5000|$|The [...] "Six-factor formula" [...] is {{the neutron}} {{life-cycle}} balance equation, which includes six separate factors, {{the product of}} which {{is equal to the}} ratio of the number of neutrons in any generation to that of the previous one; this parameter is called the effective multiplication factor k, also denoted by Keff, where k = Є Lf ρ Lth f η, where Є = [...] "fast-fission factor", Lf = [...] "fast non-leakage factor", ρ = [...] "resonance escape probability", Lth = [...] "thermal non-leakage factor", f = [...] "thermal fuel utilization factor", and η = [...] "reproduction factor". This equation's factors are roughly in order of potential occurrence for a fission born neutron during critical operation. <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> k = (Neutrons produced in one generation)/(Neutrons produced in the previous generation). In other words, when the reactor is critical, k = 1; when the reactor is subcritical, k < 1; and when the reactor is supercritical, k > 1.|$|E
50|$|Blood and sputum {{culture has}} often already been {{performed}} {{in the setting of}} community acquired pneumonia needing hospitalization. It should however be noted that the micro-organism responsible for development of empyema is not necessarily the same as the organism causing the pneumonia, especially in adults. <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> sensitivity of pleural fluid culture is generally low, often partly due to prior administration of antibiotics. It has been shown that culture yield can be increased from 44% to 69% if pleural fluid is injected into blood culture bottles (aerobic and anaerobic) immediately after aspiration. Furthermore, diagnostic rates can be improved for specific pathogens using polymerase chain reaction or antigen detection, especially for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. In a study including 78 children with pleural empyema, the causative micro-organism could be identified using direct culture of fresh pleural fluid in 45% of patients, with an additional 28% using PCR on pleural fluid of negative cultures. Pneumococcal antigen detection in pleural fluid samples by latex agglutination can also be useful for rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal empyema. In the previously noted study, positive and negative predictive value of pneumococcal antigen detection was 95% and 90%, respectively. However, despite the additional diagnostic value of these tests, PCR and antigen detection have limited value in determining treatment choice {{because of the lack of}} information on antibiotic resistance.|$|E
30|$|This study {{comes with}} some {{limitations}} which imply caution in generalizing our findings. First of all, our sample of interventions is limited, which prevents {{the use of}} more elaborate statistical analyses. Latent Growth Modelling for example would be suitable in this regard, but requires longitudinal data which is not at our disposal. Second, our distinction of time-frames in which the interventions are developed is a practical but somewhat arbitrary choice: the year of development for example does not give any information about which programs are mostly used in practice in that time. Usage information is not available but would have given a more realistic picture {{of what happens in}} practice. Comparably, and <b>as</b> we have <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> not all interventions are included in the database of the Netherlands Youth Institute, which means that not all interventions that are used in practice are included in this research. Again, that would have given a more realistic picture of what is happening “on the floor.” Third, except for one, none of our results show any significant differences and findings should thus be interpreted with caution. Further research should address these matters for example by including usage information or by acquiring longitudinal data. Last, {{we do not have the}} advantage of having comparative data, for instance, from other European countries or from the USA. A comparative study could have given more insight in how ideas turn into practice (or not), and could be taken up in future studies. Despite these limitations, however, there are certain trends visible and these should be acknowledged.|$|R

5000|$|Critical {{illness is}} highly dynamic. As such, {{critically}} ill patients needing RRT, {{depending on the}} clinical severity (AKI alone, or AKI associated with other organs dysfunction), could require a higher depurative dose of renal support4. As a matter of fact, the treatment of a patient with a toxic hyperkalemia, or a severe lactic acidosis due to a metformin intoxication, will need a different (and higher) depurative dose than a patient whose main problem derived from AKI is just anuria. However the two main trials that have studied the intensity of renal support in critically ill patients with AKI3, 7, allocated them to a higher or lower dose without {{taking into account the}} clinical status of each patient. Only in the ATN Study3 was the modality of RRT changed (from intermittent to extended or continuous) depending on the hemodynamic status of the patient, (patients in shock were managed with extended or continuous modalities), supporting the general idea that intermittent dialysis is not well tolerated by patients with unstable hemodynamic status. Not surprisingly both studies concluded that clinical outcomes were the same whether using a higher or lower intensity of renal support. However, <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> they also found a higher incidence of complications (hypothermia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, etc.) in the patients randomized to receive a higher dose.Taking together the results of both studies, it determined that the incidence of both under and overtreatment must have been the same in all groups of patients (whether randomized to receive a higher or lower fixed intensity of renal support, they would have received an improper dose at any time - i.e. if with severe hyperkalemia and allocated to a lower dose, initially undertreated, or if with a normal potassium and assigned to receive a higher dose, overtreated).Trying to conceal this problem, the Theory of Dynamic Approach postulates that we have to adapt the intensity of renal support according to the patient’s clinical situation, transforming in this way a fixed-dose-RRT schedule into a goal-directed-RRT, one to avoid Dialytrauma.1 ...|$|E

30|$|<b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> {{studies showed}} that formate is {{relatively}} stable on Pt and itself cannot be oxidized at mild conditions and this stability was attributed to the poor absorbability of formate on Pt [19, 26, 27]. Nevertheless, Beden et al. [56] showed the activity of gold and platinum for the oxidation of formate. Additionally, according to Hsu et al. [30], the impact of sodium formate on Pd-based materials in formic acid would be different {{to what has been}} discovered on Pt/C based on the studies of Guo et al. [57] and Gao et al. [10].|$|E

30|$|Although attempted, {{we could}} not {{quantify}} metabolite leakage accurately with a differential approach (Douma et al. 2010), because {{the analysis of the}} quenching and washing solutions unexpectedly showed severe and irreversible issues with the HPLC-column (e.g. column clogging, sudden decline in column performance). As a consequence we were forced to replace the column several times. The reason for this is unclear. One possible explanation is that also in this case the aforementioned precipitation of medium compounds and metabolites in methanol plays a role. Such precipitates are known to be sometimes detrimental to the column performance or to cause other analytical problems (e.g. Nielsen and Larsen 2015, Zakhartsev et al. 2015). As we were unable to solve this problem {{during the course of this}} work, we did not yet make further attempts on this issue. However, it can be assumed from the data available in literature that metabolite leakage is most probably of minor relevance in our case: <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> the considerably reduced contact time to the quenching solution obtained with cold-filtration is beneficial with respect to minimizing metabolite leakage (Douma et al. 2010). In addition, nucleotides—although also reported to leak from cells (e.g. Gonzalez et al. 1997)—generally leak to a smaller extent than smaller compounds such as organic acids because of their comparably large molecule size (Canelas et al. 2008).|$|E
