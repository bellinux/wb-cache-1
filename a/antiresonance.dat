Under these conditions the line current is very small {{because of the high}} electrical impedance of the parallel circuit at <b>antiresonance.</b> The branch currents are almost equal in magnitude and opposite in phase.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>antiresonances</b> in test-analysis {{correlation}} {{and dynamic}} model updating is considered in this paper. <b>Antiresonances</b> are not independent from modal data, {{and the related}} information is alternative and not additional to modal information. Several reasons exist to prefer <b>antiresonances</b> to mode shapes. First, <b>antiresonances</b> are quite important in deciding whether analytical and experimental FRFs are well correlated or not. Furthermore, <b>antiresonances</b> can be easily computed from the FE model, and identified from experimental FRFs with much less error than mode shapes. Two procedures for dynamic model updating are considered: one based on inverse sensitivity, and a second one based on multiobjective optimization. Problems connected with using <b>antiresonances</b> of transfer FRFs, as opposed to drive point FRFs, are also highlighted. Numerical results show that both the inverse sensitivity and the optimization approach work well with drive point FRFs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Antiresonances</b> {{have become}} an {{attractive}} alternative in structural damage assessment. They can be identified easier and more accurately than mode shapes, and still providing the same information. <b>Antiresonances</b> are derived from point frequency response functions (FRFs) or from transfer FRFs. However, <b>antiresonances</b> from transfer FRFs {{are very sensitive to}} small structural changes, and the matching between numerical and experimental <b>antiresonances</b> is affected. This problem is solved if <b>antiresonances</b> from point FRFs are used. However, it implies an experimental procedure that differs from a common modal testing, which may become not practical or too expensive. This paper proposes a damage detection method able to deal with transfer <b>antiresonances.</b> The inverse problem is handled by a Parallel Genetic Algorithm. In this case, a perfect match between the <b>antiresonances</b> is not required because the optimization is not gradient based. Moreover, the matching can change at each step and the optimization is not affected. An exhaust system of a car with a single fatigue crack is used to verify the approach; three increasing levels of damage are studied. Damage detected is consistent with the experimental damage. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{steady-state}} solution can {{be found}} by setting , which gives:Examining these steady state solutions {{as a function of}} driving frequency, it is evident that both oscillators display resonances (peaks in amplitude accompanied by positive phase shifts) at the two normal mode frequencies. In addition, the driven oscillator displays a pronounced dip in amplitude between the normal modes which is accompanied by a negative phase shift. This is the <b>antiresonance.</b> Note that there is no <b>antiresonance</b> in the undriven oscillator's spectrum; although its amplitude has a minimum between the normal modes, there is no pronounced dip or negative phase shift.|$|E

40|$|We present {{analytic}} and numerical studies {{based on}} Landauer theory of conductance <b>antiresonances</b> of molecular wires. Our analytic treatment {{is a solution}} of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the wire that includes {{the effects of the}} non-orthogonality of the atomic orbitals on different atoms exactly. The problem of non-orthogonality is treated by solving the transport problem in a new Hilbert space which is spanned by an orthogonal basis. An expression is derived for the energies at which <b>antiresonances</b> should occur for a molecular wire connected to a pair of single-channel 1 D leads. From this expression we identify two distinct mechanisms that give rise to <b>antiresonances</b> under different circumstances. The exact treatment of non-orthogonality in the theory is found to be necessary to obtain reliable results. Our numerical simulations extend this work to multichannel leads and to molecular wires connected to 3 D metallic nanocontacts. They demonstrate that our analytic results also provide a good description of these more complicated systems provided that certain well-defined conditions are met. These calculations suggest that <b>antiresonances</b> should be experimentally observable in the differential conductance of molecular wires of certain types. Comment: 22 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

A broadband signal synthesised from sine waves allows high precision measurements irrespective of the fundamental frequency of phonation. From these measurements, the frequencies, magnitudes and bandwidths of the resonances and <b>antiresonances</b> are determined directly.

50|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, it can {{be stated}} that as the {{distance}} between the driven component and the measured component increases, the number of antiresonances in the FRF decreases. For example, in the two-oscillator situation above, the FRF of the undriven oscillator displayed no <b>antiresonance.</b> Resonances and antiresonances only alternate continuously in the FRF of the driven component itself.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, the United States and United Kingdom {{undertook}} {{a joint effort}} to develop digital computer software for analysis and design using the ALGOL-based Navy Electronics Laboratory International Algorithmic Compiler (NELIAC). Early software used direct models to determine critical resonance and <b>antiresonance</b> frequencies of piezoelectric materials and immitances at those frequencies. Results were graphed and solutions were determined to the desired accuracy by visual comparison of successive runs of the direct model software. Martin developed [...] "find parameters" [...] software evaluating capacitance, dissipation, resonance, and <b>antiresonance</b> with a Jacobian matrix and its inverse to determine losses separately for dielectric, elastic, and piezoelectric properties of individual barium titanate ceramic components. He completed the software {{in the summer of}} 1964 and it was announced at the September, 1964, seminar of the Office of Naval Research. His software was translated from NELIAC to Fortran and distributed in 1965.

50|$|An {{important}} {{result in}} the theory of <b>antiresonances</b> is that they can be interpreted as the resonances of the system fixed at the excitation point. This {{can be seen in the}} pendulum animation above: the steady-state antiresonant situation is the same as if the left pendulum were fixed and could not oscillate. An important corollary of this result is that the <b>antiresonances</b> of a system are independent of the properties of the driven oscillator; i.e. they do not change if the resonance frequency or damping coefficient of the driven oscillator are altered.|$|R

The latter poles are produced by non-local potentials, which derive from the Pauli exchange forces acting among the nucleons or the quarks composing the colliding particles.

50|$|This result makes <b>antiresonances</b> {{useful in}} characterizing complex coupled systems which cannot be easily {{separated}} into their constituent components. The resonance frequencies {{of the system}} depend on the properties of all components and their couplings, and are independent of which is driven. The <b>antiresonances,</b> on the other hand, are dependent upon the component being driven, therefore providing information about how it affects the total system. By driving each component in turn, information {{about all of the}} individual subsystems can be obtained, despite the couplings between them. This technique has applications in mechanical engineering, structural analysis, and the design of integrated quantum circuits.|$|R
50|$|In {{the physics}} of coupled oscillators, <b>antiresonance,</b> by analogy with resonance, is a {{pronounced}} minimum in the amplitude of one oscillator at a particular frequency, accompanied by a large shift in its oscillation phase. Such frequencies are known as the system's antiresonant frequencies, and at these frequencies the oscillation amplitude can drop to almost zero. Antiresonances are caused by destructive interference, for example between an external driving force and interaction with another oscillator.|$|E
50|$|Resonant {{systems are}} said to be tightly coupled, loosely coupled, {{critically}} coupled or overcoupled. Tight coupling is when the coupling coefficient is around 1 as with conventional iron-core transformers. Overcoupling is when the secondary coil is so close and the formation of mutual flux is hindered by the effect of <b>antiresonance,</b> and critical coupling is when the transfer in the passband is optimal. Loose coupling is when the coils are distant from each other, so that most of the flux misses the secondary. In Tesla coils around 0.2 is used, and at greater distances, for example for inductive wireless power transmission, it may be lower than 0.01.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prediction}} of high-temperature superconductivity transition temperatures is rightly {{considered to be}} one of the most difficult problems in theoretical physics. The problem remained elusive for many years since these materials have generally a very complex structure making unuseful theoretical modelling for a homogeneous system. The advances in experimental investigation on local lattice fluctuations have driven the community to the conclusion that it is a problem of quantum physics in complex matter. A growing paradigm for high-temperature superconductivity in superstripes is that a key term is the quantum interference effect between pairing channels, i.e., a resonance in the exchange-like, Josephson-like pair transfer term between different condensates. The quantum configuration interaction between different pairing channels is a particular case of shape resonance belonging to the group of Fano Feshbach resonances in atomic and nuclear physics. The critical temperature shows a suppression, due to a Fano <b>antiresonance,</b> when the chemical potential is tuned at a band edge where a new Fermi surface spot appears i.e., an [...] "electronic topological transition" [...] (ETT) or 2.5 Lifshitz transition or, a metal-to-metal topological transition. The Tc amplification is switched on when the chemical potential is tuned above the band edge in an energy region away from the band edge of the order of 1 or 2 times the energy cut off of the pairing interaction. The Tc is further amplified at the shape resonance if in this range the Fermi surface of the appearing fermi surface spot changes its dimensionality (for example the Lifshitz transition for opening a neck in a tubular Fermi surface).The tuning of the chemical potential at the shape resonance can be obtained by changing: the charge density and/or the superlattice structural parameters, and/or the superlattice misfit strain and/or the disorder. Direct evidence for shape resonances in superstripes matter is provided by the anomalous variation of the isotope effect on the critical temperature by tuning the chemical potential.|$|E

Natural frequencies can be accurately identified, {{but this is not}} the case for mode shapes. Mode shapes are usually accurate to within 10 % at best, which can reduce the accuracy of the updated model. To solve this problem, some researchers have proposed antiresonant frequencies as an alternative to mode shapes. <b>Antiresonances</b> are identified easier and more accurately than mode shapes. In addition, <b>antiresonances</b> provide the same information as mode shapes and natural frequencies together. This article presents a new methodology to identify antiresonant frequencies from transmissibility measurements. A transmissibility function represents the relation in the frequency domain of the measured response of two points in the structure. Hence, it does not involve the measurement of excitation forces. These <b>antiresonances</b> are used to update the numerical models of two experimental structures: An 8 -dof mass–spring system, and an exhaust system of a car.
