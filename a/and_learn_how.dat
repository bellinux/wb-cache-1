25|$|After the {{printing}} press was invented in the mid 15th century by Johannes Gutenberg and others, the art of book printing soon spread {{to other parts of}} Europe.

In 1494, Makarije printed the Cetinje Octoechos at Zeta's capital, Cetinje. It was the first incunable written in the Serbian recension of Church Slavonic.

25|$|The Gullah {{have also}} {{struggled}} {{to preserve their}} traditional culture {{in the face of}} much more contact with modern culture and media.

25|$|John Conolly took up {{residence}} as the third superintendent on 1 June 1839. In April 1839, Serjeant-at-law John Adams, one of the Visiting Justices of the asylum and a founding member and first chairman of Legal & General, suggested that Conolly visit the Lincoln Asylum and see the system operated by Robert Gardiner Hill. He was so impressed by this {{that he decided to}} abolish mechanical restraints at Hanwell. This must have taken enormous powers of persuasion: the existing staff would have to change their work practices <b>and</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to nurse more effectively those patients with troubling behaviour. However, the reform seemed to avoid the patient suffering further trauma as a result of restraint and being made to feel completely helpless. Conolly succeeded in introducing the reform by 21 September 1839, less than 3 months after he took charge. This is perhaps a testament to the earlier work of Ellis.|$|E
25|$|Social constructivisms or socioculturalism {{encourage}} the learner or learners {{to arrive at}} his or her version of the truth, influenced by his or her background, culture or embedded worldview. Historical developments and symbol systems, such as language, logic, and mathematical systems, are inherited by the learner {{as a member of a}} particular culture and these are learned throughout the learner's life. This also stresses the importance of the nature of the learner's social interaction with knowledgeable members of the society. Without the social interaction with other more knowledgeable people, it is impossible to acquire social meaning of important symbol systems <b>and</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to utilize them. Young children develop their thinking abilities by interacting with other children, adults and the physical world. From the social constructivist viewpoint, it is thus important to take into account the background and culture of the learner throughout the learning process, as this background also helps to shape the knowledge and truth that the learner creates, discovers and attains in the learning process (Wertsch 1997).|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Razer Naga had {{a positive}} reception, although many pointed out the obvious targeting towards MMO gamers.

Ben Kuchera, of Ars Technica called it a [...] "niche product", stating the buttons were unappealing to people who did not play MMO games. The redesigned version of the Naga, called the Naga Epic Molten, received positive reviews for its design.|$|E

Costello travelled across Asia, where he did see some success; he won the Malaysian Heavyweight title in 1939, as well as the South Africa trophy in 1949. During the 1950s, Costello finally started to turn heads at home by winning the Australasian title. In 1952, Costello began wrestling in America, hoping to finally break through and make a big name of himself.|$|E
