Though {{visitors}} had to pay SGD$10 to enter the park even-though rides were not operating, tickets for the week were sold out in 2 days. On 5 March 2010, it was announced that the park will open its doors at 8:28am (UTC+8) on 18 March 2010, for a soft-opening phase. From 13 March 2010, the team members of Resorts World Sentosa and their families had a chance to visit the park before the public has <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The park had its soft opening period from 18 March 2010 to 26 October 2010.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, through sheer luck, {{the group}} find {{themselves}} perfectly positioned to attempt another {{attack on the}} Airfield. This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group {{find their way to}} the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.|$|E
25|$|His army's {{numbers were}} also low, only about 1,500 men at first, with two third on cavalry, {{and only a}} little more than 600 had firearms. Bayonets were in short supply, so they had to improvise by adding lances to their arsenal. Those {{officers}} that could not bring their own saber would have to do without. The scarcity of arms and supplies forced them to impose a strict control and organization. Belgrano spent the first months of his command in establishing a hospital, military tribunal, supply corps, reconnaissance company and in negotiating the manufacturing of ammunition and clothing. The relative hostility of the local population over the demands of the porteños did not make his job easy. He utilized the few friendships with the locals, La Madrid among them, to help with troop recruiting. Crucial in this task was Güemes, who with his troubled personal relations with Belgrano would force the latter to release him in June before even having had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> combat.|$|E

Cey Adams, creative director for Def Jam at the time, later said of the creative decision for the artwork, [...] "It was so interesting {{to me that a}} black hip-hop act did an illustration for their album cover.

500|$|General Amherst, held {{responsible}} for the uprising by the Board of Trade, was recalled to London in August 1763 and replaced by Major General Thomas Gage. In 1764, Gage sent two expeditions into the west to crush the rebellion, rescue British prisoners, and arrest the Native Americans responsible for the war. According to historian Fred Anderson, Gage's campaign, which had been designed by Amherst, prolonged the war {{for more than a year}} because it focused on punishing the Native Americans rather than ending the war. Gage's one significant departure from Amherst's plan was to allow William Johnson to conduct a peace treaty at Niagara, giving those Native Americans who were ready to [...] "bury the hatchet" [...] <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
500|$|David Duchovny was {{somewhat}} {{disappointed with the}} episode, hoping {{he would have had}} <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more in an episode that was primarily a symbolic journey for him rather than a real one. The actor said [...] "I like the psychology, and I like the thinking that went into the episode as a viewer. As an actor, I felt like an opportunity passed me by. If I had to do any episode over again, it would be that one." [...] The actor called the episode in 1995 the greatest missed opportunity they had. Chris Carter disagreed, stating that Fox Mulder's role in the episode was the right way to do it, and that the dramatic weight for the episode had to shift from Mulder to Dana Scully.|$|E

Castellaneta was also a regular participant in The Ron Petke and His Dead Uncle Show, a radio show at NIU. The show helped Castellaneta hone his skills as a voice-over actor. He recalled [...] "We did parodies and sketches, we would double up on, so you learned to switch between voices. I got my feet wet doing voiceover. The show was just barely audible, but we didn't care. It was the fact that we got <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it and write our own material." [...] He took a play-writing class and auditioned for an improvisational show.

500|$|Spielberg {{was unsure}} {{if he was}} mature {{enough to make a}} film about the Holocaust, and the project {{remained}} [...] "on [...] guilty conscience". Spielberg tried to pass the project to director Roman Polanski, who turned it down. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Kraków Ghetto. Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama The Pianist (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese, who was attached to direct Schindler's List in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as [...] "I'd given away <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something for my children and family about the Holocaust." [...] Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the 1991 remake of Cape Fear instead. Billy Wilder expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom died in the Holocaust.|$|E

500|$|The band's follow-up, Even If It Kills Me (2007), was {{recorded}} in New York City with Eli Janney and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. [...] "He just confused me the whole time," [...] said Pierre later, who noted that {{he was afraid to}} disclose that the experience was a [...] "bum-out." [...] Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance abuse nearly disbanded the group. [...] "I think it's an understatement to say it is tough to be tied to Justin's emotions," [...] Cain later remarked. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a three-week rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in the summer of 2007, marking their longest break apart in five years.

500|$|The Super Furry Animals {{had written}} several Welsh {{language}} songs {{while they were}} working on Guerrilla and decided that, rather than releasing [...] "token Welsh songs" [...] as b-sides and album tracks, they would issue them together as a coherent record. These tracks would be augmented by [...] "Dacw Hi", a song written by Rhys in 1987 that he had never [...] "had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before", and a cover of the track [...] "Y Teimlad", which the group wanted to record because of their admiration for Welsh language band Datblygu (who originally wrote and recorded the song in 1984). According to Rhys, the Super Furry Animals reasoned that, if their English language pop songs were not getting played on the radio, they may as well make a Welsh language album featuring songs that would not be played on the radio. Rhys has said that, although the decision to release a Welsh language album was not [...] "an explicitly political statement", he does see Mwng as a [...] "stand against globalisation", railing against [...] "advanced capitalism" [...] and the lack of interest shown in minority cultures by large companies who [...] "just want to make money". Rhys has also stated that his boredom with writing songs in English inspired him to write Mwng, and that it is a very personal album, rather than a celebration of Welsh culture.|$|E

500|$|The band {{felt that}} [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] and [...] "Smokin'" [...] were [...] "light relief" [...] {{and needed to}} be {{released}} so that they could concentrate on their next album, Guerrilla, with Rhys stating that the [...] "EP was <b>a</b> good <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something in isolation, because the tracks on it won't fit in with the new album, and they didn't fit in with the old one".

40|$|Part 2 : Short PapersInternational audienceIn e-marketplaces {{with limited}} {{inventory}} where buyers’ demand {{is larger than}} sellers’ supply, promoting honesty raises new challenges: sellers may behave dishonestly because they can sell out all products without the necessity of gaining high reputation; buyers may provide untruthful ratings to mislead other buyers in order <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> higher <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> obtain the limited products. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to promote buyer and seller honesty in such e-marketplaces. More specifically, our mechanism models both buyer and seller honesty.

Honest buyers also have <b>a</b> higher <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business with honest sellers {{and are able to}} gain larger utility.
