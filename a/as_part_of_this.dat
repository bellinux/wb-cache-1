5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered {{the viability of the}} Australian Chinooks.

In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. <b>As</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
