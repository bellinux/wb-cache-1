40|$|Because {{the use of}} {{fluconazole}} prophylaxis {{had been}} {{associated with an increased}} rate of Candida krusei infections <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>John</b> <b>Hopkins</b> Oncology Center, early empiric amphotericin B plus flucytosine were given to febrile neutropenic patients colonized by C. krusei. By this practice, the proportion of fungemias attributable to C. krusei was low (12. 5 %) in patients receiving fluconazole over a 6 -month interval. However, Torulopsis (Candida) glabrata assumed a much higher proportion of fungemias (75 %) among patients receiving fluconazole. In vitro susceptibility testing combined with this clinical experience suggests that some T. glabrata isolates are not susceptible to fluconazole and can cause breakthrough infections in patients receiving fluconazole...|$|R
5|$|Numerous etiologies of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{have been}} described.

However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin's Syndrome after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C. Macklin, in 1944, who cumulatively went on to describe the pathophysiology in more detail.|$|E
5|$|Scientists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> University Applied Physics Laboratory {{think that}} Voyager 1 entered the {{termination}} shock in February 2003.

The issue would not be resolved until other data became available, since Voyager 1s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Edwin Herbert Hall working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> University {{discovered}} a voltage developing across conductors transverse to an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field {{perpendicular to the}} current.

After the advent of quantum mechanics, Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the quantum Hall effect discovered half a century later.|$|E

40|$|Complete genome {{sequences}} {{are available}} for understanding biotransformation, environmental resistance and pathogenesis of microbial, cellular and pathogen systems. The present technological and scientific challenges are to unravel {{the relationships between the}} organization and function of protein complexes at cell, microbial and pathogens surfaces, to understand how these complexes evolve during the bacterial, cellular and pathogen life cycles, and how they respond to environmental changes, chemical stimulants and therapeutics. In particular, elucidating the molecular structure and architecture of human pathogen surfaces is essential to understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis, immune response, physicochemical interactions, environmental resistance and development of countermeasures against bioterrorist agents. The objective of this project was to investigate the architecture, proteomic structure, and function of bacterial spores through a combination of high-resolution in vitro atomic force microscopy (AFM) and AFM-based immunolabeling with threat-specific antibodies. Particular attention in this project was focused on spore forming Bacillus species including the Sterne vaccine strain of Bacillus anthracis and the spore forming near-neighbor of Clostridium botulinum, C. novyi-NT. Bacillus species, including B. anthracis, the causative agent of inhalation anthrax are laboratory models for elucidating spore structure/function. Even though the complete genome sequence is available for B. subtilis, cereus, anthracis and other species, the determination and composition of spore structure/function is not understood. Prof. B. Vogelstein and colleagues <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>John</b> <b>Hopkins</b> University have recently developed a breakthrough bacteriolytic therapy for cancer treatment (1). They discovered that intravenously injected Clostridium novyi-NT spores germinate exclusively within the avascular regions of tumors in mice and destroy advanced cancerous lesions. The bacteria were also found to significantly improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy (2, 3). Currently, there is no understanding of the structure-function relationships of Clostridium novyi-NT spores. As well as their therapeutic interest, studies of Clostridium noyii spores could provide a model for further studies of human pathogenic spore formers including Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium perfringens. This project involved a multi-institutional collaboration of our LLNL group with the groups of Prof. T. J. Leighton (Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute) and Prof. B. Vogelstein (The Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Ludwig Center for Cancer Genetics and Therapeutics <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>John</b> <b>Hopkins</b> Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center) ...|$|R
5|$|In 1926 Harold Knight {{spent several}} months <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> Hospital in Baltimore, in America, {{painting}} portrait commissions of surgeons. Laura joined him there {{and was given}} permission to paint at the Baltimore Children's Hospital and in the black wards of the racially segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital. Whilst in Baltimore Knight painted a nurse, Pearl Johnson, who took her to meetings and concerts of the early American civil rights movement. Knight also hired a mother and child model to pose for the composition originally known as the Madonna of the Cotton Fields. Knight took these paintings back to London with her and they feature in the Pathé newsreel produced to mark her election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1927. Another portrait of Johnson, Irene and Pearl, shows two women {{against a backdrop of}} skyscrapers and was {{one of a number of}} portraits Knight painted in the late 1920s that appear strikingly modern. Miss Ealand, shown at the Royal Academy in 1928, depicts a woman with cropped hair wearing a jacket and holding a gun. The same year Knight's portrait of a women saxophone player was displayed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} supersymmetric dark matter in minimal supergravity {{unification}} with R-parity invariance and with radiative {{breaking of the}} electro-weak symmetry is given. The analysis shows the lightest neutralino is the LSP {{over most of the}} parameter space of the supergravity model. The event rates in neutralino- nucleus scattering in dark matter detectors are also discussed. It is found that the event rates are sensititive to the constraint from the b→ sγ experiment. It is also found that the event rates are sensitive to the constraints of relic density and in our analysis we have used the accurate method for the computation of the neutralino relic density. Finally,the effect of the new results on quark polarizabilities, from the data of the Spin Muon Collaboration, on event rates is also discussed. The analysis shows that the event rates for the Ge detectors and for other detectors which use heavy targets are only negligibly affected. Comment: latex file 11 pages, and 2 figs.
