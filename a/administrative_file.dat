50|$|This {{article is}} not meant to argue the great effect that teleadministration has on the {{efficiency}} of administrative activity, as we assume that the reader is fully aware that, once paper based documents are abandoned, the real-time flow of documents greatly improves time management and responsibility of the single offices/ operators, while direct online access improves transparency. Rather, this paragraph wants to emphasize how teleadministration promotes maximum usage of the “star procedure”, known and researched in Germany as “Sternverfahren”. This procedure, an alternative to the sequential procedure, which has by nature longer head times, in the paper-based world would require making several copies of the <b>administrative</b> <b>file</b> (which can be extremely voluminous) for each office and each administration that needs to express an opinion or issue an authorisation. With the One Stop Shop, the administration initiating the process is charged with this task. Electronic files clearly provide evident benefits for these procedures, since all involved administrations can directly and simultaneously access the file, view the part they need to evaluate and add their opinion or authorisation directly, using a star-shaped scheme.|$|E

40|$|Each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes {{estimates}} of employment for industrial supersectors {{at the metropolitan}} statistical area (MSA) level. The survey-weighted ratio estimator {{that is used to}} produce estimates for large domains is generally less reliable for MSA level estimation due to the unavailability of adequate sample from a given MSA. We also note that the effect of a few establishments, which are influential in terms of unusual employment numbers or sampling weights or both, could be prominent for the small area estimation. In this paper, we develop an empirical hierarchical Bayes method based on a unit level model. Our proposed method is found to be less variable and less sensitive to influential establishments when compared to the direct survey-weighted ratio estimator or estimators based on an area level model. Empirical evaluation of the estimators is performed using the population data from <b>administrative</b> <b>file...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} two-phase sampling {{in which}} {{values of a}} variable of interest are observed only in the second-phase sub-sample. Values for the first-phase units not sampled in the second-phase are mass imputed, using values from an <b>administrative</b> <b>file</b> when available and regression imputation otherwise. Such two-phase sampling methods are often used in annual business surveys to reduce survey costs and respondent burden, assuming that collecting values from administrative sources is much cheaper than obtaining values through questionnaires from sampled units. We study both naïve and design-consistent estimators for a total or mean under the above set-up. We also obtain associated variance estimators using a unified approach proposed by Demnati and Rao (2004). Simulation results on the finite sample performance of the estimators and associated variance estimators are also presented, using substitution or ratio mass imputation. We also study the case of missing sub-sample values and develop estimators of the total and associated variance estimators. Sample allocation issues are also studied...|$|E

40|$|One {{objection}} {{was raised}} to Prehearing Order No. 8.

40|$|Background Employer <b>administrative</b> <b>files</b> are an underutilized {{source of}} data in {{epidemiologic}} studies of occupational injuries. Methods Personnel files, occupational health surveillance data, industrial hygiene data, and a real-time incident and injury management system from a large multi-site aluminum manufacturer were linked deterministically. An ecological-level measure of physical job demand was also linked. This method successfully created a database containing over 100 variables for 9, 101 hourly employees from eight geographically dispersedU. S. plants. Results Between 2002 and 2004, there were 3, 563 traumatic injuries to 2, 495 employees. The most common injuries were sprain/strains (32 %), contusions (24 %), and lacerations (14 %). A multivariable logistic regression model revealed that physical job demand was the strongest predictor of injury risk, in a dose dependent fashion. Other strong predictors of injury included female gender, young age, short company tenure and short time on current job. Conclusions Employer <b>administrative</b> <b>files</b> are a useful {{source of data}}, as they permit the exploration of risk factors and potential confounders that {{are not included in}} many population-based surveys. The ability to link employer <b>administrative</b> <b>files</b> with injury surveillance data is a valuable analysis strategy for comprehensively studying workplace injuries, identifying salient risk factors, and targeting workforce populations disproportionately affected.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the editing and imputation procedures which {{were used for}} the demographic variables in the integrated 2008 census in Israel. I. BACKGROUND 1. The Israeli census is an "Integrated Census". It combines administrative data for 100 % of the population with data obtained from a large sample survey (approximately 17 % of the households in the country). 2. The main administrative data source for the Improved <b>Administrative</b> <b>File</b> (IAF) is the National Population Register (NPR). The NPR contains personal records for all citizens and permanent residents of Israel and includes demographic and residential information, as well as links to records of parents, spouses and children. All register records are identified by a unique “personal identity number ” (PIN), which can be used for matching records. Administrative families were constructed by applying a specially developed algorithm, based on family relations and addresses. The IAF is improved by various administrative data sources to depict more accurately the "de facto " population residing in the country. 3. The survey component has a dual design: an area sample, to estimate “under-coverage ” (“U”); and a sample drawn from the PR, to estimate “over-coverage ” (“O”). Over- and under-coverage ar...|$|E
40|$|The main factors {{influencing}} the cooperation in surveys over Internet, {{as suggested from}} empirical studies (Batagelj et al., 1998; Dillman et al., 1998), could be grouped into:- {{factors influencing}} the contact with the respondent (e. g., awareness of the survey, e-mail solicitation plan);- individual factors (e. g., socioeconomic characteristics, knowledge of the subject, experience with Web surveys) that shape the decision to participate {{as the result of}} the interaction of the individual characteristics of the respondent with the invitation of the survey designer. When the survey is directed toward a specific target population with access to Web, often identified by an <b>administrative</b> <b>file,</b> there are many auxiliary variables available to understand the respondent behavior. In the case of the population of firms the list of the Chamber of Commerce is completed by the individual characteristics of the firm, such as the legal form, the number of employees, and the class of economic activity. The e-mail list does not represent the whole population of firms, it represents a segment with access to Internet that choose to publish the e-mail address. Due to the development of the e-commerce, this segment in some sectors of economic activity covers a large part of the population and many firms in several sectors of economic activity are now joining the net to gain visibility. The diffusion of Internet has been growing in the small medium size enterprises, too. Although no complete coverage of the list is supposed, we work under the hypothesis that the list is our target population...|$|E
