5|$|Bloeme was {{deported}} to Auschwitz {{on the last}} train leaving Westerbork on 3 September 1944. On the same train were the Frank family who had been discovered in hiding on 4 August. Bloeme saw Anne, Margot <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> regularly in Auschwitz, although {{she was part of}} a separate group of eight women who stayed together, encouraging and helping one another. In October 1944, Bloeme and her group were selected for transfer to the Liebau labor camp in Upper Silesia. For the filming of the 1995 BBC documentary Anne Frank Remembered, Bloeme recalled that Anne, Margot, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother,</b> Edith, also planned to join the transport, but Anne was prohibited from joining because she had developed scabies. Her mother and sister opted to stay with her, and Bloeme went on without them. Bloeme was also interviewed for her remembrances of the Frank women in Auschwitz in the 1988 television documentary The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank by Dutch filmmaker Willy Lindwer.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley wrote Midas in 1820. Miranda Seymour, a Mary Shelley biographer, {{speculates that}} she wrote Midas and Proserpine for two young girls she met and befriended, Laurette and Nerina Tighe. They were {{the daughters of}} friends of the Shelleys in Italy <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> was a former pupil of Mary Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft.

5|$|According to Hayes' confession, {{the two men}} {{had planned}} to rob the Petit house under cover of {{darkness}} leaving the family bound, but unharmed. Hayes attributed the outcome to a change of plan. Upon their arrival {{in the early hours of}} July 23, they found William Petit sleeping on a couch on the porch. Komisarjevsky struck William on the head with a baseball bat found in the yard and then tied him up at gunpoint in the basement. The children <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> were then bound and locked in their respective rooms. Hayes said that he and Komisarjevsky were not satisfied with their haul, and that a bankbook was found which showed an available balance.|$|E
40|$|Free radical {{injury is}} thought {{to be one of the}} common {{mechanisms}} for several diseases in preterm infants. Lipid peroxidation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of many neonatal complications because the antioxidant system of preterm infants is highly stressed and incompletely developed. We aimed to determine the oxidative stress [Malondialdehyde (MDA) ] and antioxidants [Total antioxidant activity (TAA) and Vitamin E] in cord blood of preterm (n= 20) and term infants (n= 20) and in the blood of <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> In preterm infants <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> TAA <b>and</b> Vitamin E levels were low as compared to term infants <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> In preterm infants <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> MDA was high as compared to term infants <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Therefore it is possible to postulate that preterm infants <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> are more susceptible to oxidative stress than term infants <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{measure the}} oxidant/ {{antioxidant}} status of newborn babies with oesophageal atresia <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> compared with healthy control subjects. METHODS: This case–control study included 40 participants: 10 newborns with oesophageal atresia <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> 10 healthy newborns <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Whole blood malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and {{the activities of}} antioxidant enzymes (catalase, carbonic anhydrase [CA], glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase [G- 6 -PD], and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) were measured. RESULTS: MDA levels and CA activity were significantly higher, and catalase, SOD and G- 6 -PD activities were significantly lower, in newborns with oesophageal atresia <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> than in healthy newborns <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Although CA activity was similar between the newborns and mothers in the patient group, it was significantly lower in newborns than in mothers in the healthy group. CONCLUSIONS: Increased lipid peroxidation might {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of oesophageal atresia. Impairment of the free radical/antioxidant balance may lead to increased free radical and decreased antioxidant levels in oesophageal atresia...|$|R

5|$|On 3 September 1944, {{the group}} was {{deported}} on {{what would be the}} last transport from Westerbork to the Auschwitz concentration camp and arrived after a three-day journey. On the same train was Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam native who had befriended Margot and Anne in the Jewish Lyceum in 1941. Bloeme saw Anne, Margot, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> regularly in Auschwitz, and was interviewed for her remembrances of the Frank women in Auschwitz in the television documentary The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank (1988) by Dutch filmmaker Willy Lindwer and the BBC documentary Anne Frank Remembered (1995).|$|E

40|$|Background: Zinc {{and copper}} {{belong to the}} {{essential}} trace metals needed for optimal growth and development. Measurement of serum zinc and copper in maternal blood and cord blood of neonates was carried out to study and compare the level of trace metals in term and preterm neonates <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Methods: 152 healthy neonates, both term <b>and</b> preterm <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> were selected. Measurement of serum zinc and copper {{was carried out by}} atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Findings: The mean serum zinc level in the term neonates <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> was 0. 83 µg/ml and 0. 62 µg/ml respectively. The mean serum zinc level in the preterm neonates <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> was 0. 78 µg/ml and 0. 47 µg/ml respectively. The mean serum copper level in the term neonates <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> was 0. 55 µg/ml and 2. 29 µg/ml respectively. The mean serum copper level in the preterm neonates <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> was 0. 63 µg/ml and 2. 17 µg/ml respectively. Cord blood zinc level was significantly higher and cord blood copper level was significantly lower than the corresponding maternal blood levels (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: There {{was no significant difference between}} cord blood zinc and copper levels in term and preterm neonates. The serum levels of zinc in both maternal and cord blood seem to be lower in our sample population compared to the levels found by other authors...|$|R

5|$|Charles August was {{no great}} admirer of Joseph's. As a younger man, he had sought {{the hand of}} Joseph's sister, Archduchess Maria Amalia. She had been quite content to take him, but Joseph <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> insisted she marry instead the better-connected Duke of Parma. After this disappointment, Charles II August married Maria Amalia of Saxony in 1774; she was the {{daughter}} of the Elector Christian (d. 1765) and his wife Maria Antonia, Max Joseph's sister. In 1769, the reigning Saxon elector, Frederick Augustus III, had married Charles August's sister. Charles August, sometimes called duc de Deux-Ponts (a French translation of Zweibrücken, or two bridges), was a French client and could theoretically draw on French support for his claim. However, he had especially good relations with the Saxon Electors: both his mother- and brother-in-law wanted to ensure that Maria Amalia's husband received his rightful inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs are {{dedicated}} parents. Many poison dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles {{stick to the}} mucus {{on the backs of}} their parents. Once in {{the upper reaches of the}} rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.|$|E

5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

This study investigated interpretation biases of anxious children <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> using the ambiguous stimuli task developed by Hadwin, Frost, French, and Richards (1997). Three groups of children (aged 7 to 12 years) <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> were recruited; 23 non-clinical controls, 18 children with an anxiety disorder and 15 children with an externalising disorder.
