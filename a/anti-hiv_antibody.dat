40|$|Not {{the final}} {{published}} versionOBJECTIVE: To detect <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> in cervicovaginal secretions of HIV-seronegative female sex workers and {{to evaluate whether}} {{the presence of these}} antibodies is associated with increased sexual exposure. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at a confidential clinic for female sex workers in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. The participants were 342 HIV-seronegative female sex workers in whom a cervicovaginal lavage was collected. The main outcome measures were the detection of antibodies to HIV- 1 in cervicovaginal lavages using an in-house and a commercial (Seradyn Sentinel; Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Berkeley, California, USA) enzyme immunoassay; the detection of semen in cervicovaginal lavages; and the assessment of epidemiological and biological markers of sexual exposure to HIV. RESULTS: Cervicovaginal <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected in 7. 3 and 29. 8 % of women using in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Seradyn Sentinel respectively. All cervicovaginal secretions found to be positive by in-house ELISA were also positive by Seradyn Sentinel. In a minority of women, ranging from 2. 9 % by in-house ELISA to 12. 3 % by Seradyn Sentinel, the <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> were present in vaginal fluids that did not contain semen. Sexual exposure to HIV was similar in women with <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> in their semen-free cervicovaginal secretions compared with women without <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> in their cervicovaginal secretions. CONCLUSIONS: Cervicovaginal HIV-specific antibodies were detected in a minority of sexually exposed HIV-seronegative female sex workers in Abidjan. The lack of association between increased sexual exposure to HIV and presence of cervicovaginal HIV-specific antibodies suggests that the production of genital HIV-specific antibodies in exposed seronegative women depends on the ability of individual women to mount specific mucosal immunity to HIV antigens, the determinants of which are currently unknown...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} develop a {{reliable}} and inexpensive serodiagnostic method {{to be used for}} <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> detection in Thailand, recombinant envelope (TM or gp 41 subunit) protein of HIV- 1 subtype E was produced from prokaryotic cell (Escherichia coli) as the source of antigen in enzyme immunoassay (TE diagnostic EIA kit). HIV- 1 gp 41 subunit of subtype E was suc-cessfully expressed in E. coli in the form of polyhistidine-tagged proteins, comprising of rgp 41 A (601 bases N-terminal half of TM or 25 kDa) and rgp 41 B (560 bases C-terminal half of TM or 24 kDa) by using an expression vector, pBAD/His C. The amount of protein, dilution of sera, and anti-human IgG labeled HRP used in the EIA test optimized by a checker board titration of the protein and seropositive or seronegative sera, were 5. 0 µg/ml, 1 : 300, and 1 : 4, 000, respec-tively. The blinded test evaluation of TE-diagnostic EIA in 500 seropositive and 500 seronegative sera which have been simultaneously tested by two available commercial kits and compared with our TE diagnostic EIA, gave 99. 6 % sensitivity and specificity. The other known genetic subtypes sera such as subtype A (n= 5), B (n= 9), C (n= 4) and D (n= 5) were also positive with this EIA. The estimated manufacturer cost per test of rgp 41 based <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> detection EIA or TE-diagnostic EIA was about 15 baht. This recombinant envelope (gp 41 or TM) protein from HIV- 1, which can be produced in large quantities without any hazards from growing the virus and has lower cost to produce <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> serological diagnostic kit, should be considered as an HIV screening test in Thailand...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{antibodies}} have {{an important}} role in the serodiagnosis, constituting the most widely used biomarkers to detect and confirm various diseases. Objective: To investigate the reproducibility of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies reactivity, to assess the stability of the sera samples stored at - 20 &# 186;C for two to eighteen years. Method: Sera were collected in the period 1988 - 2004 for routine <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> diagnostic testing. The remaining samples stored at - 20 &# 186;C, were analyzed in this study. Serum sample stability was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/enzyme immunoassay (ELISA/EIA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and Western blot (WB) for detecting <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibodies.</b> The previously found results (1988 - 2004) and those obtained in 2006 were subjected to Kappa index analysis.

30|$|One of {{the more}} {{exciting}} forms of delivery is the intramuscular injection of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding antibodies, followed by years of consistently high expression of those antibodies in non-human primates (Fuchs et al., 2016; Greig et al., 2016).

HIV was subsequently isolated from all animals, indicating failure of the vaccination to protect against HIV infection. Serum antibody responses were evaluated before immunization, {{at the time of}} challenge with HIV, and at multiple time points in the 9 mo after challenge. Immunization resulted in a more rapid rise of antibody to gp 160 in both high and low dose animals. Antibodies to the V 3 loop induced upon infection were unaffected by immunization. In low dose animals, neutralizing antibody rose more rapidly and to higher levels in the immunized animals as compared with the control. There was no difference in neutralizing antibodies between immunized and control chimpanzees in the high dose group.

40|$|Infection of monocyte/macrophages (M/M) by {{a variety}} of viruses (including HIV- 1) {{has been shown to be}} {{enhanced}} in the presence of low concentrations of antiviral antibodies. This process has been hypothesized as occurring through binding of the virus-antibody complex to Fc or complement receptors followed by endocytosis. In the current study, we explored whether such a mechanism might provide a CD 4 - independent route of infection by HIV- 1 for any of several populations of M/M. In the absence of <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibodies,</b> replication of HIV- 1 in M/M was blocked by viral binding inhibitors such as soluble CD 4 or OKT 4 A mAb. Furthermore, while infection of the M/M populations by a low multiplicity of infection of HIV- 1 was found to be somewhat enhanced by the presence of very low concentrations of <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibodies,</b> this process was also consistently inhibited by recombinant soluble CD 4 and by OKT 4 A antibody. These results suggest that under the variety of conditions studied, CD 4 binding was an essential step in the infection of M/M by HIV. Moreover, they are consistent with the notion that "enhancing" antibodies may serve to concentrate HIV onto CD 4 receptors or, alternately, may act at other steps in the process of viral entry and replication...|$|R

Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out at a con®dential clinic for female sex workers in Abidjan, CoÃ te d'Ivoire. The participants were 342 HIV-seronegative female sex workers in whom a cervicovaginal lavage was collected. The main outcome measures were the detection of antibodies to HIV- 1 in cervicovaginal lavages using an in-house and a commercial (Seradyn Sentinel 1; Calypte Biomedical Corporation...|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{the impact}} of HIV spike {{arrangement}} on antibody avidity This chapter presents a hypothesis called the “island effect ” that may explain the poor efficacy of existing broadly neutralizing <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> and the ongoing failure to develop a vaccine capable of eliciting any substantial neutralizing antibody response, and data are presented {{on the development of}} antibody hinge extension technologies that could eventually lead to novel antibody architectures capable of overcoming this effect. This work was completed with the assistance of Priyanthi Gnanapragasm, Rachel Galimidi, Chris Foglesong, and Maria Suzuki. 5...|$|R
