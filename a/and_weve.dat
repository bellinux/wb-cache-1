40|$|Plant disease {{resistance}} inducers, so-called plant activators, are agrochemicals that protect crops from pathogens. They confer long-lasting resistance against {{a broad range}} of diseases by activating their immune system. Since plant activators impinge on host plants, unlike commonly-used pesticides which directly target pathogens, no drug-resistant microbes for plant activators have been found so far in the field. They originated from probenazole (Oryzemate) and have been widely used over 30 years for the protection of paddy-field rice from blast fungus and bacterial leaf blight in East Asia. In spite of the advantages of plant activators, their application is still limited. The lack of both knowledge about their modes of action and an appropriate high-throughput screening system restrict the isolation of novel compounds. We established a highthroughput chemical screening procedure to identify plant immune-priming compounds which increase but do not directly induce immune responses in Arabidopsis suspension cells upon infection of the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 avrRpm 1. From the screening of a commercially available chemical library of 10, 000 diverse small organic molecules, we identified seven compounds that prime the immune response and we designated them ‘imprimatins’ for immune-priming chemicals. The isolated compound, imprimatin C 1 activates the expression of defense-related genes independent of pathogen and functions as a weak analog of salicylic acid (SA). Those originally-isolated three compounds and their four derivatives were classified into two groups with distinct molecular structures <b>and</b> they <b>weve</b> named imprimatins A and B. We found that they conferred {{disease resistance}} in plants by inhibiting both a known and a previously unknown SA glucosyltransferase (SAGT). Imprimatins and their targets are useful for the development of practical plant activators and also their modes of action might give a clue for novel crop protection technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{simplifying}} {{assumption that the}} Central Business District is a point or featureless plain, is often made in urban economics. The main goal {{of this paper is}} to promote the relaxation of this hypothesis, with the support of empirical evidence, sustaining that the subsequent analysis can be supported on the agglomeration economies theoretical framework. For this purpose we?ve analysed the distribution of economic activity inside the city of Lisbon, using the employment data of ?Quadros de Pessoal do Minist 9 rio do Trabalho e Solidariedade? (Employment Datasheet of the Ministry for Social Security and Labour), for 1998. Proceeding with the address matching of this information to the street level in order to allow the use of GIS tools. From the analysis we emphasize the evidence of agglomeration economies inside the Central Business District, using as evidence the different levels of employment agglomeration that occur on different streets and testing the hypothesis that to streets with higher employment concentration correspond higher salary levels. Therefore we sustain that the CBD cannot be seen as a point or a featureless plain <b>and</b> furthermore <b>we?ve</b> verified the existence of an hierarchy inside the urban structure, which can be seen as a parallel of the rank-size rule. After this analysis we argue that the streets with larger employment volume display a structural role in the spatial distribution of economic activity. The final conclusion leads us to consider Lisbon as a squares network-city, where the axis are structural streets and the nodes are structural squares. This paper explores some of the results of the thesis presented for the master degree in Economics and Management of the Territory of The Technical University of Lisbon, made with the orientation of professor M.

The writers find that this issues is very important to be analyzed, especially in hospitality industries, where the employee is dealing with people, who have their own expectations, of taste, atmosphere, and so on, which become a challenge to fulfill it, or even more to exceed it. A good leader must handle not only the guest, but also his/her own subordinate, handle them as good as the guest, lead them together to reach the customer satisfaction. The problem is that {{it is very hard to}} find the style of leadership applicable in one place, because there is a lot of factor affect the workplace atmosphere.

Biochemical markers controlled by the A or B genomes of one or both wheat parents weve distributed in the H- 93 - Unes as expected if the egcells fvom the self-stevile ABDM 0 hybvid, rescued by the ABD polen, cavvied the complete A and B genomes from T. tuvgidum. The distvibution of biochemical mavkevs contvolled by the D genomes of one ov both D genome parents indicated that most of the eggcells from the ABDM 0 hybrid carvied most of the D genome, i. e. 3 out of 8 markers of the former tupe were absent in a few Unes each, ind. icating incomplete homology between the two D genomes, non-homologous transfer or deletion. Biochemical characters present in Ae. ventricosa (DM°), Ae. comosa (M), Ae. uniaristata (M 11) and absent in T. aestivum (ABD), Ae. squarrosa (D) and T. tuvgidum (AB) were selected as M° genome markers. Two of these markers were not transmited to the H- 93 - Unes, three were tvansmitted with low fvequency and one with a high fvequency. Resistance to Erisiphe graminis was determined by Dosba and Doussinault at Rennes and was found to be transmitted with low fvequency. Somatic chromosome numbers of the H- 93 - Unes were counted <b>and</b> all <b>weve</b> found to be hexaploid. Meiosis was studied in Unes cavvying M° genome mavkevs and in their hybrids with the T. aestivum parent, to determine the máximum numbev of alien chvornosornespvesent in each Une.

5000|$|August Strindberg {{referred}} to Kierkegaard {{in his book}} To Damascus (1900). Part 1 is compared to [...] "Kierkegaards Gentagelse" [...] by Gunnar Ollen who translated the book. [...] STRANGER. Then whats your view?MELCHER. We have no views here; weve faith, as Ive told you already. <b>And</b> thats why <b>weve</b> only one head--placed exactly above the heart. Pause.) In the meantime lets look at number seven in the catalogue. Ah, Napoleon! The creation of the Revolution itself! The Emperor of the People, the Nero of Freedom, the suppressor of Equality and the big brother of Fraternity. Hes the most cunning of all the two-headed, for he could laugh at himself, raise himself above his own contradictions, change his skin and his soul, and yet be quite explicable to himself in every transformation--convinced, self-authorised. Theres only one other man who can be compared with him in this; Kierkegaard the Dane. From the beginning {{he was aware of}} this parthenogenesis of the soul, whose capacity to multiply by taking cuttings was equivalent to bringing forth young in this life without conception. And for that reason, and so as not to become lifes fool, he wrote under a number of pseudonyms, of which each one constituted a stage on his lifes way. But did you realise this? The Lord of life, in spite of all these precautions, made a fool of him after all. Kierkegaard, who fought all his life against the priesthood and the professional preachers of the State Church, was eventually forced of necessity to become a professional preacher himself! Oh yes! Such things do happen.STRANGER. The Powers That Be play tricks. The Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, 1915, had a short article about Søren Kierkegaard. They wrote, In Gjentagelsen ( [...] Repetition, October 1843), Kierkegaard sketches an abortive transition to the religious sphere. Repetition is one of his characteristic ideas; it signifies persistence in, and faithfulness to, a chosen course of life, and is thus opposed to the (esthetic standpoint, with constancy only in change. But Kierkegaard also gives the word a more special meaning—that rather of resumption (Gjentagelse, taking again)—implying that each higher stage of life carries with it the lower in a transfigured form. Gjentagelsen tells of a young man who seeks to pass from the (esthetic to the religious sphere, but for want of a true penitence becomes merely a romanticist; i.e., he simply resumes his old self; and his case is contrasted with that of Job, who humbled himself utterly before God, and at last regained all that he had lost, and more—the true [...] repetition." ...|$|R
