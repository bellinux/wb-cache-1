In May 1950, {{one of her}} readers notified her that Barbara Cartland had written several novels in a style similar to Heyer's, reusing names, character traits and plot points and paraphrased descriptions from her books, particularly A Hazard of Hearts, which borrowed characters from Friday's Child, and The Knave of Hearts which took off These Old Shades. Heyer completed <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, and while the case never came to court and no apology was received, the copying ceased. Her lawyers suggested that she leak the copying to the press. Heyer refused.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Béla H. Bánáthy, Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the Monterey Bay Area Council, {{formulated}} {{the idea}} of an experimental leadership training program. He named it White Stag Leadership Development after the white stag of Hungarian mythology, the emblem of the Fourth World Scout Jamboree, which Bela had attended when he was 14 years old. With the active interest and support of the Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board, Bela continually improved his experimental program. In 1963 Maury Tripp and Fran Peterson were working closely with Bela. They also served on the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America and brought the White Stag program to their attention. In November 1963, Dr. John W. Larson, a staff researcher for the National Council, observed the program's annual Indaba at the Presidio of Monterey. Impressed with what he witnessed, he recommended that the national office conduct <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the White Stag program.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Schlegel first {{proposed}} in 1857 that the species {{belonged to the}} starling family (Sturnidae), reclassifying {{it as part of}} the Sturnus genus S. capensis. This reclassification was observed by other authors; Carl Jakob Sundevall proposed the new genus name Lophopsarus ("crested starling") in 1872, yet Fregilupus varius—the oldest name—remains the bird's binomial, and all other scientific names are synonyms. In 1874, after <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the only known skeleton (held at the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology), James Murie agreed that it was a starling. Richard Bowdler Sharpe said in 1890 that the hoopoe starling was similar to the starling genus Basilornis, but did not note any similarities other than their crests. In 1941, Malcolm R. Miller found the bird's musculature {{similar to that of the}} common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) after he dissected a specimen preserved in spirits at the Cambridge Museum, but noted that the tissue was very degraded and the similarity did not necessarily confirm a relationship with starlings. In 1957, Andrew John Berger cast doubt on the bird's affinity with starlings due to subtle anatomical differences, after dissecting a spirit specimen at the American Museum of Natural History. Some authors proposed a relationship with vangas (Vangidae), but Hiroyuki Morioka rejected this in 1996, after a comparative study of skulls.|$|E

25|$|Film scholar Greg Jenkins {{has done}} <b>a</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the {{adaptation}} of the novel as a screenplay. The novel is in three parts. The film greatly expands the relatively brief section in Part I, about the boot camp on Parris Island, and essentially discards Part III. This gives the film a twofold structure, telling two largely independent stories connected by the same characters acting in each. Jenkins believes this structure is a development of concepts that Kubrick has had since the 1960s. At that time, Kubrick talked about wanting to explode the usual conventions of narrative structure.|$|E
