5|$|On September 6, 2006, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine {{announced}} his decision {{in favor of}} an elevated track through Tysons Corner. In his statement, Kaine said he believed a tunnel would be the best option, but decided against it, citing <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> losing federal funding for the project.|$|E
5|$|Rapoport {{has argued}} that Sorabji's {{reluctance}} to make commercial recordings of his music stemmed from <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> losing control over the making of future recordings of it, because of UK copyright laws of the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} safety {{meetings}} were scheduled {{in order to}} prevent accidents on the set. One of the items on the agenda was finding the closest hospital to the set, according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set, but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were sutured shut.|$|E

5|$|All species {{experienced}} over-hunting by sealers. The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean monk seal was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were {{too low to}} hunt commercially. The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. Monk seals have developed <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 monk seals in total.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{suffered}} from <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> flying, which had on occasion caused difficulties in his football career. Chosen by the Birmingham County Football Association for a representative match in Hamburg in 1953, {{the players were}} already at the airport when he requested to be omitted from the team. While his teammates flew to Birmingham's Fairs Cup match in Milan, Boyd travelled across the English Channel by boat and then across France and into Italy by train.|$|E

5|$|Brian Delate as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his {{character}} {{on the show}} was killed off to instill <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and {{as he tries to}} get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.|$|E
5|$|Bryce learns {{about the}} tunnel from his cellmate, {{and the two}} escape again. Emerging from the tunnel, they are met by Butler and a dog that attacks Bryce. After being {{brought back to the}} farmhouse, Bryce is told to accept that he is mediocre and ordinary. Elsewhere, Black and Watts {{interview}} Roe again, who seems to espouse the same mindset. Black reveals that he knows Roe was once a promising student, and accuses her of being cowed by <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure. Frightened, she reveals the location of Butler's farm. Police raid the farm, freeing several captive youths, including Bryce, but Butler is nowhere to be found.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius {{abandoned}} Syria {{with the}} holy relic of the True Cross which was, along with other relics held at Jerusalem, secretly boarded on ship by Parthia of Jerusalem, just {{to protect it from}} the invading Arabs. It is said that the emperor had <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> water. and a pontoon bridge was made for Heraclius to cross the Bosphorus to Constantinople. After abandoning Syria, the Emperor began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead. Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 638–39, after which Heraclius created a buffer zone in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated.|$|E
50|$|Unlike acrophobia, <b>a</b> natural <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> heights is <b>a</b> normal phenomenon.

5|$|In June and July 2002, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma {{sponsored}} the first National Intercollegiate Marching Band, which {{traveled to the}} French Riviera, including the cities of Nice, Grasse, Aix-en-Provence, Cannes, Antibes, and the Principality of Monaco. The thirty-five member band performed at Le Suquet in Cannes, in Nice, {{and in front of}} the Prince's Palace of Monaco. After the inaugural trip, the program was dissolved by the joint national councils due to its high cost and low attendance, which was believed to be caused by <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> traveling abroad after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

Valens won the coin toss for the seat on the flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} {{of nuclear weapons}} arose from scientific and political developments of the 1930s. The decade saw many new discoveries {{about the nature of}} atoms, including the existence of nuclear fission. The concurrent rise of fascist governments in Europe led to <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> a German nuclear weapon project, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. When their calculations showed that nuclear weapons were theoretically feasible, the British and United States governments supported an all-out effort to build them.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily out of <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> a negative public reaction, {{with the potential}} militarization of space that it would also have signified, and because a moon landing would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement {{in the eyes of}} the American and international public alike. A similar project by the Soviet Union also never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|After the breakout, the Austro-Hungarian navy saw {{very little}} action, {{spending}} {{much of its}} time in its base at Pola (now Pula, Croatia). The navy's general inactivity was partly caused {{by a lack of}} coal, which became a problem as the war progressed, and partly by <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> mines in the Adriatic (which also kept the Italian navy in port for most of the war). They did, however, leave Pola to bombard Ancona in May 1915. On 23 May 1915, four hours after the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola, the members of the Tegetthoff class {{and the rest of the}} fleet departed to bombard the Italian coast. The Austro-Hungarian ships bombarded the important naval base at Ancona, and later the coast of Montenegro, without opposition; by the time Italian ships arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in Pola.|$|E
5|$|Blink-182 {{first began}} touring {{in support of}} Neighborhoods with the 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour in August 2011. The 2011 tour marked the tenth anniversary of the tour, which Blink-182 headlined in its first incarnation. The trio headlined the 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour with My Chemical Romance, which ran from August to October 2011, with {{additional}} dates scheduled in Canada with Rancid and Against Me!. In 2012 the band embarked on a worldwide 20th Anniversary Tour. The band continued touring in 2012 with their 20th Anniversary Tour, where they performed the rescheduled European dates originally canceled {{in order to continue}} recording. They were scheduled to headline the Bamboozle 2012 Music Festival but cancelled when Barker had to undergo an operation for tonsilitis. The 20th Anniversary Tour extended into Australia for in 2013 as part of the Soundwave festival, as well as 4 sideshows along the east coast with punk acts The Vandals and Sharks. Barker, who still suffers <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> flying, did not attend; Brooks Wackerman, drummer of Bad Religion at the time, filled-in for Barker's position for the Australian tour.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Communism and a belief that the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion, paired with a desire {{on the part of the}} Metropolia to dissociate itself from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of which it had been part.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{plans were}} drawn up to quell Welsh {{nationalism}} by affiliating Elizabeth {{more closely with}} Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, {{at a time when}} Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the right-wing}} Jörg Haider {{took over the}} {{leadership}} of the FPÖ's significant Carinthia branch. Its importance dated to the Kärntner Abwehrkampf (Carinthian defensive struggle) following World War I, and subsequent anti-Slavic sentiment arising from <b>a</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> being taken over by Yugoslavia. Encouraged by the mass media, a struggle soon developed between Steger and Haider over the future of the party. In the 1985 Reder case, for instance, Haider staunchly supported FPÖ Minister of Defence Friedhelm Frischenschlager when the latter welcomed convicted Waffen-SS war criminal Walter Reder in person when Reder arrived at Graz Airport after his release from Italy. While the FPÖ struggled with its low support at the national level in the mid-1980s, this was {{in sharp contrast to the}} party's position in Haider's Carinthia (where the party had increased its support from 11.7% in the 1979 provincial election to 16% in 1984).|$|E
