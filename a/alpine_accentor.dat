40|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>accentors</b> and dunnocks bred in polygynandrous {{groups in}} which two or more {{unrelated}} males shared two or more females. In both species, a female solicited actively to both alpha and subordinate males whereas an alpha male attempted to guard the female to monopolize paternity. Females combated the restrictions imposed by alpha male guarding by increasing their solicitation rate to males who had gained less mating access. Males increased their copulation rate in response, but alpha males ignored more of the offers. In both species, even when a female mated with both alpha and beta males she often gained just one male’s help with chick feeding. Under these conditions, alpha male <b>alpine</b> <b>accentors</b> reduced their amount of help with a decreased mating share, whereas beta males did not. In dunnocks, however, neither alpha nor beta males reduced their help provided a critical share of the matings was exceeded. As predicted if females attempted to maximize male help, female <b>alpine</b> <b>accentors</b> preferred to give more matings to the alpha male while female dunnocks preferred alpha and beta equally. There was no evidence for either species that alpha males sired fitter offspring; within broods of mixed paternity, {{there was no difference}} in the weights of chicks sired by alpha versus subordinate males. Female dunnocks competed with other females by territory defence whereas female <b>alpine</b> <b>accentors</b> had overlapping ranges and competed directly for male attention, increasing their solicitation rate to the alpha male if other females in the group were fertile. We suggest that the extraordinarily high rates of solicitation by females, refusal by males and copulation rates (up to a thousand per clutch) in the two species are the outcome of sexual conflict over the control of mating...|$|R

According to the Hellenic Ornithological Society mount Tymfi along with the neighbouring mountain Smolikas are important regions for breeding birds of prey, alpine and forest dwelling bird species.

Alpine reptilian and amphibian species are also present. Vipera ursinii lives in the mountain's subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus Alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the mountain, mostly in and around Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. Yellow-bellied toads (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area.|$|E

40|$|In the Pyrenees, <b>alpine</b> <b>accentors</b> bred in polygynandrous {{groups of}} up to four males and four females. Complex songs were {{produced}} by females as well as males. Females sang only during their fertile period, and they sang at a greater rate when alone than when they were accompanied {{by one or more}} mateguarding males. Female songs elicited approaches from males, but not from other females, and females often solicited copulations as soon as the male arrived. Playbacks showed that males respond differently to, and hence distinguish between, male and female songs. This study provides the first evidence that female song in birds attracts males and we suggest that it has evolved in <b>alpine</b> <b>accentors</b> because both sexes compete intensively for mates in the polygynandrous groups. Female song may advertise quality as well as receptivity for mating because older females, which laid larger clutches, sang more complex songs. We show that female song not only attracts mates but may also provide females with a mechanism for sharing mating access among several males, so females obtain maximum paternal care for their offspring...|$|R
