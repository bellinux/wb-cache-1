Lee's characters were typically stern, morally upright heroes. In contrast, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular men, often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends, or families, who always triumph in the end despite the odds. Additionally, he has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee's: where Lee held his <b>arms</b> <b>wide,</b> Chan holds his tight to the body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan is tight and choppy. Despite the success of the Rush Hour series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it, since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie nor understands American humour.|$|E

500|$|In the United States, [...] "Just Dance" [...] was {{initially}} a club hit after its release, peaking at number two {{on both the}} Hot Dance Airplay and Hot Dance Club Play charts {{during the summer of}} 2008. The song entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 76 on August 16, 2008. After five months, it gradually rose to number two on the Hot 100, after selling 419,000 in downloads on January 10, 2009. The next week, the song reached number one on the Hot 100. The single took a total of 22 weeks to hit the top spot, which is the longest climb to number one since Creed's [...] "With <b>Arms</b> <b>Wide</b> Open" [...] took 27 weeks before finally reaching number one in November 2000. The song also {{reached the top of the}} Mainstream Top 40 chart, becoming Gaga's first number-one song. [...] "Just Dance" [...] spent a total of 49 weeks on the Hot 100 and on May 29, 2015, the single was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of eight million copies. It was the second song to reach the six-million mark in paid downloads, following [...] "I Gotta Feeling" [...] by the Black Eyed Peas. As of April 2016, [...] "Just Dance" [...] has sold 7,100,000 digital downloads in the United States and is the ninth best-selling digital single of all time in the United States. In Canada, the song debuted at number 97 on the Canadian Hot 100 for the issue dated June 7, 2008. It reached the top of the chart on August 23, 2008, and was present there for five consecutive weeks.

2500|$|With money {{made from}} My Own Prison, the band started {{to write for}} their second album, Human Clay. The album's first single, [...] "Higher," [...] spent a record-breaking 17 weeks {{on the top of}} the rock radio charts. In 2009, [...] "Higher" [...] was ranked as the 95th {{greatest}} hard rock song of all time by VH1. The album was released in 1999, when My Own Prison was still doing reasonably well. However, Human Clay was an instant and overwhelming success debuting at No.1 on the Billboard 200 and selling over ten million copies over the next two years, allowing it to become one of the few rock albums to be certified diamond by the RIAA. The album was the band's first to hit No.1 in the U.S., where it debuted with first week sales of 315,000, and stayed on top for two weeks. After the album's release, follow-up singles were released: [...] "With <b>Arms</b> <b>Wide</b> Open," [...] "What If," [...] and [...] "Are You Ready." [...] The first three of those topped radio charts, giving Creed a total of seven chart-topping singles. The band would later go on to win their first, and to date only, Grammy Award for [...] "With <b>Arms</b> <b>Wide</b> Open" [...] for Best Rock Song in 2001.|$|E

2500|$|Reviews for Human Clay {{were largely}} positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{said that the}} record [...] "does {{make it clear that}} there is an {{audience}} for post-grunge hard rock, as long as it's delivered without pretension and as long as it meets the audience's desire for straight-ahead, hard-hitting music." [...] The lyrical content of Human Clay is a slight departure from that of My Own Prison, touching on subjects such as lucid dreaming ("Higher") and fatherhood ("With <b>Arms</b> <b>Wide</b> Open"), as well as darker, more violent themes such as sexual abuse ("Wash Away Those Years") and hostility ("What If").|$|E
2500|$|In 2012 {{sociologist}} Nathalie E. Paton of the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris {{analyzed the}} online videos created by post-Columbine school shooting perpetrators.

Paton said the videos serve the perpetrators by distinguishing themselves from their classmates and associating themselves with the previous perpetrators.|$|E
2500|$|Commercially, {{the band}} {{was one of the}} most [...] {{successful}} rock bands of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their first three studio albums, My Own Prison, Human Clay, and Weathered, have all gone multi-platinum in the United States, selling 6 million, 11 million, and 6 million copies respectively. The band also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for the song [...] "With <b>Arms</b> <b>Wide</b> Open" [...] in 2001. However, in spite of this enormous commercial success, Creed was poorly received by professional critics, such as Robert Christgau, among others. [...] Jonah Weiner of Slate has tried to make the case that {{the band was}} [...] "seriously underrated," [...] "most people hate Creed’s combination of overwrought power-balladry and Christian-infused testosterone." [...] However, the band's live shows from throughout their career have been critically acclaimed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band was}} never signed to a {{contemporary}} Christian music label, {{nor did it}} perform in Christian music venues or get any widespread regular play on Christian radio. However, the band's name itself refers to the religious concept of a creed. Also, themes within their musical titles such as [...] "My Own Prison", [...] "My Sacrifice", [...] "What's This Life For", [...] "With <b>Arms</b> <b>Wide</b> Open", and [...] "One Last Breath" [...] all contain allusions to Christian theology. Band members have stated that while they may be Christians, {{they do not see}} Creed as a Christian band. Bassist Brian Marshall, who named the band, said that Stapp uses spiritual imagery as a metaphor. Stapp confirmed this in 2005 in an interview with Craig Kilborn, stating that Creed being a Christian band was a misconception, and that his beliefs unintentionally come out when making analogies in lyrics.|$|E
