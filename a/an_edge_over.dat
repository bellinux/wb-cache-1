He made 21 with three fours, {{including}} <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> the slips cordon, before being bowled by Laker. Johnson hit the ball onto his foot, which deflected it back into his stumps. This left Australia at 6/338 but the lower order continued to contribute and pushed the total to 509, giving the tourists a 344-run lead.|$|E
5|$|Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the {{selfish and}} petulant {{head of a}} {{research}} team for Ryan Electrics. His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|In StarCraft, the Zerg are {{obsessed with}} the pursuit of genetic purity, and {{are the focus of}} the game's second episode. With the Xel'Nagaempowered Protoss {{targeted}} as the ultimate lifeform, the Zerg invade the Terran colonies in the Koprulu Sector to assimilate the Terrans' psionic potential and give the Zerg <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> the Protoss. Through the actions of the Sons of Korhal, the Zerg are lured to the Confederate capital Tarsonis, where they capture the psionic ghost agent Sarah Kerrigan and infest her. Returning to the Zerg base of operations on Char, the Zerg are attacked by the dark templar Zeratul, who accidentally gives the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur to the Zerg Overmind. With victory in sight, the Overmind launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet. However, {{at the end of the}} game, the Protoss high templar Tassadar sacrifices himself to destroy the Overmind, leaving the Zerg to run rampant and leaderless across the planet.|$|E

Two American business firms were established—the Russell, Sturgis & Company and the Peele, Hubbell & Company. These became two of the leading business firms. At first, Americans had <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> their British competitors, because they offered good prices for Philippine exports like hemp, sugar, and tobacco.|$|E

However, since the 1990s, the tide began to change due to a rapid growth of soccer in the United States. During this decade, Mexico {{continued}} to hold <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> their arch-rivals but since the 2000s the series has favored the U.S. 13–6–5 (W–L–T).|$|E
25|$|Car Life {{magazine}} bestowed {{its annual}} Award for Engineering Excellence on the 1963 Sting Ray. Chevy's small-block V-8 – {{the most consistent}} component of past Corvette performance – was rated by the buff books to be even better in the Sting Ray. The 1963 was noted to have <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> past models in both traction and handling because the new independent rear suspension reduced wheel spin compared to the live-axle cars.|$|E

Accordingly, the Chengdu J-10B had more advanced technology such as its radar and OLS targeting system, and its new generation stealthy features, such as its DSI intake gave it <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> the Lockheed Martin F-16.|$|E
25|$|The {{aforementioned}} submarines were {{an attempt}} to gain <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> the Greek navy (which had only one Nordenfelt submarine, a smaller and older version). However, it was quickly realized that – like the other Nordenfelt submarines ordered by Russia – they suffered from stability problems and were too easy to swamp on the surface. The Turks {{could not find a}} crew that was willing to serve on the primitive submarines. Abdül Hamid ended up rotting at dock, while Abdül Mecid was never fully completed.|$|E

In secret, he decided to pursue an unexpected and very risky invasion of Libya, the heartland of Carthage. By doing so he intended to divert Carthaginian military power from Syracuse. In Libya he wanted to incite the Libyan allies of Carthage to revolt and plunder the wealthy territory of Carthage. Also, his experienced army would have <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> the Carthaginian forces there, which were not as battle-hardened as their forces on Sicily.|$|E

25|$|The {{match was}} {{predicted}} to {{be a very}} close game, with the possibility of either side winning the game being nearly even. An NCAA.com fan poll saw that 55 percent of viewers felt that Wake Forest was going to win the match, while 45 percent felt that Stanford would win. CollegeSoccerNews.com described the match as a likely cagey contest featuring two very evenly matched teams. Brian Radewitz at Hero Sports predicted that the match would be tightly contested, but that Stanford would prevail. Radewitz felt that Stanford would have <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> Wake Forest, given their experience in the tournament, as well as the team's sturdy defense.|$|E
25|$|There {{were other}} ports along the Malacca Straits such as Kedah in the Peninsula and Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra, yet {{none of them}} came close to {{challenging}} Malacca's success as a centre of international trade. Malacca had <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> these ports because its Rulers created an environment that was safe and conducive for business. Chinese records of the mid-15th century stated that Malacca flourished as a centre for trade on account of its effective security measures. It also had a well-equipped and well-managed port. Among the facilities provided for merchants were warehouses, where they could safely house their goods as they awaited favourable trade winds, as well as elephants for transporting goods to the warehouses. Malacca's management of its ethnically diverse merchant population - {{it is said that}} 84 different languages were spoken in Malacca during its heyday- is particularly telling. To administer the cosmopolitan marketplace, the traders were grouped according to region and placed under one of four shahbandars.|$|E
25|$|Barrington {{was chosen}} to manage the {{forthcoming}} tour of Pakistan in the first season of the WSC, both sides losing players as a result. Phil Edmonds and Paul Downton were taken on the tour, Downton on Barrington's advice after playing only a few county games and he gave Edmonds was long practise sessions in the nets to improve his spin bowling. The team arrived {{in the wake of}} General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's military coup displacing Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the country {{was in a state of}} high tension and disorder. In the First Test 40,000 Bhutto supporters rioted at the ground and the teams took refuge in their dressing rooms as the army restored order. The TCCB gave Barrington permission to cancel the tour if he saw fit and realising this the players urged him to let them go home for Christmas. In the Second Test England collapsed in the first innings to the leg-spinner Abdul Qadir (6/44), but Barrington bowled his own leg-spin at Brearley and Boycott for an hour before the second innings and their 185 opening stand saved the game. The Third Test was surrounded by controversy as Pakistan wanted brought in their WSC players Zaheer Abbas, Mushtaq Mohammad and Imran Khan to win a series victory in the last Test. This would have given them <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> an England team without its WSC veterans. Several England players led by the vice-captain Geoff Boycott, Bob Willis and Derek Randall refused to play Pakistan with their Packer players and Barrington and Brearley tried to negotiate between the players, the TCCB and the Pakistani cricket authorities. Matters were made worst by Mike Brearley breaking his arm and returning to England, leaving the uncompromising Boycott as captain and Willis as vice-captain. Fortunately, the Pakistani players could only play by breaking their WSC contracts, which they refused to do, and the Test was drawn. Barrington was out of his depth in these political matters, even though Willis later admitted that his determination for the Test to be played regardless was the right course.|$|E

500|$|Finally, the German {{tradition}} {{of local and}} regional autonomy created structural and cultural differences in the Holy Roman Empire, compared to the increasingly centralized authority of such other European states as France, England, and Spain.

500|$|Johnson made 21, {{including}} <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> the slips cordon, {{before being}} bowled by Laker. He inside edged the ball onto {{his foot and}} it rolled back into his stumps. At the same time, Yardley pinned Hassett down with more leg theory. Laker bowled with one slip, while Young had none and had all of his fielders evenly spread in a circular formation. Tallon came in and took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the left-arm orthodox spin of Young. The scoring was very slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs. Hassett conducted himself in a humorous way, and Arlott said: [...] "only his grace and concealed humour made his innings tolerable". He mainly scored from deflections and was {{for the most part}} prepared to take his time.|$|E
500|$|The German {{tradition}} {{of local and}} regional autonomy differed structurally and culturally from the increasingly centralized authority of such other European states as France, England, and Spain. This difference made them vulnerable to the unabashed intervention of Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, English and Scots mercenaries {{and the influence of}} papal gold and changed the dynamic of internal German confessional and dynastic disputes. The great [...] "players" [...] of the Early Modern European political stage realized that they could enhance their own positions vis-a-vis one another by assisting, promoting, or undermining local and regional competition among the German princes, {{as they did in the}} localized feud between Gebhard and Ernst. Conversely, German princes, dukes, and counts realized that they could gain <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>over</b> their competitors by promoting the interests of powerful neighbors. The scale of the engagement of such external mercenary armies as Spain's Army of Flanders set a precedent to internationalize contests of local autonomy and religious issues in the German states, a problem not settled until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Even after that settlement, German states remained vulnerable to both external intervention and the religious division exemplified in the Cologne war.|$|E
