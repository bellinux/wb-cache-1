40|$|Abstract This paper {{estimates}} {{the value of}} the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) subsidy. Using data from the merger boom of 1991 - 2004, we find that banking organizations were willing to pay an added premium for mergers that would put them over the asset sizes that are commonly viewed as the thresholds for being TBTF. We estimate at least $ 15 billion in added premiums for the eight merger deals that brought the organizations to over $ 100 billion in assets. In addition, we find that both the stock and bond markets reacted positively to these TBTF merger deals. Our estimated TBTF subsidy is large enough to create serious concern, particularly since the recently <b>assisted</b> <b>mergers</b> have effectively allowed for TBTF banking organizations to become even bigger and for nonbanks to become part of TBTF banking organizations, thus extending the TBTF subsidy beyond banking...|$|R
40|$|Although {{increasing}} research {{attention has}} been given to the discourse of legitimacy in <b>assisting</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions in Scandinavian countries, scarce research has been done on this topic in different geopolitical contexts. This study therefore aims to investigate the discursive struggle of delegitimizing a Chinese state-owned company investment in the Australian mining sector. We used a historical critical approach to further develop the theoretical and empirical capacity for analysing legitimacy discourses. Specifically, we have extended the research on the discourse of legitimacy research in three aspects. First, we have identified political-ideological discourse as a prominent discourse in addition to the commonly acknowledged rationalistic and nationalistic discourse. Second, we have found that the use of legitimation strategies is purposive and deliberate. Moralization strategy, in particular, was extensively used in a range of discourses (rationalistic, nationalistic and political-ideological) to delegitimize the proposed merger as not being aligned with the national interest. As a result, the legitimacy discourse failed and the deal collapsed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} various {{approaches to}} dealing with problematic assets of the banking sector. These approaches include {{the establishment of an}} asset management company, capital injection and sale of the bank, purchase and assumption transactions, liquidation or bridge bank. All these approaches are evaluated with respect to Czech transformation experience and with respect to experience of other foreign countries. The paper concludes that the establishment of Czech Consolidation Agency (Czech Consolidation Bank, respectively) was the least suitable approach {{to dealing with}} problematic assets in the Czech banking sector during the period of the transformation. The paper furthermore suggests that other methods, such as the liquidation accompanied with deposit insurance payments, publicly <b>assisted</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions, or finally privately or publicly assisted purchase and assumption transactions should have been used instead. The knowledge of these alternative approaches to weak-bank restructuring is supposed to guarantee that Czech authorities will not step up to establish a similar inefficient asset management company, should banking-sector problems emerge once again. problematic assets, Czech Consolidation Agency, banking...|$|R

During these two decades, approximately 8, 200 unassisted bank mergers and 1, 160 <b>assisted</b> <b>mergers</b> of distressed banks have occurred. 1 From a peak of 14, 483 commercial banks in 1984, the number of insured commercial banks fell to 8, 563 by the end of 1999. The ownership of about $ 2. 5 trillion of banking assets has changed through mergers during this time – more than half the U. S. total. These mergers have brought consolidation with a vengeance. The 25 largest banks control 70 % of all assets, and are expected to control 85 % of bank assets in another decade –mostly via mergers. Figure 1 presents estimates of the banks and bank assets acquired in the 1980 - 1999 period; Figure 2 illustrates the dramatic {{decline in the number of}} commercial banks (and savings institutions). This dramatic industrial shift raises some basic questions: why are banks merging? will mergers enhance efficiency in banking? is consolidation good for banking customers? It has been widely assumed by the business press, bankers, and most regulators that the answers to these questions are yes, yes, and yes. This reflects widespread agreement that the United States economy is “overbanked ” and therefore inefficient. This view has been established as th...|$|R

After March 31, 2002 the government's unlimited guarantee of all deposits {{is scheduled to}} revert to 10 million yen (about $ 95, 000) per depositor in each bank. Three major concerns will accompany this transition. First, a number of weaker banks will fail as the bad loan problems are gradually resolved. Second, if deposit insurance is limited, then weak banks will be made even weaker by depositor withdrawals in favor of deposits in stronger banks, or other financial assets, and hence are even more likely to fail. Third, until March 31, 2002 government financia 1 aid to <b>assist</b> the <b>merger</b> of weak financial institutions can be greater than the amount of formal deposit insurance coverage.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} value of patent analysis in an industrial context. An empirical approach is taken to test the benefits and limitations {{of a series of}} patent analysis techniques. The technology profiles of a group of competitor companies within the oil/petrochemicals area are mapped to evaluate the analysis techniques. Patent quantity analysis benefits from speed of execution but provides no indication of patent quality. The International Patent Classification (IPC) hierarchy can map a company’s technological diversity but the correlation of IPC categories with industry or product areas may present difficulties in a business-focused analysis. An experiment within the polymer chemistry area suggests there is a positive association between a patent’s citation counts and its commercial significance, as rated by expert grading. This supports the use of patent citation data to compare the quality of companies’ patent portfolios but the time lag to build citation counts may limit its usefulness in practice. Maps of inter-company patent references may indicate technological leadership but {{the value of}} other bibliographic-based techniques appears more marginal. A trend of inter-company differences in the volume of the ‘References Cited’ list is observed. If confirmed, this could impact the value of bibliographic-based patent analysis techniques. Patent analysis can <b>assist</b> in a <b>merger</b> evaluation, particularly at the due diligence phase, but it is often of secondary importance to financial and product market information. Several factors that may distort patent statistics are identified. These include inadequate company name consolidation, errors in patent classification and differences in national patent legislation.

40|$|In this paper, a model {{based on}} the translog cost {{function}} was used to provide an insight into the controversy surrounding the government protection provided to banking institutions determined as ‘Too-big-to-fail’ (TBTF). Whilst the origins of this protection traces back to the bailout of Continental Bank in the US in 1984, the bailouts around the world during the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 have established this issue as a major policy talking point. The support provided during the crisis {{was also in the}} form of <b>assisted</b> and facilitated <b>mergers,</b> which has actually resulted in many of these TBTF institutions becoming even larger, and has extended TBTF protection beyond commercial banking to investment banking and even insurance companies, as demonstrated by the bailout of AIG. The justification for such intervention to prevent failure is a desire to restore stability to financial systems and economies, whilst avoiding the damaging effects of contagion and spillovers to other interconnected firms. However, the consequence of such implicit state protection for institutions arises in the form of moral hazard, as the incentives of a bank’s creditors, depositors and management are distorted, alongside a weakening of market discipline. As such, TBTF institutions have access to a lower cost of capital than other firms, incentivizing it to increase the riskiness of its activities in the pursuit of higher returns. A much-cited justification for the scale of the largest banks around the world concerns economies of scale. This concept holds that the average costs of a firm fall as size increases, due to risk diversification and other factors. In this paper, I examine whether such scale economies actually exist, in the context of many calls from politicians for these institutions to be broken up, alongside a formal size limit of banks. Using a sample of UK banks, I fail to find evidence of economies of scale, instead finding evidence of diseconomies of scale. The presence of such decreasing returns to scale defies the much-cited rationale for consolidation and scale, consequently adding credence to the policy option of reducing bank size in order to remove the negative effects of TBTF institutions within a financial system. I also indentify a number of practical and methodological obstacles to the successful implementation of such a policy...|$|R
40|$|Freeways {{are divided}} roadways {{designed}} {{to facilitate the}} uninterrupted movement of motor vehicles. However, many freeways now experience demand flows in excess of capacity, leading to recurrent congestion. The Highway Capacity Manual (TRB, 1994) uses empirical macroscopic relationships between speed, flow and density to quantify freeway operations and performance. Capacity may be predicted as the maximum uncongested flow achievable. Although they are effective tools for design and analysis, macroscopic models lack {{an understanding of the}} nature of processes taking place in the system. Szwed and Smith (1972, 1974) and Makigami and Matsuo (1990) have shown that microscopic modelling is also applicable to freeway operations. Such models facilitate an understanding of the processes whilst providing for the assessment of performance, through measures of capacity and delay. However, these models are limited to only a few circumstances. The aim of this study was to produce more comprehensive and practical microscopic models. These models were required to accurately portray the mechanisms of freeway operations at the specific locations under consideration. The models needed to be able to be calibrated using data acquired at these locations. The output of the models needed to be able to be validated with data acquired at these sites. Therefore, the outputs should be truly descriptive of the performance of the facility. A theoretical basis needed to underlie the form of these models, rather than empiricism, which is the case for the macroscopic models currently used. And the models needed to be adaptable to variable operating conditions, so that they may be applied, where possible, to other similar systems and facilities. It was not possible to produce a stand-alone model which is applicable to all facilities and locations, in this single study, however the scene has been set for the application of the models to a much broader range of operating conditions. Opportunities for further development of the models were identified, and procedures provided for the calibration and validation of the models to a wide range of conditions. The models developed, do however, have limitations in their applicability. Only uncongested operations were studied and represented. Driver behaviour in Brisbane was applied to the models. Different mechanisms are likely in other locations due to variability in road rules and driving cultures. Not all manoeuvres evident were modelled. Some unusual manoeuvres were considered unwarranted to model. However the models developed contain the principal processes of freeway operations, merging and lane changing. Gap acceptance theory was applied to these critical operations to assess freeway performance. Gap acceptance theory was found to be applicable to merging, however the major stream, the kerb lane traffic, exercises only a limited priority over the minor stream, the on-ramp traffic. Theory was established to account for this activity. Kerb lane drivers were also found to change to the median lane where possible, to <b>assist</b> coincident <b>mergers.</b> The net limited priority model accounts for this by predicting a reduced major stream flow rate, which excludes lane changers. Cowan's M 3 model as calibrated for both streams. On-ramp and total upstream flow are required as input. Relationships between proportion of headways greater than 1 s and flow differed for on-ramps where traffic leaves signalised intersections and unsignalised intersections. Constant departure onramp metering was also modelled. Minimum follow-on times of 1 to 1. 2 s were calibrated. Critical gaps were shown to lie between the minimum follow-on time, and the sum of the minimum follow-on time and the 1 s minimum headway. Limited priority capacity and other boundary relationships were established by Troutbeck (1995). The minimum average minor stream delay and corresponding proportion of drivers delayed were quantified theoretically in this study. A simulation model was constructed to predict intermediate minor and major stream delays across all minor and major stream flows. Pseudo-empirical relationships were established to predict average delays. Major stream average delays are limited to 0. 5 s, insignificant compared with minor stream delay, which reach infinity at capacity. Minor stream delays were shown to be less when unsignalised intersections are located upstream of on-ramps than signalised intersections, and less still when ramp metering is installed. Smaller delays correspond to improved merge area performance. A more tangible performance measure, the distribution of distances required to merge, was established by including design speeds. This distribution can be measured to validate the model. Merging probabilities can be predicted for given taper lengths, a most useful performance measure. This model was also shown to be applicable to lane changing. Tolerable limits to merging probabilities require calibration. From these, practical capacities can be estimated. Further calibration is required of traffic inputs, critical gap and minimum follow-on time, for both merging and lane changing. A general relationship to predict proportion of drivers delayed requires development. These models can then be used to complement existing macroscopic models to assess performance, and provide further insight into the nature of operations...|$|R
