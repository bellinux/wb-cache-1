5|$|Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt {{without success}} to bring Homer {{back to the}} congregation. One Sunday morning, while {{everybody}} else is at church, Homer falls <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch smoking a cigar, which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service. Appearing in his dreams again, God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion. He starts to tell Homer the meaning of life, but is cut off by the ending credits.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} premiered on MTV Live on May 12, 1998. The clip {{starts with the}} rising of the sun, until it {{progresses}} into the Koyaanisqatsi inspired section, featuring time-lapse images of daily life, from people riding a subway, ordering food, bowling, and children in a classroom to sped-up city-scapes and freeways at night. Interspersed in the scenes is Madonna dancing and singing the track, her image partially merged with {{the backdrop of the}} fast-sped cityscape. During the intermediate verse the high-speed motion stops with the camera focusing on Madonna only against a sunset backdrop but quickly speeds up again. As the clip continues into nightfall, high-speed images of Madonna dancing in a discoth√®que is shown, with the camera focusing on the revelers, until she is seen falling <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dance floor, and a revolving shot of planet Earth.|$|E
5|$|The novel's protagonist is Lucius, {{a man who}} {{has been}} magically {{transformed}} into a donkey. In the eleventh and last book of the novel, Lucius, after falling <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach at Cenchreae in Greece, wakes to see the full moon. He prays to the moon, using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco-Roman world, asking her to restore him to human form. Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself the greatest of all goddesses. She tells him that a festival in her honor, the Navigium Isidis, is taking place nearby, and that the festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them. After Lucius becomes human again, the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess, and that he will now be free of the inquisitiveness and self-indulgence that drew him into many of his earlier misadventures. Lucius joins the local temple of Isis, becomes her devoted follower, and eventually undergoes initiation.|$|E

25|$|A {{slightly}} different story {{was told by}} the notes of Pyotr Lidov published in Parlamentskaya Gazeta in 1999. Apparently, Lidov for years meticulously collected all the available information on Kosmodemyanskaya. The notes supported the version that Kosmodemyanskaya and Vasily Klubkov were caught while <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of Petrischevo. The Germans were called by Petrischevo resident Semyon Sviridov. Lidov's notes also included an interview with a German noncommissioned officer taken prisoner by the Red Army. The interview described the negative effect on the morale of the German soldiers who witnessed the burning of the houses.|$|E

25|$|For Ben-Hur, Simonides bribes Sejanus {{to remove}} the prefect Valerius Gratus from his post; Valerius is succeeded by Pontius Pilate. Ben-Hur sets out for Jerusalem to find his mother and sister. Pilate's review of the prison records reveals great injustice, and he notes Gratus {{concealed}} a walled-up cell. Pilate's troops reopen the cell to find two women, Judah's long-lost mother and sister, suffering from leprosy. Pilate releases them, and {{they go to the}} old Hur house, which is vacant. Finding Judah <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steps, they give thanks to God that he is alive, but do not wake him. As lepers, they are considered less than human. Banished from the city, they leave in the morning.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of Friday, August 24, Rolling broke into the {{apartment}} shared by 17-year-old university freshmen Sonja Larson and Christina Powell. Finding Powell <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> downstairs couch, he stood over her briefly but did not wake her up, choosing instead to explore the upstairs bedroom where he found Larson also asleep. Rolling murdered Larson, first taping her mouth shut to stifle her screams and then stabbing her to death. She died while trying to fend him off. Rolling then went back downstairs, taped Powell's mouth shut, bound her wrists together behind her back and threatened her with a knife as he cut her clothes off of her. He then raped her and forced her face-down onto the floor, where he stabbed her five times in the back. Rolling posed the bodies in sexually provocative positions and left the apartment.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day Kitai reaches a mountaintop, and Cypher learns about the broken capsules. Knowing {{that the only}} way to complete the journey with only two capsules would be to skydive, Cypher orders Kitai to abort the mission. Believing his father still sees him as a disappointment, Kitai blames Senshi's death on Cypher's absence on the day of the attack. He skydives from the mountaintop, but a large eagle captures him and his communicator is damaged. Kitai wakes in the eagle's nest, surrounded by its chicks. Tigers attack the chicks, and Kitai attempts but fails to defend the chicks. The eagle attacks the tigers, and Kitai escapes. He reaches a river, and builds a raft to continue along it. Tired, Kitai falls <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> raft. He dreams of his sister, Senshi, who reassures him that Cypher's bitterness is just his own anger for not saving her. Senshi urges Kitai to wake up. When he does, another thermal shift catches him by surprise and he nearly freezes to death. Kitai is rescued by the eagle, who sacrifices itself for him.|$|E

25|$|A State {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by a}} chain of mistakes owing to the negligence of air traffic controllers, as well as disobedience of basic airport maintenance and safety regulations. The ground controller was found directly responsible, as he fell <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> job and thus did not respond to emergency queries; he also allowed the service trucks to move onto the runway and did not mark the runway as occupied. At a hearing, he could not recollect his actions during the time in question, but did not deny the charges. He was sentenced to 15 years and committed suicide in prison. In addition, the flight operations manager was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the approach controller to 13 years, and the head of airport maintenance to 12 years. All three appealed their sentences, to no avail. Future inspections at numerous other Soviet airports also found similar types and numbers of violations of safety regulations, resulting in the firing of several high-level officials thereafter.|$|E

500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] is {{the tenth}} {{track in the}} Anton Corbijn film Linear, based on a story by Corbijn and Bono where a Parisian traffic cop travels across France and the Mediterranean Sea to visit his girlfriend in Tripoli. During the sequence, the cop (played by Sa√Ød Taghmaoui), leaves the bar and begins to wander the streets of C√°diz at night, {{eventually}} making his {{way down to the}} beach where he falls <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sand.

Stengel was given a contract for 1965, though Creamer suggested that Weiss, Grant and Payson would have preferred that the 74-year-old Stengel retire.|$|E
500|$|Goodridge {{completed}} Beauty Revealed in 1828, likely {{from looking}} at herself in a mirror. Several works have been cited as possible inspirations, including John Vanderlyn's Ariadne <b>Asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Island of Naxos and Horatio Greenough's sculpture Venus Victrix. Goodridge sent her portrait to Webster {{when he was a}} new widower, and, based on its miniature format, it was likely intended for his eyes alone. The American art critic John Updike suggests that the artist intended it to offer herself to Webster; he writes that the bared breasts appear to say [...] "We are yours for the taking, in all our ivory loveliness, with our tenderly stippled nipples". Ultimately, however, Webster married another, wealthier woman.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna {{stretching}} {{in front of}} a wall-mirror, while traffic noise is heard. During the first verse, Madonna is shown in a chic Chanel black dress with retro makeup.

[...] He noted how Jones would fall <b>asleep</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board, waking up to answer a question. [...] "He works in the Alpha state a lot", Ingram added. Two of Jackson's sisters, Janet and La Toya, provided backing vocals in the guise of the P.Y.T.s. The two sisters sang [...] "na na na" [...] back at their brother {{towards the end of the}} song. It has a tempo of 126 beats per minute, making it one of Jackson's fastest songs.|$|E

Unfortunately, Peter forgets his promise to Lois and plays such drinking games as [...] "Drink the beer".
