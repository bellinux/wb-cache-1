5|$|From 1942–1945, Peng's {{role in the}} war {{was mostly}} political, and he {{supported}} Mao very closely.

5|$|In clock-limited sports, games {{often end}} with <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> holds the lead killing the clock rather than {{competing}} aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is {{some form of}} aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even {{in the case of}} multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.|$|E
