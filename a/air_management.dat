With a simplified structure to reduce cost and weight, the optimised high-transonic wing improves by more than 10% the lift-to-drag ratio over the supercritical-section wing of the Falcon 50 shared by previous Falcons. The cabin is 2.4m (8ft) longer than the 900 and have a lower 6,000ft (1,800m) cabin altitude. the 6,100lb-thrust (21.7kN) PW307A was finally selected, among other risk-sharing partners: Honeywell for avionics architecture, auxiliary power unit, <b>air</b> <b>management</b> system; with Parker Hannifin for the power generation system and wheels brakes; and TRW Aeronautical Systems for the hydromechanical flap and airbrake systems.|$|E
25|$|On 13 June, the RLAF flew 17 sorties against Pathet Lao {{artillery}} and antiaircraft guns on Phou Kout Mountain menacing Neutralist positions near Muang Soui. Due to an inadequate forward air control system, {{some of the}} ordnance struck friendly troops. Although this disclosed a dangerous shortcoming in the Lao military's <b>air</b> <b>management,</b> General Thao Ma, commander of the RLAF, refused to supply Air Liaison Officers to direct the RLAF T-28 Trojans for the planned Lao attack. In fact, Ma transferred nine of his 20 T-28s south to Savannakhet, moving them out of possible range of targets on the Plain of Jars. Arranging air support for the upcoming Operation Triangle was thus left to the air attaché, Colonel Robert Tyrell. Two American pilots from Project Waterpump in Udorn, Thailand were forwarded to the Neutralists to fly O-1 Bird Dogs in their support, but their efforts were foiled by restrictions imposed by American ambassador Leonard Unger. Nevertheless, operational planning continued.|$|E

The Corvette division approached Lotus {{with the idea}} of developing the world's fastest production car, {{to be based on the}} C4 generation Corvette. With input from GM, Lotus designed a new engine to fit in place of the L98 V8 that was powering the standard C4. The result was what GM dubbed the LT5, an aluminum-block V-8 with the same bore centers as the L98, but with four overhead camshafts, 32 valves. Lotus also designed a unique <b>air</b> <b>management</b> system for the engine to provide a wider power band by shutting off 8 of the 16 intake runners and fuel injectors when the engine was at part-throttle, while still giving the ZR-1 [...] when at wide open throttle.|$|E
2500|$|Water and <b>air</b> <b>management</b> (in PEMFCs). In {{this type}} of fuel cell, the {{membrane}} must be hydrated, requiring water to be evaporated at precisely the same rate that it is produced. If water is evaporated too quickly, the membrane dries, resistance across it increases, and eventually it will crack, creating a gas [...] "short circuit" [...] where hydrogen and oxygen combine directly, generating heat that will damage the fuel cell. If the water is evaporated too slowly, the electrodes will flood, preventing the reactants from reaching the catalyst and stopping the reaction. Methods to manage water in cells are being developed like electroosmotic pumps focusing on flow control. Just as in a combustion engine, a steady ratio between the reactant and oxygen is necessary to keep the fuel cell operating efficiently.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{increasing}} popularity and higher risk of wreck diving, many diver training organizations such as Scuba Diving International and the Professional Association of Diving Instructors provide specialist wreck diver training courses, which divers are advised to take before wreck diving.

[...] Most recreational diving organizations teach divers only to penetrate to at most the limit of the [...] "light zone" [...] or a maximum aggregate surface distance (depth and penetration) of 100 feet. [...] Other technical diving organizations, such as IANTD, TDI and ANDI teach advanced wreck courses that emphasize a higher level of training, experience and equipment and prepare divers for deeper levels of wreck penetration. The Nautical Archaeology Society in the UK, teaches awareness of underwater cultural heritage issues as well as practical diver and archaeological skills. Other organizations, such as the Artificial Reef Society of British Columbia (ARSBC) deliberately create artificial reefs to provide features for divers to explore, as well as substrates for marine life to thrive upon.|$|E

40|$|System wide {{information}} management (SWIM) – as {{envisioned by the}} Single European Sky <b>Air</b> Traffic <b>Management</b> Research (SESAR) program – is the application of service oriented architectures to the <b>air</b> traffic <b>management</b> domain. Service oriented architectures are widely deployed in business and finance but usually tied to one specific technological implementation. SWIM goes one step further by defining only the semantic layer of the application integration and leaving {{the implementation of the}} communication layer open to the implementer. The shift from legacy communication patterns to SWIM is fundamental for the expected evolution of <b>air</b> traffic <b>management</b> in the next decades. However, the <b>air</b> traffic <b>management</b> simulators currently in use do not reflect this, yet. SWIM compliance is defined by semantic compatibility to the <b>Air</b> traffic <b>management</b> Information Reference Model (AIRM) and a SWIM service may implement one or more communication profiles, which specify a communication layer implementation. This work proposes a SWIM-compliant communication profile suitable to integrate SWIM-compliant tools into human-in-the-loop simulations for <b>air</b> traffic <b>management</b> research. We achieve this objective by implementing a SWIM communication profile using XML-based multicast messaging, and extending the message format to support distributed human-in-the-loop simulations. We apply our method to the evaluation of the performance of a rule-based automatic controller against human controllers in a simulation of Hamburg airport operations. Our results demonstrate that our method is fit to integrate commercial and experimental <b>air</b> traffic <b>management</b> software in complex simulation scenarios...|$|R
