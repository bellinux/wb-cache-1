Due to negative feedback from the riders, the historic color was kept.|$|E

Thereafter members of the class <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> plain black by the LB&SCR. Under Southern Railway ownership three examples <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in lined umber, and others in passenger green and lined black. During the Second World War they <b>were</b> either <b>painted</b> in unlined dark green or black. Under British Railways the usual livery was lined black.|$|R

5|$|Some areas were, in fact, {{decorated}} with gold: the shields between the Ignudi and the columns between the Prophets and Sibyls. It seems {{very likely that}} the gilding of the shields was part of Michelangelo's original scheme, since they <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> to resemble {{a certain type of}} parade shield, a number of which still exist and are decorated in a similar style with gold.|$|E

6000|$|... "What!" [...] it will {{perhaps be}} replied, [...] "have, then, ships never <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> {{perfectly}} yet, {{even by the}} men who have devoted most attention to them?" [...] Assuredly not. A ship never yet has <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> at all, in any other sense than men have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> in [...] "Landscapes with figures." [...] Things have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> which have a general effect of ships, just as things have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> which have a general effect of shepherds or banditti; but the best average ship-painting no more reaches the truth of ships than the equestrian troops in one of Van der Meulen's battle-pieces express the higher truths of humanity.|$|R
