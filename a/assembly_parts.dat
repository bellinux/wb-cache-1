50|$|Scale miniatures of real {{production}} vehicles, {{designed as}} kits for children or the enthusiast to construct, {{can be made}} of plastic, die-cast metal, resin, and even wood. In plastic model kits, parts are molded in single cast 'trees' with thin connections {{that can be easily}} severed for painting and <b>assembly.</b> <b>Parts</b> come molded in a variety of colors, white being the most common in the 1960s and 1970s. Some parts are chrome plated to simulate real bumpers, grilles, wheels, and other pieces that might be chrome on the actual vehicle. Tires are most commonly molded in rubber. Water 'slide-on' decals are usually included along with an instruction brochure.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the newest}} {{technologies}} available today for programming are those which use a virtual simulation. Simulations {{with the use}} of virtual models of the working environment and the robots themselves can offer advantages to both the company and programmer. By using a simulation, costs are reduced, and robots can be programmed off-line which eliminates any down-time for an assembly line. Robot actions and <b>assembly</b> <b>parts</b> can be visualised in a 3-dimensional virtual environment months before prototypes are even produced. Writing code for a simulation is also easier than writing code for a physical robot. While the move toward virtual simulations for programming robots is a step forward in user interface design, many such applications are only in their infancy.|$|E

50|$|Turkey's main {{exports to}} EU and imports from EU are dominantly {{industrial}} (95% {{of all its}} imports and exports). Since 1996, Turkey's gross domestic product has increased 4-fold, {{making it one of}} the fastest growing economies in the world. At the same time, however, the foreign trade deficit of Turkey (between EU) has increased 2 fold and 6 fold with non-EU countries (the rest of the world), between 1995-2008. The Customs Union is a large factor in both of these developments. Some commentators have pointed to a vicious circle that the profits generated from imports are being used to buy raw materials and <b>assembly</b> <b>parts</b> again from Europe.

One month later, the Red Army assumed control over the area, starting a civilian works project to manufacture weapons for the Soviet Union. By August 1945, the Red Army had created 50 StG 44s from existing <b>assembly</b> <b>parts,</b> and had begun inspecting their design. 10,785 sheets of technical designs were confiscated by the Soviets {{as part of their}} research.
