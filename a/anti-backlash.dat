40|$|Abstract. This paper puts {{forward a}} new type of gear <b>anti-backlash</b> drive mechanism, in view of {{traditional}} ’ manufacturing is difficult and production cost is high. This mechanism uses the structure of a pair of worm gears which are against each other and double gears to eliminate the back clearance volume. The dynamic model of the mechanism in this paper is established by the method of lumped mass, and the model’s numerical solution is solved by fourth-order Runge-Kutta. Then the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of system are simulated and analyzed. The studies show that this mechanism whose backlash has been eliminated has a good dynamic characteristics, and increasing system’s meshing damping can shorten the vibration attenuation time and improving the average meshing stiffness can reduce vibration amplitude of the system...|$|E

The objective is to minimize the frictional force between the worm and the gear. The constraints include the worm geometry, stresses, displacements and the natural frequency of the worm. To avoid a difficult 3 -D shape optimization problem, a two-stage optimization method is introduced in this paper. The first stage optimization uses an approximate worm model. The threads of the worm are approximated by plate elements in this stage.

40|$|The CNC {{machine tools}} are spatial {{machines}} that {{are able to}} control computer. There are two types of machine tools structure, C-frame and gantry-frame. A CNC gantry machine tool is defined as a computer numerically controlled machine that is programmed and controlled through a computer. Its CNC controller offers very short setup time flexibility to run batches of one to several thousand. Today, the CNC gantry machines are widely used in manufacturing combined with software programs to efficiently and consistently create different products for large companies or even single consumers. The CNC gantry machine is used in the manufacturing sector including drilling, milling, reaming, boring and counter boring. Parts can be grooved and threaded with CNC milling centers; they can be transformed into CNC lathes, CNC drill and tap areas; for CNC grinding; and used in conjunction with routers to make CNC wood engravers and letterers. The CNC gantry machine can be used to machine small, large, short and lengthy components. Currently, {{there are two types of}} such machines in the market. The first type has a moving worktable and fixed gantry and the second type has a moving gantry and fixed worktable. Each type has advantages and disadvantages. In this study, a new concept is proposed to improve the specifications and applicability of the first type of CNC gantry machine. In the new concept, reciprocal and simultaneous motion of the gantry and worktable is proposed as the gantry machine’s X-axis double motion mechanism. At the beginning of this study, the double motion mechanism is designed based on a rack and pinion system. A new <b>anti-backlash</b> system is proposed to compensate for transmission error and backlash (simultaneously) and for use in the double motion mechanism. The simulation results of the new <b>anti-backlash</b> system are discussed. Due to manufacturing limitations of the rack and pinion systems, a new double motion mechanism based on a ball screw system is proposed. Then, various designs of a new CNC gantry machine are presented. In this improvement process the problem is solved with the new design of a completed CNC gantry machine. The dynamic and static behavior of the final CNC gantry machine design is investigated via modal and static structural analysis using ANSYS software. The gantry’s natural frequency is designed to be 202 Hz in the first vibration mode, making the machine capable of working at higher speeds of up to 11530 rpm, which is suitable not only for rough cutting but also for finishing. The final design of the new CNC gantry machine is updated according to the obtained results. The increase in natural frequency during gantry design modification affects complexity, increasing the weight and manufacturing cost of the gantry. As such, five different gantry designs are selected for comparison. Four parameters, i. e., the first four natural frequencies, total deformation due to mechanical forces, weight and manufacturing cost are considered performance indices. One is selected among five designs mathematically and optimized by MOGA (multi-objective genetic algorithm) in ANSYS software. In the optimization process, the gantry’s natural frequency is maximized, thus minimizing the total gantry weight and deformation against mechanical forces. CNC gantry machine documents for manufacturing are prepared, followed by modeling, casting, machining and assembly. To evaluate and verify the design and analysis, an experimental modal test is performed. The experimental results show less than 11...|$|E
40|$|A {{closed loop}} PC based {{system has been}} {{developed}} to drive a stepper motor to control the exit area of an isolated Air intake model. The exit area of the intake model is rectangular, which can be varied by turning a rectangular butterfly valve. The valve is connected to a shaft which is driven by a 6 V DC stepper motor. The motor operates at 200 pulses per revolution which corresponds to 1. 8 /pulse. During the run, the butterfly valve is operated from fully open to nearly closed state, a reduction gearbox (reduction ratio = 1 : 15) further reduces the speed of rotation to 0. 12  per pulse. The PC based software for the stepper motor control provides the chosen number of pulses with a resolution of 1 pulse, equivalent to  0. 12 . The motor shaft is also connected {{to a pair of}} <b>anti-backlash</b> gears, used to drive a 10 -turn potentiometer. The output of the potentiometer is calibrated and used to determine the valve position during the run. The software developed can run the motor at any number of chosen steps. After the required steps are achieved, the valve can be driven in reverse direction through any number of chosen steps, which could be the same as forward path or different. The hardware and software are established in such a manner that the whole system could be stopped automatically once the requirement for a particular experiment is over. The complete details of the control set-up i. e. hardware as well as software are included in this report.

"May 2013 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In this work, a linear technique is used to study the stability of a nonlinear system. Most of dynamic systems in industrial and fluid power systems are nonlinear and include uncertainties. Thus, unexpected changes in the stability can be exhibited and can lead these systems to become unstable exhibit oscillatory behavior. Engineers have been trying to develop nonlinear mathematical models to be able to predict whether or not a designed system will be exposed to such an oscillation before considering building and implementing the system. The focus {{of this study is to}} predict the existence of nonlinear oscillation in a dynamic system. A nonlinear model validation of a solenoid operated proportional control valve was performed using open loop testes. The model consists of linear and nonlinear parts. The linear part was developed by linearizing the nonlinear equations governing the operations of the valve at nominal conditions. The nonlinear parts constructed by analyzing open loop tests showed that two major nonlinearities found in the system; saturation effect of the current input and backlash hysteresis behavior of the valve; were considered to be the cause of instability. Each one of these nonlinearities was represented by its linear model and several limit cycles were predicted using the describing function analysis method. In order to control limit cycle behavior, a control system was designed in order to ensure robust stability and performance. Two aspects of the valve system were considered in the design. First, the uncertainty model of the valve operation due to the uncertainty found for the 30 replications of the first stage spool valve was considered. Second, the nonlinearities embedded in the system were considered which can cause stability issues if they have not been considered in the design. Thus, two different controllers were designed and implemented for the system, <b>anti-backlash</b> and H-infinity controllers. Designing both of the controllers in a way that robust stability and performance are to be achieved proved to be the main challenge. A technique was developed to extract the best stability and performance characteristics for each type of controller. Finally, the control system was tested experimentally for all the replications of the valve system. Results showed a significant amount of hysteresis reduction as well as robust stability and performance objectives were me by all the system uncertain replications using the designed controllers...|$|E
