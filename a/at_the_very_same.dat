25|$|Instead of yeast, {{bacteria}} play {{a fundamental}} role in malolactic fermentation {{which is essentially}} the conversion of malic acid into lactic acid.

Depending on the style of wine that the winemaker is trying to produce, malolactic fermentation may take place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>same</b> time as the yeast fermentation. Alternatively, some strains of yeast may be developed that can convert L-malate to L-lactate during alcohol fermentation. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ML01 (S. cerevisiae strain ML01), which carries a gene encoding malolactic enzyme from Oenococcus oeni and a gene encoding malate permease from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. cerevisiae strain ML01 has received regulatory approval in both Canada and the United States.|$|E

The earlier use of the specific epithet melanoleucus for the black-and-white hawk-eagle technically precludes its use for the black-chested buzzard-eagle, except when it is placed in Geranoaetus. In fact, in the mid-20th century Buteo fuscescens was the prevailing name for the black-chested buzzard-eagle for some years, but it was eventually dismissed as erroneous.

During a road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles, his brother Jonathan pitched the idea for [...] "Memento Mori", about a man with anterograde amnesia who uses notes and tattoos to hunt for his wife's murderer. Nolan developed a screenplay that told the story in reverse; Aaron Ryder, an executive for Newmarket Films, said it was [...] "perhaps the most innovative script I had ever seen". The film was optioned and given a budget of $4.5 million. Memento, starring Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss, premiered in September 2000 at the Venice International Film Festival to critical acclaim.

Few years ago, an empirical model for semi-conductor and insulator materials with an Ln activator has been developed that not only explains the optical properties of phosphors but helps as well to find hitherto unknown materials with selected photoluminescence (PL), thermoluminescence (TL) or charge carrier trapping properties. Within the model, such properties {{are determined by the}} locations of the 4 f and 5 d energy levels of Ln dopant ions relative to the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB) of the host.
