Although slavery was largely legal {{prior to its}} abolition by the British, torts were common under slavery and in one sliver of history, the years of historic rupture, 1794 - 1839, when the local élite defied first French and then English law, generated systemic unlawful activity. Most types of legal <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> <b>for</b> slavery face formidable difficulties and pursuing reparations supported by broad legal arguments {{may be a more}} viable route. Slavery may be argued to have been an illegitimate endeavour per se. Whilst sympathetic to that argument, we do not pursue it but rather seek to demonstrate that the ‘legal at the time’ argument against reparations contains significant lacunae even within its restricted terms. We also show that French constitutional law offers possibilities in the form of rights that are not time-limited...|$|R
50|$|The principal, or dominus, {{more fully}} dominus negotiorum dominus rei gestae, {{is bound to}} {{indemnify}} the gestor for the expenses and liabilities incurred.

50|$|Historically, the indebitatus counts only afforded a {{personal}} remedy. Hence where the claimant's action {{would have been}} brought as an action for money had and received, for money paid, or as a quantum meruit or quantum valebat, the claimant is only entitled to a money award. In short, an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> of unjust enrichment only generates {{a personal}} liability: the claimant has no proprietary interest in any specific asset of the defendant.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, {{a husband}} could sell or {{mortgage}} the family home, {{without the consent}} or even knowledge of his wife.

50|$|After Blagge's death, Dorothy married Richard Goodrich (also Goodricke) of Bolingbroke, {{formerly}} {{three times}} MP for Great Grimsby. Goodrich was a staunch Protestant and an eminent Gray's Inn lawyer, active in drafting ecclesiastical reforms under Edward VI, {{and he had}} taken part with Blagge in proceedings against Bishop Gardiner. He had been married to Mary Blagge or Blage or Blake but had obtained a divorce and separation from her. During the reign of Mary, in a case she took <b>action</b> <b>for</b> the <b>restitution</b> of her conjugal rights and dowry, the latter case being heard by Gardiner in the Court of Chancery. Dorothy had two further children with Goodrich: Richard and Elizabeth. He died in 1562.|$|R

The [...] South fight for independence; but what do the North fight for, [...] except to gratify passion or pride?”—Letters, p. 395, etc. See [...] also preface to his Administration of Great Britain (p. xix), [...] where he says, in 1856, he sees no solution but separation.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia {{the legal}} <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> of {{conjugal}} rights was abolished by the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 8(2). Therefore, since 1975 courts {{no longer have}} the power to make a [...] "decree of restitution of conjugal rights" [...] to enforce marital duties. One problematic provision today is considered to be Section 114(2) of the Family Law Act 1975, which remains on the books, and provides that a court can [...] "make an order relieving a party to a marriage from any obligation to perform marital services or render conjugal rights". Although this section is now obsolete (its last recorded use was in 1978; [...] and the 1991 High Court of Australia case of R v L (1991) 174 CLR 379, 398 criminalized marital rape (ruling that if the common law exemption was ever part of Australian law it no longer was by 1991), the existence of such wording in the Family Law Act 1975 is argued to send problematic messages to the public; and in a 2010 report the Australian Law Reform Commission strongly recommended its abolition, writing that [...] "Section 114(2) implies that there is a continuing obligation to render conjugal rights and provide marital services—obligations that no longer exist in law and which should not be assumed to form part of a marriage as a social or legal institution" [...] and [...] "The Commissions therefore consider that the power to make an order relieving a party to a marriage from any obligation to perform marital services or render conjugal rights is unnecessary and inconsistent with current principles of family and criminal law, and, as such, should be repealed." [...] (see section on Injunctions to relieve a party to a marriage from rendering conjugal rights). Despite this, this provision still remains on the books.|$|E
5000|$|Since Tinsley, {{the courts}} have been more willing to examine the {{intention}} of the parties rather than relying on the strict maxim that [...] "he who comes to equity must come with clean hands". The standard law on this was set out by Millett LJ in Tribe v Tribe: [...] (1) Title to property passes both at law and in equity even if the transfer is made for an illegal purpose. The fact that title has passed to the transferee does not preclude the transferor from bringing an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>restitution.</b> (2) The transferor's action will fail if it would be illegal for him to retain any interest in the property (3) Subject to (2) the transferor can recover the property if he can do so without relying on the illegal purpose. This will normally be the case where the property was transferred without consideration in circumstances where the transferor can rely on an express declaration of trust or as a resulting trust in his favour. (4) It will almost invariably be so where the illegal purpose has not been carried out. It may be otherwise where the illegal purpose has been carried out and the transferee can rely on the transferor's conduct as inconsistent with his retention of a beneficial interest. (5) The transferor can lead evidence of the illegal purpose whenever it is necessary for him to do so provided that he has withdrawn from the transaction before the illegal purpose has been wholly or partly carried into effect. It will be necessary for him to do so (i) if he brings an action at law or (ii) if he brings proceedings in equity and needs to rebut the presumption of advancement. (6) The only way in which a man can protect his property from his creditors is by divesting himself of all beneficial interest in it. Evidence that he transferred the property in order to protect it from his creditors, therefore, does nothing by itself to rebut the presumption of advancement; it reinforces it. To rebut the presumption it is necessary to show that he intended to retain a beneficial interest and conceal it from his creditors. (7) The court should not conclude that this was his intention without compelling circumstantial evidence to this effect. The identity of the transferee and the circumstances in which the transfer was made would be highly relevant. It is unlikely that the court would reach such a conclusion where the transfer was made {{in the absence of an}} imminent and perceived threat from known creditors. As seen in Tribe v Tribe, a common form of illegality is where the transferor is worried about bankruptcy or insolvency, and transfers the property to avoid having to pay his creditors. Section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986 empowers to the courts to reverse any transfer which removes assets from creditors with the intention to avoid their claims. These creditors do not have to be creditors at the time of the transfer; it is enough that they be creditors after the transfer or sale, as in Midland Bank v Wyatt.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada, {{family law}} has varied {{significantly}} (and still varies today) by province/territory. Canadian family regulations {{have traditionally been}} based on concepts existing in English common law (except in Quebec, where the principal source of inspiration has been French law). As such, restitution of conjugal rights {{has been a part}} of law in most, but not all, provinces. In Canada, it was only in the second part of the 20th century that a standardization of family law has been started. For example, until 1968, there was no uniform federal divorce law in Canada. Although the Divorce Act (Canada) is a federal Act that governs divorce in Canada, applying to all the country, many other issues regarding family law are left to province/territory. The legal action of restitution of conjugal rights was abolished in British Columbia by the Family Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 121, s. 75; in Manitoba by the Equality of Status Act, R.S.M. 1987, c. E140, s. l(2); in Newfoundland and Labrador by the Family Law Act, S. Nfld. 1988, c. 60, s. 76.3, as am. by S. Nfld. 1989, c. 11, s. 2. Not all provinces in Canada had adopted this concept, according to a 1993 report by the Alberta Law Reform Institute, the concept of restitution of conjugal rights has never been a true part of the law of Ontario, which is Canada's most populous province: the report stated that [...] "In Ontario, <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> of conjugal rights have never been entertained". While in many Canadian provinces the family law has been overhauled and modernized in the 1970s and 1980s, in others, such as Alberta, this only happened in the 21st century: the legal action of restitution of conjugal rights was abolished by the Family Law Act (Alberta) which came into force in 2005 (see section 103). The concept of restitution of conjugal rights has never been as harsh in Alberta as it has been in England; indeed, according to the 1993 report, unlike in England, [...] "Neither excommunication nor imprisonment has applied in Alberta"; in fact by 1993, the refusal of a spouse to comply with a decree of restitution of conjugal rights only served as giving the other spouse a ground for judicial separation. In Saskatchewan, the concept of restitution of conjugal rights was effectively abolished by The Family Maintenance Act, SS 1990-91, c F-6.1, through its repeal of the section on restitution of conjugal rights relating to judicial separation (which was defined in the The Queen’s Bench Act). In Nova Scotia, the 2012 Matrimonial Statutes Repeal Act (An Act to Repeal Out-dated Matrimonial Statutes) repealed six pieces of legislation related to family law, which were considered obsolete, including the Alimony Act, which made reference to restitution of conjugal rights. Also in New Brunswick, the 2008 An Act to Repeal the Divorce Court Act repealed legislation which made reference to restitution of conjugal rights. Although family law in Canada varies by province/territory, the criminal law of Canada is under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the federal government and is the same throughout Canada. Under the criminal law, marital rape was made illegal in 1983.|$|R

40|$|Does {{and should}} a wrongdoer’s {{liability}} insurance cover an aggrieved party’s claim <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> (e. g., {{a claim for}} the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains) ? This article answers those questions. It does so by first answering {{the question of whether}} claims <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> are covered under the terms of liability insurance policies. Then, after concluding that they are, it addresses the question of whether claims <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> should be insurable as a matter of public policy and insurance law theory. There are long-standing legal and equitable principles that, on the one hand, dictate that a wrongdoer {{should not be allowed to}} benefit from its wrongdoing, which the wrongdoer would if insurance were allowed to cover claims <b>for</b> <b>restitution.</b> On the other hand, there are competing public policies that favor enforcing contracts and compensating innocent victims. If a claim <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> is covered by the terms of an insurance policy, but such claims are viewed as uninsurable as a matter of public policy, then policyholders would have paid millions of dollars in premiums for policies that provide illusory coverage and thousands of innocent victims with billions of dollars of claims would not receive compensation. In analyzing these issues, this article does so by using two common examples where the insurability of claims <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> are regularly implicated—intellectual property infringement claims under Commercial General Liability insurance policies (CGL policies) and shareholder fraud claims under Directors and Officers liability insurance policies (D 2 ̆ 6 O policies) ...|$|R
