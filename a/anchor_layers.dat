The main goal of presented studies was to obtain polymer/nanoparticles films with controlled electroactive properties.

40|$|A {{label-free}} electrochemical biosensor {{for detecting}} DNA hybridisation {{was developed by}} monitoring {{the change in the}} voltammetric activity of ferrocenecarboxylic acid at the biosensor-solution interface. The biosensor was constructed by initially immobilising on a glassy carbon electrode an <b>anchoring</b> <b>layer</b> consisting of chitosan, carboxyl group functionalised carbon nanofibres and glutaraldehye. Chitosan acted as an adhering agent and carbon nanofibres were strategically used to provide a large surface area with binding points for DNA immobilisation, while glutaraldehye was a linker for DNA probes on the electrode surface. Based on a two-factorial design, cyclic voltammetry of [Fe(CN) 6] 3 -/ 4 - was performed to optimise the composition of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>layer.</b> Next, a 17 -base pair DNA probe was attached to the <b>anchoring</b> <b>layer,</b> followed by its complementary target. Zr(IV) ion, known to exhibit affinity for oxygen-containing electroactive markers, for example, ferrocenecarboxylic acid, was then coordinated in the DNA duplex. In this way, ferrocenecarboxylic acid was attracted towards the biosensor for oxidation. A change in the voltammetric oxidation current of ferrocenecarboxylic acid pre- and post-hybridisation was used to provide an indication of hybridisation. A linear dynamic range between 0. 5 and 40 nM and a detection limit of 88 pM of DNA target were then achieved. In addition, the biosensor exhibited good selectivity, repeatability and stability for the determination of DNA sequences. 10 page(s...|$|R

We use glycerol as an <b>anchor</b> <b>layer</b> between the NFC-G layer and glass substrate since the NFC-G solution cannot be coated directly onto a pure plasma-activated glass substrate. A glycerol <b>anchor</b> <b>layer</b> provides good adhesion and reproducible results that allows a systematic study of the interaction between PEDOT:PSS and NFC-G coating. The electrical properties are studied {{as a function of the}} annealing temperature, the spin coating and drop casting of NFC, and the coating time intervals during film deposition. The effect of glycerol as a plasticizer on film formation and the resulting conductivity is discussed as well. PEDOT:PSS on NFC can be used to produce humidity or amine sensors, which can find applications in food packaging industry. These films can also be utilized in solar cell applications due to their tunable optical properties.|$|R

30|$|The spin-coated NFC-G layer serves two {{purposes}} {{as shown}} in Fig.  1 : first, the PEDOT:PSS can be directly spin coated on top of it, and secondly, {{it serves as a}} rigid underlayer in which the drop cast NFC-G coating adheres preventing withdrawal from the edge during drying. We wish to emphasize that NFC or NFC-G did neither adhere to the plain glass slide surface nor did it form a clean, uniform coating on the oxygen plasma-treated glass surface. However, addition of a 5.0  wt% glycerol coating as an <b>anchor</b> <b>layer</b> after the oxygen plasma surface treatment step resulted in good-quality spin-coated NFC-G films. The adhesion of the glycerol <b>anchor</b> <b>layer</b> was better on the oxygen plasma-coated surfaces than on an untreated plain glass. The glycerol coating has several advantages as it is colorless and semitransparent making it suitable for transmission measurements. It is also a plasticizer and a humectant for the NFC films to avoid brittleness and a well-known secondary dopant that can increase the overall electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS by 2 to 3  orders of magnitude.|$|R

The electrodeposited TiO 2 films were more compact structure near the FTO surface (inner layer), and became less compact further away from the surface (outer layer). The outer layer of film deposited at 10 μA cm− 2 was composed of granular nanoparticles and that of film deposited at 5 μA cm− 2 was composed of short nanorods. The inner compact layer could act as a blocking layer to suppress the charge recombination. The outer loose layer could provide an <b>anchoring</b> <b>layer</b> for a better electrical contact between FTO and thick TiO 2 layer. The photoelectron conversion efficiency (η) of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) using TiO 2 -coated FTO deposited at 10 μA cm− 2 was 6. 9 %, which is {{higher than that of}} DSC using bare FTO (6. 5 %).
