40|$|Testing for {{the random}} walk hypothesis, which asserts that a series is a non-stationary process or a unit root process, {{in the case}} of visitor <b>arrivals</b> has {{important}} implications for policy. If, for instance, visitor <b>arrivals</b> are characterized by a unit root, then it implies that shocks to visitor <b>arrivals</b> are permanent. However, if visitor <b>arrivals</b> are without a unit root, this implies that shocks to visitor <b>arrivals</b> are temporary. This study provides evidence on the random walk hypothesis for visitor <b>arrivals</b> to India using the recently developed Im et al. (2003) and Maddala and Wu (1999) panel unit root tests.
