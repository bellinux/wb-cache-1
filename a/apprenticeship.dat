5|$|Blackburn {{obtained}} {{his early}} {{education in the}} local public schools. At age sixteen, he began a medical <b>apprenticeship</b> under his uncle, physician Churchill Blackburn. During his <b>apprenticeship,</b> he aided his uncle in treating victims of cholera outbreaks in Lexington and Paris. He later matriculated to Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, where he earned a medical degree in March 1835. After graduation, he opened a medical practice in Lexington and was instrumental in combating a cholera epidemic in nearby Versailles. He accepted no payment for his services during the epidemic.|$|E

5|$|Lilly became {{interested}} in chemicals as a teen. In 1854, while {{on a trip to}} visit his aunt and uncle in Lafayette, Indiana, the sixteen-year-old Lilly visited Henry Lawrence's Good Samaritan Drug Store, a local apothecary shop, where he watched Lawrence prepare pharmaceutical drugs. Lilly completed a four-year <b>apprenticeship</b> with Lawrence to become a chemist and pharmacist. In addition to learning to mix chemicals, Lawrence taught Lilly how to manage funds and operate a business. In 1858, after earning a certificate of proficiency from his <b>apprenticeship,</b> Lilly left the Good Samaritan to work for Israel Spencer and Sons, a wholesale and retail druggist in Lafayette, before moving to Indianapolis to take a position at the Perkins and Coons Pharmacy.|$|E
30|$|Standard <b>apprenticeships</b> {{and youth}} <b>apprenticeships</b> offer in-depth, work-based {{learning}} combined with related course work. Though youth <b>apprenticeships</b> constitute the most intensive form of career-focused education and training, youth <b>apprenticeships</b> and other (including registered) <b>apprenticeships</b> {{have been the}} least studied major intervention. Despite the widespread, long-term use of <b>apprenticeships</b> in some countries and their resurgence in others, few rigorous studies have examined how entering and completing <b>apprenticeships</b> in the United States affects the education, job skills, non-academic skills, and job market outcomes of young people.|$|R

5|$|Matthew Deady {{spent the}} next four years working for his father on the family farm, engaged in manual labor, while also reading {{extensively}} in his spare time. On February 17, 1841, he left home after a disagreement with his father and moved to Barnesville, Ohio. For four years he lived with the family of John Kelly, working as a blacksmith’s apprentice. Beginning in 1843, Deady attended Barnesville Academy, continuing his education there until four months beyond the time that his blacksmith <b>apprenticeship</b> ended. The <b>apprenticeship</b> had paid {{for the first six months}} of school. At the school he earned a certificate that allowed him to become a teacher on July 7, 1845, from his instructor Nathan R.

50|$|<b>Apprenticeships</b> come in four levels: Intermediate (level 2), Advanced (level 3), Higher (level 4 - 7) and Degree (level 6 - 7). Intermediate <b>apprenticeships</b> are {{equivalent}} to 5 GCSEs at A* - C, Advanced to 2 A-levels, Higher to a foundation degree or above, and Degree <b>apprenticeships</b> to a bachelor's or master's degree.|$|R
50|$|Vocational {{education}} {{is provided in}} Further Education Colleges and through <b>apprenticeships.</b> Due to the growing surplus of university graduates in many fields of study, along with that of lower level apprentices, higher level <b>apprenticeships</b> are seen as providing the lowest risk of unemployment or underemployment. Skills Development Scotland has introduced Graduate Level <b>Apprenticeships</b> {{in order to promote}} this option.|$|R

5|$|Allardyce {{spent his}} youth with semi-professional side Dudley Town, making his debut {{at the age}} of 14 he quickly learned how to play centre-half in the highly {{physical}} West Midlands (Regional) League. He trained with local Football League clubs West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers, and had an unsuccessful trial with Aston Villa. He was spotted by Bolton Wanderers just before leaving school {{at the age of}} 15, and signed an <b>apprenticeship</b> with the club. To supplement his income before officially starting his <b>apprenticeship</b> he worked in a factory producing record decks. The Bolton under-18s were very successful, winning the Lancashire Youth Cup and reaching the quarter-finals of the FA Youth Cup, and Allardyce quickly rose through the B-team into the A-team. He signed his first professional contract on his 17th birthday, receiving a £125 signing on fee and wages of £14 a week.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 19 Henriette Kleine married surgeon Friedrich Wilhelm Stümpe. Henriette became widowed {{at the age of}} 26, {{with her}} three {{children}} to Stümpe dying as infants.

25|$|A {{study in}} 2014 found that {{unemployment}} rates among former apprentices {{one year after}} completing their <b>apprenticeships</b> were one-third those of university graduates one year after finishing their degrees. A 2015 study by the Sutton Trust found that, while average net lifetime earnings {{for those who had}} completed level 5 <b>apprenticeships</b> were higher than those for graduates from non-Russell Group universities, most <b>apprenticeships</b> offered were at levels 2 and 3, providing little improvement over earnings from secondary school qualifications. The report also found that <b>apprenticeships</b> had a lower perceived value compared to degrees in Britain than in many other countries.|$|R

5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his <b>apprenticeship</b> he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually {{realize that there is}} a price to be paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his <b>apprenticeship</b> with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E
5|$|Graf {{finished}} his Volksschule (primary school) in 1926 {{at the age}} of thirteen. Without the means to fund a higher education, Graf applied for an <b>apprenticeship.</b> For the next three years, he worked as a locksmith's apprentice at a local factory. A locksmith had a low income, so when offered work as an apprentice clerk, he gladly accepted a change in career.|$|E
5|$|His biographer, Brian Little, {{suggests}} that {{this might have been}} a way for the newcomers to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little also {{suggests that}} it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his <b>apprenticeship</b> in November 1704.|$|E
50|$|From 1601, 'parish' <b>apprenticeships</b> {{under the}} Elizabethan Poor Law {{came to be}} used as a way of {{providing}} for poor, illegitimate and orphaned children of both sexes alongside the regular system of skilled <b>apprenticeships,</b> which tended to provide for boys from slightly more affluent backgrounds. These parish <b>apprenticeships,</b> which could be created with the assent of two Justices of the Peace, supplied apprentices for occupations of lower status such as farm labouring, brickmaking and menial household service.|$|R
40|$|Among those {{enrolled}} in <b>apprenticeships</b> and traineeships, Indigenous {{students are more}} likely to be participating in courses of study leading to lower qualifications, according to this report. Summary What we know 	Indigenous Australians, particularly females, are more likely than the rest of the population to participate in <b>apprenticeships</b> and traineeships, mostly due to the relatively younger demographic structure of the Indigenous population (as <b>apprenticeships</b> are typically undertaken during youth). 	Among those {{enrolled in}} <b>apprenticeships</b> and traineeships, Indigenous {{students are more likely}} to be participating in courses of study leading to lower qualifications (Certificate I and II). 	For both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, the key determinant of field of study is gender: males are much more likely to be participating in <b>apprenticeships</b> and traineeships that will result in them becoming tradespersons or related workers, and females are more likely to be working towards an occupation as an Intermediate Clerical, Sales and Service Worker. 	Indigenous Australians are less likely to be employed across all age groups. 	<b>Apprenticeships</b> are commonly seen as a useful tool for ‘Closing the Gap’. 	Not all apprentices and trainees are employed, but they have a much higher rate of employment compared with other students (52. 1...|$|R

5|$|It {{is likely}} that much of Morris's {{preference}} for medieval textiles was formed– or crystallised– during his brief <b>apprenticeship</b> with G. E. Street. Street had co-written a book on Ecclesiastical Embroidery in 1848, and was a staunch advocate of abandoning faddish woolen work on canvas in favour of more expressive embroidery techniques based on Opus Anglicanum, a surface embroidery technique popular in medieval England.|$|E

30|$|Little {{empirical}} evidence can be cited {{in support of}} the theory that <b>apprenticeships</b> are being edged out by skilled workers with higher levels of school-based or vocational qualification. Although enterprises reduced their number of <b>apprenticeships</b> on offer when they hired specialist salaried employees with a degree from a university of applied sciences or part-time employees who had earned qualification to enrol in a university or a university of applied sciences, hiring full-time and part-time employees with a scientific degree had a positive effect on the change in the number of the <b>apprenticeships</b> offered by the enterprises examined in this analyse. Positive changes in the number of <b>apprenticeships</b> on offer could also be seen for positions that offer career prospects such as master craftsman, technician or management expert (“graduate in business administration”).|$|R
