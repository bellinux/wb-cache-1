40|$|We {{report the}} {{characterization}} of multifunctional rigid-rod [beta]-barrel ion channels with either internal <b>aspartates</b> or arginine–histidine dyads by planar bilayer conductance experiments. Barrels with internal <b>aspartates</b> form cation selective, large, unstable and ohmic barrel-stave (rather than toroidal) pores; addition of magnesium cations nearly deletes cation selectivity and increases single-channel stability. Barrels with internal arginine–histidine dyads form cation selective (P[K+]/P[Cl–]= 2. 1), small and ohmic ion channels with superb stability (single-channel lifetime > 20 seconds). Addition of "protons" results in inversion of anion/cation selectivity (P[Cl–]/P[K+]= 3. 8); addition of an anionic guest (HPTS) results in the blockage of anion selective but not cation selective channels. These results suggest that specific, internal counterion immobilization, here magnesium (but not sodium or potassium) cations by internal <b>aspartates</b> and inorganic phosphates by internal arginines (but not histidines), provides access to synthetic multifunctional pores with attractive properties...|$|R

In the Michaelis complex two calcium ions bind between the C 6 carboxylate of the d-galacturonate residue and enzyme <b>aspartates</b> at the active centre (+ 1 subsite), they withdraw electrons acidifying the C 5 proton facilitating its abstraction by the catalytic arginine.

The potential of mean force profile was used to assign the protonation state of the two catalytic <b>aspartates</b> in PM IV–KNI- 764 complex. The results indicate that protonation of the 214 residue is more favorable.

In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and <b>aspartate</b> transaminase.|$|E
5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (<b>aspartate</b> or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common <b>aspartate</b> or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E
40|$|Reverse transcriptases (RTs) {{are found}} {{in a wide variety}} of mobile genetic {{elements}} including viruses, retrotransposons, and infectious organellar introns. An invariant triad of <b>aspartates</b> is thought to be required for the catalytic function of RTs. We generated RT mutants in the yeast retrotransposon Ty 1, changing each of these active-site <b>aspartates</b> to asparagine or glutamate. All but one of the mutants lacked detectable polymerase activity. The novel exception, D 211 N, retained near wild-type in vitro polymerase activity within virus-like particles but failed to carry out in vivo transposition. For this mutant, minus-strand synthesis is impaired and formation of the plus-strand strong-stop intermediate is eliminated. Intragenic second-site suppressor mutations of the transposition defect map to the RNase H domain of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that one of the three active-site <b>aspartates</b> in a retrotransposon RT is not catalytically critical. This implies a basic difference in the polymerase active-site geometry of Ty 1 and human immunodeficiency virus RT and shows that subtle mutations in one domain can cause dramatic functional effects on a distant domain of the same enzyme...|$|R

5|$|The triad of {{cytomegalovirus}} protease uses histidine as {{both the}} acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to >10,000-fold when <b>aspartate</b> is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.|$|E
5|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{and plants}} can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain {{some of the}} amino acids from the diet. The amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own {{are referred to as}} essential amino acids. Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase, which catalyses {{the first step in the}} synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from <b>aspartate.</b> If amino acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.|$|E
5|$|Nucleotides {{are made}} from amino acids, carbon dioxide and formic acid in {{pathways}} that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides. Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose). Both adenine and guanine {{are made from}} the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Pyrimidines, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base orotate, which is formed from glutamine and <b>aspartate.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Charge {{interactions}} between histidines on the kappa-casein and glutamates and <b>aspartates</b> of chymosin initiate enzyme binding to the substrate.

40|$|The transmembrane {{domains of}} HERG (S 1 –S 3) contain six {{negative}} charges: three are conserved in all voltage-gated K channels (D 456 and D 466 in S 2, D 501 in S 3) and three {{are unique to}} the EAG family (D 411 in S 1, D 460 in S 2, and D 509 in S 3). We infer the functional role of these <b>aspartates</b> by studying how substituting them with cysteine, one at a time, affects the channel function. D 456 C is not functional, suggesting that this negative charge may {{play a critical role}} in channel protein folding during biogenesis, as has been shown for its counterpart in the Shaker channel. Data from the other five functional mutants suggest that D 411 can stabilize the HERG channel in the closed state, while D 460 and D 509 have the opposite effect. D 466 and D 501 both may contribute to voltage-sensing during the activation process. On the other hand, all five <b>aspartates</b> work in a concerted fashion in contributing to the slow deactivation process of the HERG channel. Accessibility tests of the introduced thiol groups to extracellular MTS reagents indicate that water-filled crevices penetrate deep into the HERG protein core, reaching the cytoplasmic halves of S 1 and S 2. At these deep locations, accessibility of 411 C and 466 C to the extracellular aqueous phase is voltage dependent, suggesting that conformational changes occur in S 1 and S 2 or the surrounding crevices during gating. Increasing extracellular [H+] accelerates HERG deactivation. This effect is suppressed by substituting the <b>aspartates</b> with cysteine, suggesting that protonation of these <b>aspartates</b> may contribute to the signaling pathway whereby external [H+] influences conformational changes in the channel's cytoplasmic domains (where deactivation takes place). There is no evidence for a metal ion binding site coordinated by negative charges in the transmembrane domains of HERG, as the one described for the EAG channel...|$|R
5|$|The {{generation}} of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH {{relies on the}} malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD+. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to <b>aspartate</b> for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.|$|E
5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion. Oxaloacetate {{can then be}} consumed by citrate synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or <b>aspartate</b> aminotransferase, feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate {{as well as the}} concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E
5|$|The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The <b>aspartate</b> is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the pKa of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH− attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E

50|$|The enzymes {{threonine}} deaminase, dihydroxy acid dehydrase and transaminase {{are controlled}} by end-product regulation. I.e. the presence of isoleucine will downregulate the formation of all three enzymes, resulting in the downregulation of threonine biosynthesis. High concentrations of isoleucine also result in the downregulation of <b>aspartate’s</b> conversion into the aspartyl-phosphate intermediate, hence halting further biosynthesis of lysine, methionine, threonine, and isoleucine.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSynaptotagmin is a {{synaptic}} vesicle {{protein that}} has been proposed to be the calcium sensor responsible for fast neurotransmitter release at synapses. Synaptotagmin's two C 2 domains, C 2 A and C 2 B, each provide a calcium binding pocket lined with negative charges contributed by five conserved <b>aspartates.</b> We find that even when all of C 2 A's conserved <b>aspartates</b> are neutralized by replacement with asparagines, neurotransmitter release still occurs at hippocampal synapses in culture. Because exocytosis continues {{to be dependent on}} extracellular calcium concentration, the C 2 A domain cannot represent the entire calcium sensor. C 2 A does appear {{to be part of the}} calcium sensor, however, because substitution of D 232 alters the calcium dependence of release, perhaps by reducing the number of calcium ions that must bind to trigger exocytosis. We conclude that neutralization of the negative charge at D 232 by coordination of a calcium ion is necessary—but not sufficient—for fast neurotransmission at mammalian CNS synapses...|$|R
5|$|During winter, {{asparagine}} is metabolised immediately, {{but other}} nutrients, especially phosphates and glutamine, {{are removed from}} the xylem sap and stored in mature stem, bark and leaf tissues for release back into the xylem just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also {{the time when the}} oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When glutamine eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise protein and non-amide amino acids such as <b>aspartate,</b> threonine, serine, glutamate, glycine, alanine and cystine. Together with sucrose and other solutes, these are then circulated in the phloem. The phloem sap of B.prionotes is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium cations, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate anions. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining turgor pressure; that is, with so little potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, B.prionotes is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain turgor.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and <b>aspartate,</b> while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine. There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.|$|E
25|$|Histidine-specific protein kinases are {{structurally}} {{distinct from}} other protein kinases and {{are found in}} prokaryotes, fungi, and plants {{as part of a}} two-component signal transduction mechanism: a phosphate group from ATP is first added to a histidine residue within the kinase, then transferred to an <b>aspartate</b> residue on a receiver domain on a different protein or the kinase itself, thus activating the <b>aspartate</b> residue.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of the first steps of the reaction catalyzed by HIV- 1 protease was studied through molecular dynamics simulations. The potential energy surface in the active site was generated using the approximate valence bond method. The approximate valence bond (AVB) method was parameterized based on density functional calculations. The surrounding protein and explicit water environment was modeled with conventional, classical force field. The calculations were performed based on HIV- 1 protease complexed with the MVT- 101 inhibitor that was modified to a model substrate. The protonation state of the catalytic <b>aspartates</b> was determined theoretically. Possible reaction mechanisms involving the lytic water molecule are accounted for in this study. The modeled steps include the dissociation of the lytic water molecule and proton transfer onto Asp- 125, the nucleophilic attack followed by a proton transfer onto peptide nitrogen. The simulations show that in the active site most preferable energetically are structures consisting of ionized or polarized molecular fragments that are not accounted for in conventional molecular dynamics.
