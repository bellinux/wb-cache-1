40|$|DE 102006023768 A 1 UPAB: 20080111 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{providing an}} even substrate surface, and applying a sacrificial layer on the substrate surface, where a material layer (3) is applied on the sacrificial layer. Another sacrificial layer is applied {{in a local}} area of the material layer. Another material layer (4) and the latter sacrificial layer are applied on the former material layer, and the sacrificial layers are removed. A base body and <b>a</b> <b>gripping</b> <b>body</b> are manufactured by a material separating procedure under formation of the material layers that are connected with one another. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a micro gripper with a base body. USE - Used for manufacturing a micro gripper for accommodating, transporting and holding material samples {{in the context of}} investigation in a transmission electronic microscope (claimed) or scanning electronic microscope, where the gripper is used in the micro and nano-technology for manipulation and assembly or joining of small objects and in physics, biology, chemistry and medical applications. ADVANTAGE - The method allows simultaneous manufacturing of a set of micro grippers on surface substrates, so that the manufacturing cost is reduced. The method allows to easily change the design of the micro gripper with high manufacturing accuracy...|$|E

An electrostatic gripping device suitable therefor, comprising <b>a</b> <b>gripping</b> element (1, 11) having an electrode pair and means for generating a potential difference between the electrodes of the electrode pair, is characterized by means for lowering the absolute value, between the electrodes, of the potential difference and for changing the sign of the potential difference...|$|R

40|$|Primates {{are known}} for their use of the hand in many {{activities}} including food grasping. Yet, most studies concentrate on the type of grip used. Moreover, kinematic studies remain limited to a few investigations of the distal elements in constrained conditions in humans and macaques. In order to improve our understanding of the prehension movement in primates, we analyse here the behavioural strategies (e. g., types of <b>grip,</b> <b>body</b> postures) as well as the 3 D kinematics of the whole forelimb and the trunk during the prehension of small static food items in five primate species in unconstrained conditions. All species preferred the quadrupedal posture except lemurs, which used a typical crouched posture. Grasp type differed among species, with smaller animals (capuchins and lemurs) using <b>a</b> whole-hand <b>grip</b> and larger animals (humans, gorillas, chimpanzees) using predominantly <b>a</b> precision <b>grip.</b> Larger animals had lower relative wrist velocities and spent a larger proportion of the movement decelerating. Humans grasped food items with planar motions involving small joint rotations, more similar to the smaller animals than to gorillas and chimpanzees, which used greater rotations of both the shoulder and forearm. In conclusion, the features characterising human food prehension are present in other primates, yet differences exist in joint motions. These results provide a good basis to suggest hypotheses concerning the factors involved in driving the evolution of grasping abilities in primates...|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>grip</b> {{safety is}} <b>a</b> lever or other device {{situated}} on the <b>grip</b> of <b>a</b> firearm which must be actuated by the operator's hand, as a natural consequence of holding the firearm in a firing position, {{in order for the}} firearm to fire. It is usually similar to a manual safety in its function, but is momentary; the safety is deactivated only while the shooter maintains their hold on the grip, and is reactivated immediately once the shooter releases it. The M1911 design is a popular example of a handgun with <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> safety. The Uzi submachine gun is another example of a firearm with <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> safety.|$|R
