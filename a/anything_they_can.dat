25|$|Lick fit is {{the frantic}} licking to which Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs can be prone. This has been {{reported}} in 17% of the breed. When {{in the middle of a}} lick fit, the dog will lick <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> — carpet, floors, walls — and will eat <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find, including grass, leaves, dirt, carpet, and will gulp air and swallow constantly. Their actions make it obvious they are in severe gastrointestinal discomfort. Many owners are able to prevent lick fits by ensuring the dog never has an empty stomach by frequent, smaller meals and large dog biscuits as between meal snacks.|$|E
25|$|Brachypelma vagans is {{a species}} of {{tarantula}} known commonly as the Mexican red rump or Mexican black velvet. It ranges predominantly in Mexico (including the Yucatán Peninsula), but {{is also found in}} Central America. They are terrestrial, burrowing spiders. The reason for the name red rump is because of its distinctive red hairs on its abdomen. Like most tarantulas, they will eat <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> overpower, which is usually insects, but small lizards and rodents may also be consumed. They can grow up to a solid 6.5inch leg span, with males typically being smaller and thinner than the females. They prefer scrubland habitats.|$|E
25|$|Dysdera {{are unable}} to produce webs for shelter causing them {{to be limited to}} the ground and natural shelters. Dysdera inhabit hot humid forest, or {{potentially}} any shelter on and close to the ground. They search for objects to hide under not only because they are ground dwellers but due to the moist earth's footing and keeping the spider warm. Dysdera shelter under objects like gravel with organic material covering it, stones, bark, also sometimes found in suburban gardens, anything to keep them protected from predators during the day. Dysdera unguimannis is considered the most remarkable case of troglomorphism (adaptation to cave life) in the Dysdera genus. They shelter under or in <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find but, only during the day due to strictly hunting prey at night.|$|E

25|$|Each one has {{at least}} ten or twelve horses, and they have them so well-trained that they follow them {{wherever}} {{they want to take}} them, and they mount first on one and then on another. When they are on a raid, each horse has a bag hung on his nose, in which his fodder is put, and he feeds as he follows his master, and they do not stop going by night or by day. And they ride so hard that they cover in one day and one night fully six days' journey or seven or eight. And while they are on the way they will not seize anything or carry it along, before their return, but when they are returning, then they seize plunder and make captives and take <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get. Nor do they go armed, except that they wear a garment of sheepskin and carry bows and arrows.|$|E
25|$|Primarily aquatic, {{they eat}} {{a wide variety}} of prey, almost <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> manage to overpower, {{including}} fish, birds, a variety of mammals, and other reptiles. Particularly large anacondas may consume large prey such as tapirs, deer, capybaras, caimans, and even jaguars, but such large meals are not regularly consumed. The green anaconda's eyes and nose are located {{on the top of the}} head, allowing the snake to breathe and watch for prey while the vast majority of the body is hidden underwater. Many local stories and legends report the anaconda as a man-eater, but little evidence supports any such activity. They employ constriction to subdue their prey. Cannibalism among green anacondas is also known, most recorded cases involving a larger female consuming a smaller male. While the exact reason for this is not understood, scientists cite several possibilities, including the dramatic sexual dimorphism in the species, and the possibility that a female anaconda requires additional food intake after breeding to sustain the long period of gestation. The nearby male simply provides the opportunistic female a ready source of nutrition.|$|E
500|$|Rainbow trout are predators with {{a varied}} diet and will eat nearly <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> capture. They {{are not as}} piscivorous or {{aggressive}} as brown trout or chars. Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on larval, pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies and aquatic diptera). [...] They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include small fish up to one-third of their length, crayfish, shrimp, and other crustaceans. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. Some lake-dwelling forms may become planktonic feeders. In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species, rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs, including those of salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish and the eggs of other rainbow trout. Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from carcasses of other fish. [...] Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish, squid and amphipods.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} require the players to employ more tactical approaches to maps, in their introduction of such units as the Flare Gun, a vehicle that could reveal parts of the map hidden by fog of war, and the commanding officers, who have had their [...] "CO Powers" [...] reduced in importance from the previous titles. However, the developers added that {{one does not have}} to be a [...] "master strategist" [...] to play the game, commenting that the Flare Gun could be used by a casual gamer to quickly move across a map covered in fog of war, while a more advanced player may use it for more strategic means. This unit was added as a means to speed up stages with fog of war. Other new units include the Bike, which was a means of achieving a faster tempo to the game. When asked why the Duster, a modification of a crop duster, was added in favor of the stealth jet from Advance Wars: Dual Strike, the developers commented that the Duster was an inexpensive aerial unit that was not only easy-to-use, but could attack ground units as well. The unit was also added to be a throwback to an older era, as well as demonstrating how people in this world use <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> as a means of survival.|$|E
500|$|Project Chanology was {{formulated}} by {{users of the}} English-speaking imageboards 711chan.org and 4chan, the associated partyvan.info wiki, and several Internet Relay Chat channels, {{all part of a}} group collectively known as Anonymous, on January 16, 2008 after the Church of Scientology issued a copyright violation claim against YouTube for hosting material from the Cruise video. The effort against Scientology has also been referred to by group members as [...] "Operation Chanology". A webpage called [...] "Project Chanology", part of a larger wiki, is maintained by Anonymous and chronicles planned, ongoing and completed actions by project participants. The website includes a list of suggested guerrilla tactics to use against the Church of Scientology. Members use other websites as well to coordinate action, including Encyclopedia Dramatica and the social networking site Facebook, where two groups associated with the movement had 3,500 members as of February 4, 2008. A member of Anonymous told the Los Angeles Times that, as of February 4, 2008, the group consisted of [...] "a loose confederation of about 9,000 people" [...] who post anonymously on the Internet. A security analyst told The Age that the number of people participating anonymously in Project Chanology could number in the thousands: [...] "You can't pin it on a person or a group of people.

500|$|Odontocetes {{are known}} as toothed whales; they have teeth and only one blowhole. They rely on their {{well-developed}} sonar {{to find their way}} in the water. Toothed whales send out ultrasonic clicks using the melon. Sound waves travel through the water. Upon striking an object in the water, the sound waves bounce back at the whale. These vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw, which is then rerouted into the ear-bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted. All toothed whales are opportunistic, meaning they will eat <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> fit in their throat because they are unable to chew. These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but they do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting the force of water pressure. Excluding dolphins and porpoises, odontocetes consist of four families: belugas and narwhals (monodontids), sperm whales (physeterids), dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (kogiids), and beaked whales (ziphiids). There are six species, sometimes referred to as [...] "blackfish", that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).|$|E

500|$|Trying {{to resolve}} Larkin's {{contradictory}} opinions on race {{in his book}} Such Deliberate Disguises: The Art of Philip Larkin, the writer Richard Palmer quotes a letter Larkin wrote to Betjeman, as if it exposes [...] "all the post-Motion and post-Letters furore about Larkin’s 'racism' as the nonsense it is":"The American Negro is trying {{to take a step}} forward that can be compared only to the ending of slavery in the nineteenth century. And despite the dogs, the hosepipes and the burnings, advances have already been made towards giving the Negro his civil rights that would have been inconceivable when Louis Armstrong was a young man. These advances will doubtless continue. They will end only when the Negro is as well-housed, educated and medically cared for as the white man."Reviewing Palmer's book, John G. Rodwan, Jr. proposes that: [...] "a less forgiving reader could counter by asking if this does not qualify as the thought of a “true racist”: 'I find the state of the nation quite terrifying. In 10 years’ time we shall all be cowering under our beds as hordes of blacks steal <b>anything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> lay their hands on.' Or this: 'We don’t go to cricket Test matches now, too many fucking niggers about.'"Despite controversy about his personal life and opinions, Larkin remains one of Britain's most popular poets. In 2003, almost two decades after his death, Larkin was chosen as [...] "the nation's best-loved poet" [...] in a survey by the Poetry Book Society, and in 2008 The Times named Larkin as the greatest British post-war writer. Three of his poems, [...] "This Be The Verse", [...] "The Whitsun Weddings" [...] and [...] "An Arundel Tomb", featured in the Nation's Top 100 Poems as voted for by viewers of the BBC's Bookworm in 1995. Media interest in Larkin has increased in the twenty-first century. Larkin's collection The Whitsun Weddings is one of the available poetry texts in the AQA English Literature A Level syllabus, while High Windows is offered by the OCR board. Buses in Hull displayed extracts from his poems in 2010.|$|E
