HgCl 2. The structure of this compound has been determined and is found to contain discreet <b>mercuric</b> <b>chloride</b> adducts. The bonding between the mercury and the cobalt atoms is best considered as involving a metal- donor metal metal bond, with dicarbonylcyclopentadienyl- -cobalt(I) acting as the Lewis base and <b>mercuric</b> <b>chloride</b> as the Lewis acid. This {{is one of a}} limited number of examples of this type of metal-metal bonding and an investigation was undertaken of the closely related compound (?-C 5 H 5) Co(CO) 2. 3 HgCl 2. This complex was found to contain (?-C 5 H 5) Co(CO) 2 HgCl+ cations, Cl-anions and HgCl 2 molecules. Although no discreet <b>mercuric</b> <b>chloride</b> adducts are present, the cationic species can still be considered as containing a metal-donor Co-Hg bond, and the relative values of bond lengths found in the two dicarbonyl- -cyclopentadienylcobalt complexes are discussed.
