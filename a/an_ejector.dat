5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} {{an homage to}} the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes, the death by full body painting, <b>an</b> <b>ejector</b> seat {{in a car and}} using a tuxedo under a drysuit.|$|E
5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by <b>an</b> <b>ejector</b> pin plate, which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E
50|$|The {{automatic}} {{vacuum brake}} as described represented a considerable technical advance in train braking. In practice steam locomotives had two <b>ejectors,</b> <b>a</b> small <b>ejector</b> for running purposes (to exhaust air that had leaked into the train pipe) and <b>a</b> large <b>ejector</b> to release brake applications. Later Great Western Railway practice {{was to use}} a vacuum pump instead of the small ejector.|$|R

25|$|In {{the fully}} open cruise position, {{together}} with engine nozzle, they formed <b>an</b> <b>ejector</b> nozzle {{to control the}} expansion of the exhaust. The eyelids formed the divergent passage while the engine exhaust ejected or pumped the secondary flow from the intake ramp bleed slot.|$|E
25|$|Evaporators {{consume a}} great deal of steam, and thus fuel, in {{relation}} to the quantity of fresh water produced. Their efficiency is improved by working them at a partial vacuum, supplied by the main engine condensers. On modern diesel-powered ships, this vacuum can instead be produced by <b>an</b> <b>ejector,</b> usually worked by the output from the brine pump. Working under vacuum also reduces the temperature required to boil seawater and thus permits evaporators to be used with lower-temperature waste heat from the diesel cooling system.|$|E
25|$|The first {{designs were}} criticized {{as having a}} slow and {{cumbersome}} firing mechanism. The shells had to be individually loaded and then the drum wound by a clockwork mechanism. Shell ejection was by <b>an</b> <b>ejector</b> rod along the right hand side of the barrel. The last version has the clockwork winding mechanism removed, the ejector rod {{has been replaced by}} an automatic ejection system and in the rod's place is a cocking lever that winds the drum automatically. The Striker design has a twelve-round magazine capacity and short overall length. Compact variants have 7 rounds.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} {{use for the}} injector {{technology is}} in vacuum ejectors in continuous train braking systems, which were made compulsory in the UK by the Regulation of Railways Act 1889. <b>A</b> vacuum <b>ejector</b> uses steam pressure to draw {{air out of the}} vacuum pipe and reservoirs of continuous train brake. Steam locomotives, with a ready source of steam, found ejector technology ideal with its rugged simplicity and lack of moving parts. A steam locomotive usually has two ejectors: <b>a</b> large <b>ejector</b> for releasing the brakes when stationary and <b>a</b> small <b>ejector</b> for maintaining the vacuum against leaks. The small ejector is sometimes replaced by a reciprocating pump driven from the crosshead because this is more economical of steam.|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} to the air brake is the vacuum brake, in which <b>a</b> steam-operated <b>ejector</b> is mounted on the engine instead of the air pump, to create a vacuum and release the brakes. <b>A</b> secondary <b>ejector</b> or crosshead vacuum pump is used to maintain the vacuum in the system against the small leaks in the pipe connections between carriages and wagons. Vacuum systems existed on British, Indian, West Australian and South African railway networks.|$|R
25|$|The {{revolver}} {{featured a}} counter-clockwise rotating cylinder, {{which could be}} opened for loading and ejection by simply pulling back on a catch mounted {{on the left side}} of the frame behind the recoil shield. It was easily manipulated by the thumb of the right hand, and upon release the cylinder could be poked out sideways with the shooter's forefinger. Empty cases were removed by simply pushing back on <b>an</b> <b>ejector</b> rod to activate a star extractor. The six-shooter could then be quickly reloaded and the cylinder clicked back into place.|$|E
25|$|The tip-up was {{the first}} {{revolver}} design for use with metallic cartridges in the Smith & Wesson Model 1, on which the barrel pivoted upwards, hinged on the forward end of the topstrap. On the S & W tip-up revolvers, the barrel release catch is located {{on both sides of}} the frame in front of the trigger. Smith & Wesson discontinued it in the third series of the Smith & Wesson Model 1 1/2 but it was fairly widely used in Europe in the 19th century, after a patent by Spirlet in 1870, which also included <b>an</b> <b>ejector.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through <b>an</b> <b>ejector</b> attached to the condenser.|$|E

25|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 30 May 1939 {{powered by}} two Walter Sagitta I-SR air cooled vee piston engines. The trial flights identified {{problems with the}} cooling of the rear engine and general engine performance. It was proposed to use Rolls-Royce or Daimler-Benz engines in the production aircraft. Concerns were also raised about the pilot clearing the rear propeller {{if he had to}} bail out and <b>an</b> <b>ejector</b> seat was studied. As a provisional solution, rails were put {{on both sides of the}} forward fuselage for the Fokker test pilot, Gerben Sonderman, to use to bail out in an emergency. The aircraft was flown 11 times for a total flight time of less than four hours. The rear fuselage paneling was modified significantly before the last few flights in an attempt to address chronic rear engine cooling problems. On the 11th flight in April, the undercarriage was damaged, and the programme was abandoned in May 1940 when the German forces invaded the Netherlands.|$|E
