5|$|Fezf2 is <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed in layer V of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 expression {{is restricted to}} layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed in layer VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression in layer VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression in layer VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 in layer V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{duplication}} is not {{the only}} way that venom has become more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by alternative splicing. The Elapid snake Bungarus fasciatus, for example, possesses <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor is believed to have had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic Crotalus species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom evolving into a very complex mixture of proteins. The venom of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins. The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and to be related to the prey species available in a certain region. Snake venom has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the venom than in the rest of the organism.|$|E

25|$|These second-generation iPSCs {{were derived}} from mouse {{fibroblasts}} by retroviral-mediated expression of the same four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, cMyc, Klf4). However, instead of using Fbx15 to select for pluripotent cells, the researchers used Nanog, <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> is functionally important in ESCs. By using this different strategy, the researchers created iPSCs that were functionally identical to ESCs.|$|E
25|$|An Amorph (gene), a term {{utilized}} by Muller in 1932, is a mutated allele, which {{has lost the}} ability of the parent (whether wild type or any other type) allele to encode any functional protein. An amorphic mutation may be caused by the replacement of an amino acid that deactivates an enzyme or by the deletion of part of <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> produces the enzyme.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, a {{study by}} Margaret Roth Woodhouse, Michael Freeling, and Damon Lisch {{identified}} <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> inhibits the transcription of both transposons and paramuted color gens in maize (Woodhouse, 6). The gene, called Mediator of paramutation1 (Mop1), codes for an RNA-processing enzyme that is necessary for making the small RNAs {{that are responsible for}} silencing the transposon MuDR. A second gene, Mu killer (MuK), is then needed to establish heritable silencing (Gross, 1).|$|E

25|$|A tumor {{suppressor}} gene, or anti-oncogene, is <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> protects a cell {{from one}} {{step on the}} path to cancer. When this gene is mutated to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes. In 1986, Robert Weinberg and a team of researchers working under his direction made a seminal discovery when they isolated Rb, or the retinoblastoma protein, the first known growth-suppressor gene.|$|E
25|$|Generally, efforts {{focused on}} {{administering}} <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> causes a needed protein to be expressed. More recently, increased understanding of nuclease function {{has led to}} more direct DNA editing, using techniques such as zinc finger nucleases and CRISPR. The vector incorporates genes into chromosomes. The expressed nucleases then knock out and replace genes in the chromosome. As of 2014 these approaches involve removing cells from patients, editing a chromosome and returning the transformed cells to patients.|$|E
25|$|When {{bacterial}} {{cells are}} used as host organisms, the selectable marker is usually <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> confers resistance to an antibiotic that would otherwise kill the cells, typically ampicillin. Cells harboring the plasmid will survive when exposed to the antibiotic, while those that have failed to take up plasmid sequences will die. When mammalian cells (e.g. human or mouse cells) are used, a similar strategy is used, except that the marker gene (in this case typically encoded {{as part of the}} kanMX cassette) confers resistance to the antibiotic Geneticin.|$|E

25|$|Doubletime (dbt) {{also known}} as discs {{overgrown}} (dco) is <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> encodes the double-time protein (DBT) in Drosophila melanogaster. The double-time protein is a kinase that phosphorylates PER protein that regulates the molecularly-driven, biological clock controlling circadian rhythm. The mammalian homolog of doubletime is casein kinase I, epsilon. Different Mutations in the dbt gene {{have been shown to}} cause lengthening, shortening, or complete loss in period of locomotor activity in flies. Drosophila and certain vertebrate Casein Kinase Id shows circadian function that has been evolutionary conserved over long time spans.|$|E
25|$|Most deaths due to {{colon cancer}} are {{associated}} with metastatic disease. <b>A</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> appears {{to contribute to the}} potential for metastatic disease, metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1), has been isolated. It is a transcriptional factor that influences the expression of hepatocyte growth factor. This gene is associated with the proliferation, invasion and scattering of colon cancer cells in cell culture, and tumor growth and metastasis in mice. MACC1 may be a potential target for cancer intervention, but this possibility needs to be confirmed with clinical studies.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} these {{homeotic}} genes determine an organ’s identity becomes evident when <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> represents a particular function, for example the A gene, is not expressed. In Arabidopsis this loss results in a flower which is composed of one verticil of carpels, another containing stamens and another of carpels. This method for studying gene function uses reverse genetics techniques to produce transgenic plants that contain a mechanism for gene silencing through RNA interference. In other studies, using forward genetics techniques such as genetic mapping, it is {{the analysis of the}} phenotypes of flowers with structural anomalies that leads to the cloning of the gene of interest. The flowers may possess a non-functional or over expressed allele for the gene being studied.|$|E

25|$|The GLO/PI {{lines that}} have been {{duplicated}} in Petunia contain P. hybrida GLOBOSA1 (PhGLO1, also called FBP1) and also PhGLO2 (also called PMADS2 or FBP3). For the functional elements equivalent to AP3/DEF in Petunia there is both <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> possesses a relatively similar sequence, called PhDEF {{and there is also}} an atypical B function gene called PhTM6. Phylogenetic studies have placed the first three within the «euAP3» lineage, while PhTM6 belongs to that of «paleoAP3». It is worth pointing out that, in terms of evolutionary history, the appearance of the euAP3 line seems to be related with the emergence of dicotyledons, as representatives of euAP3-type B function genes are present in dicotyledons while paleoAP3 genes are present in monocotyledons and basal angiosperms, among others.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only are}} {{songbird}} and human language parallel regarding neural and molecular factors, {{they also are}} similar in how their communication is initially produced. Observations about these similarities {{can be traced back}} to Charles Darwin and his studies. Avian and mammalian brains are similar in form and connectivity and there may even be <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> is relevant to speech found in both organisms. The learning of a song is produced through a mix of interaction, experience, and predisposition. Young songbirds will imitate their species' call when presented with songs from their own and another species. They are physically capable of producing either song, but do not. Humans learn language through similar means, which is why this early vocalization in songbirds is considered babbling.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, a {{publication}} in Science received {{a large amount}} of press attention when it suggested that early humans may have practiced extensive cannibalism. According to this research, genetic markers commonly found in modern humans worldwide suggest that today many people carry <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> evolved as protection against the brain diseases that can be spread by consuming human brain tissue. A 2006 reanalysis of the data questioned this hypothesis, as it claimed to have found a data collection bias, which led to an erroneous conclusion. This claimed bias came from incidents of cannibalism used in the analysis not being due to local cultures, but having been carried out by explorers, stranded seafarers or escaped convicts. The original authors published a subsequent paper in 2008 defending their conclusions.|$|E
