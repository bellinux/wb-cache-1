25|$|After reorganising in Egypt, {{where it}} was briefly {{employed}} to defend the Suez Canal against an Ottoman attack that never came, the 1st Division was transferred to France in mid-March. Arriving in Marseilles, they were moved by train to northern France {{where it was}} initially sent to a quiet sector south of Armentières to acclimatise to the Western Front conditions. The division was not considered ready {{to be committed to}} the fighting {{at the start of the}} offensive on the Somme in early July, but as it dragged on I Anzac was sent to join the British Reserve Army of Lieutenant General Hubert Gough who intended to use the Australian divisions to take the village of Pozières. Walker resisted Gough's efforts to throw the 1st Division into battle unprepared, insisting on careful preparation. When the 1st Division attacked shortly after midnight on 23 July, it succeeded in capturing half of the village but failed to make progress in the neighbouring German trench system. After enduring a heavy German bombardment, far surpassing <b>anything</b> <b>yet</b> experienced by an Australian unit, the 1st Division was withdrawn, having suffered 5,285 casualties, and was replaced by the Australian 2nd Division.|$|E

[...] It is here that Dyer almost {{certainly}} met George Fox, and learned about his beliefs {{and the role of}} women as preachers in his faith. [...] Though documentary evidence of an actual meeting of Dyer and Fox is lacking, it is certain that Dyer was known to Margaret Fell, based on a letter written to Margaret by two Quakers in Barbadoes. [...] The two men, John Rous and Henry Fell (no close relation to Thomas and Margaret Fell) [...] wrote on 24 May 1657 that [...] "We are still waiting here to get a passage for New England.

500|$|Benfica opened March {{with the}} quarter-finals of the Portuguese Cup. They played Beira-Mar {{at home and}} won 1–0 with a goal from João Pereira in the 25th minute. Trapattoni {{analysed}} the game, saying, [...] "Everybody knew this match was an revenge for the league defeat. In the first half we dominated, in the second we were dominated. Beira-Mar was fresher – {{it is not easy}} to play every three days. Still, we deserved to win." [...] Three days later, on 6 March, Benfica played at Estádio da Madeira against Nacional and won 1–0 with a goal from Nuno Gomes. Near the end, Quim brought down Wendel Geraldo inside the box but failed to convert the penalty, hitting the woodwork. Trapattoni praised his team's commitment saying their victory was deserved and they were lucky with the missed penalty. On 12 March, Benfica played at home against Gil Vicente. With the chance to open a three-point lead over Porto, Benfica won 2–0 with an opening goal from Mantorras and a second from Miguel. After the game, Trapattoni argued with a fan after the second goal; he said, [...] "I argued with a fan, not fans. I was not nice to him, but since the first game, he has not been nice to me." [...] He added that the win was very important and that Benfica had not won <b>anything</b> <b>yet.</b> Benfica closed March with an away game against Vitória de Setúbal. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first, with Geovanni doubling the lead in the second half in a 2–0 win.|$|E
500|$|By 1923, {{the teams}} no longer shared the Polo Grounds, as Giants owner Charles Stoneham had {{attempted}} to evict the Yankees in 1920. Although the attempt was unsuccessful, and Stoneham and the Yankees' owners agreed to a two-year lease renewal, the Giants indicated that the Yankees would not receive an extension after 1922. The treatment pushed the Yankees into seeking their own stadium. In 1921, the team bought a plot {{of land in the}} Bronx, and the construction crew finished the new ballpark before the 1923 season. Yankee Stadium, a triple-deck facility, was originally designed to hold more than 55,000 spectators; it was later able to hold over 70,000. Writer Peter Carino called the stadium [...] "a larger and more impressive facility than <b>anything</b> <b>yet</b> built to house a baseball team." [...] At Yankee Stadium's inaugural game on April 18, 1923, Ruth hit the first home run in the stadium, which sportswriter Fred Lieb named [...] "the House That Ruth Built" [...] as the Yankees would not have needed such a large stadium without the Ruth-driven attendance. Ruth himself had a resurgence after receiving vocal criticism for his 1922 World Series performance. He shared the MLB lead with Cy Williams by hitting 41 home runs in the 1923 season, and had a career-best [...]393 batting average; his performance earned him the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. The Yankees finished first for the third consecutive year, and faced the Giants again in the 1923 World Series. Giants outfielder Casey Stengel hit game-winning home runs in two of the first three games of the World Series, but Ruth's three home runs helped the Yankees win in six games for their first MLB title. Off the field, Ruppert purchased Huston's share of the Yankees for $1,250,000, assuming full ownership of the club.|$|E

2500|$|Developing for the PC {{brought a}} number of advantages, {{not the least of}} which was it allowed the team to make the game using 3D graphics. As Bruty explains, [...] "I wanted to work on PC because the game was 3D, which wasn't an option on {{consoles}} at that point." [...] Once the decision was made to develop for the PC, the team quickly decided they wanted to make a game that would push the boundaries of PC gaming beyond <b>anything</b> <b>yet</b> seen. At the time, the shooter game market was dominated by first-person shooters, most of which worked off the template set by Doom and Quake. However, the developers were not interested in making a first-person shooter. Co-designer Tim Williams explains; [...] "We wanted the player to see all the cool actions the main character would be performing, so third-person was the natural choice and challenge we went for." ...|$|E
2500|$|The German IX Corps {{relieved}} IV Corps and {{the commander}} cancelled the planned counter-attack, choosing {{to concentrate on}} the defence of the O.G. Lines, which were the next objective of the British. The bombardment reached a climax on 26 July and by [...] the Australians, believing an attack was imminent, appealed for a counter-barrage. The artillery of I Anzac Corps, II Corps and the guns of the two neighbouring British corps replied. This in turn led the Germans to believe the Australians were preparing to attack and so they increased their fire yet again. It was not until midnight that the shelling subsided. At its peak, the German bombardment of Pozières was the equal of <b>anything</b> <b>yet</b> experienced on the Western Front and far surpassed the worst shelling previously endured by an Australian division. The Australian 1st Division suffered [...] on its first tour of Pozières. When the survivors were relieved on 27 July, one observer said ...|$|E

2500|$|The Better Boston Group is a {{political}} group that split from the Boston Bypass Independents in October 2007 under the leadership Cllr Anne Dorrian. She had unsuccessfully stood for leadership of the BBI group after their landslide victory in April 2007. It has four councillors on Boston Borough Council. Cllr Brian Rush, the other unsuccessful candidate for Party leadership in April 2007, of the group said of the Boston Bypass Independents that [...] "We came in on a typhoon and we {{are nothing more than}} a gentle breeze now. It appears to me that we haven't done <b>anything</b> <b>yet.</b> There is nothing that I can put my hand on and say the BBI have thought of that, the inspiration was there and they have carried it through." [...] The group criticised the record of the BBI, including their approval of the Lincolnshire County Council Transport Strategy for Boston. A deal with the county council was struck to aid the BBI with the bypass proposal if they agreed not to stand in the next county council elections, prompting two councillors to resign. The chairman of the Boston Bypass Pressure Group also called on Cllr Austin and his deputy, Cllr Peter Jordan to resign over the deal with Lincolnshire Council. Both Cllrs Austin and Jordan vigorously denied any such deal and there were four BBI candidates in the subsequent County Council elections in 2009.|$|E
