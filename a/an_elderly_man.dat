5|$|In {{a quaint}} rural village, <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> {{receives}} a {{card in the}} mail from his youngest grandson, Yogesh (Harman Baweja). In Mumbai, Yogesh's family consults an astrologer to learn if their eldest son, Jitu (Dilip Joshi), a debtor, will go to jail, and also give him Yogesh's birthdate to learn his future. They are astonished to hear that Yogesh will inherit a fortune if he is married on the 20th of that month; the phone rings, and the family is overjoyed to hear that Yogesh's grandfather has made him his sole heir.|$|E
5|$|K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' died between AD435 and AD437. In 1995 a tomb {{underneath}} the talud-tablero Hunal temple {{was discovered by}} a team of archaeologists led by Robert Sharer and David Sedat. The tomb contained the skeleton of <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> with rich offerings and evidence of battle wounds. The remains have been identified as those of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' due to their location underneath a sequence of seven buildings erected in his honor. Bone analysis has identified the remains as being those of someone foreign to Copán.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the storm, high {{waves and}} gusty winds led to one {{drowning}} {{when a woman}} was knocked off a ferry in Takamatsu, Kagawa. A landslide in Miyazaki destroyed five homes, killing three people. A man who was listed as missing {{was found dead in}} a flooded rice field. In Tarumi, a landslide buried a home in mud, killing two people. Nabi caused a portion of the San'yō Expressway to collapse in Yamaguchi Prefecture, killing three people. In Fukui Prefecture, the winds knocked <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> off a bicycle, killing him. Overall, Nabi killed 29people in Japan and injured 179others, 45 of them severely. Damage was estimated at ¥94.9billion (US$854million).|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was filmed by Danielle Federici, in New York {{during the summer}} of 1994. The video was filmed in {{black-and-white}} fashion, and features Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with a straightened hairstyle {{for the first time in}} her career. Additionally, the music video showcases scenes of Carey singing by a large church choir in a foyer, as well as several people, ranging from a small child to <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man,</b> who are alone and depressed. As the video progresses, the child and man are befriended after brief interludes and prayers to God. The song's C+C remix also features its own music video, displaying behind the scenes footage of Carey and her staff enjoying themselves during the original video's filming.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{throughout}} the Windward Islands were substantial, but most heavily concentrated in St. Lucia. There, gusts reached 69mph (110km/h), toppling trees and power lines. Torrential rainfall up to 26.3in (668mm) created mudslides and landslides that {{damaged or destroyed}} numerous structures, bridges, and vehicles. Most of the island's plantain and banana crops were destroyed. Up to 14 people were killed. Farther west in Curaçao, Tomas led to the most prolific rain event in four decades. <b>An</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> was killed after suffering {{a heart attack and}} drowning in his flooded vehicle, while a rescue worker died after a hospital wall collapsed. In Haiti, already ravaged by a catastrophic 7.0 MW earthquake less than a year prior, heavy rainfall flooded a refugee camp and triggered mudslides that destroyed homes and roads. Up to 35 people were killed there, though it was feared many more could die as Tomas exacerbated an already-deadly cholera outbreak.|$|E

5|$|In Nuevo León, fifteen {{people were}} {{confirmed}} to have died: one bricklayer who died after a housing unit under construction collapsed {{on top of}} him; two men {{and a woman who}} died after their vehicle rolled over and crashed into a semi-trailer truck due to the intense rainfall; a 25-year-old who was swept away by swift currents and pinned against a fence; <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> who died after a wall toppled over him, a woman who died after a large boulder from a rock slide fell on her home, and a young man who fell onto the Arroyo Topo Chico. Eight more bodies were found after floodwaters began receding, although one {{is believed to have been}} washed away from a cemetery. Twenty people in Nuevo León were reported missing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{wants to}} spend time with his girlfriend, Elisa (Salma Hayek), but her job as a nurse does not allow it. While taking care of <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> named Mr. Templeton (George Bartenieff), who suffers from dementia, Jack persuades her {{to spend time with}} him, to which Elisa gives in to, and results in the two {{bringing}} Mr. Templeton along on their dates. One day, as they prepare to go out again, Jack and Elisa are shocked when Mr. Templeton's son, Michael (Scott Bryce), visits unexpectedly. The elderly man tells his son about the late night escapades, though Elisa tells the son that his story is not true. As Elisa distracts the son, Jack tries to leave the apartment, until Mr. Templeton sees him. Jack explains his situation with Elisa to Mr. Templeton, which he understands, and promises Jack he will not tell his son anything more of the late nights.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} and its precursor tremor struck {{during the afternoon}} near an extremely populated area, with most buildings in the area already left in precarious conditions by previous earthquakes. It affected roughly 400,000 people directly, {{most of whom were}} estimated to have experienced at least strong (MM VI) shaking. Hospital officials confirmed at least 46 injuries after its occurrence; falling debris struck several people, while two others were left in critical condition. In the city centre, two workers had to be rescued from a collapsed church and were promptly hospitalised. The morning after, officials confirmed <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> had died after being knocked unconscious in a rest home when the earthquake struck. Mass casualties were avoided owing to a combination of building evacuations prompted by the weaker shock and an epicentre removed from populous areas.|$|E

5|$|The rains from Nangka caused rivers {{to exceed}} their banks. In Tokushima Prefecture, the Naka River flooded {{to the second}} story of nearby school buildings. Flooding {{stranded}} 1,600passengers on a train for four hours, which had been traveling from Tsuruga, Fukui to Himeji, Hyōgo. Across Japan, strong waves and high winds killed over 11,000bluefin tuna on a fish farm in Kushimoto, accounting for ¥1.29billion ($10.4million) in losses. About 15,000people lost power across the country. The storm damaged 30homes and flooded another 190, and also damaged farming equipment. There were 55injuries and two deaths related to the typhoon, including <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> who drowned after falling into a ditch. Total damage in the Kansai region reached ¥18billion (US$150million), including ¥7.1billion (US$58.9million) in Wakayama Prefecture and ¥4.9billion (US$40.7million) in Hyogo Prefecture. Total economic losses {{are estimated to be}} in excess of ¥24billion (US$200million).|$|E
5|$|Upon the queen's {{signing of}} the treaty, the French {{government}} deposed Rainilaiarivony from his position as Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> named Rainitsimbazafy, was jointly selected by the French and Ranavalona as his replacement. The French ordered Rainilaiarivony to be exiled to French Algeria, although he initially remained in Antananarivo for several months after the treaty was signed. On 15 October 1895 {{the former prime minister}} was placed under house arrest and put under the guard of Senegalese soldiers at his home in Amboditsiry. On 6 February 1896, at the age of 68, Rainilaiarivony boarded a ship bound for Algiers and left his island {{for the first time in}} his life. He was accompanied by his grandson, Ratelifera, as well as an interpreter and four servants. On 17 March 1896 the ship docked at the port of Algiers, where he would live out the few remaining months of his life.|$|E
5|$|Writer Damon Lindelof {{conceived}} Peter Weyland as a {{man with}} a massive ego and a god complex. During the film's early development director Ridley Scott intended Max von Sydow to play Weyland, but he began to favor Guy Pearce when a scene was written with a younger version of the character. To depict Weyland's aging, Pearce wore heavy prosthetics requiring five hours to apply and one hour to remove. The actor worked to replicate the speech patterns and movements of <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man.</b> Although Weyland's younger version was omitted from Prometheus final screenplay, the film marketed the character with a fictional, futuristic TED talk in which Pearce appears without prosthetics. His performance was generally negatively received because of the unconvincing prosthetics and the casting of a 44-year-old actor as a 103-year-old man. However, the Weyland Industries web campaign was recognized by the Key Art Awards. In October 2016, it was reported that Pearce would be reprising his role as a younger version of Weyland in Alien: Covenant.|$|E

5|$|However, in 1642 {{civil war}} broke out between the rival Royalist {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament. Raglan Castle was still held by Henry, then <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man,</b> supported by his son, Lord Herbert. Both men were firm royalists. King Charles sent his own son, Prince Charles, on a fund-raising tour of friendly regions, starting with Raglan Castle in October 1642, following which Henry was promoted {{to be the first}} Marquess of Worcester. Tensions grew in the immediate region, partially driven by religious tensions between some of the more Protestant local people and the Roman Catholic Marquess; on one of these occasions a local group attempted to search the castle, but were reportedly driven away by the sudden noise of Lord Herbert's steam-engine. The defences of Raglan were improved after this, with modern earthwork bastions built around the castle and a powder mill created; a garrison of around 300 men was established at a cost of £40,000. Heavier cannon were installed in the bastions, with lighter pieces placed in the castle towers.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man,</b> lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E
5|$|Togusa tracks {{down one}} of the missing children, now {{assigned}} to <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>man</b> in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State. Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.|$|E
