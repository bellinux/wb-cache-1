500|$|The CLR {{looked to}} economise {{through the use}} of {{technological}} developments. The introduction in 1909 of dead-man's handles to the driver controls and [...] "trip cocks" [...] devices on signals and trains meant that the <b>assistant</b> <b>driver</b> was no longer required as a safety measure. Signalling automation allowed the closure of many of the line's 16 signal boxes and a reduction in signalling staff. From 1911, the CLR operated a parcel service, making modifications to the driving cars of four trains to provide a compartment in which parcels could be sorted. These were collected at each station and distributed to their destinations by a team of tricycle riding delivery boys. The service made a small profit, but ended in 1917 because of wartime labour shortages.|$|E
2500|$|The OA vz. 30's armored {{body was}} {{mounted on a}} Tatra 6 x 4 T-72 truck chassis. The chassis design was unusual {{as it was a}} central tube design with {{independently}} sprung rear half-axles which gave good cross-country performance. The driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The <b>assistant</b> <b>driver</b> sat on the left and had a small vision port for his ZB vz. 26 machine gun. It was mounted in a firing slit directly to his front. There were similar vision ports on both sides. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from a door {{in the rear of the}} vehicle. The gunner sat in a small, cylindrical turret with 360° of traverse. It had an observation port in the front and vision slits on both sides and the rear. The turret had another ZB vz. 26 light machine gun in a ball mount. Another machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 3000 rounds were stored for the machine guns. The armor ranged between [...] thick; this was deemed enough to deflect ordinary bullets fired from over [...] distance.|$|E
2500|$|The OA vz. 27's armored {{body was}} {{mounted on a}} {{purpose-built}} ladder frame chassis. The chassis design was unusual {{as it could be}} driven in both directions as it had both forward and rear drivers. Both axles could be driven and steered, but not {{at the same time as}} the reverser lever controlled the direction of travel and which axle was being used so it was not a true four-wheel drive design[...] The forward driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The <b>assistant</b> <b>driver</b> sat on the left and had his own vision port. The rear driver sat on the vehicle's left side. A heavy Schwarzlose MG vz. 07/24 water-cooled machine gun was mounted in the center of the rear hull with 72° of traverse. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from doors in both sides of the vehicle and a hatch in the turret. The gunner sat in a small, conical turret with 360° of traverse. It had an observation port in the front, vision slits on both sides and an armored searchlight on a swing arm in the rear. The turret had a Schwarzlose MG vz. 07/24 machine gun in a forward-facing ball mount and two other ball mounts were fitted on the sides of the turret. A ZB vz. 26 light machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 5750 rounds were stored for the machine guns. The body had an internal frame of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams to which [...] armor plates were riveted.|$|E

50|$|The M10 and M10A1 had {{a crew of}} five; commander, gunner, loader, driver, and <b>assistant</b> <b>driver.</b> The {{driver and}} <b>assistant</b> <b>driver</b> (who also {{operated}} the vehicle's radio) were seated in the front hull and provided with periscopes. The unique design of the hull hatches to clear the gun mantlet meant that the driver's view directly {{to the left side}} was obstructed. He was provided with a second periscope {{at the edge of the}} hull for this purpose. The commander, gunner, and loader were all located in the turret. The commander sat on a folding seat at the right rear. The gunner, on the left side of the gun, normally stood to operate it, but he was also provided with a folding seat. The loader normally stood in the area behind the gun. A third folding seat was provided in the turret for the <b>assistant</b> <b>driver</b> in case he needed to assist the loader for any reason.|$|E

50|$|Next morning, Srisha's mother spots Saroja {{along with}} Poochi and asks {{him to call}} singer Vairamuthu {{in front of them}} which leads to the truth. Saroja, now devastated asks him never to show his face again. When he tries to {{apologize}} her, he is confronted by Nandhakumar, who locks him in a room. The train is stopped midway after hitting some wild bulls , the reason for which was blamed upon the <b>assistant</b> <b>driver</b> who failed to alert the driver due to his sobriety. Nandhakumar tries to attack Saroja but she escapes. Due to a fight between the guard of the train and the <b>assistant</b> <b>driver,</b> a green flag was waved. The driver notices and thinking that the <b>assistant</b> <b>driver</b> has fully checked the brakes' connection, he starts the train. As the train starts accelarating, Saroja is unable to board the passenger compartment in the moving train so she boards on the engine. At the same time, the guard and the <b>assistant</b> <b>driver</b> fall off the train which leaves them behind. A message is passed onto the railway administrator that the guard is not on the train. However, the driver, numb from thinking of the incident does not hear it. After a few moments, the driver dies of heart attack, and while dying pushes the controls forward making the train speed up, which is watched by Saroja much to her horror. The train starts to skip stations much to the alarm of the station masters and the railway administrator. At the same time, the burglars attack the passengers, and order not to stop the train. The passengers get terrified due to the high speed. Poochi then overpowers Nandhakumar and attempts to save Saroja. He kills all the burglars and gives Saroja a walkie talkie for communication. Nandhakumar tries to kill Poochi but is himself killed by the edge of an oncoming rail tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{prototype}} T18 {{dropped the}} <b>assistant</b> <b>driver,</b> but retained the remote controlled machine guns. The T18E1 pilot was unarmed {{and had a}} high cupola for the commander, this is {{sometimes referred to as}} pilot number 4. The T18E2 replaced the commander's cupola with a T122 machine gun mount, which could be fitted with either a [...]30 or [...]50 caliber machine gun.|$|E
5000|$|By October, the US {{developers}} {{reached the}} same conclusion as their European counterparts. The armament was changed to a single vertically stabilized 3-inch (76.2 mm) gun and a coaxial 37 mm gun in a single three-man turret with both manual and electric traverse. The turret had a commander's cupola identical {{to that of the}} M3 Medium Tank. Additional armament consisted of two [...]50 caliber machine guns in a bow mount (operated by the <b>assistant</b> <b>driver),</b> two [...]30 caliber machine guns in the front plate (fired electrically by the driver), one [...]30 caliber in the commander's cupola and one [...]50 caliber in a rotor mount for anti-aircraft use in the right rear of the turret roof (operated by the loader). The crew consisted of commander (seated in the turret left), gunner {{to the right of the}} gun, gun loader (turret), driver and <b>assistant</b> <b>driver</b> in the front left and right of the hull respectively, and another crewman in the hull to pass ammunition to the turret.|$|E
5000|$|The lower hull had 1 inch (25 mm) thick armor on {{the sides}} and rear. The rounded, cast {{transmission}} cover was 2 in (51 mm) thick. Like the M10, the M36 lacked the extra 0.5 in (13 mm) floor plate under the <b>driver's</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>driver's</b> stations that provided them additional protection from mines. The glacis plate was 1.5 in (38 mm) thick, sloped at 55 degrees from the vertical, and had eight large bosses on {{it in order to}} attach appliqué armor plates. The sides and rear of the upper hull were 0.75 in (19 mm) thick, sloped at 38 degrees from the vertical. Depending on the production period of its M10 parent, each side of the M36's upper hull was plain, or could be adorned with 12 appliqué armor bosses. The rear upper hull plate was used for storage of the vehicle's pioneer tools; a 5-pound (2.27 kg) axe, a 5-foot (1.5 m) crowbar, a mattock handle and head, and a double-sided 10-pound (4.54 kg) sledgehammer. The track tensioning wrench was also stowed there. As a result, there were no appliqué armor bosses there regardless. The sides and rear of the upper hull featured angled extensions or covers over the upper run of track. These extensions often {{got in the way of}} fitting [...] "duckbill" [...] extended end connectors, used to reduce ground pressure on soft ground, and were often removed, along with the front fenders, by maintenance units. The hull roof plate ranged from 0.75 in (19 mm) thick over the <b>driver's</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>driver's</b> stations and turret ring, to 0.38 in (9 mm) thick over the engine compartment.|$|R
50|$|American tank {{destroyer}} doctrine emphasized {{speed and}} gun power over armor. As a result, the M10's armor was thin, {{which made it}} vulnerable to most German anti-tank weapons. The thickness of the M10's armor ranged from 0.375 to 2.25 inches (9.5 to 57.2 mm) The lower hull, being modified {{from that of a}} standard M4A2 or M4A3 Sherman tank, had 1 inch (25.4 mm) thick armor on the sides and rear, and an 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) thick floor. The rounded, cast transmission cover was 2 inches (50.8 mm) thick. In a departure from its M4 Sherman parent, the M10 lacked the extra 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) floor plate under the <b>driver's</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>driver's</b> stations that provided them additional protection from mines.|$|R
