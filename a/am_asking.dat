500|$|Historically, {{the press}} had enjoyed {{considerable}} prestige and respect to that point, though some Republicans complained of bias. But in his Des Moines speech, Agnew attacked the media, complaining that immediately after Nixon's speech, [...] "his words and policies {{were subjected to}} instant analysis and querulous criticism... by {{a small band of}} network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed {{in one way or another}} their hostility to what he had to say... It was obvious that their minds were made up in advance." [...] Agnew continued, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>asking</b> whether a form of censorship already exists when the news that forty million Americans receive each night is determined by a handful of men... and filtered through a handful of commentators who admit their own set of biases".|$|E

500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope.

It is in this context that I now need your appraisal of the situation. If the prognosis in your judgment is not hopeful, I would like your views on what action must be taken by the South Vietnamese Government and what steps our Government should take to lead the Vietnamese to that action.|$|E
2500|$|The {{promotion}} {{of research to}} make screening programs find ever more cancers is also criticized. One-third of diagnosed breast cancers might recede on their own. In addition to efficiently finding most deadly cancers, screening programs also find most non-life-threatening, asymptomatic breast cancers and pre-cancers, and miss some fast growing, aggressive, dangerous cancers. According to H. Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, [...] "I'm certainly not asking anyone to stop getting mammograms. I <b>am</b> <b>asking</b> my profession to tell women the truth about overdiagnosis." [...] Welch said that research on screening mammography has taken the [...] "brain-dead approach that says the best test {{is the one that}} finds the most cancers" [...] rather than the one that finds dangerous cancers.|$|E

2500|$|On July 25, in {{response}} to a question as to whether The Washington Post was investigating the claims, political reporter, Jonathan Weisman, stated, [...] "Yes, and to be quite honest, we're waiting to see the pictures the Enquirer says it will publish this weekend. That said, Edwards is no longer an elected official and is not running for any office now. Don't expect wall-to-wall coverage." [...] Meanwhile, on that same day, Kaus, at Slate, published an e-mail sent to him the day before from Tony Pierce, an editor at the Los Angeles Times. It was sent to the Times in-house bloggers, and, referring to the Edwards allegations, stated, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>asking</b> you all not to blog about this topic until further notified." [...] Kaus portrayed the email as a [...] "gag" [...] order. In an online interview, Pierce defended the e-mail, stating that it was the result of a decision by senior editors at the Times to allow time for the newspaper's Metro Desk to investigate the allegations. Pierce also pointed out that a Times blogger had already posted a story on the Enquirer claims.|$|E

[...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I <b>am</b> <b>asking</b> questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ... (It's) just making sure I let him know some of the things I did to learn the playbook quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|At about 08:30, a FAR Sea Fury piloted by Carlos Ulloa Arauz {{crashed in}} the bay, due to {{stalling}} or anti-aircraft fire, after encountering a FAL C-46 returning south after dropping paratroops. By 09:00, Cuban troops and militia {{from outside the}} area had started arriving at the Central Australia sugar mill, Covadonga and Yaguaramas. Throughout the day they were reinforced by more troops, heavy armour and T-34 tanks typically carried on flat-bed trucks. At about 09:30, FAR Sea Furies and T-33s fired rockets at Rio Escondido, which then 'blew up' and sank about [...] south of Girón. Rio Escondido was loaded with aviation fuel and as the ship started to burn, the captain gave the order to abandon ship with the ship being destroyed in three explosions shortly afterwards. Rio Escondido carried not only fuel, but also enough ammunition, food and medical supplies to last ten days and the radio that allowed the Brigade {{to communicate with the}} Liberation Air Force. The loss of the communications ship Rio Escondido meant that San Román was only able to issue orders to the forces at Blue Beach, and he had no idea of what was happening at Red Beach or with the paratroopers. A messenger from Red Beach arrived at about 10:00 <b>am</b> <b>asking</b> San Román to send tank and infantry to block the road from the Central Australia sugar mill, a request that he agreed to. It was not expected that government forces would be counter-attacking from this direction.|$|E
