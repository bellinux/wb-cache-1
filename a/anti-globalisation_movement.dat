The rise of the <b>anti-globalisation</b> <b>movements</b> remarks the onset {{of a new era}} for the social <b>movements.</b> Although the <b>anti-globalisation</b> <b>movements</b> commonly emerge at the trans-national level, there is a unique case in Argentina which illustrates that the <b>anti-globalisation</b> <b>movements</b> are also feasible at the national level. The Argentinazo movement is a remarkable example for the new social movements at the national level. With demonstrations and pan-banging following the financial collapse of Argentina in 2001, the masses were out on the streets and crying out against the corrupted state, and the inhumane face of neo-liberal globalisation. Then, this study elaborates on the factors leading to the failure of the Argentinazo in changing politics and economy. To find an answer for the failure of the movement, this study formulates a theory-based explanation within the historicity of the Argentinazo movement...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{how social}} movements {{could be a}} source of trade union revitalisation. Four sociological fault lines are identified: (i) a stand for participative as against representative democracy; (ii) organic and inclusive forms of representation as against corporatism and labour chauvinism; (iii) a preference for direct action, emotion and fun, as against administrative-led and ritualised forms of conflict; (iv) passion, utopia and contest as against regulation. Further, given that <b>anti-globalisation</b> <b>movements</b> are largely fueled by the new generation of militants, in a context when unions seem to struggle to reach them, the paper emphasizes four points of intersection with youth activism: (i) precarious employment; (ii) citizenship; (iii) student unionism; (iv) emancipation and the artist critic.

40|$|This book is {{a wide-ranging}} survey {{of the rise of}} mass {{movements}} for democracy and workers??? rights in northern England. It is a provocative narrative of the closing down of public space and dispossession from place. The book offers historical parallels for contemporary debates about protests in public space and democracy and <b>anti-globalisation</b> <b>movements.</b> In response to fears of revolution from 1789 to 1848, the British government and local authorities prohibited mass working-class political meetings and societies. Protesters faced the privatisation of public space. The ???Peterloo Massacre??? of 1819 marked a turning point. Radicals, trade unions and the Chartists fought back by challenging their exclusion from public spaces, creating their own sites and eventually constructing their own buildings or emigrating to America. This book also uncovers new evidence of protest in rural areas of northern England, including rural Luddism. It will appeal to academic and local historians, as well as geographers and scholars of social movements in the UK, France and North Americ...|$|R

40|$|Over the years, most {{developing}} countries {{have failed to}} collect enough revenues to finance their budgets. As a result, they face the problem of twin deficits and are relying on public external and domestic debt to finance their developmental activities. NGOs and <b>anti-globalisation</b> <b>movements</b> have propagated the view that instead of reducing poverty public debt has increased the miseries of the poor. The current study examines the consequences of public debt for economic growth and poverty regarding selected South Asian countries, i. e., Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, for the period 1975 – 2010. It develops an empirical model that incorporates the role of public debt into growth equations and the model is extended to incorporate the effects of debt on poverty. The model is estimated by using standard panel data estimation methodologies. The results shows that although public debt has {{a negative impact on}} economic growth, neither public external debt nor external debt servicing has a significant relationship with income inequality, suggesting that public external debt is as good/bad for poor as it is for rich. However, domestic debt has a positive relationship with economic growth and a negative relationship with the GINI coefficient, indicating that domestic debt is pro-poor...|$|R

Thus in the US the ISO's leadership entered into a dispute with the leadership of the SWP as to the significance of the anti-capitalist and <b>anti-globalisation</b> <b>movements</b> following the World Trade Organization demonstration in Seattle. This led to the ISO being expelled from the IST and a small faction (sympathetic to the SWP) leaving it to form Left Turn (LT). Ironically, LT also left the IST in 2003 leaving the tendency with no affiliate in the US. Very small numbers of people sympathetic to the SWP operate in the US Keep Left and the US Solidarity, but with no official link to the IST. Meanwhile, in Greece the OSE (which had renamed itself the Socialist Workers Party) split on similar lines with a substantial minority forming the Internationalist Workers Left.

40|$|Don’t moan; organise!’ - {{or so the}} old {{community}} work adage of my youth used to go – and that’s exactly what this highly readable book by David Walls, ‘Community Organising’, focuses upon. Written by someone with a history in both academia and community activism, this book, in eight fascinating chapters, tells the story how ‘community organising’ in the USA grew from neighbourhood-based attempts at improving working and social conditions for residents and workers, to regional and national networks of community-based organisations intent on influencing power on a much wider level. It chronicles the development of such organisations, from those rooted in the labour unions and in particular in Church congregations to those less geographically-based in the civil rights, feminist, environmentalist and <b>anti-globalisation</b> <b>movements.</b> Changing forms of community and changing issues in turn affected community organising. The main focus {{of the book is}} the contribution to ‘community organising’ in the USA (and elsewhere) of Saul Alinsky and the Industrial Areas Foundation (IFA), from the 1930 s- 1960 s (and since). It critically analyses the specific ideas associated with this approach to social change, looking at some of the rules/methods/tools of Alinskyian ‘community organising’. Using a range of case studies charting the growth of different organisations and social movements it shows how Alinsky’s approach and method have been duplicated and modified, in response to changing contexts and circumstances. The final chapter asks, ‘What next?’, and looks at contemporary and possible future developments in the story, as ‘community organising’ turns increasing to electoral engagement and international networking...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the experience}} of the World Social Forum in its five initial editions, from 2001 to 2005, all of them but one held in the Southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegré. Two main objectives are addressed: firstly the paper offers a profile of those in attendance at these events. Secondly, it discusses the permanent, albeit not clearly explicit, tension surrounding the event from the beginning, opposing those who would rather change it to a new political tool to promote traditional goals of left-inspired traditions and those, on the contrary, who would prefer to see the WSF as a new and innovative space for social diversity. The paper consists of three sections. The first presents a descriptive characterisation of the event under its five editions, specifically focusing on the profiles, activities and structures created over time. It also discusses the importance of the ‘Charter of Principles’ and how the ensuing so-called ‘methodology’ has entered the scene and dominated the event. The second section describes the existing diversity that is a trademark of the Forum, identifying the main networks that converge in this process, the relations between diversity and collective identity, and the different positions that oppose diversity and the political efficacy of the forums. The final section focuses on the positions and conflicts in relation to the ‘methodology’, and analytically explores the growing visibility of this dilemma and its potential divisive nature; from those who advocate a more unified political action in the short run vis-à-vis those who consider that the World Social Forum is not a political party, but rather a space of diversity. It concludes by suggesting that this remarkable experience is most probably on the verge of rupture, given the mounting tensions created by these polarising perspectives.
