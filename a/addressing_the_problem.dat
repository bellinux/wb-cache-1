These methods include promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, requiring utilities to use more renewable energy, and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies. It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term.|$|E

The Council then made Flanders chairman of the Committee on Unemployment. This committee recommended <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> both geographically and by industry. Flanders reported, however, that when the committee made its recommendations President Roosevelt was preoccupied with augmenting the Supreme Court and ultimately chose the undistributed profits tax instead—a choice that Flanders felt discouraged capital investment.|$|E

25|$|ICMEC {{stated that}} it found in its initial report that only 27 {{countries}} had legislation needed to deal with child pornography offenses, while 95 countries {{did not have any}} legislation that specifically addressed child pornography, making child pornography a global issue worsened by the inadequacies of domestic legislation. The 7th Edition Report found that still only 69 countries had legislation needed to deal with child pornography offenses, while 53 did not have any legislation specifically <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Over seven years of research from 2006–12, ICMEC and its Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy report that they have worked with 100 countries that have revised or put in place new child pornography laws.|$|E

25|$|In 1790, William Kelly of Glasgow used a {{new method}} {{to assist the}} draw stroke. First animals, and then water, {{was used as the}} prime mover. Wright of Manchester moved the head stock to the centre of the machine, {{allowing}} twice as many spindles; a squaring band was added to ensure the spindles came out in a straight line. He was in conversation with John Kennedy {{about the possibility of a}} self-acting mule. Kennedy, a partner in McConnell & Kennedy machine makers in Ancoats, was concerned with building ever larger mules. McConnell & Kennedy ventured into spinning when they were left with two unpaid-for mules; their firm prospered and eventually merged into the Fine Spinners & Doublers Association. In 1793, John Kennedy was <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of fine counts. With these counts, the spindles on the return traverse needed to rotate faster than on the outward traverse. He attached gears and a clutch to implement this motion.|$|E
25|$|According to the United States Census Bureau the city's {{poverty rate}} of 19 percent in 2004 {{had not changed}} since 2001, while in Manhattan the {{earnings}} of the top fifth of earners ($330,244 on average) were 41 times the earnings of the bottom fifth ($8,019 on average). Bronx County is the second poorest urban county in the United States, with a per capita income of $13,595 (after El Paso County, Texas); Kings County, which is coterminous with Brooklyn, has a per capita of $16,775, which {{is lower than the}} 2000 per capita income of New Orleans. In 2004, the Census' American Community Survey reported, Latinos had the highest poverty rate in the city (29 percent), compared to Blacks (21 percent), Asians (18 percent) and non-Latino Whites (11 percent). Although in 2005 Latinos made up 28 percent of the New York City's total population, they made up 42 percent of its poverty population. The Mayor's Commission, however, was criticized by advocacy groups like the National Institute for Latino Policy, for not <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of high and persistent poverty in the Latino community, pointing to the underrepresentation of Latinos on the Commission (only 4 out of 32 commissioners are Latino) and its leadership (no Latinos).|$|E

500|$|The {{government}} did not give up on <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> when it ended subsidies. [...] It had previously commissioned {{a number of studies}} on the agricultural situation and related factors, and converted some of the results of these studies into legislation. [...] The Debt Adjustment Act of 1923 was designed to adjust farmers' debts to a level that they could actually pay, thus allowing them to carry on while still ensuring that creditors received as much as was feasible. [...] In the words of University of Calgary professor David C. Jones, the bill offered [...] "solace, but no real satisfaction". According to Jones, Greenfield's attempts to rescue southern Alberta from agricultural calamity were probably doomed to failure. [...] Even so, Greenfield had called the situation his top priority, and his failure to bring it to a successful resolution cost him politically.|$|E
2500|$|Public opinion {{surveys show}} {{relatively}} little {{support for this}} view, however. A 1995 paper in the American Journal of Community Psychology concluded that [...] "although the homeless are clearly stigmatized, {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that the public has lost compassion and is unwilling to support policies to help homeless people."

The murder rate climbed 14% in 2011 to 57.88 per 100,000 rising to #21 in the world.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{surveillance}} projects was the Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) program, which lasted from 1990 to 2009. ATSDR partnered with 15 states to collect information for HSEES in order to track, report, and study [...] chemical spills. The information in the HSEES system was used to plan for emergency events involving hazardous substances (including terrorist attacks). States also used the information to develop policies and programs to strengthen public health and reduce illnesses and deaths that can result from exposure to hazardous substances. For example, states used HSEES data to support legislation <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of hazardous chemicals at illegal methamphetamine labs. Other states used HSEES data to implement programs designed to minimize exposure to hazardous chemicals and mercury at schools. More than 50 published studies were conducted using HSEES data.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} that Alexander Farnese, the future Duke of Parma, {{took control of the}} army in 1578, the Low Countries [...] were {{increasingly}} split between the rebellious north and those southern provinces still loyal to Spain. Farnese set about consolidating Spanish control in the south, retaking Antwerp and other major towns. At this point the Army was diverted from its original function of fighting the northern rebels to <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of England, at war with Spain. Farnese believed that the Army could hope to cross the Channel in force, relying upon a Catholic uprising in England to support it; instead, Philip decided to undertake a naval attack using the Spanish Armada in 1588. The Army of Flanders moved against Ostend and Dunkirk in preparations for a follow-up manoeuver across the Channel in support of the Armada, but the defeat of the main naval force brought an end to these plans.|$|E
2500|$|Child {{abduction}} to Mexico {{from the}} US {{is as much}} an American policy problem {{as it is a}} Mexican one. Inasmuch as Mexico is cited for failing to take appropriate measures to curb the international abduction of children, the US government is likewise criticized for not taking appropriate measures to protect American children or support American parents in their efforts to recover their internationally abducted children. [...] The proximity and close relationship between the United States and Mexico makes the problems of one country the problems of both and, by extension, places the responsibility of <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> on both countries. [...] US officials recognize this and have increasingly worked to assist Mexico by providing training and education to Mexican judges and law enforcement. [...] This type of bilateral cooperation is part of a broadening recognition of the responsibility both nations share in addressing problems in the region, and is most notably demonstrated in the Mérida Initiative, the $1.4 billion aid package to help Mexico interdict illicit drugs, arms and human trafficking.|$|E

Since the publication of Ain't I a Woman?, she has become eminent as a leftist and postmodern political thinker and cultural critic. She targets and appeals to a broad audience by presenting her work in a variety of media using various writing and speaking styles. As well as having written books, she has published in numerous scholarly and mainstream magazines, lectures at widely accessible venues, and appears in various documentaries.She is frequently cited by feminists as having provided the best solution to the difficulty of defining something as diverse as [...] "feminism", <b>addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> that if feminism can mean everything, it means nothing.
