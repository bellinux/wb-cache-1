Anyone who can fit Anna Wintour into a rhyme about winter automatically gets points." ...|$|E

[...] Burn After Reading is the third Coen brothers film for Clooney (O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Intolerable Cruelty), who acknowledged that he usually plays a fool in their movies: [...] "I've done three films with them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> it my trilogy of idiots."

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the civil war in 1983 to the end of it in 2009, Buddhist monks were involved in politics and opposed negotiations, ceasefire agreements, or any devolution of power to Tamil minorities, and most supported military solution to the conflict. This has led to Asanga Tilakaratne, head of the Department of Buddhist Philosophy in the Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies in Colombo, to remark that [...] "the Sinhala Buddhist nationalists are ... opposed to any attempt to solve the ethnic problem by peaceful means; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> for a 'holy war' against Tamils". It has been argued that the absence of opportunities for power sharing among the different ethnic groups in the island [...] "has been one of the primary factors behind the intensification of the conflict". Numerous Buddhist religious leaders and Buddhist organizations since the country's independence {{have played a role in}} mobilizing against the devolution of power to the Tamils. Leading Buddhist monks opposed devolution of power that would grant regional autonomy to Tamils on the basis of Mahavamsa worldview that the entire country is a Buddhist promised land which belongs to the Sinhalese Buddhist people, along with the fear that devolution would eventually lead to separate country.|$|E
