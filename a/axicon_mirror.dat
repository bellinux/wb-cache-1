40|$|The {{objective}} of the nanobrush project is creating arbitrary structures with a size of the order 100 nm. An atom beam of neutral chromium atoms is used to deposit atoms on existing structures, which is an additive, non-destructive process. The atom beam is created from a thermal source, making write speeds of the order 101 ?m/s possible. In combination {{with the use of}} chromium, this can be an interesting patterning technique for practical applications such as chip corrections and creating interconnects. Beam compression is realized by applying a lightfield that is used as an optical lens: the atom-light interaction causes atoms to experience a force, which is used to control the atomic motion and push them inward. In this thesis two options for an optical lens are investigated: an axial symmetric conical mirror (<b>axicon</b> <b>mirror)</b> with a vertex angle of 90 degrees, and a doughnut-shaped hollow beam. The hollow beam has no light intensity on the axis, so by pushing atoms towards regions of low intensity, the atom beam can be focused. The <b>axicon</b> <b>mirror</b> on the other hand is used to create a 1 r -like potential, with maximum light intensity on the axis. Here the atoms need to be pushed towards regions of high intensity to focus the atom beam. A model is developed to study the behavior of both lenses, by simulating atomic trajectories while passing one of the lenses. Laser cooling is needed to confine the atoms to a central region, and has been added to the model. The lightfield parameters are chosen so that practical implementation is possible. The simulations show that with the hollow beam a flux increase of approximately 7. 5 times can be achieved in a 200 nm region, but the associated minimum spot size is 1 ?m. With the <b>axicon</b> <b>mirror</b> it is possible to create a spot size of approximately 200 nm, and a flux increase of approximately 4. 5 times can be realized in this region.

40|$|A scheme {{based on}} a W-shaped <b>axicon</b> <b>mirror</b> device for total-internal-reflection {{fluorescence}} microscopy (TIRFM) is presented. This approach combines the advantages of higher efficiency compared with traditional TIRFM, adjustable illumination area, and simple switching between wide-field and TIRF imaging modes. TIRF images obtained with this approach are free of shadow artifacts and of interference fringes. Example micrographs of fluorescently labeled polystyrene beads, of Convallaria majalis tissue, and of Propidium-iodide-labeled Chinese hamster ovary cells are shown, and {{the capabilities of the}} scheme are discussed.

Background reduction is an important issue in fluores-cence microscopy. In many cases, (auto) fluorescence from out-of-focus excited and detected areas is the main source of background. For this reason, a variety of ap-proaches ranging from confocal microscopy to total-internal-reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) [1] are employed to eliminate background and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio as well as the spatial resolution...|$|E
40|$|A {{reflecting}} waxicon {{has been}} demonstrated to generate long, smooth, CO 2 laser induced breakdown plasmas in atmospheric pressure gases including nitrogen, argon, and air. A waxicon or compound <b>axicon</b> is a <b>mirror</b> consisting of two concentric cones which form a W‐shaped cross section. The protruding central cone of the waxicon also functions as an electrode for laser guided electrical discharges. In contrast to conventional mirrors, this waxicon design produces nearly uniform laser intensity in a fixed length of breakdown plasma. The length of the laser induced breakdown plasma has been measured {{as a function of}} incident laser power and agrees well with predictions of a ray tracing code...|$|R
