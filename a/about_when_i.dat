25|$|Murakami is {{a serious}} {{marathon}} runner and triathlon enthusiast, {{though he did not}} start running until he was 33 years old. On 23 June 1996, he completed his first ultramarathon, a 100km race around Lake Saroma in Hokkaido, Japan. He discusses his relationship with running in his 2008 memoir What I Talk <b>About</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Talk About Running.|$|E
25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so it sounds more like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot when I got in the band , and then things not turning out as I might have expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} the Gunzo Award for his 1979 literary work Hear the Wind Sing, Murakami did not aspire {{to meet other}} writers. Aside from Sarah Lawrence's Mary Morris, whom he briefly mentions in his memoir What I Talk <b>About</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Talk About Running alongside Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, Murakami was never {{a part of a}} community of writers, his reason being that he was a loner and was never fond of groups, schools, and literary circles. When working on a book, Murakami states that he relies on his wife, who is always his first reader. While he never acquainted himself with many writers, Murakami enjoys the works of Ryu Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Murakami {{published}} the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short {{stories on the}} theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What I Talk <b>About</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Talk About Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.|$|E
500|$|... "Daddy", the album's longest track saw, Jonathan Davis [...] "descending {{very real}} tears." [...] Davis {{said that the}} song's concept deals with his childhood, saying [...] "People think 'Daddy' was written because my father abused me, but that's not what the song's <b>about.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> was a kid, I was being abused by someone else. I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song." [...] Some 14 minutes into [...] "Daddy"—well after the song has ended—a hidden track begins to play. The hidden track depicts an {{argument}} between a man and his wife over a Dodge Dart carburetor.|$|E
500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot <b>about.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{said that}} she wrote [...] "Gang Bang" [...] with {{director}} Quentin Tarantino in mind, saying, [...] "That's who I was thinking <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was writing the song. I was picturing one of his movies, {{and one of the}} female characters. I have a whole thing worked out. All Quentin has to do is show up with a camera. I can't afford a director's fee." [...] However, when asked about the video, Tarantino said, [...] "I don't know. I've been asked to direct commercials and music videos, Madonna and Jay-Z wanted me to direct their videos, but I refused. I'm not interested, just as I'm not interested in commercials. If it's not to make movies, I don't want to be on set." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the song with Steve Bray. According to her, [...] "True Blue" [...] takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband Sean Penn {{and to his}} very pure vision of love and was a direct tribute to him {{as well as the}} album, which was as a whole inspired by her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, [...] "She [...] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs." [...] In 2015, Madonna said that [...] "True Blue" [...] is [...] "a song about true love. I didn't know what I was talking <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|Youth {{development}} and scouring for talent abroad {{is central to}} Wenger's recruitment policy. He relies on a network of scouts and personal contacts to find and attract talented footballers to play under him. Wenger's strategy is aided by data; for instance, the decision to sign Flamini in 2004 came about as {{he was looking at}} statistics to find an understudy to Vieira. To examine the mental state of a young footballer, he uses psychometric tests conducted by psychologist Jacques Crevoisier once every two years. Wenger prides himself on nurturing talent, saying in an interview: [...] "I believe {{one of the best things}} about managing people is that we can influence lives in a positive way. That's basically what a manager is <b>about.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> can do that, I am very happy".|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{only these}} two notes," [...] he explained. [...] "Expected all along I'd pull up even. Will you arrange things? See you <b>about</b> it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come back." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Take It Off" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha, {{alongside}} Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly. It was recorded at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Dr. Luke's studio in that city. The song was produced by Luke with vocal editing done by Emily Wright. The main riff of the chorus {{is the same as}} that of The Streets of Cairo, also using a similar rhyme scheme and parallel phrasing. During an interview with Esquire magazine Kesha was asked about her song writing process and used [...] "Take It Off" [...] as an example of how her songs come to fruition. She explained that the song came about when she was out one night and was visiting a transsexual bar, stating, [...] "I have a song [...] called 'Take It Off' <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went to a drag show, and how really turned on I was by these transvestite men taking clothes off. I was like, What does that even make me?".|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was like a movie star, right then and there... She {{said she was going}} to be a movie star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was grown up and famous." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, yes; not too many. I didn't trouble myself much <b>about</b> it. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> saw a {{pheasant}} I shot it. I've been {{a little}} troubled in spirit, you know." ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{spoke about}} the song Prussian Blue in Rolling Stone {{magazine}} saying it was [...] "the only song I ever contrived". [...] He said it [...] "came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was going through my 'wanna-write-me-a-masterpiece stage, which everyone goes through." [...] He said it took him [...] "six weeks getting all the right clever rhymes and all." ...|$|E
2500|$|The character's arrival was {{announced}} by the press in November 1998. She was one of Executive Producer Matthew Robinson's introductions, and {{was described as a}} [...] "home-wrecking blonde". According to actress Lucy Benjamin who played Lisa, the scriptwriters had doubts about casting her in the role: [...] "I just knew in my heart that I'd {{be able to do it}} well. And I desperately wanted the security of a regular income. But after the audition they kept me hanging on for such a long time. They tortured me by saying yes then saying no. It's the only job I've ever cried <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought I didn't have it." [...] Benjamin said that she was overjoyed when she was eventually given the part. In 2010, Matthew Robinson discussed Lisa's introduction with Walford Web, suggesting that Lisa and several other new characters introduced were an attempt to fill in character gaps in the soap resulting from a large number of axings. Lisa was conceptualised as a [...] "totty" [...] contingent. He indicated that the casting of Benjamin had been awkward as BBC controller of drama, Mal Young, was hesitant about her hiring. He eventually relented and, according to Robinson, admitted after seeing her in the role that [...] "she was, after all, a great asset to the show".|$|E
2500|$|... "Take Everything", {{another song}} {{recorded}} for the album, {{is one of}} several songs written by Love and produced by Jim Jonsin and was the first record that Rowland recorded with the duo. Jonsin praised his studio sessions with Rowland, describing the new sound as Donna Summer-esque. During an interview with 103.5 KTU FM, she accidentally revealed she had collaborated with Pitbull, {{but it was not until}} August 15, 2010 during an interview with 97.9 The Box FM, that it was revealed that he features on [...] "Take Everything". Another song written and produced by the duo is titled [...] "Motivation" [...] featuring Lil Wayne. It was released as the album's lead single in April 2011. Speaking of how the record came about, Rowland said [...] "'Motivation' came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was in the studio with [...] Jim Jonsin and Rico Love, and we kind of were just vibing. I told Rico I wanted something really sexy ... and he came up with 'Motivation' along with Jim. It turned into this amazing record... I played [...] and he got on it, and it was just as simple as that." [...] The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body, and are accompanied by a [...] "synth-saturated beat" [...] produced by Jonsin. In terms of instruments, [...] "Motivation" [...] uses sparse keyboard notes, programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus. Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland's seductive suggestions, using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex.|$|E
