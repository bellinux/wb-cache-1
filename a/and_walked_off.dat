5|$|Some {{incidents}} in Fingleton's {{century in the}} last match of the season were also believed to have reflected badly at the selection table. Having retired hurt on 78, he returned {{the next day and}} was then dropped on 86 in the slips. Fingleton had moved out of his crease to pat out the pitch before the ball had gone dead and Victorian wicket-keeper Ben Barnett broke the stumps. A displeased Fingleton was given out by umpire George Borwick <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the ground, only to be called back by captain Woodfull. Fingleton refused Woodfull's offer and did not return until Woodfull successfully asked Borwick to reverse his decision. The media reported that Fingleton had quarrelled with Woodfull and several teammates told him that his apparent rebuff of the national captain would prejudice his chances of selection, and the NSWCA made an inquiry into the matter; Fingleton failed to respond. During the same innings, Bradman also wrote in his newspaper report that Fingleton had been responsible for the run out of teammate Ray Rowe, which angered Fingleton for an extended period.|$|E
25|$|The film's villain, Freddy Krueger, draws {{heavily from}} Craven's early life. One night, a young Craven saw {{an elderly man}} walking on the sidepath outside {{the window of his}} home. The man stopped to glance at a startled Craven <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off.</b> This served as the {{inspiration}} for Krueger. Initially, Fred Krueger was intended to be a child molester, but Craven eventually characterized him as a child murderer to avoid being accused of exploiting a spate of highly publicized child molestation cases that occurred in California around the time of production of the film.|$|E

Lindsey Buckingham joined them in 1972 and toured with them. They said their final performance would be on July 14, 1973, at Knott's Berry Farm, in California, but tensions between the two surfaced, and Don told a reporter {{he was tired of}} being an Everly Brother.

25|$|The main rivalry on the Raw brand {{was between}} John Cena and Shawn Michaels over the WWE Championship. After The Undertaker, {{the winner of}} the 2007 Royal Rumble match, made his {{decision}} to face Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania, a match to determine the next challenger to the WWE Championship was announced. Michaels defeated Randy Orton and Edge in a match involving three wrestlers to win a chance to face Cena at WrestleMania. On an edition of Raw, Orton and Edge, who were tag team partners as Rated-RKO, attempted to attack Cena, but Michaels ran-in and attacked them with steel chairs. Before a scheduled tag team match between Rated-RKO and Cena and Michaels, Orton played a video that highlighted the past friendships that Michaels was involved in, before turning on the friend. In the match, Michaels nearly superkicked Cena after Orton moved. Due to a later disagreement, Edge left Orton <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> backstage, which allowed Cena and Michaels to win the match. The following week, Michaels responded to the video set-up by Orton, and made comments regarding Cena.|$|E

25|$|In 1926 {{he reached}} {{the quarterfinals of the}} French International Hard Court Championship partnering Béla von Kehrling; they were {{defeated}} by eventual victors Howard Kinsey and Vincent Richards. Also in 1926 he won the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin tournament, a victory which caused a major scandal. Count Salm threw derogatory verbal abuses to his 18-old opponent Herman Wetzel, who had enough <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the court in the second set. The judges overruled the first decision and awarded the match to Salm, reasoning that Wetzel had voluntarily left the court. It was the second time within a year that Salm's misbehavior stirred international controversy and as a result an official ban was requested on the Austrian to deny him access to tournaments. On another occasion in 1928, while he was participating in the mixed doubles at Cannes, he drew attention when he walked off the court in outrage during a match after a ball flew in from outside, distracting him so that he lost the point. He came back when he heard the laughter of the spectators. His partner, Blanche Gladys Duddell, wife of Edward Murray Colston, 2nd Baron Roundway, was also upset by the count's actions and her husband officially protested during this interruption to ensure that the rules prevented the count from leaving the court again.|$|E
500|$|On 6 June 1970, Barrett {{gave his}} {{one and only}} solo {{performance}}, the performance {{was held at the}} Kensington Olympia, backed by Gilmour and Shirley, and baffled the audience (including Gilmour and Shirley) when he abruptly took off his guitar after the fourth number <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> stage. They played [...] "Terrapin", [...] "Gigolo Aunt", [...] "Effervescing Elephant", and [...] "Octopus". From the start of the performance up to (but not including) [...] "Octopus", the vocals were inaudible. The performance has been bootlegged.|$|E

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1958, the group had another chance to {{audition}} for Carroll Levis, nearly {{a year and a}} half after the Quarymen's first Star Search. For the audition, the group changed their name to Johnny and the Moondogs. Lennon was without a guitar, his having broken recently. Johnny and the Moondogs passed the first heat of the competition in Liverpool, and were invited to appear in the finals in Manchester. The group performed Buddy Holly's [...] "Think It Over" [...] to positive reception, but were unable to stay until the end of the competition to receive the results. As they were leaving, Lennon saw a cutaway electric guitar by the stage door, picked it up <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> with it, later saying that the trip [...] "wasn't a total loss." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after its}} release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, {{and moved to}} Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers in the {{development}} of soundtracks for film. The loss of his key mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake to further retreat into depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered that [...] "Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> halfway through it. Just left the stage." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Ray Patterson is {{reinstated}} (to which he enters and exits to the Sanford and Son theme song) was {{a reference to}} a moment that occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx (who starred on Sanford and Son). During a show in Vegas, Redd Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song, only to find that there were very few people in the audience. Foxx angrily stated that he refused to do a show with such a small audience <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the stage. The house orchestra, puzzled by Foxx's leaving, simply played him off with the Sanford and Son theme song again. The same incident was the basis for the joke in [...] "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] where Moe Szyslak walks onto the stage and, without breaking his stride, walks off.|$|E

500|$|The tour {{started on}} 28 October 1973. The {{original}} plan {{had been to}} play most of the album, but after the first gig at Stoke-on-Trent, the band dropped [...] "The Dirty Jobs", [...] "Is It In My Head" [...] and [...] "I've Had Enough" [...] from the set. Both Daltrey and Townshend felt they had to describe the plot in detail to the audience, which took up valuable time on stage. A few shows later in Newcastle upon Tyne, the backing tapes to [...] "5:15" [...] came in late. Townshend stopped the show, grabbed Pridden, who was controlling the mixing desk, and dragged him onstage, shouting obscenities at him. Townshend subsequently picked {{up some of the}} tapes and threw them over the stage, kicked his amplifier over, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off.</b> The band returned 20 minutes later, playing older material. Townshend and Moon appeared on local television the following day and attempted to brush things off. The Who played two other shows in Newcastle without incident.|$|E
500|$|During Brown's {{visit to}} Australia for his F.A.M.E. Tour, {{he made a}} guest {{appearance}} at Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber's concert at the Acer Arena in Sydney on April28,2011, where they performed [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] together. For the performance, Bieber covered Busta Rhyme's verse. On June 26, 2011, Brown performed the song at the 2011 BET Awards, where he opened his performance with his single [...] "She Ain't You", while wearing a gray suit with voluminous pant legs and a cape fashioned out of a jacket. He then performed [...] "Look at Me Now", {{as a group of}} dancers in similarly street black hoodies joined him on stage. For the performance, Brown switched his outfit to a black jumpsuit. Rhymes later appeared from a brightly lit cube flanked by dancers in eerie, transparent masks illuminated by blinking lights. Wearing a black jacket with enormous, ridged sleeves, Rhymes dropped the microphone after performing his verse <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the stage. Brown ended the performance with [...] "Paper, Scissors, Rock", a song from F.A.M.E..|$|E
500|$|The Foreigner song [...] "Hot Blooded" [...] plays over Apu's {{bachelor}} binge, and he dances in {{a manner}} similar to Riverdance. Additionally, an Indian version of The Carpenters' song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] is sung at the wedding; an Indian vocal group was hired to sing, while Alf Clausen wrote the instrumental part. The scene where Moe walks on and off the stage without breaking his stride was loosely based on a moment that occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx. During a show in Las Vegas, Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song, only to find that there were very few people in the audience. Foxx reacted angrily refusing to do a show with such a small audience <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off.</b> The house orchestra, puzzled by Foxx's leave simply played him off with the Sanford and Son theme song again.

500|$|Gilmour and Shirley also backed Barrett for his one {{and only}} live concert during this period. The gig took place on 6 June 1970 at the Olympia Exhibition Hall {{as part of a}} Music and Fashion Festival. The trio {{performed}} four songs, [...] "Terrapin", [...] "Gigolo Aunt", [...] "Effervescing Elephant" [...] and [...] "Octopus". Poor mixing left the vocals barely audible until part-way through the last number. At the end of the fourth song, Barrett unexpectedly but politely put down his guitar <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the stage. The performance has been bootlegged. Barrett made one last appearance on BBC Radio, recording three songs at their studios on 16 February 1971. [...] All three came from the Barrett album. After this session, he took a hiatus from his music career that lasted more than a year, although in an extensive interview with Mick Rock and Rolling Stone in December, he discussed himself at length, showed off his new 12-string guitar, talked about touring with Jimi Hendrix and stated that he was frustrated in terms of his musical work because of his inability to find anyone good to play with.|$|E
500|$|As {{evidenced}} by {{the manner in which}} Hewett left Somerset <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> during the Scarborough Festival of 1895, he possessed a short fuse. Teammate Frederic John Poynton characterised his captain as a player who suffered [...] "from a deep, difficult nature, which once upset, took long to recover". He was a strong leader who was both respected and feared by his colleagues. In 1885, Somerset County Cricket Club had failed to field eleven players for some of their first-class contests, and in most of their other matches were a poor side. Hewett took on the county captaincy in 1889, and in his second year led his side unbeaten against fellow county opposition to win the 'Second-class County Championship', and gain re-admission to the first-class game. Hewett's batting and captaincy were aided by the emergence of Woods and Palairet, both of whom were named as Wisden Cricketers of the Year between 1889 and 1893. In 1891, Somerset finished joint fifth among the nine first-class counties, while the subsequent year they rose to third. Hewett's final season at Somerset was the county's least successful under his captaincy, winning just four of their sixteen matches to finish in eighth.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between November 2 and December 23, 1981. The plants used in the gardening scenes were brought inside at night {{to keep them from}} freezing. Due to the tight schedule, the cast and crew worked seven days a week with very long hours each day. Although the Australian filmmakers and the crew, who were mostly from Dallas, got along very well {{both on and off the}} set, Beresford and Duvall were at odds during the production. Beresford, in his usual approach, meticulously planned each scene, and Duvall, who preferred a free-form give-and-take on set, felt restricted by the director's methods. Although Duvall regularly acknowledged his talent as a director, he said of Beresford, [...] "He has this dictatorial way of doing things with me that just doesn't cut it. Man, I have to have my freedom." [...] Although he had no problem with Duvall's acting methodology, the actor's temperament infuriated Beresford. While filming one scene with Harper and Barkin, he became so frustrated during a phone conversation with Duvall that he said, [...] "Well if you want to direct the film, go right ahead," [...] <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>off</b> the set. Beresford flew to New York and reportedly was ready to quit, until Duvall flew out to speak with him. After further arguments, the two made amends and returned to work on the film.|$|E
