5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{was not as}} {{successful}} as the original upon its release, although it was generally critically well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Modern critics and scholars have noted the strong lesbian overtones of the film, which Universal acknowledged {{from the start of}} filming <b>and</b> <b>exploited</b> in some early advertising.|$|E
5|$|Public {{interest}} in the scandal eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted <b>and</b> <b>exploited</b> {{by members of the}} upper class. This attitude reached its climax a few years later when Oscar Wilde was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas.|$|E
5|$|The Abir {{concession}} {{included the}} Bolombo river, Yekokora river and Lomako river which were tributaries {{of the two}} main rivers. Each concession operated independently <b>and</b> <b>exploited</b> its own area commercially. The other main rubber companies in the Congo Free State were the Société Anversoise and the Lulonga Company but Abir was {{the largest in the}} country.|$|E

5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing <b>and</b> <b>Exploited</b> Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E
5|$|The SS was the {{organization}} {{most responsible for}} the genocidal killing of an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims in the Holocaust. Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939–45). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises <b>and</b> <b>exploited</b> concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, {{was found guilty of}} crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} map {{itself of}} Europa Barbarorum covers a wider geographical area {{than that of}} Rome: Total War, expanding into {{areas such as the}} Arabian Peninsula, India, Central Asia, and Scandinavia. Relief, province boundaries, snow boundaries, vegetation types, coastlines and areas prone to natural disaster in 272 BC have all been researched and implemented into the campaign map. The Nile–Red Sea canal linking the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea has been added to the map, as have the great trade routes of the ancient world, such as the Amber and Silk Roads, which can be captured <b>and</b> <b>exploited</b> by the player or by the artificial intelligence.|$|E

5|$|The game's storyline {{focuses on}} {{a young man named}} Wander who enters a {{forbidden}} land. Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with whom to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi. Shadow of the Colossus {{has been described as a}} puzzle game, as each colossus' weakness must be identified <b>and</b> <b>exploited</b> before it can be defeated.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn has {{consistently}} been depicted with several unusual weaknesses {{related to his}} psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression, has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits, and in some depictions, a multiple-personality disorder. For some of his early appearances he and the Goblin were separate personalities; his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses, while his Norman Osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry. Although his anger over his son's failing health as Norman helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin, this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead. Norman is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack of empathy for the lives of innocent people who stand {{between him and his}} objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him <b>and</b> <b>exploited</b> by his enemies.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS's two screens {{act as one}} tall screen; however, in practice, this {{essentially}} {{just gives}} the player {{a better view of}} the surroundings and, save for one boss battle, (Hector the Reflector, where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle) only provides the benefit of being able to see more (above) and, when the player is on the top screen, below. The game does not make use of the bottom screen's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini-games. Each of DSs five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified <b>and</b> <b>exploited.</b> Most of the time, these are simply giant-sized versions of normal enemies, though some are more inventive.|$|E
