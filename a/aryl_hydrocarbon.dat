5|$|Due to its fat-soluble nature, TCDD {{enters the}} body through {{physical}} contact or ingestion. Dioxin easily accumulates {{in the food}} chain. Dioxin enters the body by attaching to a protein called the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor (AhR), a transcription factor. When TCDD binds to AhR, the protein moves to the nucleus, where it influences gene expression.|$|E
5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} receptor {{present in all}} cells: the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of genes; in fact {{it has been shown}} that high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E
25|$|The <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{receptor}} (AhR or AHR or ahr or ahR) is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the AHR gene. The <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor {{involved in the}} regulation of biological responses to planar aromatic (aryl) hydrocarbons. This receptor {{has been shown to}} regulate xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450.|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} {{has been}} found to act as an agonist of the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor.|$|E
25|$|The {{coplanar}} {{group members}} {{have a fairly}} rigid structure, with their two phenyl rings in the same plane. It renders their structure similar to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and allows them to act like PCDDs, as an agonist of the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor (AhR) in organisms. They are considered as contributors to overall dioxin toxicity, and the term dioxins and dioxin-like compounds is often used interchangeably when the environmental and toxic impact of these compounds is considered.|$|E
25|$|Dioxins and {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) are {{two groups of}} predominately {{man-made}} toxic chemicals which, when consumed, affect both the immune and reproductive systems and are classified as probably carcinogenic by the World Health Organization and in the United States by the National Cancer Institute and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. The toxicity of dioxins and dioxin like PCBs is mediated by their ability to bind strongly to the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> cell receptor that is present in most animals.|$|E
25|$|Enzymes in the {{cytochrome}} family (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1) metabolize PAHs to diol epoxides. PAH exposure {{can increase}} {{production of the}} cytochrome enzymes, allowing the enzymes to convert PAHs into mutagenic diol epoxides at greater rates. In this pathway, PAH molecules bind to the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor (AhR) and activate it as a transcription factor that increases production of the cytochrome enzymes. The activity of these enzymes may at times conversely protect against PAH toxicity, which is not yet well understood.|$|E
25|$|Dioxins {{build up}} {{primarily}} in fatty tissues over time (bioaccumulation), so even small exposures may eventually reach dangerous levels. In 1994, the US EPA reported that dioxins are a probable carcinogen, but noted that non-cancer effects (reproduction and sexual development, immune system) may pose a greater threat to human health. TCDD, the most toxic of the dibenzodioxins, {{is classified as}} a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). TCDD has a half-life of approximately 8 years in humans, although at high concentrations, the elimination rate is enhanced by metabolism. The health effects of dioxins are mediated by their action on a cellular receptor, the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor (AhR).|$|E
25|$|The AhR protein {{contains}} several domains {{critical for}} function and {{is classified as}} a member of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH/PAS) family of transcription factors. The bHLH motif is located in the N-terminal of the protein and is a common entity in a variety of transcription factors. Members of the bHLH superfamily have two functionally distinctive and highly conserved domains. The first is the basic-region (b), which is involved in the binding of the transcription factor to DNA. The second is the helix-loop-helix (HLH) region, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. Also contained with the AhR are two PAS domains, PAS-A and PAS-B, which are stretches of 200-350 amino acids that exhibit a high sequence homology to the protein domains that were originally found in the Drosophila genes period (Per) and single-minded (Sim) and in AhR’s dimerization partner the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). The PAS domains support specific secondary interactions with other PAS domain containing proteins, as is the case with AhR and ARNT, so that dimeric and heteromeric protein complexes can form. The ligand binding site of AhR is contained within the PAS-B domain and contains several conserved residues critical for ligand binding. Finally, a glutamine-rich (Q-rich) domain is located in the C-terminal region of the protein and is involved in co-activator recruitment and transactivation.|$|E
500|$|The 5' {{region of}} the NEDD9 {{promoter}} is regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and contains a retinoic acid response element (RARE) that is specifically bound by a retinoid X receptor (RXR)/retinoic acid receptor (RAR) heterodimer. NEDD9 is also induced by the environmental pollutant dioxin, based on regulation through the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor (AhR). One study has found NEDD9 repressed by estrogen, based on binding of the SAFB1 co-repressor. NEDD9 is induced by Wnt signaling in colon cancer, based on binding to T-cell factor (TCF) factors in the promoter region. NEDD9 is induced by hypoxia and loss of VHL, based on binding of hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) transcription factors to the NEDD9 promoter. Prostaglandin E2 induces NEDD9 transcription. [...] The Fox transcription factor Forkhead box C1 (FoxC1) [...] and PAX5 transcription factor [...] {{have been reported to}} induce NEDD9 transcription. TGF-beta induces NEDD9 transcription. [...] Based on inspection of sequence, the NEDD9 promoter also has potential binding sites for a number of additional transcription factors, including STAT5A and NF-kappa B.|$|E
2500|$|Induction of CYP1A1 by {{benzopyrene}} occurs via binding to the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor in the cytosol, {{leading the}} transformed receptor to translocate to the nucleus where it dimerises with <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor nuclear translocator and then binds xenobiotic response elements in DNA located upstream of certain genes. [...] This process increases transcription of genes including CYP1A1, resulting in increased CYP1A1 protein production. This process {{is similar to}} induction of CYP1A1 by certain polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Seemingly, CYP1A1 activity in the intestinal mucosa prevents major amounts of ingested benzopyrene to enter portal blood and systemic circulation. Intestinal, but not hepatic, expression of CYP1A1 depends on TOLL-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which is a eucaryotic receptor for bacterial surface structures such as lipoteichoic acid. Moreover, benzopyrene {{has been found to}} activate a transposon, LINE1, in humans.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{receptor}} is {{a member}} of the family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. [...] AHR binds several exogenous ligands such as natural plant flavonoids, polyphenolics and indoles, as well as synthetic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dioxin-like compounds. AhR is a cytosolic transcription factor that is normally inactive, bound to several co-chaperones. Upon ligand binding to chemicals such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the chaperones dissociate resulting in AhR translocating into the nucleus and dimerizing with ARNT (AhR nuclear translocator), leading to changes in gene transcription.|$|E
2500|$|... 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) is {{considered}} the most toxic of the congeners (for the mechanism of action, see 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin and <b>Aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor). Other dioxin congeners including PCDFs and PCBs with dioxin-like toxicity, are given a toxicity rating from 0 to 1, where TCDD = 1 (see Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds). This toxicity rating is called the Toxic Equivalence Factor concept, or TEF. TEFs are consensus values and, because of the strong species dependence for toxicity, are listed separately for mammals, fish, and birds. TEFs for mammalian species are generally applicable to human risk calculations. The TEFs have been developed from detailed assessment of literature data to facilitate both risk assessment and regulatory control. Many other compounds may also have dioxin-like properties, particularly non-ortho PCBs, one of which has a TEF as high as 0.1.|$|E

50|$|The ARNT gene encodes the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{receptor}} nuclear translocator {{protein that}} forms a complex with ligand-bound <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor (AhR), and {{is required for}} receptor function. The encoded protein has also been identified as the beta subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1). A t(1;12)(q21;p13) translocation, which results in a TEL-ARNT fusion protein, is associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Three alternatively spliced variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.|$|E
50|$|Dioxins and dioxin-like {{compounds}} are teratogens that exert {{their effects}} through the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor (AhR) {{in conjunction with}} the receptor's binding partner, <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). The protein encoded by this gene represses signal transduction by the AhR by competing with the arylhydrocarbon receptor for binding to the ARNT. Expression of the repressor is stimulated by the receptor/translocator heterodimer, thereby regulating receptor function through a negative feedback mechanism. In addition, the encoded protein can bind to nuclear factor-kappa B.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{receptor}} (AhR) {{is involved}} in the induction of several enzymes that participate in xenobiotic metabolism. The ligand-free, cytosolic form of the <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor is complexed to heat shock protein 90. Binding of ligand, which includes dioxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, results in translocation of the ligand-binding subunit only to the nucleus.

50|$|One of the {{well-established}} {{mechanisms by}} which chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can exert their toxic effects is via {{the function of the}} <b>aryl</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> receptor (AhR). The AhR-mediated activities of Cl-PAHs have been determined by using yeast assay systems. <b>Aryl</b> <b>Hydrocarbon</b> Receptor (AhR) is a cytosolic, ligand-activated transcription receptor. Cl-PAHs have the ability to bind to and activate the AhR. The biological pathway involves translocation of the activated AhR to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the AhR binds with the AhR nuclear translator protein to form a heterodimer. This process leads to transcriptional modulation of genes, causing adverse changes in cellular processes and function.|$|E
