500|$|Hollyoaks devised an arson plot {{to begin}} on Guy Fawkes Night 2010, {{as a result}} of which some {{characters}} would die. The production team intended to keep details of who would die secret until transmission. Prior to broadcast, Stenson revealed that Steph would risk her own life to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies), Leah Barnes (Jessica Croft-Lane) and Lucas Hay. The actress explained that [...] "She stares death in the face every day because of her cancer, so thinks she really has nothing to lose now." [...] Stenson performed one of her own stunts during filming, with the rest undertaken by a stunt double. A promotional trailer for the episodes aired across the Channel 4 network, featuring Steph on fire. In the event, Steph rescued Amy and her children from a burning building but refused to leave herself, saying she was ready to die. Her exit received a positive reaction from fans on the social networking website Twitter, with Stenson stating that she was [...] "honoured" [...] by the response. Steph's legacy continued following her death, with her husband, family and friends left {{to come to terms with}} their grief. On 29 November 2011 it was confirmed Stenson was to reprise the role for a one off guest appearance as Steph in which she appears as an angel to Doug Carter who had attempted suicide and she convinces him that his life matters. Steph tells Doug something and he shows Frankie a special song that Steph had recorded for her. Frankie, overjoyed that her daughter had not forgotten her, wept whilst Angel Steph looked on happily and placed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> before winking to Tom and returning to heaven, stating she was [...] "ready for her solo." ...|$|E
60|$|Laura sat still, and he laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Then {{she turned}} {{and looked up at}} him.|$|E
60|$|She knelt there, lost to {{everything}} but the loveliness around her, until she was startled by <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Marilla had come in unheard by the small dreamer.|$|E
60|$|The Chinese girl obeyed, moving blindly, so that Robinson, with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm, was {{compelled}} to guide her.|$|R
5000|$|Wozzeck confronts Marie, {{who does}} not deny his suspicions. Enraged, Wozzeck is about to hit her, when she stops him, saying even her father never dared lay <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> Her {{statement}} [...] "better a knife in my belly than your <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> me" [...] plants in Wozzeck's mind the idea for his subsequent revenge.|$|R
6000|$|Delia felt <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm as {{she stood}} at the corner. [...] "You look tired, Mrs. Markham; won't you come in a little while? I'm Mrs. Hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Poynsett felt <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and Rosamond said, [...] "I {{have brought}} our only hope," [...] and Eleonora stood, {{looking at the}} ghastly face. The yellow skin, the {{inflamed}} purple lips, the cavernous look of cheeks and eyes, were a fearful sight, and only the feeble incessant groping of the skeleton fingers showed life or action.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Winter glanced unutterable {{things at}} Margaret, and Ethel began to {{perceive}} {{she had done}} something wrong. Flora was going to speak, when Margaret, trying to appear unconscious of a certain deepening colour in her own cheeks, pressed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and whispering, [...] "I'll see about it. Don't say any more, please," [...] glided out of the room.|$|E
6000|$|She sprang up, {{ignoring}} his wail of [...] "Vida! Wait! Sit down! Gosh! I'm flabbergasted! Gee! Vida!" [...] She marched out. While {{he was paying}} his check she got ahead. He ran after her, blubbering, [...] "Vida! Wait!" [...] In {{the shade of the}} lilacs in front of the Gougerling house he came up with her, stayed her flight by <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He hesitated what to do, {{but at last}} {{he slipped}} behind <b>her,</b> laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm, and said: 'Mammy, what's the matter? Are you angry with me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm deshed," [...] he murmured. Ann became interested. He laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm and pointed. Ann scrutinised the Labyrinthodon {{and then}} came around to Kipps' face in mute interrogation.|$|R
6000|$|Daisy looked conscious, but answered, with a smile, and <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> necklace, [...] "This {{old thing}} wouldn't look well in my pretty box, so I'll leave it empty till I can afford {{something}} better." ...|$|R
6000|$|He moved a pace forward, {{and laid}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> holding her back from him, unresisting, while {{he looked down}} at her. [...] "Since I carried you through the creek that evening up in the bush I have thought of nothing, longed for nothing, but you. It has been one long effort to hold the folly in check; but it has {{suddenly}} grown too hard for me--I can't keep it up. Now, at least, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|I knew {{we should}} travel {{at a pace}} {{approaching}} a steamer's, provided the craft could be kept from filling; but, enlarging upon the former point, I tried to conceal the latter possibility, as I put the helm up; and the craft, rising upright, but commencing to roll horribly, raced away down-wind towards open water. Once out of the point's shelter, short but angry waves raced white behind her, for one may find sufficient turmoil of waters when a fresh gale sweeps the Canadian lakes. The rolling grew wilder, the long boom splashed heavily into the white upheavals that surged by on each side, and our progress became a series of upward rushes and swoops, until at times I feared the craft would run her bows under and go down bodily. Once I caught my companion glancing over the stern, and, knowing how ugly oncoming waves appear when they heave up behind a running vessel, I laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> and gently turned her head aside.|$|E
6000|$|They made no response, but I {{was used}} to silent company and went on with my work, only a little disconcerted--even though exhilarated by {{the sense that this}} was at least the ideal thing--at not having got rid of them after all. Presently I heard Mrs. Monarch's sweet voice beside or rather above me: [...] "I wish her hair were a little better done." [...] I looked up and she was staring with a strange fixedness at Miss Churm, whose back was turned to her. [...] "Do you mind my just {{touching}} it?" [...] she went on--a question which made me spring up for an instant as with the instinctive fear that she might do the young lady a harm. But she quieted me with a glance I shall never forget--I confess I should like {{to have been able to}} paint that--and went for a moment to my model. She spoke to her softly, laying <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> and bending over her; and as the girl, understanding, gratefully assented, she disposed her rough curls, with a few quick passes, in such a way as to make Miss Churm's head twice as charming. It was one of the most heroic personal services I've ever seen rendered. Then Mrs. Monarch turned away with a low sigh and, looking about her as if for something to do, stooped to the floor with a noble humility and picked up a dirty rag that had dropped out of my paint-box.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not talking}} {{out of any}} novel that ever was written," [...] said Bobus seriously; but she was {{speeding}} on too fast to heed him, and started as he laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can that," [...] he said. She {{drew out}} her purse. [...] "Ye needn't {{be paying for}} it all at once," [...] he protested, laying <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm. [...] "You won't be running away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have sent}} for you, Corny," [...] she said, laying <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> heart, {{as if to}} quiet its throbbings, [...] "to say one word {{in the way of}} caution--I hope it is not wrong." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite Maisie's {{concerns}} {{about the state of}} their marriage, Gwen and Arthur appear close to Tom [...] - [...] Arthur regularly meeting him at the local pub, and Tom visiting them at home. One afternoon, while Arthur is at work, Tom invites himself round, foxtrots with Gwen, and reveals that he has always loved her. Gwen questions the sincerity of this declaration because he moved away and left her with Arthur, but does not dismiss his obvious passion for her. Shortly afterwards, Gwen's father dies. At the memorial service, Arthur and Tom sit upfront with Gwen and, to Maisie's amazement, both men console her by placing <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sudha {{comes in}} her room crying. Someone keeps <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> it was her younger sister who asks Sudha what happened? Sudha asks when she came? She says she and amma just came here. Sudha says someone asked her questions? Her sister asks if she didn’t know the answers, if she doesn’t want to know them. She asks Sudha to hug her as they are meeting each other after eight years. Chandar walks towards Sudha’s room, her sister was inside and it was dark. Chandar holds her with shoulders, then is shocked to see her and asks about Sudha. A lady comes inside and curses Chandar to be shameless. She asks who is he. Chandar asks who is she. She says she is Sudha’s aunt (Bua). Bua scolds Chandar and drags him downstairs. Mr. Shukla says this is Chandar and takes him inside.|$|E
5000|$|According to the police, McMillan {{was asked}} to leave the park, but refused to leave. The officer later placed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> to lead her out. The events diverge here with McMillan {{claiming}} the officer grabbed her breast and in return, she elbowed the police officer in the eye, although she claims to {{have no memory of}} the incident. The officer testified that she suddenly said “Are you filming this? Are you filming this?”, bent down, then leapt up to strike him in the face with her elbow. Video supported the officer's account, showing McMillan [...] "bending her knees, then throwing her right elbow into the officer’s eye". After briefly attempting to flee, she was tackled by several officers and detained. [...] The New York Times reported that McMillan appeared to have [...] "what looked like a seizure" [...] while being loaded onto a police bus, and was then transported to a hospital.|$|E
60|$|The girl sat very insecurely, {{clinging}} fast. He put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> waist, {{to support}} her. And {{he held her}} closely, he clasped her as in an embrace, he was weak with desire as he strode beside her.|$|R
5000|$|Aylmer is a {{brilliant}} and recognized scientist and philosopher who has dropped his focus from his career and experiments to marry the beautiful Georgiana (who is physically perfect except for a small red birthmark {{in the shape of}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> cheek).|$|R
6000|$|Serviss rose, {{his blood}} astir. At last {{he was about}} to remove his doubt--or prove Viola's guilt. [...] "Doctor," [...] he said, and his voice was incisive, [...] "take the other side and place <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> wrist. That will be permitted?" [...] he asked.|$|R

50|$|Mr. Shukla calls Sudha, Sudha brings tea downstairs. Chandar stops her {{and asks}} her to sit. She shows her {{the photo of}} Sudha, that this is Kailash. Sudha says he is good looking, and handsome. Chandar asks if she likes him. Sudha says yes, and heads to leave. Chandar stops her, Sudha says if he needs {{something}} he must ask Binti. Chandar asks her {{to sit down and}} takes her hand in his. He asks her to agree upon something he is going to say. Sudha asks what is that she doesn’t hear when he says. Chandar says that he wants her to promise she won’t deny. Chandar places his eyes on Sudha’s hand and asks her to marry that guy. Sudha jerks his hand away and goes backward, away from Chandar. She cries and says she doesn’t like such jokes. Is this why he had been speaking to her with such love. Chandar says that she has promised him. Sudha says she didn’t promise, and what promise does he fulfil; is it right to get his promise fulfilled. She cries and pleads him not to sacrifice her tying her in a promise. Chandar comes to her, keeps <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> She jerks his hand away and runs inside the room. Chandar comes to her again, she again jerks him away and says she will never marry. They want to kill her, she herself will beat herself to death and hits her head on mirror. Sudha asks if {{he was the only one}} to make her choose her proposal, she doesn’t need him anymore. She asks him if he felt ashamed asking the questions that he did. She cries, takes the photo from Chandar’s hand and says that she will tell Papa that she likes this guy, he is good but she will never marry him. Chandar stops Sudha, she wrestles with him. He slaps her, she fell on the floor. Both cry in agony.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has Ridroonee {{ever felt}} {{something}} in here,"--she laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> withered bosom--"as if it broke in two, {{and then went}} dead for evermore? That is what I felt the day they brought my man home; he was so kind. Like my son Okiok, and Angut." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then she {{snatched}} him up, {{and burst into}} a bitter cry herself--wailing [...] "father was dead, and he would die," [...] in broken words. Steadfast then laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> and said [...] "He won't die, Patience, I see Croppie there, I'll get some milk. Take him." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{depicts the}} Virgin humbly {{accepting}} {{her role as}} mother of Jesus, with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> breast, while the dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit, is given to her. The angel is kneeling next to <b>her,</b> also with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his breast <b>a</b> greeting sign. The scene is framed into a portico opening to a close garden.|$|R
60|$|She {{crossed the}} room softly, and placed <b>a</b> cool <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> son's aching brow.|$|R
6000|$|... ''Tis true, and {{you shall}} find it so. I {{have no more}} words to waste. Stand from the door. Kate, do you go first. Lay not <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> or <b>on</b> that woman, or on me, or so much a brush their {{garments}} as they pass you by!--You let them pass, and he blocks the door again!' ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{companion}} laid <b>a</b> restraining <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm as she {{was about}} to move away.|$|R
60|$|Pa Sloane arose {{and came}} around to Ma's chair. He laid <b>a</b> {{trembling}} <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|She did not answer, but sat {{leaning forward}} over the hearth, he {{staring at her}} in angry perplexity. A sound broke the {{afternoon}} stillness,--the pattering of small, bare feet on the puncheons. A tremor shook the woman's shoulders, and little Tom stood before her, a quaint figure in a butternut smock, his blue eyes questioning. He laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} consent for granted, and leaning down laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> lightly <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Superstition, {{deeply rooted}} in every Roman heart, held the crowd enthralled even whilst Menecreta's {{trembling}} voice echoed against the marble walls of the temples of the gods whom she invoked. No one attempted to stop her. Dea Flavia's slaves dared not lay <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> It seemed as if Magna Mater herself, the great Mother, had thrown an invisible mantle over the humble freedwoman, shielding her with god-like power.|$|R
