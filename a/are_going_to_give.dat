500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be a bitch in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is [...] "the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in spite of herself. Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably." [...] This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, [...] "What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field." [...] This pairing made Shannon [...] "less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with." [...] According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, [...] "The relationships [...] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [...] necessarily <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> you, but we want to try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, Real Madrid wanted to sell Van der Vaart, but the player decided to stay in Madrid because his wife was {{undergoing}} cancer treatment there. A year later, upon his move to England, Van der Vaart stated, [...] "She had a very serious illness {{and it is true}} that she had to be treated at the Clinica Quiron. Last season, they wanted me to leave but I couldn't leave for that reason. Now she is well {{and the only thing that}} happened was that Madrid wanted to sell and I wanted to get back to enjoying playing football, and Tottenham are a great team that <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me the football opportunities that I need." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1890s, Morley {{adopted a}} doctrinaire {{opposition}} to state intervention {{in social and}} economic matters. He repeatedly expressed his hope that social reform would not become a party issue and warned voters to [...] "Beware of any State action which artificially disturbs the basis of work and wages". Politicians could not [...] "insure steady work and good wages" [...] because of [...] "great economic tides and currents flowing which were {{beyond the control of}} any statesman, Government, or community". Morley also opposed the state providing benefits for sections or classes of the community as the government should not be used as a tool for sectional or class interests. The Unionist government had proposed to help farmers by assuming some of their rates and wanted to subsidise West Indian sugar producers. Morley viewed these as dangerous precedents of [...] "distributing public money for the purposes of a single class" [...] and he asked voters: [...] "How far are you going to allow this to take you? ... If you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> grants to help profits, how are you off from giving grants in favour of aiding wages?" [...] The end of this process, Morley warned, would see [...] "national workshops to which anybody has a right to go and receive money out of your pockets".|$|E
2500|$|García Lorca's {{return to}} Spain in 1930 {{coincided with the}} fall of the {{dictatorship}} of Primo de Rivera and the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic. In 1931, García Lorca was appointed director of a student theatre company, Teatro Universitario La Barraca (The Shack). It was funded by the Second Republic's Ministry of Education, and it was charged with touring Spain's rural areas in order to introduce audiences to radically modern interpretations of classic Spanish theatre free of charge. With a portable stage and little equipment, they sought to bring theatre to people who had never seen any, with García Lorca directing as well as acting. He commented: [...] "Outside of Madrid, the theatre, which is in its very essence a part {{of the life of the}} people, is almost dead, and the people suffer accordingly, as they would if they had lost their two eyes, or ears, or a sense of taste. We [...] <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it back to them". His experiences traveling through impoverished rural Spain and New York (particularly amongst the disenfranchised African American population), transformed him into a passionate advocate of the theatre of social action. He wrote [...] "The theatre is a school of weeping and of laughter, a free forum, where men can question norms that are outmoded or mistaken and explain with living example the eternal norms of the human heart".|$|E

2500|$|When she wasn't writing, Allen and {{her husband}} were among the most visible of Manhattan's theater crowd. She would spend her later years as a script doctor and observing {{particularly}} salacious crime trials from the benches in Manhattan Criminal Court. Allen had just about given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that [...] "developed" [...] scripts tend to need rewrites – from outside the [...] "development circle"."A production rewrite means that the project is in production. Big money elements – directors, actors – are pay or play. There is a shooting date. The shit is in the fan. And that's where writers like me come in. Writers who are fast and reliable. We are nicely paid to do these production rewrites[...] [...] and we love these jobs. Without credit? Never with credit. If you go for credit on somebody else's work, you have to completely dismantle the structure. Who wants a job where you have to completely dismantle the structure? I only take things that I think are in reasonable shape. The director and the producer and the studio may not necessarily agree with me, but I think the script is in reasonable shape. Besides, no one but the writer ever knows how much trouble any one piece of work will be. Only the writer knows that. Only the writer. So I take what looks to me like something that is in good enough shape, yet which I can contribute to and make it worth the pay they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me[...] [...] There are more than one of us out there. These jobs are quick, sometimes they're even fun, and you don't have to take the terrible meetings. They're not breathing on you. They're just desperate to get a script. I've never taken anything that I knew I couldn't help. They pay good money." ...|$|E
