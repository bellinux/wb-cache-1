40|$|Abstract- We {{consider}} a joint source-channel coding system that protects an embedded wavelet bitstream against noise using a finite family of channel codes with error detection and error correction capability. The performance {{of this system}} may be measured by the expected distortion or by the expected number of correctly received source bits subject to a target total transmission rate. Whereas <b>a</b> rate-based <b>optimal</b> solution {{can be found in}} linear time, the computation of <b>a</b> distortion-based <b>optimal</b> solution is prohibitive. Under the assumption of the convexity of the operational distortion-rate function of the source coder, we give a lower bound on the expected distortion of <b>a</b> distortion-based <b>optimal</b> solution that depends only on <b>a</b> rate-based <b>optimal</b> solution. Then we show that <b>a</b> distortion-based <b>optimal</b> solution provides <b>a</b> stronger error protection than <b>a</b> rate-based <b>optimal</b> solution and exploit this result to reduce the time complexity of the distortion-based optimization. Finally, we propose a fast iterative improvement algorithm that starts from <b>a</b> rate-based <b>optimal</b> solution and converges to a local minimum of the expected distortion. Experimental results for a binary symmetric channel with the SPIHT coder and JPEG 2000 show that our lower bound is close to optimal. Moreover, the solution given by our local search algorithm has about the same quality as <b>a</b> distortion-based <b>optimal</b> solution, whereas its complexity is much lower than that of the previous best solution. 1...|$|R
