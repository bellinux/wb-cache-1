40|$|The {{impact of}} leaf <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> {{extracts}} of Calendula officinalis on total protein and total carbohydrate {{contents of the}} hemolymph, midgut and midgut content of Spodoptera litura larvae were studied. Among the leaf <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> extracts tested in the hemolymph, the highest reduction in protein content of the larvae was caused by chloroform leaf <b>and</b> benzene <b>flower</b> extracts whereas in the midgut, chloroform leaf <b>and</b> petroleum ether <b>flower</b> extracts reduced the protein to the maximum. Aqueous leaf <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> extracts had least activity in both hemolymph and midgut. However, in the midgut content, methanol leaf <b>and</b> chloroform <b>flower</b> showed maximum reduction in protein content and petroleum ether leaf <b>and</b> methanol <b>flower</b> showed least reduction. Total carbohydrate content was reduced by chloroform leaf, <b>and</b> petroleum ether <b>flower</b> extracts in hemolymph with least reduction in benzene leaf <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> extracts treated larvae. In the midgut, chloroform leaf <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> extract caused maximum reduction whereas in the midgut content, methanol leaf <b>and</b> petroleum ether <b>flower</b> extracts showed reduction in carbohydrate content, while aqueous leaf <b>and</b> <b>flower</b> extracts showed an increase in carbohydrate content in midgut content contrary to midgut. However, when compared to control, the protein and carbohydrate content were reduced in all the tissues of treated larvae irrespective of the extracts tested. These results suggest that Calendula extracts affect the nutritional status of Spodoptera litura larvae. Â© JBiopest...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} of vegetative growth to bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering</b> {{is an important}} process in {{the life cycle of}} plants, which is determined by numerous genes forming an intricate network of bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering.</b> However, no comprehensive identification and profiling of bolting and flowering-related genes have been carried out in radish. In this study, RNA-seq technology was applied to analyze the differential gene expressions during the transition from vegetative stage to reproductive stage in radish. A total of 5, 922 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 779 up-regulated and 5, 143 down-regulated genes were isolated. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that some DEGs were involved in hormone signaling pathways and the transcriptional regulation of bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering.</b> KEGG-based analysis identified 37 DEGs being involved in phytohormone signaling pathways. Moreover, 95 DEGs related to bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering</b> were identified <b>and</b> integrated into various flowering pathways. Several critical genes including FT, CO, SOC 1, FLC and LFY were characterized and profiled by RT-qPCR analysis. Correlation analysis indicated that 24 miRNA-DEG pairs were involved in radish bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering.</b> Finally, a miRNA-DEG-based schematic model of bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering</b> regulatory network was proposed in radish. These outcomes provided significant insights into genetic control of radish bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering,</b> <b>and</b> would facilitate unraveling molecular regulatory mechanism underlying bolting <b>and</b> <b>flowering</b> in root vegetable crops...|$|R

5|$|The {{availability}} of food reflects the seasonal {{nature of the}} forests in which they live. During the hot season, fruit, flowers, and young leaves are more abundant, whereas the cold, wet season offers more young leaves <b>and</b> <b>flowers.</b> Despite this, the diet changes little between seasons, except that females will consume more high-protein, low-fiber items, such as young leaves <b>and</b> <b>flowers,</b> during pregnancy and lactation in order to offset the energy costs of reproduction. Nectar is only available sporadically, yet constitutes a major food source when the flowers bloom. The nectar of the traveller's palm (Ravenala madagascariensis) is a favorite among ruffed lemurs.|$|E
