Later on, we compare some educational models to identify best practices related to new technologies, and particularly, to edublogs. Finally, we analyze our experience in a <b>postgraduate</b> <b>Course.</b> Findings and Orig inality/value: We have identified best practices on teaching using edublogs and we have applied them to a particular <b>postgraduate</b> <b>Course.</b> Research limitations/implications: Conclusions are obtained from only one experience (one <b>postgraduate</b> <b>Course).</b> We intend to extend the analysis to more <b>postgraduate</b> <b>Courses</b> and compare the obtained results. Practical implications: We have applied the previously described methodology and we have discussed advantages and disadvantages of using edublogs...|$|R
