5|$|The family finds {{work in a}} fish-gutting {{factory in}} Osaka, where they notice a TV game show called The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show. They go on it, telling the host Wink that they wish for plane tickets to Springfield. In order to get them, they go through {{physical}} torture (particularly Homer), then must pick them up from <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> bridge over an active volcano. Lisa is {{able to get the}} tickets, but Wink breaks the bridge and the whole family falls into the volcano, which is actually orangeade with lots of wasabi added. As the Simpsons leave Japan, their plane is briefly confronted by four giant monsters – Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and Rodan before it flies off on the journey to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Many more {{hotels and}} {{restaurants}} were constructed in the remaining years of Boeckling's tenure, including Hotel Cedars, White House Hotel, Crystal Rock Castle, and Crystal Gardens Ballroom. The Cyclone, <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> and rough coaster, was built in 1926. Cedar Point continued to update its ride attractions, replacing the Racer, the Circle Swing, and many other rides {{to make way for}} a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride, a Tilt-A-Whirl, and fun houses such as Noah's Ark and Bluebeard's Palace. Boeckling's health began to deteriorate in the late 1920s. In 1931, Boeckling became confined to a wheelchair, but he continued to oversee park operations, and was pushed around Cedar Point by an employee or relative. His condition worsened, however, and he eventually had to remain indoors. Boeckling died on July 24, 1931 from uremia. His portrait in the lobby of Breakers Hotel was draped in black. Flags in the resort and on the G.A. Boeckling steamboat were lowered to half mast.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} shed was <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> wooden {{structure with}} walls of Kentish weatherboarding and a tin roof. It fell into hopeless disrepair {{and was replaced}} in stages with a more substantial structure in corrugated asbestos with five brick smoke vents which was finished in 1937. This was pulled down by British Railways at an unknown date by 1953.|$|E

25|$|After Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's command left Lookout Mountain {{at about}} 10 a.m. and moved east, they {{encountered}} a significant obstacle. The bridges across Chattanooga Creek, {{about a mile}} from Rossville Gap, had been burned by the Confederates as they withdrew the night before and the creek was running high. Brig. Gen. Peter Joseph Osterhaus assigned a 70-man pioneer unit to start rebuilding one bridge while men of the 27th Missouri created <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> footbridge and began crossing one by one. Hooker decided to leave his guns and wagons behind so that all of his infantry could cross first, but his advance was delayed about three hours and the bulk of his force did not reach Rossville Gap until 3:30p.m.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} {{emerges from}} the passage and teeters {{on the edge of}} a vast pit of lava. Another transport is seen attempting to cross <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> rope bridge which spans the pit under a crumbling ceiling. On the far side of the cavern, there is a 45-foot-tall stone face of Mara, that periodically shoots green rays at both transports, causing flames to erupt from where the beam hits. Formerly, there was an effect in place within this scene where the light beams would hit the ceiling, causing dyed ice cubes to rain down, simulating the rubble of the caving temple, but it was removed. The light beams have now been redirected away from the former effect, however, the sound effect for the rubble still plays upon entering the room. The transport turns left and enters catacombs of false pathways lined with skeletons, some of which pop out toward the guests.|$|E
25|$|A {{field marshal}} {{in the service}} of Portugal, Beresford had {{available}} the 2nd Division, the 4th Division, Major General John Hamilton's Portuguese Division, and General Robert Ballard Long's cavalry. If he could have invested Badajoz at the end of March, Beresford might have found the defenses of the fortress in poor shape. However, problems arose to delay the operation until the French effected repairs. First, the 4th Division was immobilized by a lack of shoes and had to wait for a new shipment from Lisbon. Next, ample bridging material was supposed to be available at the Portuguese fortress of Elvas, but the number of pontoons proved inadequate to span the Guadiana River. The military engineers improvised a bridge, but it was immediately washed out by a flood on 4 April. A battalion was ferried across on the 5th, and starting on 6 April, the Allied corps began slowly filing across the Guadiana on <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> structure. Luckily, for the Allies, the French did not contest the crossing. Mortier had been recalled and his replacement Latour-Maubourg lacked his strategic insight.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>an</b> old <b>rickety</b> {{door and}} gave at once before our united strength. Together we {{rushed into the}} room. It was empty. There was no {{furniture}} save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.|$|R

50|$|The current {{bridge is}} {{actually}} the third bridge in this location. The first bridge, <b>a</b> rather <b>rickety</b> wooden structure, was built in 1889. That bridge was closed for a time due to arguments in the city over rights of passage and ownership. It burned down in 1890 and was replaced with a steel bridge.|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{after setting}} off, the group {{camp for the}} night. Johann decides to take first watch. When Debelzaq comes to relieve him of the watch, Johann says how much she remind him of his dead daughter, {{then goes on to}} speak of the {{politics}} of her trial, and how the Church cannot have her not be guilty. Johann decides to give up the mission and goes to convince the others to do the same, leaving Anna alone with Debelzaq. Anna becomes hysterical at the prospect of being left alone with Debelzaq. She attacks him and grabs his key to the cage, then escapes, fleeing toward a nearby village. The search for her leads the group to a mass grave, where Eckhart has visions of his dead daughter. Chasing the visions, he impales himself on Kay's sword and dies. When they recapture her, the tearful Anna explains that she only ran away for fear of Debelzaq. However the group gradually becomes less trusting of her. They cross <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> rope bridge, where Anna saves Kay from falling to his death by grabbing him with one hand, showing unnatural strength. The group enters the dark forest called Wormwood, where Hagamar attempts to kill Anna so that the group can go home, only to be stopped by the others. Anna appears to summon monstrous wolves, which chase the group and kill Hagamar. An enraged Behmen tries to kill Anna, but is stopped by Debelzaq and Felson, who point out that the monastery is in sight.|$|E
500|$|According to Ellen's mother, {{upon the}} girl's return home on <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> cart, {{she began to}} feel drowsy and had several seizures. Hayman states that it was two days after her {{discharge}} that the seizures occurred. He visited Ellen at her home, where he was told that the previous night, March17, Ellen had endured a series of such attacks, after which she turned to lie [...] "on her left side, with her hand under her head, and the lower extremities drawn upwards". It was in this position that—her mother maintained—Ellen remained for the duration of her sleep. Hayman visited Ellen many times {{over the next few years}} and he later said that he [...] "never found her otherwise".|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{rated the}} episode 8 out of 10, praising Gatiss's script which [...] "moved the drama and horror {{straight}} into the miniaturised heart of <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> creepy dolls house, {{with a set of}} villains that— while never as memorable or scary as their look may suggest— used sound design to its most effective". He said that the main story [...] "soared", though the sidelined Amy and Rory left [...] "little impact" [...] in relation to the Doctor, George, and Alex. Russell Lewin of SFX gave [...] "Night Terrors" [...] three and a half out of five stars, saying that it had [...] "many great things going for it but perhaps hasn't quite got that little extra something that would have turned it into a classic" [...] and that nothing seemed especially unexpected. However, he praised the shots of the doll house and apartment buildings, the sound, dolls, the acting of Matt Smith and Daniel Mays, and the idea of George being alien who created the reality.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just come inside,--will you?" [...] said Lopez. Now within Mr. Parker's {{very small}} office {{there was a}} smaller office in which there were a safe, <b>a</b> small <b>rickety</b> Pembroke table, two chairs, and an old washing-stand with a tumbled towel. Lopez led the way into this sanctum as though he knew the place well, and Sexty Parker {{followed}} him.|$|R

The Monasteries have ancient history of occupation by monks, as hermitages.|$|R
60|$|The {{actors were}} the first to retire, then the older actresses, the ones who could no longer command a court of admirers round them. They all filed out of the greenroom and crossed the stage to where, at the back, <b>a</b> narrow, <b>rickety</b> wooden stairs led to their {{so-called}} dressing-rooms--tiny, dark cubicles, ill-lighted, unventilated, where some half-dozen of the lesser stars tumbled over one another while removing wigs and grease-paint.|$|R
500|$|Rick Massimo, {{reviewing}} the concert for The Providence Journal, wrote {{that as a}} musical theater, the Monster Ball was not that exciting, but [...] "that leaves the music, and when you lay two hours of her songs end-to-end, it's easy to see the vision, the intelligence and a serious songwriting talent at work." [...] Jay N. Miller from The Enterprise {{was impressed with the}} show, saying that the music was somewhere between industrial disco and house music with a rock edge, but [...] "always danceable". Philip Borof from Bloomberg Television reviewed the concert in New York's Madison Square Garden and found it average, calling the crowd decked in various costumes as the [...] "most entertaining". Toronto Stars Ben Rayner appreciated the show, exclaiming [...] "hot damn, that was one hell of a show Gaga brought to the Air Canada Centre Sunday night and suddenly it doesn’t seem redundant to add one more voice to the Lady Gaga choir." [...] Mariel Concepción from Billboard felt that Gaga [...] "may be best known for her gaudy outfits and over-the-top stage shows, but at her hometown headlining debut at Madison Square Garden last night, the pop phenomenon proved she's a regular girl at heart." [...] The Seattle Times staff writer Marian Liu declared that as [...] "one of the most anticipated touring acts of the year, [...] stimulated the crowd's senses on Saturday night in a way few artists can. She brought spectacle and backed it up with soul." [...] The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis reviewed the opening show of the European leg, and commented that [...] "it takes a certain je ne sais quoi to open your show doing something that looks suspiciously like mime on <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> metal staircase while wearing an outfit with shoulderpads the size of the deck on a small aircraft carrier." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to British {{historian}} A. J. P. Taylor, {{writing in}} 1954, [...] "If {{the treaty of}} San Stefano had been maintained, both the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary might have survived to the present day. The British, except for [...] in his wilder moments, had expected less and were therefore less disappointed. Salisbury wrote {{at the end of}} 1878 'We shall set up <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> sort of Turkish rule again south of the Balkans. But it is a mere respite. There is no vitality left in them.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Marguerite {{turned to}} look at the speaker, and in spite of her excitement, of her sorrow and of her anxieties, she could not help smiling at the {{whimsical}} little figure which sat opposite to her, on <b>a</b> very <b>rickety</b> chair, solemnly striving with slow and measured movement of hand and arm, and a large supply of breath, to get up a polish on the worn-out surface of an ancient pair of buckled shoes.|$|R
50|$|The {{opening scene}} is of a hunched figure {{digging in the}} darkness, and {{demonstrates}} Simon Raby’s superb cinematography; as does the next (daytime) shot of <b>a</b> high <b>rickety</b> wooden tower built by Cedric’s mentally unbalanced father Martin. But when the characters start talking, {{what ought to be}} a darkly hilarious crime comedy dissolves into mush, according to reviewer David Larsen. The screenplay was written by the director Jason Stutter, who chopped up and rearranged Morrieson’s dialogue.|$|R
50|$|Stampida is a racing, wooden {{roller coaster}} built by Custom Coasters International at PortAventura in Salou, Catalonia, Spain. It is <b>a</b> very <b>rickety</b> roller coaster with many drops and 2 tunnels. It {{features}} two parallel tracks with {{blue and red}} cars each one, but then they run separately for a while. Finally, they come parallel again {{to the end of}} the ride. It shares a part of its route with a kiddie wooden roller coaster named Tomahawk.|$|R
2500|$|This stunt {{was adapted}} from Jay Milligan's Astro Spiral Javelin show cars. These were jumps {{performed}} in AMC sponsored thrill shows at fairs around the US, including the Houston Astrodome, where Gremlins and Hornets were also used to drive around in circles on their side two wheels in the arena. [...] Using exactly the same ramp design, movie artists made the ramps convincingly look like <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> old bridge that was falling apart. [...] The movie's director ruined the continuous spiral effect of the stunt. [...] By cutting camera shots as the car was in mid-air, it looks like trick photography to get the car upside-down instead of one continuous actual jump.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1950, Sal gets the itch to travel again while Dean is working as a parking lot {{attendant}} in Manhattan, living with his girlfriend Inez. Sal notices {{that he has been}} reduced to simple pleasures—listening to basketball games and looking at erotic playing cards. By bus Sal takes to the road again, passing Washington, D.C., Ashland, Cincinnati, and St. Louis, and eventually reaching Denver. There he meets Stan Shephard, and the two plan to go to Mexico City when they learn that Dean has bought a car and is on the way to join them. In <b>a</b> <b>rickety</b> '37 Ford sedan the three set off across Texas to Laredo, where they cross the border. They are ecstatic, having left [...] "everything behind us and entering a new and unknown phase of things." [...] Their money buys more (10 cents for a beer), police are laid back, cannabis is readily available, and people are curious and friendly. The landscape is magnificent. In Gregoria, they meet Victor, a local kid, who leads them to a bordello where they have their last grand party, dancing to mambo, drinking, and having fun with prostitutes. In Mexico City Sal becomes ill from dysentery and is [...] "delirious and unconscious." [...] Dean leaves him, and Sal later reflects that [...] "when I got better I realized what a rat he was, but then I had to understand the impossible complexity of his life, how he had to leave me there, sick, to get on with his wives and woes." ...|$|E

It was often used as a court-room, however; and here we attended several trials; among others, that of a decayed naval officer, and a young girl of fourteen; the latter charged with having been very naughty on a particular occasion {{set forth in the}} pleadings; and the former with having aided and abetted her in her naughtiness, and with other misdemeanours.|$|R
