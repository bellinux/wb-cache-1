5|$|A {{documentary}} film was commissioned {{to celebrate the}} 25th anniversary of Last of the Summer Wine. Produced and directed by Alan J. W.

5|$|Berg's {{observation}} of {{local high school}} students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development {{of some of the}} characters. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football career is ended by a spinal injury in the pilot, was inspired by a local event. David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when this accident occurred; he was profoundly affected by Edwards' injury <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> overturned his life. Berg set up a similar incident in the pilot.|$|E

5|$|In March 1972, the Mount Saint Peter Parish Council {{was first}} elected. The group {{consists}} of eighteen elected members and it advises and assists the pastor in important decisions concerning {{the affairs of}} the church. It prides itself on having the ability to guide the parish in its mission of following Christ. The main purpose of the council is to give the pastor an insight into what the parish community thinks <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> feels about different issues. All of the parish activities must go through the four standing committees, which are the Liturgy, Education, Apostolic Work, and Temporalities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 {{compilation}} Children and the Politics of Culture, anthropologist Vivienne Wee {{analyzed the}} perception of children by adults <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> supported the concept of children's rights. Wee wrote that in this model (which she called the European pattern), children were seen as defenseless, unadulterated, {{and in need of}} protection by authoritative adults. According to Wee, this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the United Nations Charter and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted {{to revisit the}} {{previous}} proposal to reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King wrote that he believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> will impact the postseason, and {{the simple fact that}} not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format.|$|E
5|$|Lambert had a {{different}} visual aspect of the song on her mind. She {{felt that it was}} more about ecstasy, especially a sexual one, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> related to religious ecstasy. She listened to the song with Madonna a number of times and together decided to include the ecstasy part. A sub-plot about Madonna as a homicide witness was included, which became the trigger for the sexual and religious ecstasy. Actor Leon Robinson was hired {{to play the role of}} a saint; the part was inspired by Martin de Porres, the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony.|$|E

5|$|Shaw Jeffrey was {{particularly}} {{at home with}} modern languages, having become fluent in both French and German in the 1890s, and lectured on the topic <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> should be taught–phonetically, in his opinion.

5|$|The {{case has}} been cited in {{numerous}} law reviews.

Alex Tallchief Skibine opined that the case was almost unique, and he did not foresee that it would be significant for other tribes.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendants}} did {{not appeal}} to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the time for filing such an appeal lapsed on March 22, 1976.

5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories.

The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E
5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed.
