40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>blast,</b> {{a sudden}} mass {{movement}} of air, {{can occur in}} underground mining system where caving develops an extensive mass of unsupported rock spanning a large void. <b>Air</b> <b>blast</b> can result in injury to mine personnel, damage to equipment or disrupts mine operation. Evaluation of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> parameters is, therefore, an essential part to develop strategies to mitigate the hazard. The properties of a muckpile or a caved zone are significant factors affecting the magnitude of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> in particular on the undercut and extraction levels. This research investigates the effect of muckpile properties on air flow using the numerical code, PFC 2 D. The critical parameters such as thickness, block size and porosity (swell factor) of the muckpile have been studied to quantify how much they could change the magnitude of air pressures and velocities while the air flows through the muckpile. It {{was found that the}} porosity of the muckpile is the most effective parameter on the magnitude of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> and by designing a thick layer of blasted rock with low porosity in the caved zone, the intensity of the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> can be significantly reduced. The findings of this study can be used to design <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> plugs or bulkheads in order to isolate any potential <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> from the active workings, or to quantify the minimum thickness of the muckpile above extraction levels to manage <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> hazards...|$|R
2500|$|The Lowe {{process is}} {{performed}} {{in a series of}} three chambers, the generator, the carburettor and the superheater. [...] The original <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is used to produce air gas in the generator. [...] The heat of primary combustion heats the coal sufficiently, while the air gas is burned by a second <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> in the other two chambers in which the oil for carburetting is decomposed. These chambers contain a quantity of loose fire brick called “checker work,” and the air gas is burned in them during the time the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is on the main producer. When the coal and checker work are hot enough, the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is shut off and the steam blast is turned on. Heat stored in the checker work pyrolyzes the mixture of water gas and oil, which is led through the chambers while the steam blast is on the producers. The Lowe process is endothermic, and cools the generator and checker work, so the process has to alternate between <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> for heating and steam blast for gas production.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} whether <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> or rinsing particle remnants {{with water}} would impair adhesion of resin composite to metal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Commercially pure titanium plates (1 mm x 25 mm x 50 mm) were wet polished down to 1200 -grit silicone carbide abrasive and ultrasonically cleaned. They were then embedded in auto-polymerizing acrylic with the bonding surfaces exposed. Specimens {{were randomly assigned}} to one of the following particle deposition protocols (N = 60, n = 10 per group) : group 1 : particle deposition with aluminum trioxide (50 µm Al 2 O 3) (AL) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane (ESPE-Sil); group 2 : particle deposition with 30 µm SiO 2 (CoJet) (CSC) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane; group 3 : particle deposition with Rocatec Pre 110 µm Al 2 O 3 +Rocatec Plus 110 µm SiO 2 (LSC) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane. In groups 4 (AL-W), 5 (CSC-W) and 6 (LSC-W), the same protocols were used, but instead of <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> only, particle-deposited specimen surfaces were rinsed with water and <b>air</b> <b>blasted.</b> Adhesive resin (VisioBond) was applied and resin composite (Quadrant Posterior, Cavex) was bonded using polyethylene molds and photopolymerized. The specimens were then submitted to thermocycling (6000 cycles, 5 °C- 55 °C, dwell time: 30 s, transfer time: 5 s). Pre-test failures during thermocycling were assigned a value of 0 MPa. Failure modes were identified using an optical microscope. SEM images of particles were obtained. Bond strength data (MPa) were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests (a = 0. 05). RESULTS: Particle type significantly affected the bond results (p 0. 05). While AL groups showed exclusively adhesive failure between the resin composite and the substrate, the incidence of cohesive failures in the composite was more frequent in groups CSC and LSC after either <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> or rinsing. SEM images of particles showed sharp morphology of the particles in AL compared to CSC and LSC. Conclusion: Rinsing and <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> following particle deposition methods did not impair adhesion of resin composite to titanium. Particle deposition with silica particles provided better adhesion of resin composite to this substrate compared to the use of alumina particles...|$|R

Strain rate effects have been accounted for usingthe well-known Cowper Symonds equation by differentiating the corresponding strain rate equations.

5000|$|The Shocker wears {{a pair of}} gauntlets he {{designed}} with vibro-shock units known as [...] "vibro-smashers" [...] that, when activated by a pump-action thumb trigger, can project a concentrated <b>blast</b> of compressed <b>air</b> that vibrates at an intense frequency. This creates a series of rapid-succession high-pressure <b>air</b> <b>blasts</b> that result {{in a series of}} powerful impacts. This allows Shocker to both effectively throw long range vibrational punches from a distance, creating destructive vibrations that can crumble solid concrete and cause extensive damage to the human body and its internal organs, as well as throw shock waves which vibrate the structure of something in order to weaken or destroy it. A lesser known ability of the gaunlets allows Shocker to make incredible leaps, by directing the <b>air</b> <b>blasts</b> toward {{the ground in front of}} him.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe use {{of vehicle}} bombs by terrorists to attack {{building}} structures has become of increasing concern to structural engineers since {{the bombing of}} the marine barracks in Beriut (1982). This is particularly true following attacks on the Murrah building (1995). Due to increasing threat of vehicle bomb attack, structural engineers have developed methods of design and analysis to protect against blast loads. However, the behavior of structures under blast loads is difficult to understand. Current design for <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> loads generally uses simplified analysis procedures that were developed in the late 1950 's [19]. More recent modeling and computation capabilities can readily be used to provide a more exact estimate of the structural behavior under these extreme loads. It has been suggested that buildings designed for strong ground motions will also have improved resistance to <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> loads. As an initial attempt to quantify this behavior, the responses of a three story and ten story steel building, designed for the 1994 building code, with lateral resistance provided by perimeter moment frames, are considered. An analytical model of the building is developed and the magnitude and distribution of blast loads on the structure are estimated using available computer software that is based on empirical methods.; To obtain the relationship between pressure, time duration, and standoff distance, these programs are used to obtain an accurate model of the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> loading. A hemispherical surface burst for various explosive weights and standoff distances is considered for generating the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> loading and determining the structural responses. Linear and nonlinear analyses are conducted for these loadings. <b>Air</b> <b>blast</b> demands on the structure are compared to current seismic guidelines. These studies present the displacement responses, story drifts, demand/capacity ratio, diaphragm analysis and inelastic demands for these structures...|$|R
