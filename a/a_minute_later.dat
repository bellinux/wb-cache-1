5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the restart, Liverpool had the first attack. Striker Michael Owen went past United defender Brown, but {{he was unable to}} shoot when the ball got stuck in between his feet. <b>A</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later,</b> Liverpool had an appeal for a penalty after striker Emile Heskey went down in the United penalty area, but referee Paul Durkin did not award a penalty. They had another chance in the 52nd minute after an exchange of passes between Murphy and Heskey, but Murphy's shot went over the bar. United began to exert more pressure on Liverpool after this. <b>A</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> a shot by Keane was blocked by Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä. The ball went out for a United, which resulted in a throw-in, that was headed into the arms of Dudek. Five minutes later, Van Nistelrooy had a chance to score as he turned and shot at the Liverpool goal, but it was saved by Dudek. Heskey was replaced by striker Milan Baroš following an injury.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-final Manchester United faced Newcastle United at the Millennium Stadium. They {{took the}} lead in the 19th minute when Ruud van Nistelrooy scored, and Scholes {{extended}} the team's advantage just before half time.

Minutes later, West Ham captain Nigel Reo-Coker had an attempt to score, but his shot went over the Liverpool goal.

Ottawa received another penalty less than <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later,</b> which sent Todd Simpson to the penalty box for holding.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} half, nearing the halftime break, came an unusual string of {{reckless}} challenges from Toronto right back, Mikael Yourassowsky, on loan from Croatian side Rijeka. In the 36th minute of play, Yourassowsky was carded for a reckless challenge on Andy Najar, and <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> was given a second yellow and subsequently ejected for doing a similarly mistimed tackle on Chris Pontius. It would not be until the 62nd minute that United were able to capitalize on the shorthanded Toronto, restoring parity at 2–2 thanks a goal from Ngwenya. The draw gave D.C. United the cup title.|$|E

Liverpool responded late in the game when defender Chris Lawler scored in the 89th minute; however, Ajax scored <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> through Henk Groot to win the match 5–1. The spectators could not really see much of the match due to the fog's density and at times could only tell by the celebration of the team when a goal was scored.|$|E
5|$|As Manchester United and Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup respectively, {{both teams}} met in another heated match at the Millennium Stadium {{a month earlier}} for the 2003 Community Shield. Phil Neville was booked in the first minute for a {{challenge}} on Patrick Vieira, and <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> Ashley Cole received a booking for fouling Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Yellow cards were also given to Quinton Fortune and Paul Scholes for United and Patrick Vieira for Arsenal, Arsenal substitute Francis Jeffers was shown a straight red for a kick on Phil Neville and, despite originally going unpunished, Sol Campbell was later given a three-match ban by the FA for kicking out at Eric Djemba-Djemba. The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes and United eventually won the Shield 4–3 on penalties. Ruud van Nistelrooy had his spot kick saved by debutant Jens Lehmann {{but it was his}} opposite number and fellow debutant Tim Howard who was the hero, saving penalties from Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Robert Pirès.|$|E
5|$|Astorias bridge crew called general {{quarters}} upon sighting the flares {{south of}} Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, {{shortly after the}} Japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around the ship, Astorias main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire. Astorias captain, awakened to find his ship in action, rushed to the bridge and ordered a ceasefire, fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued to cascade around his ship, the captain ordered firing resumed less than <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later.</b> Chōkai, however, had found the range, and Astoria was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire. Between 02:00 and 02:15, Aoba, Kinugasa, and Kako joined Chōkai in pounding Astoria, destroying the cruiser's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of Astorias remaining operational main gun turrets fired at Kinugasas searchlight, but missed and hit Chōkais forward turret, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship.|$|E

5|$|Despite Dire's greater {{experience}} {{over long}} distances, it was Kiplagat who forged {{ahead in the}} last kilometre and she won the race with ten seconds to spare over her Ethiopian rival. Arusei was the third across the line half <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later,</b> while Feyse Tadese, Joyce Chepkirui, Meseret Mengistu and Fate Tola took places 4–7 around one minute behind the winner. It was Arusei's clear third place which proved {{the difference between the}} top African teams, as Kenya won the team gold by a margin of 34 seconds over Ethiopia. A strong final phase saw Zhu Xiaolin take eighth place for the hosts, which was the best non-African individual performance that year. Japan's Yoshimi Ozaki and Ryoko Kizaki were immediately behind her, failing to get a top eight finish but yet again leading the country to the team bronze with a buffer of over six minutes between them and Australia.|$|E
5|$|In the 66thminute, Alex Ferguson {{completed}} his attacking quartet by bringing Dimitar Berbatov on {{in place of}} Park. Ronaldo was penalised for a high elbow when challenging for a header with Puyol <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later,</b> before Rooney forced another corner off Piqué in the 69thminute. However, United's numbers up front in search of another goal left them wanting in defence; a weak clearance from Van der Sar was cut out by Puyol who played the ball to Eto'o {{on the right side}} of the penalty area. The ball broke to Xavi on the edge of the area, who crossed for Messi to send a looping header over the United goalkeeper and into the far side of the goal for a two-goal lead. Immediately after the goal, Henry was replaced by Seydou Keita, allowing Barcelona to adopt a more defensive stance.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool got {{the second}} half under way, but it was West Ham who had the first attack of the half. Etherington {{advanced}} down the right hand side of the pitch and passed to Harewood, whose shot was saved by Reina, who also saved a subsequent shot from Benayoun. Liverpool had a chance immediately afterwards as Cissé passed to Alonso, but his shot was blocked and {{went out for a}} corner. <b>A</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later,</b> Liverpool made the first substitution of the match, as the injured Harry Kewell was replaced by Fernando Morientes. Liverpool equalised in the 54th minute, when Gerrard volleyed home a knock-down header from Crouch. The first yellow card of the match went to Ashton after he fouled Finnan in the 60th minute. Three minutes later, Carragher also received a yellow card for a foul on Ashton.|$|E
