500|$|Mia Farrow, who {{had come}} and gone from the ashram before, left again and drifted around India before {{returning}} to the United States. Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver: The Secret History of the Beatles says that, before leaving, she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. Ned Wynn, one of Farrow's childhood friends, wrote in his 1990 memoir that she had told him in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes at her. In her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera wrote that she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation [...] "cave" [...] when he tried to put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was [...] "an honour" [...] and [...] "a tradition" [...] for a [...] "holy man" [...] to touch someone after meditation.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{was five}} years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone, {{died of breast cancer}} at the age of30. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also." ...|$|E
500|$|She was {{particularly}} affectionate towards the latter because it {{allowed her to}} appear on camera with her two children, {{and said it was}} her favorite. Certain elements of Rand's characterization were developed by Whitney and Shatner; Whitney would go to Shatner's side when their characters were put in danger – in response, Shatner would put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> such as in [...] "Balance of Terror". The character was written out of the episode [...] "Dagger of the Mind", which Whitney attributed to the romantic liaison that Kirk has with the female lead in that episode being so overt that it would have caused issues for later plots. This was because the script had Kirk and the female lead sleep with each other. Although Whitney found it difficult to watch as her character had been removed from the episode, she understood why. Part of her outfit was dictated by attempting to increase the duties of the Captain's Yeoman on screen. In order to provide support while part of an away team on a planet, Roddenberry suggested that she could wear a device on an over-the-shoulder strap which she could use as an electronic camera. He also suggested immediately that it could be expanded in order to be sold as a toy for young girls. This was part of the development process that {{led to the creation of}} the tricorder.|$|E

500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|Dryden's {{translation}} {{is based on}} presumed authorial intent and smooth English. [...] In line 790 the literal translation of [...] "haec ubi dicta dedit” is [...] "when she gave these words.” [...] But [...] "she said” gets the point across, uses half the words, and makes for better English. [...] A few lines later, with [...] "ter conatus ibi collo dare bracchia circum; ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago", he alters the literal translation [...] "Thrice trying to give <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck; thrice the image grasped in vain fled the hands", in order to fit it into meter and the emotion of the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Linda and Noor {{were sitting}} on a {{two-seater}} couch with Charlotte sitting on the arm, when Noor started touching Linda in a sexual way. He spoke into her ear, put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist and refused to let her go. Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to ”just kill him for me" [...] Charlotte picked up a Stanley knife and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that {{sent him to the}} ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times. It may have been more, but pathologists had no opportunity to examine the full body.|$|E

2500|$|The goddess Iðunn interrupts, asking Bragi, as {{a service}} to his {{relatives}} and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in Ægir's hall. Loki tells Iðunn to be silent, calling her the most [...] "man-crazed" [...] of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> brother's slayer. Iðunn says that she won't say words of blame in Ægir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want {{the two of them}} to fight. The goddess Gefjun asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that [...] "all living things love him." [...] Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a [...] "white boy" [...] who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.|$|E
