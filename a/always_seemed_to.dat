25|$|According to Neville Cardus, Tyldesley {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} of Lancashire batsmen. Cardus agreed with Wisden that Tyldesley was exceptionally quick on his feet and therefore <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Tyldesley was very strong, despite his small size, with quick reflexes and great flexibility in his wrists which assisted both his strokeplay and, when fielding, his throwing. He was especially noted as a batsman for his mastery of the square cut and his fighting qualities in difficult conditions; he played many noted innings on bad wickets.|$|E
25|$|Foreman was {{sometimes}} {{characterized by the}} media as an aloof and antisocial champion. According to them, he <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> wear a sneer and was not often available to the press. Foreman later attributed his demeanor during this time as an emulation of Sonny Liston, for whom {{he had been an}} occasional sparring partner. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against Puerto Rican Heavyweight Champion José Roman. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, and it took Foreman only 2 minutes to end the fight, one of the fastest knockouts in a Heavyweight Championship bout.|$|E
25|$|On September 9, 1864, the 19th New York Cavalry was {{transfer}} to the second brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas C. Devin. The volunteers welcomed this move because the soldiers of the Regular regiments had fled from the field {{on more than one}} occasion and <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> get undeserved credit for actions won or carried by the volunteers, as Bowen and other writers from the volunteer ranks such as Capt. R. A. Britton, who is quoted by Bowen, observed. On September 19, 1864, Sheridan's forces attacked Early's forces at the Battle of Opequon or Third Battle of Winchester. The 19th New York Cavalry struck the Confederate outposts on the Opequon Creek at Sewer's Ford, about seven miles northeast of Winchester, Virginia. Captain Alexander K. Thorp, brother of the regiment's Lt. Col. Thomas Thorp, who had been taken prisoner at Trevilian Station, was killed near the beginning of this battle. At a key point in the battle, Devin sent his entire division charging into the Confederate infantry's line of battle inflicting a great number of casualties, including the taking of many prisoners. Devin wrote that Gibbs led his regiment in gallant style. The cavalry charges sent the remaining Confederate infantry fleeing from the field.|$|E

500|$|For {{the most}} part, Agnew {{remained}} somewhat aloof {{from the state}} legislature, preferring the company of businessmen. Some of these had been associates in his county executive days, such as Lester Matz and Walter Jones, who had been {{among the first to}} encourage him to seek the governorship. Agnew's close ties to the business community were noted by officials in the state capital of Annapolis: [...] "There <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be people around him who were in business." [...] Some suspected that, while not himself corrupt, he [...] "allowed himself to be used by the people around him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Pine Bluff Variant" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban. For much of the show's fifth season, Shiban had an index card that simply read [...] "Mulder Undercover". He had long {{wanted to do a}} story like this, noting, [...] "It <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> fit to me—putting Mulder in a {{situation}} [...] don't know his allegiance." [...] Shiban argued that the concept also worked because the theme of Mulder questioning his beliefs was a major element of the fifth season. Shiban petitioned Frank Spotnitz several times about the idea until [...] "the right time and the right way" [...] presented itself.|$|E
500|$|Mayberry {{made the}} Phillies' opening day roster {{for the first}} time, and {{recorded}} the game-winning RBI via a pinch hit single in the Phillies' first game, but was optioned back to the minors after the Phillies activated Shane Victorino from the disabled list in early June. Subsequently, Mayberry returned to the big-league club when Victorino {{went back to the}} disabled list. Throughout 2011, Mayberry did not have a defined role on the club. In August, columnist David Murphy wrote, [...] "While the Phillies may not see evidence that Mayberry should be part of their everyday plans, it is getting hard to ignore the two huge offensive tools he brings to the table: immense power, and a curious ability to hit when it counts." [...] He added, [...] "Charlie Manuel has <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have a soft spot in his heart for Mayberry. And, more importantly, he has <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have a knack for when to put him into a game." [...] Manuel compared Mayberry to former Phillie Jayson Werth in terms of their size, athleticism, {{and the fact that they}} both hit better against left-handed pitching than right-handed pitching, noting that he planned to give Mayberry a chance to start if Ben Francisco floundered. Ultimately, the Phillies traded away Francisco after the season, in part due to Mayberry's emergence. He finished the season batting [...]273/.341/.513, with a [...]854 OPS and 15 home runs in 104 games, and made his postseason debut in the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals that September.|$|E

[...] He says that the actions that Mahone takes are affected by [...] "some of the things that Mahone has {{in the back of his}} closet—and in the back of his mind, the voices he is hearing about his own life."

500|$|Epworth {{stated that}} the producers' request was for [...] "a {{dramatic}} ballad", so he and Adele tried to [...] "do something that was simultaneously dark and final, like a funeral, and to try {{and turn it into}} something that was not final.

Epworth watched the first thirteen Bond films seeking the [...] "musical code" [...] of the songs, [...] "whatever the modal structure or the chord that <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> unify those songs" [...] and contributed to the mood and [...] "that kind of '60s jazzy quality". Epworth identified as an uniting factor [...] "a minor ninth as the harmonic code... the Bond songs, they have that elaboration to it", and wrote what would become the instrumental part of [...] "Skyfall". He described it as [...] "a bit of a 'Eureka!' moment".|$|E
500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. You know, a lot of girls would have gone through with , and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{love story}} {{involving}} Kurt and Blaine {{was met with}} critical acclaim, especially {{the events in the}} [...] "Original Song" [...] episode where the characters first kissed. Katie Morgan of Billboard stated, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy." [...] The Boston Herald Mark Perigard wrote, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of the}} moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be stuck in pure misery." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet" [...] and said that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. Semigran praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, and characterized the kiss scene as a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". She went on to commend the acting in the scene, and wrote that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty".|$|E
500|$|In {{writing a}} {{biography}} on the author, Brian Stableford placed several of Dick's short stories {{in a context}} that established {{their relationship to the}} author's personal hardships. [...] "...it <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> him [...] that his career was a catalogue of undeserved disappointments and the record of his published work a travesty of his true ambitions." [...] The personal problems which Dick struggled throughout his life provided fuel for several of the anxiety driven themes for his short stories. In Dick's early work, Stableford highlighted recurring themes in those most popular. These included paranoid suspicions; the dangerous hostility of [...] "seemingly innocent entities"; and [...] "the mechanization of the environment and the computerization of political decision-making". Stories in which androids and robots are a danger to the protagonist include [...] "Autofac", [...] "Colony", and Vulcan's Hammer. However, [...] "The Last of the Masters", Stableford contends, was an exception to Dick's common dystopic portrayals of technology, given Stableford's interpretation of Bors as an altruist, who was [...] "benign" [...] in its role.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the second}} new ball was taken after tea, Lindwall {{returned}} but {{appeared to be}} tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Johnston removed Compton, and one run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. At {{the start of the}} third morning, he bowled Alec Bedser off an inside edge from a bouncer to finish with 5/70 as Australia took a 135-run first innings lead on the third morning. O'Reilly said Lindwall [...] "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task...and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler." [...] Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them.|$|E
