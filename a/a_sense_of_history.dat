Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E

500|$|Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; {{the magnet}} for talent {{was not the}} pay, {{generally}} mediocre, but rather the allure of {{taking part in the}} first computer-animated feature. Lasseter said that on the challenges of the computer animation in the film [...] "We had to make things look more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history.</b> So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs." [...] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was either created out of clay or was first modeled off of a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer animated design. Once the animators had a model, articulation and motion controls were coded; this would allow each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping. Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth. The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.|$|E

Great minds make individual contributions of permanent value to the thought of their age; but they do not, and cannot, altogether transcend the age in which they live.... Even when they are propounding answers which are startlingly new, they use the inadequate ideas and concepts of tradition to express the deeper truths towards which they are feeling their way."

2500|$|Doctorate in Religion {{recipient}} Sandra Kahn {{notes the}} parallel between early Christians [...] "going out {{to spread the}} 'good new.' heedless of personal danger, and the early converts [...] taking the message to their hearts as fulfillment of their most cherished hopes.… providing {{a glimpse into the}} actual scenario of the mass teaching/conversion experience which is so similar to early Christianity" [...] even though [...] "a significant number of Southern fundamentalist Christians who religion orientation is primarily 'other-worldly,' convert to a religion which denies the literal beliefs which they have always held, replacing them with sophisticated symbolic interpretations in a 'this-world' setting." [...] Reviewing a small selection of converts Kahn found [...] "Concrete behavioral change take place. These are changes in habits such as fighting, drinking, [...] "partying", cursing, gambling, gossiping, and promiscuous sexual behavior…. Family relationships become more stable. Racially mixed relationships and marriages occur. There is a tendency to increase one's education, nutritional habits and medical practices. And the convert finds ways to use his own talents to contribute to the religion and personally help others, as well as accepting help." [...] Finding additional parallels with a study of mass conversion in Buddhism she finds [...] "Most of them are poor, illiterate, with centuries of oppression behind them" [...] akin to the Untouchables of India, and represents a stage in escaping the system of oppression, using a popular understanding of the religion's ideas rather than an intellectual one. While many who were initially enthusiastic about conversion fell away, none in Kahn's study formally converted back to Christianity. She found the tendency to convert to the Baha'i Faith transcended other options for those she studied - on the one hand it filled a need for a kind of personal salvation over that of a [...] "civil religion" [...] in the American mythos of civil rights and its [...] "sacred" [...] documents like the Declaration of Independence, and on the other it was more appealing that the Civil Rights Movement with its charismatic preachers and ideals because it was less personal and more a [...] "restatement of the old myth for the purpose of social action". She found that [...] "the two (southern Christian experience and the Baha'i Faith) are compatible for a fruitful encounter. In a sense they are complementary. The Baha'i [...] provides philosophical explanations, a broader world view, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> a sense of world unity, explanations of catastrophes and corruption, and in general gives a wider experience of purpose and meaning suitable to the new cultural environment of the South." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Boboli Gardens are not large--you {{wonder how}} compact little Florence finds {{room for them}} within her walls. But they are scattered, to their extreme, their all-romantic {{advantage}} and felicity, over a group of steep undulations between the rugged and terraced palace and a still-surviving stretch of city wall, where the unevenness of the ground much adds to their apparent size. You may cultivate in them the fancy of their solemn and haunted character, of something faint and dim and even, if you like, tragic, in their prescribed, their functional smile; as if they borrowed from the huge monument that overhangs them certain of its ponderous memories and regrets. This course is open to you, I mention, but it isn't enjoined, and will doubtless indeed not come up for you at all if it isn't your habit, cherished beyond any other, to spin your impressions to the last tenuity of fineness. Now that I bethink myself I must always have happened to wander here on grey and melancholy days. It remains none the less true that the place contains, thank goodness--or at least thank the grave, the infinitely-distinguished traditional taste of Florence--no cheerful, trivial object, neither parterres, nor pagodas, nor peacocks, nor swans. They have their famous amphitheatre already referred to, with its degrees or stone benches of a thoroughly aged and mottled complexion and its circular wall of evergreens behind, in which small cracked images and vases, things that, according to association, and with {{the law of the}} same quite indefinable, may make as much on one occasion for exquisite dignity as they may make on another for (to express it kindly) nothing at all. Something was once done in this charmed and forsaken circle--done or meant to be done; what was it, dumb statues, who saw it with your blank eyes? Opposite stands the huge flat-roofed palace, putting forward two great rectangular arms and looking, with its closed windows and its foundations of almost unreduced rock, like some ghost of a sample of a ruder Babylon. In the wide court-like space between the wings is a fine old white marble fountain that never plays. Its dusty idleness completes the general air of abandonment. Chancing on such a cluster of objects in Italy--glancing at them in a certain light and a certain mood--I get (perhaps on too easy terms, you may think) <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> that takes away my breath. Generations of Medici have stood at these closed windows, embroidered and brocaded according to their period, and held fetes champetres and floral games on the greensward, beneath the mouldering hemicycle. And the Medici were great people! But what remains of it all now is a mere tone in the air, a faint sigh in the breeze, a vague expression in things, a passive--or call it rather, perhaps, to be fair, a shyly, pathetically responsive--accessibility to the yearning guess. Call it much or call it little, the ineffaceability of this deep stain of experience, it is the interest of old places and the bribe to the brooding analyst. Time has devoured the doers and their doings, but there still hangs about some effect of their passage. We can [...] "layout" [...] parks on virgin soil, and cause them to bristle with the most expensive importations, but we unfortunately can't scatter abroad again this seed of the eventual human soul of a place--that comes but in its time and takes too long to grow. There is nothing like it when it has come.|$|E
