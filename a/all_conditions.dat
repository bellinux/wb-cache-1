He died in the German city of Kassel, after suffering liver failure. He was buried in Switzerland, where he had lived since the early 1930s. He is remembered {{as one of the}} greatest pre-1939 Grand Prix drivers, a perfectionist who excelled in <b>all</b> <b>conditions.</b> His record of six German Grand Prix wins remains unbeaten.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} previously, {{the molecules}} that underlie LTP {{can be classified}} as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a molecule, such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly <b>all</b> <b>conditions.</b> By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.|$|E
5|$|The Australian ringneck (Barnardius zonarius) is {{a parrot}} native to Australia. Except for extreme {{tropical}} and highland areas, the species has adapted to <b>all</b> <b>conditions.</b> Traditionally, two species were {{recognised in the}} genus Barnardius, the Port Lincoln parrot (Barnardius zonarius) and the mallee ringneck (Barnardius barnardi), but the two species readily interbred at the contact zone and are now considered one species. Currently, four subspecies are recognised, each with a distinct range.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant {{preference for the}} letters of one's own name over {{those of the other}} person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. <b>All</b> <b>conditions</b> gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E
5|$|The {{fountain}} looks unfinished, like concrete {{that has}} not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross from the corner of the plaza “like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open.” There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand in-between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the fountain and behind the falling water. The fountain and plaza are easily accessible to the public at all times and in <b>all</b> <b>conditions,</b> rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US$310,000, and it was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The Los Angeles Times reported that its actual cost was US$607,800.|$|E

This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours.|$|E
