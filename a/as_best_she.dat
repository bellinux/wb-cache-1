5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna. Maria Antonia's education was neglected, {{and when the}} French showed an interest in her, her mother went about educating her <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could about the court of Versailles and the French. Maria Theresa kept up a fortnightly correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called Marie Antoinette, in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing to conceive a child.|$|E
25|$|Henrietta Maria {{spent the}} autumn and winter of 1643 in Oxford with Charles, where she attempted, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could, to {{maintain}} the pleasant court life that they had enjoyed before the war. The Queen lived in the Warden's lodgings in Merton College, adorned with the royal furniture which had been brought up from London. The Queen's usual companions were present: Denbigh, Davenant, her dwarves; her rooms were overrun by dogs, including Mitte. The atmosphere in Oxford {{was a combination of}} a fortified city and a royal court, and Henrietta Maria was frequently stressed with worry.|$|E
25|$|The British hired armed cutter Sandwich {{was under}} the command of Lieutenant George Lempriere and {{cruising}} off the coast of Barcelona on 14 June 1799 when she sighted a large fleet. Lempriere believed the vessels to be a British fleet and sailed towards them. When the strange vessels did not reply to the recognition signals, Lempriere realized that they were enemy vessels and attempted to sail away. The French fleet detached a lugger, possibly Affronteur, to pursue Sandwich. A frigate joined the lugger in pursuit and towards evening the lugger opened fire with her bow chasers. The frigate then too opened fire, with Sandwich returning fire <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could. By 1a.m. the frigate was within musket shot of Sandwich and any further resistance would have been futile. Lempriere then struck to Créole.|$|E

25|$|According to Sigmund Freud, {{being unable}} to accept the illness of her child, Victoria ended up {{distancing}} herself from her first-born, which made {{a great impact on}} the behaviour of the future William II. However, other authors, such as the historian Wolfgang Mommsen, insist that the Crown Princess was very affectionate with her children. According to him, Vicky wanted her children to be like the idealised figure of her own father and tried, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could, to follow the educational precepts of Prince Albert. In 1863, Victoria and Frederick bought a cottage in Bornstedt so that their children could grow up in an environment similar to that of Osborne House. However, Victoria's influence on her offspring had an important limitation: like all the Hohenzollerns, her sons received a military training from a very young age, and the Crown Princess feared that such education would undermine their values.|$|E
25|$|Battle is raging outside. Arindal {{is anxious}} {{and refuses to}} lead the army out. Morald does so instead. Ada appears with her two {{children}} by Arindal. She seems to throw them into a fiery abyss. Meanwhile, defeated warriors rush in. Ada refuses to console Arindal saying {{she has come to}} torment him instead. More defeated warriors arrive with reports that Morald has disappeared, captured or dead. Then Harald, who was sent to bring reinforcements, comes. He reports that his army was defeated by one led by Ada. Arindal curses her. Zemina and Farzana express joy that Ada will remain immortal. But she sorrowfully explains that the fairy-king had required as a condition of her renouncing her immortality, that she conceal her fairy background from Arindal for eight years and on the last day torment him <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> can. If he cursed her, she would remain immortal and be turned to stone for a hundred years while he would go mad and die. In truth, Morald is not dead, the army Harald led was full of traitors, and the children are still alive. Already Arindal can feel his sanity slipping.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, Ariadne had been rotated {{out of the front}} patrol line and laid at anchor in the {{entrance}} of the Weser River in support of the cruisers and torpedo boats on patrol. After receiving reports of the British attack on {{the morning of}} the 28th, Ariadne and several other cruisers got up steam and rushed to support the German patrols.

500|$|Pauline {{remains a}} family-oriented {{character}} {{throughout the course}} of the show. A [...] "fiercely loyal, but overbearing mother"; sheltering and taking on the major responsibilities of her children and frequently stressing the importance of family. She is portrayed as a traditionalist, with strict rules and beliefs—the first to criticise, but also the first to defend her children, often interfering in their issues and causing rifts in their relationships. The quintessential matriarch, she has also been compared with Queen Elizabeth, with the storylines in the fictional Albert Square, mirroring the troubles of England as a whole. [...] In Monarchies: What Are Kings and Queens For, the author points out similarities between the matriarchal nature of Pauline's character, and that of the Queen. [...] "Both exhibit a rich mix of suffering and duty. [...] Pauline has tried to bring up her family <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> can, even though it hasn't always been easy. [...] Her offspring have caused her nothing but trials and tribulations; her husband has been wayward at times and caused her several eyebrow-raising moments. [...] But Pauline has steadfastly carried on..." ...|$|E
500|$|Rudolf Kempe, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} associate conductor in 1960, became principal conductor in 1961 and music director in 1962. Beecham's widow ran {{the affairs of the}} orchestra <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could, but some senior players including Brymer and MacDonagh were unhappy with the management, and they left. The orchestra reorganised itself in 1963 as a self-governing limited company, but almost immediately encountered difficulties. The Royal Philharmonic Society decided not to engage the RPO for its concerts; Glyndebourne booked the LPO instead of the RPO from 1964 onwards. The RPO was also excluded from the London Orchestral Concert Board's schedule of concerts, which meant that it was denied the use of London's main concert venue, the Royal Festival Hall. [...] Kempe resigned, although he returned shortly afterwards. Helped by strong support from [...] Sir Malcolm Sargent, the orchestra successfully mounted its own concerts at a cinema in Swiss Cottage, [...] to the north-west of the Festival Hall. A 1965 report to the Arts Council by a committee chaired by Alan Peacock recommended that all four independent London orchestras should receive adequate public subsidy.|$|E

500|$|Writer Cody was {{impressed}} with the production design team's creation of the set from only a few sentences in her script, calling Juno's bedroom [...] "a very emotional set for [...] because it reminded me so much of my own little habitat when I was a teenager." [...] The walls of Juno's room are covered with posters of bands, while Leah's room includes a mural of older men whom she finds attractive, and Paulie's room is designed to be overly childlike to indicate his innocence. Production designer Steve Saklad designed Mark and Vanessa's house with the assumption that [...] "Vanessa has probably read every home magazine and tried to copy what's in them <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could." [...] Costume designer Monique Prudhomme was nominated for a Costume Designers Guild Award in the [...] "Excellence in Contemporary Costume Design for Film" [...] category. She dressed Vanessa in clothes that were [...] "simple and very tasteful" [...] but with an [...] "anal-retentive quality," [...] while dressing Mark in conservative clothing that complements Vanessa's taste. It was Page's suggestion that Juno wear flannel shirts and sweater-vests. Page also had to wear two sizes of prosthetic belly fitted like a corset in the back, as well as a third [...] "real" [...] belly that is seen when Juno has an ultrasound and a variety of sizes of fake breasts. The footage displayed on Juno's ultrasound monitor is of supervising sound designer Scott Sanders's son Matthew and was embedded into the scene in post-production.|$|E

50|$|Sejima {{intentionally}} overturns outmoded stereotypical housing {{models as}} {{they are based on}} assumptions instead of reality.

Instead of unconsciously applying assumptions to a design, she tries to confront them consciously <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> can. She thinks it is impossible to let a building completely based on a fictional idea or theory of what something should be.|$|R
2500|$|As a child, Elizabeth was the {{particular}} favorite of her father. She resembled him {{both physically and}} temperamentally. She was a bright girl, if not brilliant, but received only a desultory formal education. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education. He had a son (and grandson) {{from his first marriage}} to a noblewoman, and did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid and second wife might one day inherit the throne. Indeed, no woman had ever sat upon the throne of Russia yet. It was therefore left to Catherine to raise the girls <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>she</b> could, but she was herself too uneducated to be able to superintend the formal education of her daughters. Elizabeth had a French governess and grew fluent in Italian, German and French. She was also an excellent dancer and rider. Like her father, Elizabeth was physically active and loved riding, hunting, sledging, skating, and gardening. From her earliest years, she delighted everyone with her extraordinary beauty and vivacity, and was regarded as the leading beauty of the Russian Empire. The wife of the British minister (ambassador) described Elizabeth as [...] "fair, with light brown hair, large sprightly blue eyes, fine teeth and a pretty mouth. She is inclinable to be fat, but is very genteel and dances better than anyone I ever saw. She speaks German, French and Italian, is extremely gay and talks to everyone..." ...|$|E
