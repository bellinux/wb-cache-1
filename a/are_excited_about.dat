5|$|At Al's apartment, Woody {{learns that}} he {{is based on a}} 1950s TV show called Woody's Roundup, and that along with the other Roundup toys—Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete the Prospector—he is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo, Japan. While the others <b>are</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> going, Woody intends to return home to Andy. Jessie {{explains}} that the museum is only interested in the collection if it is complete, and without Woody, they will be returned to storage. When Woody's arm is torn off completely, Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape, but is foiled when Al's television set turns on, and blames Jessie when he finds the TV remote in front of her. The next morning, Woody's arm is fixed by a toy repair specialist, and Woody learns that Jessie once belonged to a child named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will last forever in the museum. Woody decides to stay, now believing that all toys will eventually get discarded by their owners.|$|E

2500|$|Scientists <b>are</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> finding {{hydrated}} minerals such as sulfates and clays on Mars {{because they}} are usually formed {{in the presence of}} water. [...] Places that contain clays and/or other hydrated minerals would be good places to look for evidence of life. [...] Sulfate minerals were found above aluminum-rich clays; this implies that early on, when the clays were formed, the water was more neutral and probably easier for life to develop.
