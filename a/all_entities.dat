5|$|The {{book was}} not {{intended}} to either present or defend any particular position in environmental ethics, but rather to explore what process philosophers could say or have said about environmental issues. There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a process approach to environmental ethics. The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for process thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as process philosophy invariably models interpretation of <b>all</b> <b>entities</b> on human experience, it is not well-suited to characterising non-human nature. Palmer thus concludes that process philosophy does not provide a suitable basis for environmental ethics.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe discuss {{relations}} between cluster structures and so-called cluster prestructures. On the other hand, we place {{ourselves in the}} framework of a context where entity descriptions belong to a complete meet-semilattice. Such a context induces a Galois correspondence which, in turn, induces a closure operator on the powerset of the entity set. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a particular collection of fixed points of this closure operator to be hierarchical. Moreover, we specify the collection of <b>all</b> <b>entity</b> subsets which are both fixed points of this closure operator and strong clusters associated with a given pairwise dissimilarity function, {{as well as that of}} <b>all</b> <b>entity</b> subsets which are both fixed points of this closure operator and weak clusters associated with a given k-way dissimilarity function...|$|R

In March 2010, the US Congress passed regulatory reform of the American health insurance system. However, since this legislation is not fundamental healthcare reform, it is unclear what its effect will be and as the new legislation is implemented in stages, with the last provision in effect in 2018, it will be some years before any empirical evaluation of the full effects on the comparison could be determined.|$|E
25|$|Anatta (not-self): all dhammas lack a fixed, unchanging 'essence'; {{there is}} no permanent, {{essential}} ātta (self). A living being is a composite of the five aggregates (khandhas), which are the physical forms (rupa), feelings or sensations (vedana), perception (sanna), mental formations (sankhara), and consciousness (vinnana), none {{of which can be}} identified as one's Self. From the moment of conception, <b>all</b> <b>entities</b> (including all living beings) are subject to a process of continuous change. A practitioner should, on the other hand, develop and refine their mind to a state so as to see through this phenomenon. Truly understanding this counter-intuitive concept of Buddhism requires direct and personal experience. This is given in vipassanā practice, closely watching the continuous changes in the Five Aggregates.|$|E

500|$|For Whitehead, {{there is}} no such thing as wholly inert matter. [...] Instead, all things have some measure of freedom or creativity, however small, which allows them to be at least partly self-directed.

500|$|It {{should be}} emphasized, however, that for Whitehead God is not {{necessarily}} tied to religion. [...] Rather than springing primarily from religious faith, Whitehead saw God as necessary for his metaphysical system. [...] His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty {{in the world and}} provided an aim to <b>all</b> <b>entities.</b> [...] Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of God. [...] However, Whitehead was also interested in religious experience. [...] This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the consequent nature. [...] Whitehead's conception of God as a [...] "dipolar" [...] entity has called for fresh theological thinking.|$|E

500|$|Paula Findlen, {{writing in}} the Cambridge History of Science, asserts that Natural history was an ancient form of {{scientific}} knowledge, most {{closely associated with the}} writings of the Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder... His loquacious and witty Historia naturalis offered an expansive definition of this subject. [...] broadly described <b>all</b> <b>entities</b> found in nature, or derived from nature, that could be seen in the Roman world and read about in its books: art, artifacts, and peoples as well as animals, plants, and minerals were included in his project. Findlen contrasts Pliny's approach with that of his intellectual predecessors Aristotle and Theophrastus, who sought general causes of natural phenomena, while Pliny was more interested in cataloguing natural wonders, and his contemporary Dioscorides explored nature for its uses in Roman medicine in his great work De Materia Medica.|$|E
500|$|It must be emphasized, however, that {{an entity}} {{is not merely}} a sum of its relations, but also a {{valuation}} of them and reaction to them. [...] For Whitehead, creativity is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it is a human being, a tree, or an electron) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities, and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws. [...] Of course, most entities do not have consciousness. [...] As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, {{the same can be said}} of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow. [...] Moreover, inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of <b>all</b> <b>entities</b> means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.|$|E
500|$|Since Whitehead's metaphysics {{described}} a universe in which <b>all</b> <b>entities</b> experience, {{he needed a}} new way of describing perception that was not limited to living, self-conscious beings. [...] The term he coined was [...] "prehension", which comes from the Latin prehensio, meaning [...] "to seize." [...] The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious, applying to people as well as electrons. [...] It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of representative perception, in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities. [...] For Whitehead, the term [...] "prehension" [...] indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself. [...] In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them. [...] Further, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, causal efficacy (or [...] "physical prehension") and presentational immediacy (or [...] "conceptual prehension").|$|E
