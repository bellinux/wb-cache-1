He showed for the first time that induction of clinical and hematological remission in this disease was achievable. These findings promoted Farber as the [...] "father" [...] of the modern era of chemotherapy for neoplastic disease, having already been recognized for a decade as the [...] "father" [...] of modern pediatric pathology. Throughout the 1950s and '60s, Farber continued to make advances in cancer research, notably the 1955 discovery that the antibiotic <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> and radiation therapy could produce remission in Wilms' tumor, a pediatric cancer of the kidneys.

5000|$|While {{studying}} the Rous sarcoma virus at UW-Madison, Temin began {{to refer to}} the genetic material that the virus introduced to the cells, the “provirus.” Using the antibiotic, <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D,</b> which inhibits the expression of DNA, he determined that the provirus was DNA or was located on the cell’s DNA., These results implied that the infecting Rous sarcoma virus was somehow generating complementary double-stranded DNA. Temin's description of how tumor viruses act on the genetic material of the cell through reverse transcription was revolutionary. This upset the widely held belief at the time of a popularized version of the [...] "Central Dogma" [...] of molecular biology posited by Nobel laureate Francis Crick, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA (along with James Watson and Rosalind Franklin). Crick had claimed only that sequence information cannot flow out of protein into DNA or RNA, but he was commonly interpreted as saying that information flows exclusively from DNA to RNA to protein. Many highly respected scientists disregarded his work and declared it impossible. Despite the lack of support from the scientific community, Temin continued to search for evidence to support his idea. In 1969, Temin and a postdoctoral fellow, Satoshi Mazutani, began searching for the enzyme that was responsible for the phenomenon of viral RNA being transferred into proviral DNA. Later that year, Temin showed that certain tumor viruses carried the enzymatic ability to reverse the flow of information from RNA back to DNA using reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase was also independently and simultaneously discovered in association with the murine leukemia virus by David Baltimore at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1975, Baltimore and Temin shared the Nobel Prize of Physiology or Medicine. Both scientists completed their initial work with RNA-dependent DNA polymerase with the Rous sarcoma virus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> in low {{concentrations}} was suggested to inhibit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription via an extranucleolar mechanism. <b>Actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> was proposed to inhibit unique messenger RNAs (mRNAs) coding for proteins {{needed for the}} maintenance of rRNA transcription. According to this hypothesis <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> would bind to specific nonribosomal DNA with high affinity. This hypothesis was investigated by isolating high molecular weight rat liver DNA, digesting it with restriction endonuclease EcoRI, adding [³H] <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> in low concentration, performing RPC- 5 chromatography to separate the restriction fragments and subsequent hybridization to rRNA. It was observed that <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> bound to nonribosomal DNA with high affinity. The same experiment was performed with nucleolar DNA. High affinity <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> binding was not observed in nucleolar DNA. Discrete high affinity binding DNA for actinomycin in rat liver DNA was also observed when another restriction endonuclease BamHI was used to cleave rat liver DNA. However, with rat liver DNA digested with restriction endonuclease HindIII, such a high affinity <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> binding DNA was not observed. <b>Actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> was also demonstrated to bind to discrete site(s) in at least four more eukaryotic species (salmon, calf, herring and human) after DNA from these species were digested by EcoRI, labeled <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> added, and RPC- 5 chromatography performed. Labeled <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> bound to its high affinity binding DNA was displaced by unlabeled <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> in a concentration range of biological significance. However, six other antitumor agents, (doxorubicin, aclacinomycin, carminomycin, marcellomycin, musettamycin and pyrromycin) which also intercalate into DNA, did not significantly displace labeled <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> from its high affinity binding DNA. Since this high affinity <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> binding DNA is hypothesized {{to be involved in the}} inhibition of rRNA transcription, the <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> binding DNA could have a role in the regulation of rRNA transcription.

40|$|Many {{types of}} cancer cells possess the ability to evade apoptosis, leading to their rapid and {{uncontrolled}} proliferation. As major regulators of apoptosis, Bcl- 2 proteins serve as emerging targets for novel chemotherapeutic strategies. In this study, we examined the involvement of Bcl- 2 proteins in apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic agent <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D.</b> A dramatic decrease in anti-apoptotic myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl- 1) mRNA and protein expression was detected upon <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> treatment. Further, Mcl-l overexpression caused resistance to cell death upon treatment with <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D,</b> implicating a role for the downregulation of Mcl- 1 in actinomycin D-induced apoptosis. We also explored the therapeutic potential of <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> in combination with ABT- 737, an experimental agent that inhibits anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2 proteins. <b>Actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> sensitized cells to ABT- 737 treatment in a Bak- or Bax-dependent manner. Importantly, low concentrations of <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> and ABT- 737 were more effective in inducing cell death in transformed cells than their untransformed counterparts. A synergistic effect of <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> and ABT- 737 on cell death was observed in several human tumor cell lines. Like <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> treatment, knocking down Mcl- 1 expression greatly sensitized tumor cells to ABT- 737 and Mcl- 1 overexpression abrogated the cytotoxic effect induced by ABT- 737 and <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D.</b> These {{results suggest that the}} downregulation of Mcl- 1 by <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> is likely responsible for the observed synergistic effect between the two drugs.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the onset of synthesis of <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> in Streptomyces parvulus is due to a release from L-glutamate catabolic repression. In the present investigation we showed that S. parvulus has the capacity to maintain high levels of intracellular glutamate during the synthesis of <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D.</b> The results seem contradictory, since <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> synthesis cannot start before a release from L-glutamate catabolic repression, but a relatively high intracellular pool of glutamate is needed for the synthesis of <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D.</b> Utilizing different labeled precursors, D-[U- 13 C]fructose and 13 C- and 15 N-labeled L-glutamate, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, we showed that carbon atoms of an intracellular glutamate pool of S. parvulus were not derived biosynthetically from the culture medium glutamate source but rather from D-fructose catabolism. A new intracellular pyrimidine derivative whose nitrogen and carbon skeletons were derived from exogenous L-glutamate was obtained as the main glutamate metabolite. Another new pyrimidine derivative that had a significantly reduced intracellular mobility and that was derived from D-fructose catabolism was identified in the cell extracts of S. parvulus during <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> synthesis. These pyrimidine derivatives may serve as a nitrogen store for <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> synthesis. In the present study, the N-trimethyl group of a choline derivative was observed by 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in growing S. parvulus cells. The choline group, as well as the N-methyl groups of sarcosine, N-methyl-valine, and the methyl groups of an <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> chromophore, arose from D-fructose catabolism.

In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism of actinomycin D-induced STAT 3 phosphorylation.

40|$|Summary. Intrauterine, but not systemic, {{administration}} of <b>actinomycin</b> <b>D</b> on Day 10 increased oestrous cycle length in guinea-pigs.
