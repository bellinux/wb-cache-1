5|$|In a 16 December statement, three Stabæk Fotball {{officials}} said that they suspected that Ulrichen's plan all along was to convert the venue to a pure convention center, and that the use as a football venue was a decoy to get a free lot worth up to NOK200 million plus grants worth NOK50 million. The book value of the venue was NOK303 million {{at the end of}} 2010, although a statement from the district court stated that the value of the venue was significantly lower than that. The bank DnB NOR held at the time <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> with security in the property worth NOK260 million, while Ulrichsen through his investment company held <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> worth NOK60.1 million.|$|E

5|$|Salem Chapel {{stands on}} land {{which had been}} part of the old Napoleonic Barrack Ground. Hence the name for the nearby Waterloo Road. The land was {{auctioned}} in 1839, and in the following year the purchaser, a Mr George Gould, himself a Baptist, sold two plots fronting the London Road for the erection of a Baptist Chapel. The land was purchased and fenced for the sum of £300 which was raised by way of <b>a</b> <b>mortgage.</b> The original meeting room, (now the Church Parlour) was built and opened in July 1840.

5|$|These {{provisions}} {{are similar to}} those set out in section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 in relation to theft. It is clearly a right of property ownership to deal with property as one wishes, including its damage or destruction. However a person setting fire to his own house which is subject to <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> can be charged because the mortgagee will have a proprietary right or interest in the property. Property that is abandoned has no owner, and cannot be stolen; it follows that such property cannot be the subject of a charge of criminal damage.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining {{that they had a}} right to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River Tone was not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects {{with an interest in}} Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills and his family had left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan T.

After Jonathan gave up command of the Reaper, he and Jackalow worked on Jonathan's father's farm on Sachem's Head in Guilford, Connecticut, where Jackalow was regarded as family. At some point, while in New York, Jackalow had stolen $100 from Jonathan and fled to New Haven. He was returned to New York by the police, but Jonathan refused to testify against him and rehired him. Jonathan and his brother Elijah J. Leete subsequently bought the 30-ton sloop Spray, {{funded in part by}} <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> their father took out on his farm. Jonathan (the captain), Elijah, and Jackalow sailed the Spray together for two or three years. By March 1860, Jackalow had sailed with Jonathan for four years.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Stern, in January 1973 Heidemann photographed the Carin II, a yacht that {{formerly}} belonged to Göring. The boat {{was in a}} poor state of repair and expensive to maintain, but Heidemann took <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> on his Hamburg flat and purchased it. While researching {{the history of the}} yacht, Heidemann interviewed Göring's daughter, Edda, after which the couple began an affair. Through this relationship and his ownership of the boat he was introduced to a circle of former Nazis. He began to hold parties on the Carin II, with the former SS generals Karl Wolff and Wilhelm Mohnke as the guests of honour. Wolff and Mohnke were witnesses at Heidemann's wedding to his third wife in 1979; the couple went on honeymoon to South America accompanied by Wolff, where they met more ex-Nazis, including Walter Rauff and Klaus Barbie, who were both wanted in the West for war crimes.|$|E

5|$|The {{early years}} of {{operation}} were marred {{by a series of}} legal disputes, which were resolved when the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal Company and the Conservators, who managed the River Tone Navigation, agreed that the Canal Company should take over the Tone Navigation. The canal originally terminated at a basin at Huntworth, to the east of Bridgwater, but was later extended to a floating harbour at Bridgwater Docks on its western edge. Financially this was a disaster, as the extension was funded by <b>a</b> <b>mortgage,</b> and the arrival of the railways soon afterwards started the demise of the canal. The canal was rescued from bankruptcy by the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1866.|$|E
5|$|The family {{sold the}} {{building}} in 1953 to William Zeckendorf for its assessed price of $18 million.

In 1957, the Chrysler Building, its annex, and the nearby Graybar Building across 43rd Street was sold for $66 million in what {{was reported to be}} the largest real estate sale at the time. In 1960, it was purchased by Sol Goldman and Alex DiLorenzo, who received <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> from the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1961, the building's stainless steel elements, including the needle, crown, gargoyles, and entrance doors, were polished for the first time.

5|$|As Harvey's {{interests}} {{shifted to}} the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended {{and the number of}} visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.|$|E
50|$|To {{complete}} <b>a</b> legal <b>mortgage</b> it {{is normally}} necessary that {{title to the}} assets is conveyed into {{the name of the}} secured party such that the secured party (or its nominee) becomes the legal titleholder to the asset.

However, mortgages (legal and equitable) are non-possessory security interests. Normally the party granting the mortgage (the mortgagor) will remain in possession of the mortgaged asset.|$|R
