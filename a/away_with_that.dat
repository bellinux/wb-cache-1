However the District is ringed by high-rise buildings in many nearby suburbs like Arlington, Silver Spring, and Bethesda.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} 600 years, Sicily was a {{province}} of the Roman Republic and later Empire. It {{was something of a}} rural backwater, important chiefly for its grain fields, which were a mainstay of the food supply for the city of Rome until the annexation of Egypt after the Battle of Actium largely did <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> role. The empire made little effort to Romanize the region, which remained largely Greek. One notable event of this period was the notorious misgovernment of Verres, as recorded by Cicero in 70 BC in his oration, In Verrem. Another was the Sicilian revolt under Sextus Pompeius, which liberated the island from Roman rule for a brief period.|$|E
500|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature of Kew Asylum and its sister asylums {{is the use}} of a variation on ha-ha walls around the patients' courtyards. [...] They consisted of a trench, one side of which was vertical and faced with stone or bricks, the other side sloped and turfed. From the inside, the walls presented a tall face to patients, deterring them from escaping, while from outside the walls looked low so as not to suggest imprisonment. [...] A journalist with The Argus described the walls as an [...] "excellent arrangement, as it enables the patients to see the outside world, and does <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> gaol appearance and feeling inculcated by the walls of the old asylums". [...] Many of Kew's ha-ha walls were retained and remain intact, unlike those at Beechworth and Ararat which were partially dismantled or the trenches were filled in.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> and nor would you want to." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2006, {{more than}} 30 {{restaurant}} patrons, including {{a group of}} tourists and Democratic Alliance councillor Masizole Mnqasela, were arrested in a police raid for drinking in public. The restaurant did not sell alcohol, but Ngcawuzele explained {{that he could not}} stop people from bringing their own. [...] The incident generated controversy in the local press. Tour operator Ryan Hunt claimed that police swore at the patrons and threatened people for asking questions. [...] "The police created a dangerous situation. People are always encouraged to visit township attractions, but now they are turned <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> kind of situation," [...] he said. Mnqasela, a member of Cape Town's economic development committee, added, [...] "Mzoli's is internationally acclaimed and is key to township tourism. What kind of message is the police sending?" [...] The African National Congress approved the police actions, citing a need to curtail public drunkenness.|$|E
500|$|Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry {{liked the}} cast's scenes with the sumo suits, but saved {{most of her}} praise for Pam's speech. She {{declared}} that it [...] "was AMAZING. Jenna Fischer blew me <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> speech. It’s what I have been hoping for since the first episode of this season. It didn’t end with Jim swooping in and kissing Pam but there’s still one episode left in the season. So that’s {{what we have to}} ponder over the next week." [...] Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode. He wrote, [...] "I thought that it was a bit more low key than some of the previous episodes (hilarious sumo outfits not withstanding) and that suited me just fine. I thought that Michael's ridiculousness, always a difficult balancing act, was reigned-in to just this side of believable where it belongs. I thought that it was filled with a great assortment of gags, both character-based and farcical." [...] However, Black was critical of Pam's speech because it felt both [...] "forced" [...] and out of character for Pam to publicly state her feelings.|$|E

500|$|Fralic also {{described}} the character as being [...] "quixotic", who is [...] "deeply layered with arrogance and angst, imbued {{with all the}} failings and bravado that a true villain possesses, his dastardly deeds leaving him most recently responsible {{not only for the}} death of his own heart donor, but for the near-death of his granddaughter Summer from peanut poisoning". She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but [...] "like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration". Braeden describes the character as [...] "the villain" [...] and as [...] "defensive and always self-protective", stating that he's [...] "not here to win a popularity contest". He stated that he enjoys portraying Victor [...] "more than anything", also describing him as [...] "very complex". Braeden said that [...] "he fought himself to the position he arrived at a number of years ago", and that [...] "he obviously doesn't suffer fools easily, doesn't suffer enemies easily. He wants relationships badly, but doesn't quite trust them. It's a tragic flaw in him because of his childhood." [...] The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: [...] "Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor. My God almighty, that's something else that I, Eric Braeden, would never do. I always confront things directly. But when that doesn't work for Victor, he gets out his wallet [...] If you are abusive to him, he will be abusive to you. No one gets <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> I will not allow anyone to cross that line with the character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Singer {{stated that}} he had to tone down the special effects to keep the film age-appropriate for children. He said, [...] "This movie {{probably}} has a bigger on-screen body count than any movie I've done before. It's done in a way that's fun, but it was a challenge to get <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> without it becoming upsetting to people... It was about creating a tone like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars that allows you to get away with a lot of stuff because it feels like a movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|The sparse Lutheran congregations of the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland, e.g. in Bydgoszcz and Poznań, mostly {{comprising}} congregants {{from former}} Russian Poland, were expelled by the German occupants. Also {{the situation of}} the [...] , mostly comprising Poles of German language, deteriorated. While its congregants, if considered by the Nazi occupants to be of good breed for their Germanisation plans in the Wartheland, were treated in a way to win them for the Nazi politics, their church body and confessors of faith underlay the same anticlerical regulations by Arthur Greiser as the Catholics. While the Polish authorities had always protracted their confirmation of the United Evangelical Church in Poland as religious statutory corporation, Greiser had done <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> status for all religious bodies in the Wartheland. Greiser pressed the United Evangelical Church in Poland down to a mere civic association. Greiser's orders as to civic associations allowed only inhabitants who had been living before 1 September 1939 {{in the area of the}} Wartheland, and new immigrants – usually of German native language – from Soviet-annexed states (eastern Poland, Baltic states) to join these associations and only if they were not German citizens. Thus even General Superintendent Paul Blau, spiritual leader of the United Evangelical Church, who had been tolerated by the Polish authorities, although no Polish citizen, was declared a non-member of his own church body downgraded to an association, because he bore the German citizenship.|$|E
