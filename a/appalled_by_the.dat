5|$|Higginbotham was {{involved}} in the transition to open democratic elections in South Africa. He had visited South Africa in 1982 with other black jurists and had been <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> racial oppression he found and analogized to before the American Civil War. After apartheid's demise, Higginbotham consulted with Nelson Mandela and founded the South Africa Free Election (SAFE) Fund. He raised several million dollars to support fair elections in South Africa, and served as one of the international mediators of the first inter-racial elections in South Africa in 1994. After the election, he helped South Africa's newly elected government draft a new constitution.|$|E
5|$|Many Samians were <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{actions of}} their generals at Lade, and {{resolved}} to emigrate before their old tyrant, Aeaces of Samos, returned to rule them. They accepted {{an invitation from}} the people of Zancle to settle {{on the coast of}} Sicily, and took with them the Milesians who had managed to escape from the Persians. Samos itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade. Most of Caria now surrendered to the Persians, although some strongholds had to be captured through force.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, in the film, Lawrence is {{only made}} aware of the Sykes-Picot Agreement very late in the story and is shown to be <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> it, whereas <b>the</b> real Lawrence knew about it much earlier, while {{fighting}} alongside the Arabs.|$|R
5|$|Even though Champollion was <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rampant looting {{of ancient}} {{artefacts}} {{and destruction of}} monuments, the expedition {{also contributed to the}} destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled. Champollion's suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali's 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction of a museum in which to house the ancient artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a missing {{documentary}} film crew who had gone to the Amazon to film cannibal tribes. A rescue mission, led by the New York University anthropologist Harold Monroe, recovers the film crew's lost cans of film, which an American television station wishes to broadcast. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> team's actions, and after learning their fate, he objects to the station's intent to air the documentary. The presentation of the crew's lost footage, functioning similarly to a flashback, revolutionized the found footage style of narrative filmmaking, later popularized by such films as The Blair Witch Project.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to use Nonsuch Island as his base of operations throughout the 1930s, {{with the onset of}} World War II in 1939 it was announced that the ferry linking Bermuda to New York would soon be making its final run, requiring Beebe and his team to hastily abandon their station there. Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the environment was slowly being transformed due to the war. The large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island's reefs were being destroyed in order to construct an airfield, and the combination of construction activity and pollution made observation of the sea life impossible. <b>Appalled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island to a military contractor and returned to New York.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{first and}} most {{prominent}} United Nations Millennium Development Goal (MDG- 1) has been widely celebrated. Yet, four reflections should give us pause. Although retaining the idea of ‘‘halving extreme poverty by 2015 ’’, MDG- 1 in fact sets a much less ambitious target than had been agreed to at the 1996 World Food Summit in Rome: {{that the number of}} poor should be reduced by 19 % (rather than 50 %), from 1094 million to 883. 5 million. Tracking the $ 1 /day poverty headcount, the World Bank uses a method that may paint far too rosy a picture of the evolution of extreme poverty. Shrinking the problem of extreme poverty, which now causes some 18 million deaths annually, by 19 % over 15 years is grotesquely underambitious in view of resources available and the magnitude of the catastrophe. Finally, this go-slow approach is rendered even more <b>appalling</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contribution made to the persistence of severe poverty <b>by</b> <b>the</b> affluent countries and the global economic order they impose...|$|R
5|$|The {{operation}} {{never took}} place. Instead, the fighter force {{was committed to}} the disastrous Operation Bodenplatte, designed to support German forces during the Battle of the Bulge. Galland's influence on matters was now virtually nil. <b>Appalled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ardennes losses, he personally confronted Gollob and criticised him severely. Gollob contacted the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Himmler's reputation {{as the most powerful}} man after Hitler at that time may have been a prime motive. Gollob complained about his misuse in the Luftwaffe and Galland's leadership. The SS had already spread their influence into other areas of military affairs including the V-2 operations. Himmler, whose relationship with Göring was poor, took the opportunity to exploit the dissent in the Luftwaffe and undermine the Reichsmarschall by supporting Gollob. It was also an opportunity for the SS to seize control of the Luftwaffe and for Himmler to oust Göring from power. Göring, for his part offered no support to Galland when Himmler or the SS were mentioned. On 13 January 1945, Galland was finally relieved of his command.|$|E
5|$|This victory did not {{delay the}} workhouse's fate; {{the site was}} duly sold to the Catholic Church for £110,000, and {{demolition}} began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been <b>appalled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} Europeans entered Indiana during the 1670s, {{the region was}} in {{the final years of}} the Beaver Wars. The French {{attempted}} to trade with the Algonquian tribes in Indiana, selling them firearms in exchange for furs. This incurred the wrath of the Iroquois, who destroyed a French outpost in Indiana in retaliation. <b>Appalled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois, the French continued to supply the western tribes with firearms and openly allied with the Algonquian tribes. A major battle—and {{a turning point in the}} conflict—occurred near modern South Bend when the Miami and their allies repulsed a large Iroquois force in an ambush. With the firearms they received from the French, the odds were evened. The war finally ended in 1701 with the Great Peace of Montreal. Both Indian confederacies were left exhausted, having suffered heavy casualties. Much of Ohio, Michigan and Indiana was left depopulated as many tribes fled west to escape the fighting.|$|E

It was ridiculous, and was made almost terrible <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stillness of every other person present. It was contemptible, and was made <b>appalling</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> man's over-mastering horror of this awful sincerity, coming to him suddenly, with the confession of such a fact.

Did he think himself a proper person to be sitting in this cabin where his wife and children lived? Tell his niece! Expected him to tell his niece! His own brother's daughter! Shameless! Did I ever hear tell of such impudence?--he appealed to me. [...] "This man here ought to have gone and hidden himself out of sight instead of..." ...|$|R
