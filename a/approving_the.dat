5|$|By early 1972, {{with the}} {{monument}} to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the {{passage through the}} House of Commons of Heath's European Communities Bill, <b>approving</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom's accession to the European Economic Community. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's second reading, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, {{and in the next}} year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
5|$|The UN Charter {{was drafted}} {{at a conference}} between April–June 1945 in San Francisco, and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the {{conclusion}} of the conference; this charter took effect 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as <b>approving</b> <b>the</b> creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.|$|E
5|$|The end came swiftly in {{the months}} after the Grey Cup. By the time of a December 1 CFL Board of Governors meeting, the Mad Dogs had already folded and the Barracudas were on the brink. The Pirates held out a little longer and flirted with a {{relocation}} to Norfolk, but local officials broke off talks after they learned that Glieberman was still facing legal disputes in Shreveport. The Barracudas resurfaced in the news in January 1996 when Williams sold them for $750,000 to a group that planned to move them to Shreveport as a replacement for the Pirates. However, that deal was contingent upon the league <b>approving</b> <b>the</b> sale and relocation, which never happened.|$|E

5|$|Though the UN's primary mandate was peacekeeping, the {{division}} between the US and USSR often paralysed the organization, generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War. (A notable exception was a Security Council resolution in 1950 authorizing a US-led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea, passed {{in the absence of}} the USSR.) In 1947, the General Assembly approved a resolution to partition Palestine, <b>approving</b> <b>the</b> creation of the state of Israel. Two years later, Ralph Bunche, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict. In 1956, the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis; however, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country's revolution.|$|E
5|$|When the {{organization}} {{became aware that}} a certain person wanted to hold a reunion with Ojeda Ríos, they would discuss and analize it before <b>approving</b> <b>the</b> meeting, with the Commander issuing {{a report of the}} topics discussed afterwards. According to the briefing that followed his reunion with bishop González Nieves, it was established that the religious leader tried to convince him to move away from armed conflict and to abandon clandestine activities. However, Ojeda Ríos responded by replying that, despite respecting the motives behind these suggestions, he declined. He extended an offer of his own to the bishop to join the efforts of the EPB, which was turned down as well.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{released}} in Europe on November 14, 2008. It {{was published in the}} region by Rising Star Games. The game was also released in Australia on January 15, 2009. In North America, the title was published by Marvelous Entertainment USA in partnership with Xseed Games. The North American version used a different localization to the European version with further polishing performed by Xseed Games, which contributed the delay in releasing the game. Another reason for the delay was the game's unique nature, which made it a hard sell for the company, in addition to the flagging popularity of the DS at the time. Xseed Games spent an unspecified time deliberating over whether to release it in North America at all before <b>approving</b> <b>the</b> decision. Initially scheduled for March 2009, the game eventually released in North America on June 16. In English territories, the subtitle was changed to Murder and Mystery in Paradise, while the game's original title remained intact.|$|E

5|$|The NCTA's November 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report {{included}} {{a proposal for}} an 89-mile (143km), $793 million rail system. The {{total cost of the}} proposed highway and rail system was less than the 1959 plan due to the elimination of controversial freeways. The plan was supported by President Kennedy, but opposed by highway advocates in Congress who reduced the rail system to only 23-miles (37km) within the District of Columbia. However, that proposal was defeated in Congress shortly after President Kennedy's death. The Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 passed Congress, which promised 66% federal funding for urban mass transportation projects. Encouraged by the new act, the NCTA recommended the formation of a private entity or a multi-state authority to operate the system using more non-federal funds. On September 8, 1965, President Johnson signed the National Capital Transportation Act of 1965 <b>approving</b> <b>the</b> construction of a 25-mile (40km) rapid transit system.|$|E
5|$|Versions of Gill Sans {{were created}} {{in a wide range}} of styles such as {{condensed}} and shadowed weights. An ultra-light version slightly lighter than the normal light style was also not digitally available until the 2015 Nova release. Several shadowed designs were released, including a capitals-only regular shadowed design and a light-shadowed version with deep relief shadows. In the metal type era, a 'cameo ruled' design that placed white letters in boxes or against a stippled black background was available. The shadowed weights were intended to be used together with the regular, printing in different colours, to achieve a simple multicolour effect. Some of the decorative versions may predominantly have been designed by the Monotype office, with Gill examining, critiquing and <b>approving</b> <b>the</b> designs sent to him by post. The long series of extensions, redrawings and conversions into new formats of one of Monotype's most important designs (extending long beyond Gill's death) has left Gill Sans with a great range of alternative designs and releases. A book weight was created in 1993 in between the light and regular weight, suitable for body text, along with a heavy weight.|$|E
