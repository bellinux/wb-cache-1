For {{the next two years}} he showed no discernible career path or ambition.

500|$|Voorhis {{resisted}} all encouragement {{toward a}} business or management career, {{much to his}} father's disappointment. [...] While attending Yale, he came to believe [...] that [...] "the Christian Gospel is to be taken seriously, and that needless poverty and suffering {{on the one hand}} and special privilege and inordinate power on the other are entirely contrary to its precepts". [...] He later stated that he lacked the faith in his own judgment to leave Yale <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> in [...] "the real world [...] lay beyond the college walls". [...] However, once he graduated, Voorhis engaged a room at a boarding house and went to work as a receiving clerk, a job he soon exchanged for one as a freight handler. Later in 1923, he was laid off. In 1923 and 1924, he served as a traveling representative for the YMCA in Germany, though his stay was cut short by illness.
