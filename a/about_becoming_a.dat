500|$|Chris claimed Kate Hudson's {{influence}} on his lyrics was subtle: [...] "More so than a literal reference to her, it's {{the vantage point}} from where I'm writing.

The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role.
