25|$|I used {{to watch}} him and Graham working on IMT, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> with great envy. So I said 'what about Bert Newton?' If Iâ€™m {{going to work with}} {{somebody}} I want to know that he's as sharp as anything and a real pro.|$|E
6000|$|... 32 [...] I think I {{could turn}} {{and live with}} animals, they are so placid and [...] self-contain'd, [...] I stand <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> long and long.|$|E
6000|$|... "See!" [...] whispered Coutchie-Coulou, [...] "there {{are some}} birds {{swimming}} in the water yonder. Let us go <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> for we also may be birds someday." ...|$|E
60|$|Somerfield, sullen and discontented, came <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> moved away, <b>and</b> then hesitatingly returned.|$|R
60|$|Osborn {{stopped a}} yard or two off <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> with sternly {{controlled}} rage.|$|R
60|$|She listened, went {{to where}} our murdered guards lay with unstained spears, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|And isn't it pleasant, Fanny went on thinking, {{how young}} men bring out lots of silver coins from their trouser pockets, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> {{instead of having}} just so many in a purse? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In their ways, {{in their}} places--Yes. But {{not if you}} go up to them <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> Not at the dinner table, not in their beds.... What a time of disillusionment you must have had! ...|$|E
6000|$|Now every queen in {{the company}} became visibly {{agitated}} (Smith, who was watching Ma-Mee, saw her hold up her hands <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them),</b> while all the Pharaohs pointed with their fingers and exclaimed together, {{in a voice that}} rolled round the hall like thunder: ...|$|E
60|$|Dorothy {{sat down}} on an old stump <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> her eyes {{twinkling}} with amusement.|$|R
60|$|But none of {{the people}} became scorpions, so the King stopped <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> in surprise.|$|R
60|$|Saladin leant {{his head}} upon his hand, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> with {{disappointed}} eyes, yet not unkindly.|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the ceiling}} there hung, {{too high to}} be {{conveniently}} dusted, a few stuffed birds, and one small alligator. 'Some of these days,' said Abner to himself, 'I am goin' {{to get on a}} step-ladder <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> birds and things; I never did properly know what they was.' ...|$|E
60|$|During {{this time}} the younger people of the town came {{frequently}} pretty near them, and would stand <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> and sometimes talk with them at some space between; and particularly {{it was observed that}} the first Sabbath-day the poor people kept retired, worshipped God together, and were heard to sing psalms.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will go up}} stairs <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> If I'm not mistaken, my boy, {{we shall}} run to earth the gang who are {{flooding}} {{the country with the}} most dangerous counterfeit known, {{at the same time that}} we bag the murderers. Do you think you could lead me to the house in the woods?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lucilla {{flew into}} his arms with a cry of delight. I stood behind <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
60|$|They {{crossed the}} room. The {{man on the}} couch opened his eyes <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> dully.|$|R
60|$|The head induna {{in command}} of the impi stepped forward <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> then felt their hearts.|$|R
6000|$|Fulkerson {{naturally}} paid {{no attention}} to what she said, being but secondarily interested in the children at the best. [...] "Here are some things right in this neighborhood, within gunshot of the office, and if you want you can go <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> to-night; the agents gave me houses where the people would be in." ...|$|E
60|$|ECRASIA. He has insulted us! outraged us! profaned his art! You {{know how}} much we hoped from the twelve busts he placed in the temple to be {{unveiled}} today. Well, go in <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> That is all I have to say. [She sweeps to the curved seat, and sits down just where Acis is leaning over it].|$|E
60|$|Where {{and how do}} our coast heroes fight? I answer--{{sometimes}} on the cliffs, {{sometimes on}} the sands, sometimes on the sea, and sometimes even on the pierheads. Their operations are varied by circumstances. Let us draw nearer <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> while in action, and observe how the enemy assails them. I shall confine myself at present to a skirmish.|$|E
60|$|Lenora turned <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> {{both with}} an air of blank astonishment. The Inspector was a little embarrassed.|$|R
60|$|And he rose up {{from his}} feet, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> lo! they were a King and a Queen.|$|R
60|$|Joe turned <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> as if waking from a trance. His stolid face {{took on a}} shamed expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll see if his {{magnificent}} Majesty King Kik-a-bray is at home," [...] said he. He {{lifted his}} head and called [...] "Whee-haw! whee-haw! whee-haw!" [...] three times, in a shocking voice, turning about and kicking with his heels against the panel of the door. For a time there was no reply; then the door opened far enough to permit a donkey's head to stick out <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|Such is the {{catalogue}} of Mary Lawrie's features, drawn out with care by {{one who has}} delighted for many hours to sit <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> All the power of language which the writer possesses {{has been used in}} thus reproducing them. But now, when this portion of his work is done, he feels sure that no reader of his novel will have the slightest idea of what Mary Lawrie was like.|$|E
60|$|When I was {{a student}} at the University of Toronto thirty years ago, I lived,--from start to finish,--in {{seventeen}} different boarding houses. As far as I am aware these houses have not, or not yet, been marked with tablets. But they are still {{to be found in the}} vicinity of McCaul and Darcy, and St. Patrick Streets. Any one who doubts the truth of what I have to say may go <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hetty turned <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> Flora Schuyler {{was smiling}} bravely, the man {{standing}} still with grave astonishment in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|The {{inspector}} {{lifted one}} of the packs of cards which had been dashed upon the table <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> thoughtfully.|$|R
60|$|As to Tom, he was {{perfectly}} delighted. He could have sat <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> {{just as they}} were, for hours.|$|R
60|$|Often {{and often}} she walked mournfully round {{the place where}} Haley's gang {{of men and women}} sat in their chains. She would glide in among them, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> with an air of perplexed and sorrowful earnestness; and {{sometimes}} she would lift their chains with her slender hands, and then sigh wofully, as she glided away. Several times she appeared suddenly among them, with her hands full of candy, nuts, and oranges, which she would distribute joyfully to them, and then be gone again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] laughed Joan. [...] "All {{things are}} possible. It was the {{possession}} of a hand that transformed monkeys into men. We used to take things up, you know, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> and wonder and wonder and wonder, till at last there was born a thought and the world became visible. It is curiosity that will lead us to the next great discovery. We must take things up; and think and think and think till one day there will come knowledge, and we shall see the universe." ...|$|E
60|$|My lord went to London {{every year}} for six weeks, and the family being too poor to appear at Court with any figure, he went alone. It was not until {{he was out of}} sight that her face showed any sorrow: and what a joy when he came back! What {{preparation}} before his return! The fond creature had his arm-chair at the chimney-side--delighting to put the children in it, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> there. Nobody took his place at the table; but his silver tankard stood there as when my lord was present.|$|E
60|$|They sat {{and smoked}} and drank whisky and water, and I {{stood by the}} fire also smoking <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
60|$|At the call, {{the horse}} pricked up his ears <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> curiously. Then he took {{half a dozen}} steps forward.|$|R
60|$|When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, {{laid down}} the newspaper, {{stretched}} himself <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> all around.|$|R
