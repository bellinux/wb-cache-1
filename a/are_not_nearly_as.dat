There are 82,870 German Americans in the city, making up over one-fifth (23.1%) of the population. The Scandinavian-American population is primarily Norwegian and Swedish. There are 39,103 Norwegian Americans, making up 10.9% of the population; there are 30,349 Swedish Americans, making up 8.5% of the city's population. Danish Americans <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> numerous; there are 4,434 Danish Americans, making up only 1.3% of the population. Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish Americans together make up 20.7% of the population. This means that ethnic Germans and Scandinavians together make up 43.8% of Minneapolis's population, and make {{up the majority of}} Minneapolis's non-Hispanic white population. Other significant European groups in the city include those of Irish (11.3%), English (7.0%), Polish (3.9%), French (3.5%) and Italian (2.3%) descent.|$|E
25|$|For generations, {{the disease}} was treated with an {{application}} of the antiseptic gentian violet. Today, topical or oral antibiotics are usually prescribed. Mild cases may be treated with bactericidal ointment, such as mupirocin. In 95% of cases, a single antibiotic course results in resolution in children. It has been advocated that topical disinfectants <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> efficient as antibiotics, and therefore should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{strength}} of individual CNT shells is extremely high, weak shear interactions between adjacent shells and tubes lead to significant reduction in the effective strength of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube bundles down to only a few GPa. This limitation has been recently addressed by applying high-energy electron irradiation, which crosslinks inner shells and tubes, and effectively increases {{the strength}} of these materials to ≈60 GPa for multi-walled carbon nanotubes and ≈17 GPa for double-walled carbon nanotube bundles. CNTs <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> strong under compression. Because of their hollow structure and high aspect ratio, they tend to undergo buckling when placed under compressive, torsional, or bending stress.|$|E

25|$|With the {{collapse}} of farming in the 19th century and its continued decline {{in the state in}} the 20th century, forests spread back over much of the land. They are not the same forests, however: Chestnut trees, for instance, wiped out by a disease, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> prevalent as they once were, and the lack of their nuts affects the populations of various mammals. Stone walls, built largely in the nineteenth century, provide more welcoming homes to certain species; and mammals from Europe, including the house mouse and Norway rat, and from elsewhere (such as the coyote) can create a different competitive environment for some species and a different food source for some (the barn owl, for instance, can now feed on Norway rats).|$|E
25|$|Forced begging is a {{profitable}} practice in which exploiters {{are motivated by}} economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked {{for the purpose of}} begging have been examined as comparable to a medium-size business enterprise. In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30–40,000 USD for the profiteer. Though family networks <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed that a family with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary. Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing capabilities. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families. UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in which parents are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.|$|E
500|$|The {{prevailing}} northwest winter winds also {{limit the}} lake's influence. [...] Places near the shoreline can receive lake-effect snow, {{but because the}} state lies north and west of the lake, snowfall amounts <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> large {{as they are in}} locations like Wisconsin and Michigan that lie downwind to the south. Even so, the single largest snowstorm in Minnesota history was a lake effect event. [...] On January 6, 1994, Finland, Minnesota, received [...] of lake effect snow in 24 hours, and [...] over a three-day period. Both are Minnesota records. At [...] per year, the port city of Duluth has the highest average snowfall total of any city in Minnesota. [...] At , Grand Marais has the lowest average summer temperature of any city in the state.|$|E

500|$|The hot, {{dry climate}} makes it {{difficult}} for soil to form. Mass wasting, the down-slope movement of loose rock, is therefore the dominant erosive force in mountainous area, resulting in [...] "skeletonized" [...] ranges (mountains with very little soil on them). Sand dunes in the park, while famous, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> widespread as their fame or the dryness of the area may suggest. The Mesquite Flat dune field is the most easily accessible from the paved road just east of Stovepipe Wells in the north-central part of the valley and is primarily made of quartz sand. Another dune field is just [...] to the north but is instead mostly composed of travertine sand. The highest dunes in the park, and some of the highest in North America, are located in the Eureka Valley about [...] to the north of Stovepipe Wells, while the Panamint Valley dunes and the Saline Valley dunes are located west and northwest of the town, respectively. The Ibex dune field is near the seldom-visited Ibex Hill in the southernmost part of the park, just south of the Saratoga Springs marshland. All of the latter four dune fields are accessible only via unpaved roads. Prevailing winds in the winter come from the north, and prevailing winds in the summer come from the south. Thus the overall position of the dune fields remains more or less fixed.|$|E
500|$|Turpin is {{best known}} for his {{exploits}} as a highwayman, but before his execution the only contemporary report of him as such was in June 1737, when a broadsheet entitled [...] "News news: great and wonderful news from London in an uproar or a hue and cry after the Great Turpin, with his escape into Ireland" [...] was published. [...] Although some of his contemporaries became the subject of chapbooks, names such as James Hind, Claude Duval and William Nevison, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> well-known today as the legend of Dick Turpin, whose fictionalised exploits first began to appear around the turn of the 19th century. [...] It was, however, the story of a fabled ride from London to York that provided the impetus for 19th-century author William Harrison Ainsworth to include and embellish the exploit in his 1834 novel Rookwood. [...] Ainsworth used Turpin as a plot device, describing him in a manner that makes him more lively than the book's other characters. [...] Turpin is introduced with the pseudonym Palmer, and is later forced to escape on his horse, Black Bess. [...] Although fast enough to keep ahead of those in pursuit, Black Bess eventually dies under the stress of the journey. [...] This scene appealed more to readers than the rest of the work, and as Turpin was depicted as a likeable character who made the life of a criminal seem appealing, the story came to form part of the modern legend surrounding Turpin. The artist Edward Hull capitalised on Ainsworth's story, publishing six prints of notable events in Turpin's career.|$|E

2500|$|However, this is {{beginning}} to change. The Royal Netherlands Navy for one is starting to experiment with composite materials like resins or carbon fiber. These materials, when formed into a propeller, are flexible enough under pressure to “deflect,” which can reduce cavitation. Other [...] options are made from carbon fiber, epoxy resin, or even glass, {{and are able to}} produce “a hydro elastic effect”. Since these new propellers can flex and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> rigid under pressure, the risk of cavitation is reduced.|$|E

[...] Composite sticks generally weigh less than their aluminum forebears, and they can be manufactured with more consistent (and varied) physical properties than their wooden counterparts. [...] They are, however, considerably more expensive than wooden sticks, and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> durable as the older aluminum sticks.|$|E

Plant viruses are grouped into 73 genera and 49 families. However, these figures relate only to cultivated plants that represent {{only a tiny fraction}} of the total number of plant species. Viruses in wild plants have been poorly studied, but those studies that exist almost overwhelmingly show that such interactions between wild plants and their viruses do not appear to cause disease in the host plants.|$|E
2500|$|The Court had to {{contrast}} the [...] "automobile exception" [...] with long standing court decisions which held that portable containers such as suitcases, despite their mobility, {{are not subject}} to the same warrantless search as automobiles. The rationale for this is that suitcases and the like <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> mobile as an automobile, and detaining a container while awaiting a warrant is practical. Furthermore, containers are presumed to have a much higher expectation of privacy than vehicles, since their primary purpose is to transport belongings, and most are opaque (some are even locked), which suggests that the owner of a container generally does not expect the contents to be visible or accessible to others.|$|E
2500|$|A {{knitting}} needle or knitting pin {{is a tool}} in hand-knitting to produce knitted fabrics. [...] They generally have a long shaft and taper at their end, but they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> sharp as sewing needles. [...] Their purpose is two-fold. [...] The long shaft holds the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, {{to prevent them from}} unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to form new stitches. Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the tapered end through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the initial stitch and forms a new active stitch in its place. [...] In specialized forms of knitting the needle may be passed between active stitches being held on another needle, or indeed between/through inactive stitches that have been knit previously.|$|E

2500|$|Out of all {{immigrant}} groups, Moroccan immigrants used French the most, which gained increasing importance alongside Berber and Moroccan Arabic {{in their}} already bilingual community. The Turks {{held on to}} their own language, although French also gained importance in their community. Dutch struggled to take hold in these two migrant groups. [...] Children from these communities attended (and often continue to attend) French-language education, and used French in their circles of friends and at home. This evolution is also seen with Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian migrants, who easily adopted French due to its similarity to other Romance languages that many already spoke. The northern Europeans, who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> numerous, came mainly after the 1980s, {{make more use of}} their own languages, such as English and German. When these northern Europeans happened to marry French-speakers, the language spoken at home often became French. In these groups, the long-term effects and trends of language shift are difficult to determine.|$|E

6000|$|There are wasps too, here, {{who make}} pretty little jar-shaped nests, round, with a neatly lined round lip. Paper-nests, too, more {{like those of}} our tree-wasps at home, hang from {{the trees in the}} woods. [...] Ants' nests, too, hang {{sometimes}} from the stronger boughs, looking like huge hard lumps of clay. And, once at least, we have found silken nests of butterflies or moths, containing many chrysalids each. Meanwhile, dismiss from your mind the stories of insect plagues. If good care is taken to close the mosquito curtains at night, the flies about the house <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> troublesome as we have often found the midges in Scotland. As for snakes, we have seen none; centipedes are, certainly, apt to get into the bath, but can be fished out dead, and thrown to the chickens. The wasps and bees do not sting, or in any wise interfere with our comfort, save by building on the books. The only ants who come into the house are the minute, harmless, and most useful 'crazy ants,' who run up and down wildly all day, till they find some eatable thing, an atom of bread or a disabled cockroach, of which last, by the by, we have seen hardly any here. They then prove themselves in their sound senses by uniting to carry off their prey, some pulling, some pushing, with a steady combination of effort which puts to shame an average negro crew. And these are all we have to fear, unless it be now and then a huge spider, which it is not the fashion here to kill, as they feed on flies. So comfort yourself with the thought that, as regards insect pests, we are quite as comfortable as in an country-house, and infinitely more comfortable than in English country-house, and infinitely more comfortable than in a Scotch shooting lodge, let alone an Alpine chalet.|$|E
