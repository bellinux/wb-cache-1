40|$|AbstractChina faces serious {{air quality}} {{challenges}} in both outdoor and indoor environments due to particularly {{high levels of}} air pollution where maximum values greatly exceed current air quality standards.

40|$|Many {{types of}} indoor {{pollution}} problems {{are found in}} homes. The most effective approach to solving these problems is usually to remove or reduce the sources of indoor pollution. Ventilation also helps remove indoor air pollutants, but not as effectively as source reduction. <b>Air</b> <b>cleaning</b> devices (<b>air</b> filters and air cleaners) can also be helpful when used along with source reduction and ventilation. The best solution to the air pollution within your home will depend, of course, on your particular problem, the effect it is having on your family's health, and your family’s budget. The information below will help you decide if an <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> device would be useful {{as a part of}} your solution to indoor pollution, and if so, what type might best meet your needs. Many of the principles discussed here also apply to offices, schools, and vehicles. How Effective Are <b>Air</b> <b>Cleaning</b> Devices? <b>Air</b> <b>cleaning</b> devices alone cannot adequately remove all indoor pollutants from homes. This is especially true when the sources emit a large amount of pollution, or when the pollutants settle rapidly on surfaces. Most <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> devices will remove some of the particles from the indoor air, but will not effectively remove certain types of pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, radon, odors...|$|R
40|$|Approximately {{ten percent}} of the energy {{consumed}} in U. S. commercial buildings is used by HVAC systems to condition outdoor ventilation air. Reducing ventilation rates would be a simple and broadly-applicable energy retrofit option, if practical counter measures were available that maintained acceptable concentrations of indoor-generated air pollutants. The two general categories of countermeasures are: 1) indoor pollutant source control, and 2) <b>air</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Although pollutant source control should be used to the degree possible, source control is complicated by the large number and changing nature of indoor pollutant sources. Particle <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> is already routinely applied in commercial buildings. Previous calculations indicate that particle filtration consumes only 10 percent to 25 percent of the energy that would otherwise be required to achieve an equivalent amount of particle removal with ventilation. If cost-effective <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were also available, outdoor air ventilation rates could be reduced substantially and broadly in the commercial building stock to save energy. The research carried out in this project focuses on developing novel VOC <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies needed to enable energy-saving reductions in ventilation rates. The minimum required VOC removal efficiency to counteract a 50 percent reduction in ventilation rate for <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems installed in the HVAC supply airstream is modest (generally 20 percent or less) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>cleaning</b> {{techniques}} {{have been applied}} worldwide {{with the goal of}} improving indoor air quality. The effectiveness of applying these techniques varies widely, and pollutant removal efficiency is usually determined in controlled laboratory environments which may not be realized in practice. Some air cleaners are largely ineffective, and some produce harmful by-products. To summarize what is known regarding the effectiveness of fan-driven <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies, a state-of-the-art review of the scientific literature was undertaken by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from Europe, North America, and Asia with expertise in <b>air</b> <b>cleaning,</b> aerosol science, medicine, chemistry and ventilation. The effects on health were not examined. Over 26, 000 articles were identified in major literature databases; 400 were selected as being relevant based on their titles and abstracts by the first two authors, who further reduced the number of articles to 160 based on the full texts. These articles were reviewed by the panel using predefined inclusion criteria during their first meeting. Additions were also made by the panel. Of these, 133 articles were finally selected for detailed review. Each article was assessed independently by two members of the panel and then judged by the entire panel during a consensus meeting. During this process 59 articles were deemed conclusive and their results were used for final reporting at their second meeting. The conclusions are that: (1) None of the reviewed technologies was able to effectively remove all indoor pollutants and many were found to generate undesirable by-products during operation. (2) Particle filtration and sorption of gaseous pollutants were among the most effective <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies, but there is insufficient information regarding long-term performance and proper maintenance. (3) The existing data make it difficult to extract information such as Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR), which represents a common benchmark for comparing the performance of different <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies. (4) To compare and select suitable indoor <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> devices, a labeling system accounting for characteristics such as CADR, energy consumption, volume, harmful by-products, and life span is necessary. For that purpose, a standard test room and condition should be built and studied. (5) Although there is evidence that some <b>air</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies improve indoor air quality, further research is needed before any of them can be confidently recommended for use in indoor environments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Currently, dilution ventilation is the usual application in the hospitality industry. However, with the use of optimal ventilation (replacement ventilation rather than dilution ventilation, with correct air exchange rates and separation between smokers and non-smokers areas) and <b>air</b> <b>cleaning,</b> quite considerable reductions of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can be achieved.
