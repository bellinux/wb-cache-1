2500|$|... 1985 {{was to see}} Keke Rosberg set {{the all-time}} Formula 1 {{qualifying}} lap record for 17 years after posting fastest qualifying time for the race with an average speed of 258.983km/h (160.92mph). Silverstone, which was already a very fast circuit, was becoming faster and faster and the cars were lapping the circuit in the low 1-minute range. The race was an exciting one with Brazilian rising star Ayrton Senna making a great start from 4th and taking the lead by the first corner. He led {{until late in the}} race, when his car was running out of fuel while Prost was pushing him hard; Senna eventually ran out of fuel and Prost went on to take victory. 1986 saw a huge crowd thanks to Mansell being a favourite to win; his newly found fame <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> competitive team would help the British Grand Prix to see huge crowds for several years. This race saw 42-year-old Jacques Laffite get involved in a first corner accident and slam head-on into the barriers, breaking both his legs and ending his Formula One career. Nigel Mansell, whose car broke {{at the start of the}} first race, got into his teammate Piquet's spare car and won the race; although this was the last F1 race at Brands Hatch. A number of people had concerns about the speeds of the cars on the small track; particularly the European Grand Prix held at Brands Hatch the previous year. The southern English circuit was getting to be very fast- now with these 1,000+ hp, 1,180 pound cars, pole sitter Piquet's average qualifying speed was 140.483mph (227.583km/h) and his lap time was in the 1 minute 6-second range, compared to the 1 minute 20-second range in 1976. But Brands Hatch's demise was for political reasons- the international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts for one circuit per Grand Prix. Brands Hatch was perceived as a poorer facility, and considering most of the track was located in a very old forest it did have very little run-off and room to expand, something Silverstone had in acres. Silverstone and the BRDC had signed a seven-year contract with Formula 1 and FISA at some point in 1986, to run from 1987 to 1993.|$|E
50|$|Bammy is {{made from}} bitter cassava (also called yuca and manioc in other American cultures).

60|$|Gregory watched its {{progress}} from a hill-side pasture as it trailed {{slowly along the}} rising and falling road. The songs of the young girls, interrupted by the explosion of hotel slogans and college cries from the young men, floated off {{to him on the}} thin breeze of the cloudless August morning, like the hymns and shouts of a saturnalian rout going in holiday processional to sacrifice to their gods. Words of fierce Hebrew poetry burned in his thought; the warnings and the accusals and the condemnations of the angry prophets; and he stood rapt from his own time <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dream of days when the Most High stooped to commune face to face with His ministers, while the young voices of those forgetful or ignorant of Him, called to his own youth, and the garlanded chariots, with their banners and their streamers passed on the road beneath him and out of sight {{in the shadow of the}} woods beyond.|$|E
6000|$|What Fanny {{had planned}} to do if Miss M., plain and simple, had {{occupied}} the Signorina's table I cannot even guess. For the spectacle of the squat, black, gloating guy she actually found there, she was utterly unprepared. It seemed, as I looked at her, that myself had fainted--had withdrawn out of my body--like the spirit in sleep. Or, maybe, {{not to be too}} nice about it, I merely [...] "became" [...] my disguise. With mind emptied of every thought, I sank into an almost lifeless stagnancy, and with a heavy settled stare out of my black and yellow, from under the coarse fringe that brushed my brows, I met her eyes. Out of time <b>and</b> <b>place,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lightless, vacant solitude, we wrestled for mastery. At length the sneering, incredulous smile slowly faded from the pale, lovely face, leaving it twisted up as if after a nauseous draught of physic. Her gaze faltered, and fell. Her bosom rose; she coughed and turned away.|$|E

50|$|Growing cobra lilies {{from seed}} is {{extremely}} slow and cobra seedlings {{are difficult to}} maintain, so these plants are best propagated from the long stolons they grow in late winter and spring.
