The club inquired about Quique Sánchez Flores, Sven-Göran Eriksson and others, ultimately choosing Flores. Rui Costa led the transfer <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> Benfica continued to invest heavily, spending nearly €19 million on Javier Balboa, Carlos Martins, Pablo Aimar and Sidnei and bringing in José Antonio Reyes and David Suazo on loan. Major departures included Rui Costa, Cristian Rodríguez, Petit and Nélson.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on children's {{engagement}} in extracurricular activities {{from the perspective of}} middle-class parents in Rome, Italy, and Los Angeles, California. Analysis of parents' accounts captured in interviews and ethnographic fieldwork reveals that both sets of parents perceive <b>activities</b> <b>as</b> important for children's success. Yet Roman parents consider <b>activities</b> <b>as</b> part of "children's world," downplaying intense involvement and performance. Conversely, L. A. parents view <b>activities</b> <b>as</b> preparing children for adult life, emphasizing competition and accomplishment. [childhood, extracurricular activities, family, United States, Italy]...|$|R

5|$|As stated above, the hydrolytic {{proteins}} Rrp6 and Rrp44 {{are associated}} with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different proteins, Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein. Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> well, the existence of this activity has recently been questioned and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.|$|E

5|$|In February 1793, amid rising {{political}} tension, the French Republic {{declared war}} on Great Britain, drawing Britain into the French Revolutionary Wars. At sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Western Approaches and the English Channel all became areas of significant naval <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> French privateers sailed on raiding cruises against British merchant shipping. To augment these attacks, the French naval authorities dispatched squadrons of frigates to attack British trade routes. To counter these operations, the Royal Navy sent their own frigates to sea, sometimes in squadrons and sometimes on single patrols.|$|E

5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} species of Cyathus produce {{metabolites}} with biological activity, and novel chemical structures that are specific to this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C.helenae, C.africanus and C.earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C.striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, and {{have the potential to}} be developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C.stercoreus, have significant antioxidant <b>activity,</b> <b>as</b> do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C.stercoreus. Various sesquiterpene compounds have also been identified in C.bulleri, including cybrodol (derived from humulene), nidulol, and bullerone.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 118Category4 hurricanes have been {{recorded}} in the eastern and central Pacific basins since 1900. Only two Category4 hurricanes {{have been recorded}} in May, in addition to 12in June, 22in July, 29in August, 32in September, 18in October, and two in November. No Category4 storms have developed during the off-season. It is theorized that global warming was responsible for an increase of 13Category4 and 5 storms that developed in the eastern Pacific, from 36in the period of 1975–1989 to 49in the period of 1990–2004. It was estimated that if sea-surface temperatures ascended by 2 to 2.5degrees, the intensity of tropical cyclones would increase by 6–10% internationally. During years with {{the existence of an}} El Niño, sea-surface temperatures increase in the eastern Pacific, resulting in an increase in <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> vertical wind shear decreases in the Pacific; the opposite happens in the Atlantic basin during El Niño, when wind shear increases creating an unfavourable environment for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic. Contrary to El Niño, La Niña increases wind shear over the eastern Pacific and reduces it over the Atlantic.|$|E
