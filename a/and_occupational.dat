40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to extend {{research}} on employee affective commitment in three ways: (1) instead of organizational commitment the focus is on occupational commitment; (2) the role of proactive personality on affective occupational commitment is examined; <b>and</b> (3) <b>occupational</b> satisfaction is examined as a mediator and political skills as moderator in the relationship between proactive personality <b>and</b> affective <b>occupational</b> commitment. Two connected studies, one in a hospital located in the private sector and one in a university located in the public sector, are carried out in Pakistan, drawing on a total sample of over 400 employees. The results show that proactive personality is positively related to affective <b>occupational</b> commitment, <b>and</b> that <b>occupational</b> satisfaction partly mediates the relationship between proactive personality <b>and</b> affective <b>occupational</b> commitment. No effect is found for a moderator effect of political skills in the relationship between proactive personality <b>and</b> affective <b>occupational</b> commitment. Political skills however moderate the relationship between proactive personality and affective organizational commitment. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|R

5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical <b>and</b> <b>occupational</b> therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{folk songs}} include ballads, lyrical songs, lullabies and children's songs, {{seasonal}} songs based around holidays such as Christmas, life-cycle songs that celebrate weddings, baptisms {{and other important}} events, dance songs, cattle calls <b>and</b> <b>occupational</b> songs, tied to professions such as fishermen, shepherds and soldiers. Ballads (canti epico-lirici) and lyric songs (canti lirico-monostrofici) are two important categories. Ballads are most common in northern Italy, while lyric songs prevail further south. Ballads are {{closely tied to the}} English form, with some British ballads existing in exact correspondence with an Italian song. Other Italian ballads are more closely based on French models. Lyric songs are a diverse category that consist of lullabies, serenades and work songs, and are frequently improvised though based on a traditional repertoire.|$|E

5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 <b>and</b> <b>Occupational</b> Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living <b>and</b> <b>occupational</b> functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E
