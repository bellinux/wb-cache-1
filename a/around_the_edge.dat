5|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, {{curvilinear}} perspective {{found its way into}} paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait contains a convex mirror with reflections {{of the people in the}} scene, while Parmigianino's Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E
5|$|The 1981 Doctor Who episode Logopolis, {{which was}} filmed at Crowsley Park, used {{a model of}} the Lovell Telescope as the Pharos Project, from which the Doctor played by Tom Baker fell and regenerated. The model was based on the Mark I telescope, but it also {{featured}} some modifications from the Mark IA telescope such as the rim <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the dish.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} pieces is a large dish weighing , in the centre of which is a relief depiction of the Last Supper. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> at the top, bottom and sides are four engravings of biblical scenes: the Washing of the Feet, the Walk to Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's Commission to the Apostles, divided by scrolls of foliage. Made by London goldsmith Henry Greenway in 1664 for the Duke of York and later acquired by CharlesII, it stands on the high altar during the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|This covers {{most of the}} reserve. Silver birch is dominant, with a few crack willow, goat willow, {{some wild}} cherry and {{sycamore}} in the canopy. Shrubs include hawthorn, elder, holly, yew and rowan, with garden escapes like buddleia, Oregon grape, cotoneaster, privet. There are some saplings of pedunculate oak, mostly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge,</b> and holm oak. The field layer is mainly thick bramble, with ivy in denser shade. Ferns include male fern, broad buckler fern and the less common lady fern.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
30|$|Again note, {{that only}} {{critical}} {{regions of the}} background mesh, i.e., mostly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cube <b>edges,</b> are refined. Other regions not affecting the approximation quality remain unchanged. Figure 26 a visualizes this adaptive refinement by highlighting all nodes of the background mesh. As {{can be seen from}} the figure, the originally regular distribution of nodes is interrupted by an accumulation of nodes mostly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> This accumulation <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> is due to the additional elements, which were introduced into the background mesh during the refinement.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are various}} types of sunburst finishes. Some common types include [...] "vintage sunburst", which is golden yellow in the very center and black <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges,</b> [...] "cherry sunburst" [...] - {{sometimes}} disparagingly called [...] "clownburst", which is a golden yellow {{at the very center}} and cherry red towards <b>the</b> <b>edges,</b> [...] "tobacco sunburst", which is golden yellow in the very center and burgundy <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges,</b> and [...] "three-color sunburst," [...] which fades from golden yellow at the center through a layer of red and finally to black <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> <b>The</b> finish is often transparent in order to show, and accentuate, attractively-patterned wood or wood veneers such as flame maple, but may be opaque where the wood is not strongly figured, such as basswood or alder.|$|R

5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} barbican had been {{demolished}} {{to make way}} for houses and the moat had begun to be occupied with housing. By 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the bailey wall. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running {{down the side of the}} keep.|$|E
5|$|Freema Agyeman, {{who played}} Martha Jones in Doctor Who and Torchwood, {{introduced}} the episode, which was shown {{on a large}} screen above the stage and smaller screens <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the Dress Circle in the Royal Albert Hall. As the Doctor addressed them, the Royal Albert Hall audience shouted back responses. Manuscript paper fell to the stage as the Doctor was seen to feed his sheet music to the orchestra. When the Graske sneaked through the portal, he appeared in the audience carrying the Doctor's water pistol and squirting members of the audience. A cellist had to defend himself from an attack by the Graske who promptly exited as, on screen, the Doctor pulled {{him back to the}} TARDIS. The Graske in the audience was Jimmy Vee in costume and prosthetics.|$|E

5|$|Gradual {{intensification}} {{took place}} throughout September20, attaining {{the status of}} tropical storm by 1800UTC and received the name Emily. The storm tracked in a general west-northwest direction <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a strong subtropical ridge. By 1200UTC on September21, the center of Emily passed directly over St. Vincent with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Situated underneath an anticyclone, rapid intensification took place as the storm quickly tracked towards Hispaniola. In the 24-hour span between 1800UTC on September21 and 1800UTC on September22, the central barometric pressure of the storm dropped 44mbar (hPa) to 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg) and winds increased to 125mph (205km/h), equivalent to a high-end Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. At the time of peak intensity, the hurricane hunters recorded flight-level winds of 155mph (250km/h) and unofficial pressure of 949mbar (hPa; 28.02inHg).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of Dunedin, it was {{impossible}} for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills. Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1785, the {{government}} had taken possession of Southsea Common, the marshland surrounding the castle, to ensure it remained open and accessible to the fort's guns, and convicts were deployed to fill in and flatten out the marshes from 1831 onwards. The surrounding area began to develop as an urban centre; seaside facilities were established {{at the start of}} the century and in the 1840s new private housing was built <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the common, used by military and naval officers. The construction of a railway line from London enabled the settlement of Southsea, named after the castle, to turn into a prosperous resort. Southsea Common was leased by the local government in 1884 and, as the population grew, practising firing the castle's guns became more difficult.|$|E

5|$|The keep {{appears to}} lie on the highest ground in the area, {{although}} this is actually located to the south, within in the deer park. Visitors would have been funnelled <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> {{of the park and}} by the town wall towards the south gate of the castle, a route dominated by the views of the keep and tower. The addition of the high tower had made the castle visible to anyone entering from Devon, framing it strikingly against the hills. The keep, park and town walls probably symbolised Richard's authority as earl, and the historian Andrew Saunders has argued that the keep and high tower were also intended to resemble Richard of Cornwall's crown in his role as the King of the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The pale brown-skinned ovoid {{tunicate}} bulbs have a membranous {{tunic and}} a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs {{in a ring}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge,</b> which grow up to 40mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Etau was {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone to impact Japan since Typhoon Tokage in 2004. Forming on August8, 2009 {{from an area}} of low pressure, the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking in a curved path <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a subtropical ridge, Etau continued to intensify as it neared Japan. By August10, the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a weak tropical storm with winds of 75km/h (45mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 992hPa (mbar). Shortly after, Etau began to weaken. Increasing wind shear led to the center becoming devoid of convection and the system eventually weakened to a tropical depression on August13. The remnants of Etau persisted for nearly three days before dissipating early on August16.|$|E

5|$|Lindow Moss is a {{peat bog}} in Lindow, {{an area of}} Wilmslow, Cheshire, which {{has been used as}} common land since the medieval period. It formed after the last ice age, one of many such peat bogs in {{north-east}} Cheshire and the Mersey basin that formed in hollows caused by melting ice. Investigations have not yet discovered settlement or agricultural activity <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of Lindow Moss that would have been contemporary with Lindow Man; however, analysis of pollen in the peat suggests there was some cultivation in the vicinity. Once covering over , the bog has now shrunk to a tenth of its original size. It is a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there. For centuries the peat from the bog was used as fuel, and it continued to be extracted until the 1980s, by which time the process had been mechanised. Lindow Moss is a lowland raised mire; this type of peat bog often produces the best preserved bog bodies, allowing more detailed analysis. Lowland raised mires occur mainly in northern England and extend south to the Midlands. Lindow Man is one of 27bodies to be recovered from such areas.|$|E
5|$|M-37 parts East Beltline Avenue {{and turns}} west along I-96. The freeway runs west and then north <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of Grand Rapids. Near 3Mile Road, I-96/M-37 runs west again, {{continuing}} across the Grand River and meeting the US Highway 131 (US131) freeway. The next interchange immediately west of US131 is for Alpine Avenue, which M-37 follows north. This road runs through a commercial and retail corridor {{in the communities}} of Walker and Comstock Park. South of 6Mile Road, Alpine Avenue widen into a four-lane divided highway. This highway splits from Alpine Avenue north of 8Mile Road and turns to the northwest as the surroundings transition to rural farmland again. M-37 transitions back to a two-lane road south of Sparta. The trunkline passes {{to the west of}} Kent City and crosses into Muskegon County at Casnovia. Through this area, the highway parallels a line of the Marquette Rail that runs north from Grand Rapids.|$|E
5|$|Most turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), {{one pair}} in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have many eyes in {{clusters}} over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable {{the animals to}} avoid it. A few groups have statocysts, fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts {{are thought to be}} balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how they sense the movements and positions of the solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell sensors.|$|E
