5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world <b>and</b> <b>taught</b> me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|Author Raven Grimassi {{has written}} {{extensively}} about Aradia in his popularization of Stregheria, presenting what he admits is his own personal rendering of her story.

5|$|During the Reformation, Martin Luther {{rejected}} {{many of the}} Catholic Church's seven sacraments, but retained baptism and the Lord's Supper. He {{saw many}} practices of the medieval church as abuses of power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone. Luther attached the promise of salvation to baptism, <b>and</b> <b>taught</b> that life after baptism should be spent in recollection {{of it and the}} dying to sin it signified.|$|E

5|$|In Byzantium, the {{elementary}} school teacher occupied a low social position <b>and</b> <b>taught</b> mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used). However, the grammarian and rhetorician, teachers responsible for the following two phases of education, were more respected. These used classical Greek texts like Homer's Iliad or Odyssey and {{much of their time}} was taken with detailed word-for-word explication. Books were rare and very expensive and likely only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students.|$|E

5|$|In interviews, Colbert has {{described}} his parents as devout people who also strongly valued intellectualism <b>and</b> <b>taught</b> their children {{that it was}} possible to question the church and still be Catholic.

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1934, Himmler oversaw the {{creation}} of SS-Junkerschule (Junker schools), institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, political and ideological indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness as part of the SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men <b>and</b> <b>taught</b> them self-confidence. The first schools were established at Bad Tölz and Braunschweig, with additional schools opening at Klagenfurt and Prague during the war.|$|E
5|$|Ke Hyung No, 8th dan (WTF), {{was invited}} to Australia by the Victoria Judo Federation in 1965, <b>and</b> <b>taught</b> taekwondo {{alongside}} judo.

5|$|Lemoine was {{accepted}} into the École Polytechnique in Paris {{at the age of}} twenty, the same year as his father's death. As a student there, Lemoine, a presumed trumpet player, helped to found an amateur musical group called La Trompette, for which Camille Saint-Saëns composed several pieces. After graduation in 1866, he considered a career in law, but was discouraged by the fact that his advocacy for republican ideology and liberal religious views clashed with the ideals of the incumbent government, the Second French Empire. Instead, he studied <b>and</b> <b>taught</b> at various institutions during this period, studying under J. Kiœs at the École d'Architecture and the École des Mines, teaching Uwe Jannsen at the same schools, and studying under Charles-Adolphe Wurtz at the École des Beaux Arts and the École de Médecine.
