25|$|After ruling Mexico {{for most}} of the past century, the return of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) brought hope to the {{supporters}} and fear to those remembering the old PRI tactics of making deals with the cartels in exchange for relative peace. According to an article published by The Economist on 23 June 2012, part of the reason why Peña Nieto and the PRI won lies in the disappointment of the rule of the National Action Party (PAN). Buffeted by China's economic growth and the economic recession in the United States, the annual growth of Mexico's economy between 2000 and 2012 was of 1.8%. Poverty worsened, and without a ruling majority in Congress, the PAN presidents were unable to pass structural reforms, leaving monopolies and Mexico's educational system unchanged. In 2006, Felipe Calderón chose to make the battle against organized crime the centerpiece of his presidency. Nonetheless, with over 60,000 dead, many Mexican citizens <b>are</b> <b>tired</b> of a fight they had first supported.|$|E
25|$|The play {{opens with}} Wong, a water seller, {{explaining}} {{to the audience}} that {{he is on the}} city outskirts awaiting the foretold appearance of several important gods. Soon the gods arrive and ask Wong to find them shelter for the night. They <b>are</b> <b>tired,</b> having travelled far and wide in search of good people who still live according to the principles that they, the gods, have handed down. Instead they have found only greed, evil, dishonesty, and selfishness. The same turns out to be true in Szechwan: no one will take them in, no one has the time or means to care for others – no one except the poor young prostitute Shen Teh, whose pure inherent charity cannot allow her to turn away anyone in need. Shen Teh was going to see a customer, but decides to help out instead; however confusion follows leaving Wang fleeing from the illustrious Ones, leaving his water carrying pole behind.|$|E
25|$|It is such {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, to have made all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and say you are protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They <b>are</b> <b>tired</b> of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. It was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E

It was later revealed that another Fionna and Cake episode was {{in the works for}} season five, and that the plot would largely revolve around Marshall Lee. The episode—titled [...] "Bad Little Boy"—aired on February 18, 2013. In the episode, the princesses that are captured by the Ice King <b>are</b> <b>tired</b> of his poorly written Fionna and Cake fan fiction stories, so Marceline stops by the Ice Kingdom to show him how to do it properly; she tells a tale involving her gender-swapped character, Marshall Lee.

[...] He described Smith's [...] "control, tone and warmth" [...] as [...] "very moving". Overall, he gave the album 4 out of 5.

Andy Gill, reviewing Wonderland for The Independent, gave a more mixed review. He said that the influence of Alice in Wonderland was often hard to perceive, and said that Cohen and Smith had [...] "sweetened the classical elements".

500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{also created}} great {{interest}} in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, [...] "The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance , but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America—we <b>are</b> <b>tired</b> of hearing her boast {{that she is the}} freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system—our Tories hate her democrats—our Whigs hate her parvenus—our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy." [...] Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{division}} {{among the}} generals {{came to a}} head {{at a meeting of the}} MRC on August 26–27. Khánh said the instability was due to troublemaking by members and supporters of the Catholic-aligned Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), whom he accused of putting partisan plotting ahead of the national interest. Prominent officers associated with the Đại Việt included Thieu and Khiêm. Khiêm blamed Khánh's weakness in dealing with Buddhist activists for the demonstrations in the cities and the rural losses to the communists. Thieu and another Catholic General Nguyễn Hữu Có called for the replacement of Khánh with Minh, but the latter refused. Minh claimed that Khánh was the only one who would get funding from Washington, so they should support him, prompting Khiêm to angrily say [...] "Obviously, Khánh is a puppet of the US government, and we <b>are</b> <b>tired</b> of being told by the Americans how we should run our internal affairs." [...] Feeling pressured by the strong condemnations of his colleagues, Khánh promised to resign, but no replacement was agreed upon and another meeting was convened.|$|E
500|$|Politics {{is present}} as an {{underlying}} theme in Spook Country {{to a greater}} extent than in any of the author's previous novels. The novel can be read as an exploration of the fear, uncertainty and pervasive paranoia of an America riven by the unending and divisive Iraq War. Although he had avoided overtly political themes in his previous work out of a distaste for didacticism, Gibson found that in the Bush era, politics had [...] "jacked itself up to my level of weirdness". Of the climate in Washington, D.C. during that period, he disclosed in a 2007 interview that [...] "I like the sheer sort of neo-Stalinist denial of reality. That's what makes it work. It's interesting." [...] Mike Duffy in Scotland on Sunday characterized the novel as a [...] "startling, effective guidebook to post-9/11 America"; Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times elaborated, proposing that it was [...] "arguably the first example of the post-post-9/11 novel, whose characters <b>are</b> <b>tired</b> of being pushed around by forces larger than they are – bureaucracy, history and, always, technology – and are at long last ready to start pushing back".|$|E

When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise's limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit.

500|$|While {{critical}} reviews were mixed, {{the game}} proved popular with players. The game's alpha footage, {{as well as}} Let's Play videos on pre-release copies such as that from PewDiePie, drew {{a great deal of}} demand for the game prior to release. Ibrisagic stated that Coffee Stain Studios made their money back on the development costs within a few minutes of the game being offered on Steam. As of August 2014, the studio has reported that nearly a million copies of Goat Simulator have been sold, outperforming their other games over the previous four years. The mobile release for iOS and Android systems reached 100,000 downloads within 6 days of launch. By mid-January 2015, over 2.5 million copies of the game were sold across all platforms. During a presentation at the 2016 Game Developers Conference, Ibrisagic revealed that Goat Simulator has made more than $12 million in revenue, compared to both Sanctum and Sanctum 2 which made under $2 million each. Goat Simulator was seen as a disruptive title in contrast to typical AAA titles; Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester felt they needed to publish more games like Goat Simulator, stating [...] "You have to have an edge in there, and that's why I say 'more Goat Simulator and less Call of Duty' for Paradox, because we need the edge.
