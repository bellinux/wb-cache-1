6000|$|... "I don't {{have any}} books to read, {{and all the}} spare time <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> off into the woods; that rests me better than stories," [...] {{answered}} Phebe, as she finished one job and began on another.|$|R
60|$|She. Yes. No! Oh, give me time! The day <b>after.</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> into my 'rickshaw {{here and}} meet Him at Peliti's. You ride.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{plenty to}} be done; {{but not enough}} to kill anybody. <b>After</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> used to the ways of the place I reckon it'll come pretty easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I presume," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "that <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> there {{everything}} will become natural. But I don't {{like to look}} forward. It--scares me. I can't form any idea of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I hain't sure but I shall stay in New York <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> there, an' if I do I'll {{give you}} fellows lots of sails in the boat. You see I'm-" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{figure out}} what I'm going to do <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> settled here," [...] {{returned}} Fred. He suddenly began to smile. [...] "Say! things have been happening since we left home, haven't they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{find your}} mother, baby darling, {{the very first}} thing <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> out of this scrape; but there couldn't any one blame me for runnin' away when the perlice are after me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's been more'n a {{year since}} I had these on," [...] he said, [...] "an' I {{may be a little}} slow an' stale at first; but <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> warmed up I'll do better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I replied, [...] "I'm {{not going}} to shingle any more--except for {{exercise}} <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> my homestead in the west--but I think--I'm not sure--I think I can make a living with my pen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll not forget, Rainer. It's {{likely that}} we shall be in Yarmouth {{in a couple of}} days, and you may depend upon my looking up the old woman as soon <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> ashore as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say," [...] he said, {{with sudden}} fierceness, [...] "don't you go fooling around that slide until <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> {{the trees in}} and rooted. It's mighty dangerous, and I sure can't afford to lose you now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>I</b> {{was just}} <b>after</b> {{the boy who}} ordered them for me, and he says {{they are to be}} done in two days, sure. It won't take an hour to fix them up <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> them." ...|$|R
50|$|Habitual {{aspect is}} {{frequently}} expressed in unmarked form in English, as in I walked {{to work every}} day for ten years, I walk {{to work every day}}, and I will walk to work every day <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to say that you had savings?" [...] one of the other {{officers}} exclaimed. [...] "Who ever heard of such a thing? I never have a pistole left in my pocket a week <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> my month's pay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{see a new}} scholar {{enter this}} school and she does not happen [...] to suit me exactly in her ways and manners, <b>I</b> very often <b>get</b> [...] prejudiced against her, though {{sometimes}} I find her a valuable [...] friend, <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> acquainted with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They won't {{be worth}} much <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to work. Going to law's {{expensive}} and Thirlwell can't {{stand up to}} the men who are backing me. He'll be glad to sell out at our price when we put the screw to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Down a bit--not much. Da Souza {{seems to}} be selling out {{carefully}} a few at a time, and my brokers are buying most of them. Pound shares are nineteen shillings to-day. They'll be between three and four pounds, a week <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're not a farmer," [...] Daylight said. The {{young man}} laughed {{and shook his}} head. [...] "No; I'm a {{telegraph}} operator. But the wife and I {{decided to take a}} two years' vacation, and ... here we are. But the time's about up. I'm going back into the office this fall <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> the grapes off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that, Bill, an' I'm goin' {{to talk to}} Mr. Davis now. I {{was only}} sayin' I wouldn't do it if things wasn't the way they are. I'll go ahead, an' you fellers meet me up to the room <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> through, 'cause it won't do for all hands to loaf 'round {{in front of the}} engine-house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} the man that he is to ask {{if there is any}} answer," [...] the captain said. [...] "And if your sister is as sharp as you are she will write the same sort of letter, and I will bring it across with me to England the first voyage <b>I</b> make <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, maybe you're right. But these {{assistant}} aviators in {{the crowd}} get me wild.... All right? Hoorray. Here goes.... Say, don't stop for anything <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> off. Leave the boys to pack up, and you hustle over to Sea Cliff for the speed-boat. You {{ought to be in}} New Haven almost as soon as I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course, if {{you want}} me to," [...] assented Anne cheerfully. [...] "I'd do {{anything}} to oblige you. But you'll have to tell me what to say for this once. <b>After</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> into bed I'll imagine out a real nice prayer to say always. I believe that it will be quite interesting, now that I come to think of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|On August 14, 2014, Frogpad founder Linda Marroquin {{stated that}} the Frogpad license to Satori Tech Solutions has expired, and {{that she does not}} know why Mr. Taylor is not {{responding}} to consumers who pre-purchased products. Although she is aware of complaints filed Mr. Taylor at the Texas AG and IC3, her stated intention is [...] "to regain the brand <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> additional funding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be {{an awful}} job, and he is so happy I won't plague him yet. Guess I'll go and put my room to rights first, and pick up some clean clothes to put on him, if he is alive <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> through with him," [...] thought Molly, foreseeing a stormy passage for the boy, who hated a bath as much as some people hate a trip across the Atlantic.|$|R
5000|$|When {{at home he}} {{is treated}} like any other house pet, and enjoys playing with Babs, Margery's assistant's Parson Russell Terrier. When he can, he sleeps {{in the same bed}} as Margery in hotels, but because at home the bed is too high, he either sleeps {{on the floor next to}} the bed or next to the toilet. [...] "He's figured out that's the first place <b>I</b> go <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> up", {{explained}} his owner.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm willin' to go an' thrash this feller, of course," [...] Skip said, suddenly, as {{he stepped}} forward once more. [...] "I did count on doin' a good day's work, 'cause I've been takin' it easy so long; but I reckon I can spare the little time I need to settle him off. See here, now--I don't want any one in the crowd to beg off for him <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> started." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whenever <b>I</b> <b>get</b> at all <b>run</b> down I {{tend to be}} rheumatic," [...] Hirst stated. He {{bent his}} wrist back sharply. [...] "I hear little pieces of chalk {{grinding}} together!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{confound}} it," [...] exclaimed the burglar, in an annoyed tone, [...] "they don't want it. I've {{got five}} cases of Château de Beychsvelle {{at home that}} was bottled in 1853. That claret of yours is corked. And you couldn't get either of them {{to look at a}} chicken unless it was stewed in champagne. You know, <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> out of the story I don't have so many limitations. I make a turn now and then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{carry this}} fat hen far," [...] thought Reddy, [...] "for Bowser will surely catch me. I don't want to drop it, because I have come {{such a long}} way to get it, and {{goodness}} knows when I will be able to catch another. The thing for me to do is to hide it where I can come back and <b>get</b> it <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> rid of that pesky dog. Goodness, what a noise he makes!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Claiming {{she was a}} young widow, Vera {{arranged}} to meet [...] "Vince" [...] at The Rovers. She was wearing a ginger wig as he approached her from behind, then slowly turned around to face Jack - and scare the daylights out of him, much to the amusement of the pub crowd who were in on the joke. [...] "You're no flipping widow, either!" [...] Jack said. [...] "No, but I will ten minutes <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> you home!" [...] Vera answered.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{first heard}} Colossal Youth on the radio, <b>after</b> <b>I</b> started <b>getting</b> into K music when I lived in Olympia. It {{was a year}} before I put out the Bleach album." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{next time}} we meet you'll see him go down and out," [...] added the tall boy. [...] "He won't be in it a minute <b>after</b> <b>I</b> once <b>get</b> at him." ...|$|R
25|$|When I first {{played for}} South Australia, I did all right. Then I got injured {{right at the}} start of the second season – I broke my nose and cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged my {{shoulder}} as well. I couldn't throw very well. Fielding has always been one of my main skills and I lost confidence in the fielding. <b>I</b> wasn't <b>getting</b> any <b>runs,</b> <b>I</b> wasn't bowling much in those days, and I wasn't fielding terribly well either. I ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. <b>I</b> still couldn't <b>get</b> <b>runs</b> in South Australia the following season but I'd go to England and <b>get</b> <b>runs.</b> <b>I</b> got dropped from the South Australian team.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I'll begin an' {{tell you}} the whole thing," [...] said Mopsey, as he {{prepared}} to show how all of Shakespeare's plays could be performed on one evening by a small company. [...] "In the first place, Nelly comes out, all dressed up, an' sings a song; then the play commences. I come out with a sword an' pistols, an' tell about my hoss runnin' away, an' <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> through, Shiner comes out an' picks a fuss with me, an' I kill him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Harkye, friend," [...] {{said the}} cockswain, [...] "may the Lord forgive you, as I do, for wishing {{to make a}} soldier of a {{seafaring}} man, and one who has followed the waters since he was an hour old, and one who hopes to die off soundings, and {{to be buried in}} brine. I wish you no harm, friend; but you'll have to keep a stopper on your conversation till such time as some of your messmates call in this way, which I hope will be as soon <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> an offing as may be." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, all right. Something in {{what you}} say, I suppose. Consider you treacherous worm and contemptible, spineless cowardly custard, but have booked Spink-Bottle. Stay where you are, then, and <b>I</b> hope you <b>get</b> <b>run</b> over by an omnibus. Love. Travers.|$|R
