King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to be with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, and that's part of my story, so I've had to do an enormous amount of research and interview people. So I have an enormous responsibility to that, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a responsibility to the actual auction, which really happened. Then there's the new story, the point of view, which is this girl who has this obsession and is going to the auctions and stuff. So it's a much more layered, complicated piece than Filth and Wisdom.|$|E
500|$|Following their signing to Interscope, Brand New stopped touring to work {{on their}} third album and major label debut. In this time, little to no {{interviews}} or updates came from the band. In 2004, Jesse Lacey told Chart magazine that he had written a [...] "few songs" [...] for the next album, commenting that [...] "the other guys love it already". He made mention of the pressure he felt with the [...] "loads of anticipation building up on my shoulders," [...] saying that he suffered from depression because of this; [...] "I'm getting depressed with all of the anxiety about the album and they say I write my best stuff when I'm in that state. Great, I'll spend the next six months all depressed and the rest of band will be excited, so that some good (material) might come out. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to contend with how it's received." [...] Lacey also said that the album would [...] "move into new territory for Brand New".|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything". And so I {{have a list of}} questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, [...] "Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." [...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{no wonder}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a classy hang-over, Wrenn. I {{was at the}} Amusieren Rathskeller till four this morning, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a couple of nips before breakfast, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>have</b> any breakfast. But sa-a-a-ay, man, <b>I</b> sure did <b>have</b> some fiesta last night. There was a little {{peroxide}} blonde that--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sorry," [...] Lutchester replied, [...] "I {{was down}} at the barber's {{the first time you}} got through, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some cables to send off." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ribbentrop became Hitler's {{favourite}} foreign-policy adviser, {{partly by}} dint of his familiarity with the world outside Germany, but also by flattery and sycophancy. One German diplomat later recalled that [...] "Ribbentrop didn't understand anything about foreign policy. His sole wish was to please Hitler". In particular, Ribbentrop acquired the habit of listening carefully to what Hitler was saying, memorizing his pet ideas, and then later presenting Hitler's ideas as his own – a practice that much impressed Hitler as proving Ribbentrop was an ideal National Socialist diplomat. Ribbentrop quickly learned that Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem, and accordingly tendered his advice in that direction as a Ribbentrop aide recalled:When Hitler said 'Grey', Ribbentrop said 'Black, black, black'. He always said it three times more, {{and he was always}} more radical. I listened to what Hitler said one day when Ribbentrop wasn't present: 'With Ribbentrop it is so easy, he is always so radical. Meanwhile, all the other people I have, they come here, they have problems, they are afraid, they think we should take care <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to blow them up, to get strong. And Ribbentrop was blowing up the whole day and I had to do nothing. I had to break – much better!' ...|$|E
2500|$|Spears {{talked about}} her {{feelings}} toward the conservatorship her father contains and how she feels about her life, and quotes [...] "There's no excitement, there's no passion... I have really good days, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> bad days. Even {{when you go to}} jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day." [...] Spears added [...] "I think it's too in control, If I wasn't under the restraints I'm under, I'd feel so liberated. When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted to become one of those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People think that when you go through something in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way. [...] "Sometimes you don't need to use words to go through what you need to go through," [...] she continues. [...] "Sometimes it's an emotion you need to feel when you dance, that you need to touch. And the only thing that can touch it is when you move a certain way." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I’m really {{fortunate}} {{to be given the}} crew members that I have on this mission. It’s myself and six others. We do swap one of our crew members with the expedition crew member on board. So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I’m really {{fortunate to}} have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I’ve seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just that,--and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{went off}} rather {{suddenly}} {{to the other}} side of the country; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to go up to London. Now I'm going to Patagonia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{had my own}} {{troubles}} getting here," [...] answered Flapp. [...] "At first I couldn't locate Hacknack <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{the misfortune}} to fall in with Sam Rover" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's one of 'em!" [...] I {{managed to}} scream before the fellow's fingers shut off my wind, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my hands full {{trying to save}} my own life.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll hunt {{up those}} tools <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a little private {{business}} to attend to," [...] announced Foster Portney. [...] "So we must move lively." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I DO know my own mind," [...] protested Anne. [...] "The trouble is, my mind changes <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to get {{acquainted with}} it all over again." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> found--no, I am mistaken. My door, {{you will}} understand, is open. And as I have said these words, a large green parrot comes 'opping out. My assassin {{is nothing but}} a green parrot.|$|E
3000|$|Thus the {{functional}} I satisfies all {{the conditions of}} Lemma  2.7, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>has</b> a critical point, and (1.1) {{has at least one}} solution. This completes the proof. □ [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, no, no; I {{liked him}} at first. <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> liked him very much, if Lord Marchmont {{had not told}} me about him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the key to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why,--let me see," [...] said Caleb, thinking. [...] "I had it yesterday, playing horses on the wood-pile: <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> it this morning,--I believe,--when I went up {{the brook}} to meet Raymond." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know. It's too absurd! How can we {{talk about}} such things when I cannot see you? You speak to the nape of my neck, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to twist my head round to answer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{she will}} feel nothing, poor soul. The deep sleep has already come on, {{which is the}} first working of the poison. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> given her of our Smyrna opium. Come, sir, for already an hour has passed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Kate; [...] "our father {{purchased}} {{him just}} a week before your arrival, thinking that you would likely want a charger now <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> only been on him once before.--Would he make a good buffalo-runner, Jacques?" ...|$|E
60|$|EILEEN. It'd be fine if they would. I'd {{like to have}} one, too--to practice. I learned {{stenography}} at {{a business}} college <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a position for a year--before my mother died.|$|R
60|$|It was Dorothy. Her {{hands were}} {{stretched}} out in welcome, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> them pressed in my own. And I could only look and look again, for I was dumb with joy.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone by, <b>and</b> the Universe {{was very}} much as {{it had always been}} except for the wild swirl in it, and the faint sense of {{insecurity}} my episode left in its wake.|$|R
60|$|The {{crowds that}} come here make a curious study for me. I get along, very sociably, {{with any of}} them--as I let them do all the talking; only now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a long confab, or ask a suggestive {{question}} or two.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Ah, well!’ {{replied the}} guard, ‘if you’ve been shot yourself, that explains. But as for contentment, why, sir, you see, it smarts, as you say. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a good wife, you see, {{and a bit}} of a brat—a little thing, so high.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I must {{go down to}} {{the station}} and leave word for him there," [...] said Mr Blake. Miss Lawrie only shook her head. [...] "Mr Hall will be very sorry to miss him. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> some special good news to tell him." ...|$|E
60|$|I remembered {{exactly what}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done {{on that day}} long ago. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> half slid on a miry descent; it was still there; a little lower <b>I</b> <b>had</b> knocked {{off the top of}} a thistle; the thistles had not been discouraged, but were still growing. I {{recalled}} it because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> wondered why one knocks off the tops of thistles; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thought of Tarquin; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> recited most of Macaulay's VIRGINIA to myself, for <b>I</b> was young. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> came to a tattered edge where the very tuft had whitened with the sawdust and brick-dust from the new row of houses; and two or three green stars of dock and thistle grew spasmodically about the blinding road.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, {{the name}} is long enough; it's the longest part about it. The editor gave me the name, you know, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to write the story. It's to be called [...] "Sir Anthony Allan-a-dale and the Baron of Ballyporeen."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{could be}} quiet at night, {{sleeping}} in Mr. Nobbs's house, and yet I could not at once compose myself {{to think it}} all over, as I desired to do. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> much to do, and here was the joy mingling with the sorrow.|$|R
60|$|Raym. No matter yet, he has my hook within him. Now let him frisk and flounce, and run and roll, And {{think to}} break his hold; he toils in vain. This love, the bait he gorged so greedily, Will make him sick, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> him sure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope, Madam, {{that nothing}} which I have said," [...] he hastily continued, [...] "will {{have an effect}} to {{prejudice}} you against the ship.

6000|$|... "Born in me, I suppose. I {{have watched}} them, lived with them, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been through the}} whole gamut of Socialistic literature.

6000|$|Then he was angry.

6000|$|... "In the {{meantime}} I walked with Carlos {{to the camp}} and made the soldiers a little speech in Spanish, which they received with enthusiasm; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some wine <b>and</b> a cigarette in Carlos's tent.

60|$|Now I {{began to}} look upon myself as quite lost, since as, the current ran {{on both sides of}} the island, I was very certain they must join again, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no hope but of {{perishing}} for want in the sea, after what provision <b>I</b> <b>had</b> was spent, or before, if a storm should happen to arise.|$|R
