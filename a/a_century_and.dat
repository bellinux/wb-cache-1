5|$|An {{innings of}} 60 by Lord Harris helped Kent {{recover from a}} first innings deficit before the Australians, batting last, {{collapsed}} to lose by 96 runs at Canterbury. The first match against Gloucestershire was drawn, W. G. Grace scoring 116 not out for his county. The Australians won the second match convincingly with an innings total of 402 (Giffen 91, Billy Murdoch 89) before dismissing Gloucestershire for only 83. This began a good finish to the tour as the Australians won five of the last seven matches following the third Test. They twice defeated the South by an innings, Spofforth taking a total of 24 wickets in these two matches, but were again beaten by the North, for whom Dick Barlow scored <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> took ten wickets in the match.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 19, McCabe {{was called}} up for the 1930 tour of England despite being yet to score his maiden {{first-class}} century as the selectors chose the youngest ever team to leave Australia. McCabe made his first century in a warm-up match but struggled in his month in England, scoring only 51 runs. His performance began to improve after adjusting his technique and he played in all five Tests, although he continued to have problems converting starts into large scores, failing to make a century during the tour. McCabe managed to maintain his position {{over the next two}} home seasons, playing in all ten Tests, but failed to make <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> after 15 Tests, his average was below 35 although he had become increasingly successful at first-class level.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were now}} 02 down {{and needed to}} win three Tests in a row to retain the Ashes. The {{pressure}} on McCabe increased when last-minute injuries meant {{that he had to}} open the bowling. McCabe made 63 and 22 and took a wicket as Australia won their first match in the series. He then top-scored with 88 in Australia's first innings of 288 and made 55 in the second as Australia won by 148 runs in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to level the series. In the deciding Test at the MCG, McCabe scored 112, one of three centuries as Australia amassed 604, a record score in Ashes Tests in Australia. This laid the platform for the innings victory that retained the Ashes. McCabe aggregated 491 runs in five Tests at 54.55, with <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> five fifties in a consistent display.|$|E

5|$|Bruno Alfred Döblin (10 August 1878 – 26 June 1957) was a German novelist, essayist, and doctor, {{best known}} for his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929). A {{prolific}} writer whose œuvre spans more than half <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> a wide variety of literary movements and styles, Döblin {{is one of the most}} important figures of German literary modernism. His complete works comprise over a dozen novels ranging in genre from historical novels to science fiction to novels about the modern metropolis; several dramas, radio plays, and screenplays; a true crime story; a travel account; two book-length philosophical treatises; scores of essays on politics, religion, art, and society; and numerous letters—his complete works, republished by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and Fischer Verlag, span more than thirty volumes. His first published novel, Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lung (The Three Leaps of Wang Lun), appeared in 1915 and his final novel, Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Tales of a Long Night) was published in 1956, one year before his death.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{also built}} the Savoy Hotel in London, and {{acquired}} other luxury hotels. In addition, he erected the Palace Theatre, London, {{which he had}} intended to be {{the home of a}} new school of English grand opera, although this ambition was not realised beyond the production of a single grand opera by Sullivan, Ivanhoe. Nevertheless, his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, and his careful management of their operas and relationship, created a series of works whose success was unprecedented in the history of musical theatre. His opera company, later operated by Helen and then by his son, Rupert, and granddaughter, Bridget, promoted those works for over <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> they are still performed regularly today.|$|E

In total, he scored 482 runs at an average of 43.81 and took 19 wickets; this was his last regular cricket until 1929. He declined an invitation to tour South Africa with an MCC team, and work limited him to two first-class games for Middlesex in 1928.|$|E
