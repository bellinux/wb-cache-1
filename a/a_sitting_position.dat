5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E
5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> near his {{original}} position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also brought}} out, {{for the first}} time, the burial customs of the Neolithic people. Both human and animal skeletons were found in deep oval shaped pits, located either below the floors of the {{dwelling}} units or in its precincts. These pits were filled with ash, stones and potsherds. Some of the human skulls found here had trepanning (bored hole) marks. In many pits, bones of dogs and antlered deer were found along with human skeletons. The skeletons of humans {{were found in the}} burial pits in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> along with bones of animals.|$|E

50|$|The {{bicycles}} are utility bicycles with a unisex step-through {{frame with}} <b>an</b> upright <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> and {{are equipped with}} 3 speed internal hub gears, drum brakes, fenders, chain guard, lights, and a front rack.|$|R
25|$|Hiatus hernia {{are most}} common in North America and Western Europe and rare in rural African communities. Some have {{proposed}} that insufficient dietary fiber {{and the use of}} <b>a</b> high <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> for defecation may increase the risk.|$|R
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b> Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
5|$|Another {{featured}} preliminary match involved Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho in a singles match. At Backlash, Michaels defeated Batista (with Jericho as {{the special}} guest referee) in an Interpromotional match. During the match, Michaels countered a Batista Bomb attempt, a powerbomb move {{in which the}} wrestler drops into <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> as they slam their opponent down to the mat, and appeared to have legitimately injured his left knee. On the April 28 episode of Raw, Jericho claimed that Michaels faked his knee injury {{to allow him to}} defeat Batista at Backlash, a claim that Michaels denied. The following week, it was announced that Jericho would face Michaels in a singles match at Judgment Day. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Jericho offered his apologies to Michaels for accusing him of feigning an injury, as well as giving Michaels the opportunity to back out of their match. Michaels revealed that he did indeed fake his knee injury. Four days later, on the May 16 episode of SmackDown, Batista commented that he would hurt Michaels, scripted into the storyline, for faking his injury.|$|E
25|$|Rath {{clapped his}} hands, and {{soldiers}} knocked the supports {{from under the}} drops. Surratt and Atzerodt seemed to die quickly. Herold and Powell struggled for nearly five minutes. Powell's body swung about wildly, and once or twice his legs came up {{so that he was}} almost in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
50|$|In children, <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> flexed <b>position</b> was as {{successful}} as lying on the side with respect to obtaining non-traumatic CSF, CSF for culture, and cell count. There was a higher success rate in obtaining CSF in the first attempt in infants younger than 12 months in the <b>sitting</b> flexed <b>position.</b>|$|R
40|$|Eating and {{swallowing}} {{functions are}} said to be influenced by the alignment of head, trunk, and pelvis. Whether both feet contact the floor also influences these functions. We hypothesized that <b>a</b> stable <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> enables sufficient eating motion for the subject who has difficulty in maintaining <b>an</b> upright <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b> Position of head, upper trunk, and lower trunk of the subject tended to shift toward to her right side while seated on her dinning chair. This <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> prevented her from smooth ingestion, and caused spilling and difficulties during biting and swallowing. Correction of the alignment of upper trunk, lower trunk, and rotational distortion between upper and lower trunk provide her with <b>a</b> stable <b>sitting.</b> The influence of abnormal <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> on eating motion may result in difficulties in ingestion and swallowing, in manipulating chopsticks with the upper extremities, and in the movements of head (head and neck flexion) and trunk (flexion). Environmental factors including height of table and chair, distance between them, and the setting of meal may also affect food intake. The influence of changes in <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> on the function in upper extremities was found to be a topic for the future investigation...|$|R
30|$|In ischiatic bursitis, pain {{is located}} in gluteal region and evoked by {{palpation}} of the ischial tuberosity or by <b>a</b> prolonged <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b> Unlike proximal hamstring tendinopathy, pain occurs at rest, disturbs sleep, and forces the patient to a continuous search for a more comfortable position.|$|R
25|$|The male {{dromedary}} camel has {{an organ}} called a dulla in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes {{from his mouth}} when in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue hanging {{out of the side}} of its mouth. Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind. The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session. Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} {{procedural step}} in forming the new breast is the collecting and the joining {{of the three}} folds of breast tissue (the medial pillar and the two lateral pillars) of the lower pole of the breast, where it meets the chest. The suturing is critical to supporting and shaping the flaccid breast tissues into a hemispheric breast-mound that well projects from the chest wall—a lifted breast. The supine patient then is elevated to <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> so that the breasts drape naturally, and the surgeon then delineates upon them the incision plan for the resection (cutting and removing) of the excess folds of skin from the lower sides (inferolateral) and the lower midline (inferomedial) of the new breast. Afterwards, the patient is laid supine, and the excess breast skin is cut; to avoid a scar at the inframammary fold, a purse-string closure gathers the excess folds of skin at the lower pole of the breast; in due course, the three joined pillars of skin will integrate to the inframammary fold. Again, the supine patient is elevated to <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> so that the surgeon can ascertain the size, shape, and symmetry, or asymmetry, of the corrected breasts. If the degree of breast-lift is satisfactory, the patient is re-laid to the operating table, and the plastic surgeon sutures the incision wounds.|$|E
25|$|In a 1992 interview, Ojukwu {{dismissed}} {{claims that}} Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu {{was the leader}} of the plot, as was widely believed. A Nigerian Police Special Branch report, its first part partially redacted and the second part missing, stated that Ifeajuna, Don Okafor and Captain Ogbu Oji were the creators and protagonists of the coup plot in 1965, with Ojukwu only becoming involved at a late stage. Ifeajuna is seen by some as the assassin of Prime Minister Balewa, which brought down the First Republic and caused civil war. No autopsy was carried on Balewa's body and no proof exists that he was shot. Official reports document his body was found in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> by a tree, next to the body of finance minister Festus Okotie-Ebo, who had been shot and was at the centre of corruption allegations.|$|E

25|$|The Keladi Nayakas (period: 1499 – 1763) built {{some fine}} temples in Ikkeri and Keladi using a {{combination}} of late Kadamba, Hoysala, Vijayanagara and Dravida styles. The use of granite for their construction shows that they simply followed the Vijayanagar model of architecture. The Aghoreshwara Temple at Ikkeri and the Rameshwara Temple at Keladi are the best examples of the Nayakas' art. Vijayanagar-style pillars with hippogryphs are common; called yali columns (depiction of horses and lions as seen in Hampi) is found here. These are pillars with lions, either with their forepaws raised or simply in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position,</b> and pillars with a mythical horse-like animal with front legs raised, balancing on its rear legs, and with an armed rider on its back. A roof sculpture depicting a Gandaberunda (see image in infobox), the mythical two-headed bird of Karnataka, symbol of the state, is found in Keladi.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of Native American hunter-gatherer societies, wolves were usually killed for body parts used in rituals, or to stop them raiding food caches, though some tribes would raid wolf dens to kill pups when wolf populations became too large for the Natives to live with. This {{also served as a}} method of acquiring food, as wolf pups were considered a delicacy. Native Americans were aware of the dangers of habituated wolves, and would quickly dispatch wolves following them too closely. Active hunting of wolves was rare because many tribes believed that such an act would cause game animals to disappear or bring retribution from other wolves. The Cherokee feared that the unjust killing of a wolf would bring about the vengeance of its pack mates, and that the weapon used for the deed would be useless in future unless exorcised by a medicine man. However, they would kill wolves with impunity if they knew the proper rites of atonement, and if the wolves themselves happened to raid their fish nets. When the Kwakiutl killed a wolf, the animal would be laid out on a blanket and have portions of its flesh eaten by the perpetrators, who would express regret at the act before burying it. The Ahtna would take the dead wolf to a hut, where it would be propped in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> with a banquet made by a shaman set before it. When men from certain Eskimo tribes killed a wolf, they would walk around their houses four times, expressing regret and abstaining from sexual relations with their wives for four days. Young Apaches would kill wolves, cougars or bears as a rite of passage. Although some of the first European colonists traveling to North America would report back that wolves were more populous in the New World than in Europe, writings from the Lewis and Clark Expedition indicate that wolves were seldom seen except in aboriginal buffer zones.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} at Saipan, The Mariana Islands, 19 June to 7 July 1944. When his entire company was held up by fire from automatic weapons and small-arms fire from strongly fortified enemy positions that commanded the view of the company, Sgt. (then Pvt.) Baker voluntarily took a bazooka and dashed alone to within 100 yards of the enemy. Through heavy rifle and machine gun fire that was directed at him by the enemy, he knocked out the strong point, enabling his company to assault the ridge. Some days later while his company advanced across the open field flanked with obstructions and places of concealment for the enemy, Sgt. Baker again voluntarily took up a position in the rear to protect the company against a surprise attack and came upon two heavily fortified enemy pockets manned by two officers and ten enlisted men which had been bypassed. Without regard for such superior numbers, he unhesitatingly attacked and killed all of them. Five hundred yards farther, he discovered six men of the enemy who had concealed themselves behind our lines and destroyed all of them. On 7 July 1944, the perimeter of which Sgt. Baker was a part was attacked from 3 sides by from 3,000 to 5,000 Japanese. During the early stages of this attack, Sgt. Baker was severely wounded, but he insisted on remaining in the line and fired at the enemy at ranges sometimes as close as 5 yards until his ammunition ran out. Without ammunition and with his weapon battered to uselessness from hand-to-hand combat, he was carried about 50 yards to the rear by a comrade, who was then himself wounded. At this point Sgt. Baker refused to be moved any further stating that he preferred to be left to die rather than risk the lives of any more of his friends. A short time later, at his request, he was placed in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> against a small tree. Another comrade, withdrawing, offered assistance. Sgt. Baker refused, insisting that he be left alone and be given a soldier's pistol with its remaining eight rounds of ammunition. When last seen alive, Sgt. Baker was propped against a tree, pistol in hand, calmly facing the foe. Later Sgt. Baker's body was found in the same position, gun empty, with 8 Japanese lying dead before him. His deeds were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army.|$|E
