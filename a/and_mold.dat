5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases <b>and</b> <b>mold</b> growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof <b>and</b> <b>mold</b> caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall {{and back to the}} Solomon Building, where it had been before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E

40|$|Yeasts <b>and</b> <b>molds</b> are {{important}} microorganisms related to human welfare, safety, and food resources. They contribute {{greatly to the}} food industry {{in areas such as}} winemaking, single-cell protein production, brewing, baking, vitamin production, etc. However, under certain conditions they can act as potential spoilage organisms in food, especially in processed, preserved, and refrigerated food. Enumeration and identification of yeasts <b>and</b> <b>molds</b> from foods are of great importance in understanding the value of these organisms in various food systems as well as their role in spoilage. Knowledge of how certain yeasts <b>and</b> <b>molds</b> colonize meat products and of their effects on the meat products is essential in order to prevent economic losses during spoilage or to maximize desirable fermentation of certain cured meat products by yeasts <b>and</b> <b>molds.</b> Occasionally, some pathogenic yeasts <b>and</b> <b>molds</b> might occur in meat and meat products that may pose food safety issues...|$|R

5|$|Mold {{was born}} on 27 May 1863 {{in the village of}} Middleton Cheney in Northamptonshire. His family had links with the thatching trade, but Mold pursued a career in {{professional}} cricket. He began to play for the village team, making good progress as a bowler; in 1882, Middleton Cheney were unbeaten <b>and</b> <b>Mold</b> had the best bowling average in the team. In 1885 and 1886, he was employed as a professional at Banbury Cricket Club. In his second year, a successful match against the Free Foresters, an amateur team, impressed two Lancashire cricketers who played against him. Subsequently in 1887, Mold was employed by Manchester Cricket Club, and played a few non-competitive cricket matches for Lancashire. In the same season, Northamptonshire, which at the time had not been awarded first-class status, asked Mold to play for them. Playing as a professional, Mold was immediately successful, taking ten wickets in a match against a team from Surrey and seven wickets for 22 runs (seven for 22) in an innings against Staffordshire. He continued to represent Northamptonshire in the following season but hoped to play for Lancashire. At the time, cricketers who wished to play competitive first-class matches for a county in which they were not born had to live there for two years to qualify.|$|E

The shape of the bottom being thus formed, the floors of oak and spruce were placed across the bottom; the spruce floors being 4×8 inches and 2 feet apart. The oak floors were reserved for the ends, and were both sided <b>and</b> <b>molded</b> 8 inches.
