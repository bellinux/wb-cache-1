He went to audition {{for the role of}} Albert Wesker, a role previously played by Jason O'Mara. Describing the character Roberts said, [...] " [...] Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation. He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance. It's a whole process: I get to set and wardrobe gives me this big, long black jacket, and props comes over <b>and</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> the dark glasses and the gloves. By the time you are all dressed you stand a little straighter, you walk a little differently.

[...] They brought out [...] "a really unique character" [...] in all the songs. During the recording, guitarist Ed Reyes used Orange and Burman amplifiers. Most of his guitar tracks were recorded with an Epiphone Casino guitar, and he also used an Epiphone Crestwood guitar. Frequently using a tape delay effect, Reyes did not use distortion pedals since the Orange amp [...] "had a perfect gain sound in itself."

[...] He channeled it through a Marshall JCM800 amplifier, and also used a Gibson Firebird guitar when the group needed [...] "a really tight sound." [...] The drums were recorded in three days. After positioning four microphones around (and inside) the bass drum, Valentine placed Mark O'Connell in a room [...] "he calls the torture chamber." [...] According to the drummer, the room's acoustics made the drums sound [...] "insane." ...|$|E
