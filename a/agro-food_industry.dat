25|$|The <b>agro-food</b> <b>{{industry}}</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} pillars of industry of Campania. The organisation of the sector is improving and leading to higher levels of quality and salaries. Campania mainly produces fruit and vegetables, but has also expanded its production of flowers grown in greenhouses, becoming one of the leading regions of the sector in Italy. The value added of this sector represents around 6.5% of the total value added of the region, equalling €213.7 million. Campania produces over 50% of Italy's nuts and is also the leader in the production of tomatoes, which reaches 1.5 million tonnes a year. A weak point, however, for the region's agriculture is the very reduced size of farms, equal to 3.53 hectares. Animal breeding is widespread (it was done in 70,278 farms in 2000) and the milk produced is used to process typical products, such as mozzarella. Olive trees cover over 74,604 hectares of the agricultural land and contribute by €620.6 million to the value added of agriculture, together with the production of fruit. Wine production has increased, together with the quality of the wine.|$|E

This study investigates the existing logistics management practices in 20 selected agro-food enterprises in Ghana.

Challenges facing small scale enterprises understudied include capital investment to replace old equipment with new ones, inadequate cold storage facilities and lack of training in logistics management among others. For the medium-large scale enterprises, logistic related challenges include inadequate financial support, high cost of fuel to support power generation, inadequate cold vans and poor road networks. Lessons learnt from the large scale agro-food enterprises understudied include (i) efficient planning of logistics needs by short, medium and long term requirements, (ii) maintaining good relationship with customers (iii) outsourcing of some logistics needs as much as possible, like raw material supplies, transportation services and other inbound need...|$|R

40|$|Within the <b>agro-food</b> <b>industry,</b> agro-materials are {{converted}} into a range of valuable semi-finished and finished products. To reach a sustainable, resource efficient food system, the optimal process pathways converting the agro-material into these products have to be identified. To identify these pathways, a systematic Process Synthesis (PS) method is needed for the <b>agro-food</b> <b>industry.</b> This sustainability driven PS method should enable the synthesis of the optimal process pathways, converting an agro-material into a range of valuable products, producing minimal waste or low-value by-products. In this paper, the elements required for such a method are proposed. The relevance of these elements is illustrated with a simple illustrative case for the processing of tropical fruit. The proposed approach uses Multi-Objective Optimisation methods, to provide decision support for PS to decision makers in the <b>agro-food</b> <b>industry.</b> This leads to new insights in optimal pathways for processing agro-materials for the <b>agro-food</b> <b>industry.</b> <br/...|$|E

40|$|The <b>agro-food</b> <b>industry</b> is {{a sector}} {{in which the}} {{percentage}} of firms which have done innovation {{in the past three}} years is high, whereas they have a low research capacity. According to an innovation survey (1986 - 90) in France, 70 % of agro-food firms which responded in the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), reported innovations while less than 5 % of them had internal research capacities. Our paper models estimates of determinants of innovation in the <b>agro-food</b> <b>industry.</b> Based on the comparison of several French databases (annual survey on firms, on innovation, on R&D in firms, on R&D in academic labs), it explores the determinants of innovation: sources of innovation (as defined in CIS), spillovers from public research and spillovers from other firms. Since agro-food firms have a low absorptive capacity, we assume that the transfer of knowledge from public research or from large firms to agro-food firms is based on geographical proximity. The paper presents three main results: 1. Intensity of innovation (defined as radical innovation versus incremental innovation) is linked with the presence of public research in life science in the same region. 2.

The major advantage of energy from hydrogen is the zero carbon emissions, since the utilization of hydrogen, either via combustion or via fuel cells, results in pure water.

Indeed, biohydrogen generation from renewable biomass would reduce dependence on fossil fuel, decrease the carbon dioxide emissions and produce usable bioenergy.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{the link between}} firm {{productivity}} and exporting using three firm level datasets of 1323 Tunisian manufacturing firms from 2004 to 2006. In particular, we examine whether more productive firms self-select into export markets, and whether exporters achieve productivity improvements through learning by exporting effects. We then explore the link between innovation (as a channel linking productivity to exporting) and exporting. The analysis has been conducted on two clusters of firms. The first cluster distinguishes exporters from non-exporters and the second distinguishes fully exporting firms from others. The results suggest that fully exporting firms self-select more often into export markets and, therefore, have much less to gain from exporting because of their likely longer prior exporting experience. The analysis has been extended to deal with sectoral studies. The study finds that, in the long run, fully exporting firms in sectors characterized by subcontracting regimes, such as the textile and electronics industries, experience a distinct decline in the scope for learning by exporting. Moreover, the scope for learning might also be influenced by export destination, {{as in the case}} of the <b>agro-food</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|R
