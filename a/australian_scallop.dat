40|$|A high natural {{mortality}} rate {{has been documented}} for the saucer scallop Amusium balloti, an <b>Australian</b> <b>scallop</b> found on sediment bottoms at 30 – 60 m deep, but {{little is known about}} the causes of mortality. We studied escape responses of A. balloti to five consumers common in the bycatch of the scallop fishery as a means of identifying potential predators. The scallop showed a negligible to weak response when touched with the sea star Pentaceraster regulus and the red portunid crab Portunus rubromarginatus. The response was similar to that observed when the scallop was touched with a plastic object. In contrast, A. balloti showed a consistent and vigorous swimming response to contact with the slipper lobster Thenus orientalis, the blue swimmer crab Portunus pelagicus and the coral crab Charybdis cruciata. This was not a generalized response to crustaceans, given the scallop's weak response to the red portunid crab. This is the first report of a scallop that has a strong swimming escape response to contact with decapod crustacean predators...|$|E
40|$|Escape {{responses}} of <b>Australian</b> <b>scallops</b> (Pecten fumatus and Chlamys asperrima) to native and introduced predatory seastars were compared in laboratory and field trials. The native seastar Coscinasterias muricata elicited an almost immediate escape response by scallops in all trials. In contrast, {{there was a}} low frequency of escape response exhibited by scallops when held {{in contact with the}} introduced seastar Asterias amurensis. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that escape response in invertebrates has evolved relative to predation risk. The absence of predator recognition in marine invertebrates may have serious implications for wild and farmed populations in southern Australia where introduced predators are prevalent...|$|R

40|$|Nucleotide {{variation}} in {{a portion of}} the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) gene from asexual stages of bucephalids of southern <b>Australian</b> <b>scallops</b> (Chlamys asperrima, Chlamys bifrons and Pecten fumatus) was investigated using a mutation scanning–sequencing approach. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis revealed three main profile types (A, B and C) for parasites isolated from scallops. Sequence analysis revealed that samples represented by profiles B and C had a high degree (97. 3 %) of sequence similarity, whereas they were ~ 21 % different in sequence from those represented by profile A. These findings suggested that at least two types or species (represented by profile A, or profile B or C) of bucephalid infect scallops, of which both were detected in South Australia, while only one was found in Victoria. The prevalence of bucephalids (and their SSCP haplotypes) appeared to differ among the three species of scallop in South Australia as well as between the two scallop species in Victoria, indicating a degree of host specificity. Adult bucephalids were collected from Eastern Australian Salmon (Arripis trutta), in an attempt to match them with the asexual stages from the scallop hosts. Neither of the two taxa of adult bucephalid (Telorhynchus arripidis and an un-named Telorhynchus species) shared SSCP profiles with the bucephalids from scallops, but were genetically similar, suggesting that the asexual stages from scallops may represent the genus Telorhynchus. This study, which assessed nucleotide sequence {{variation in}} {{a portion of the}} mitochondrial cox 1 gene for bucephalids found in scallops and arripid fish, illustrates the usefulness of the mutation scanning approach to elucidate complex life-cycles of marine parasites. <br /...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} twenty-three <b>Australian</b> Bass Strait <b>scallops,</b> Pecten fumatus {{processed}} by three different cooking methods: steam, battered and deep-fry, and pan-fry were analysed {{to determine the}} total lipid and health-benefiting n- 3 PUFA contents. Fry process resulted in a significantly higher lipid content (p< 0. 05) with 1. 98 g/ 100 g being found in deep-fried and 1. 78 g/ 100 g in pan-fried scallops while 1. 31 g/ 100 g was recorded in the fresh control group (p< 0. 05). A higher concentration of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18 : 3 n- 3), total n- 6 PUFA and linoleic (LA, 18 : 2 n- 6) were also observed in fried scallops (p< 0. 05). The two main n- 3 LC-PUFA were eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3) and their concentration also varied depending on the cooking methods. Pan-fried scallops showed a higher concentration of EPA, DHA and total n- 3 PUFA while steamed scallops had a higher concentration of DHA only (p< 0. 05). The ratio of n- 3 /n- 6 PUFA was markedly lower in both fried groups than in control and steamed scallops (p< 0. 0001). Three frozen samples were also examined and no significant variations in the lipid profiles have been observed after 22 days. The variation of lipid profiles reflects mainly the uptake of vegetable oil components and loss of water during cooking process. Scallops represent {{a good source of}} n- 3 LC-PUFA with the concentration ranging from 312. 4 mg/ 100 g in fresh scallops to 522. 1 mg/ 100 g in pan-fried scallops...|$|R
