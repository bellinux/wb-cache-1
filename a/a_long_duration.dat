5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>duration</b> is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E

Non-destructive samples of blood or feathers taken during field studies may be studied in the laboratory.

These techniques can be used in combination with other techniques such as ringing.|$|E
25|$|Some drugs used {{to treat}} {{inflammation}} have the unwanted side effect of suppressing normal platelet function. These are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Aspirin irreversibly disrupts platelet function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), and hence normal hemostasis. The resulting platelets are unable to produce new cyclooxygenase {{because they have no}} DNA. Normal platelet function will not return until the use of aspirin has ceased and enough of the affected platelets have been replaced by new ones, which can take over a week. Ibuprofen, another NSAID, does not have such <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>duration</b> effect, with platelet function usually returning within 24 hours, and taking ibuprofen before aspirin prevents the irreversible effects of aspirin.|$|E

500|$|Created and {{introduced}} by William J. Bell, {{the role of}} Nicholas Newman was born onscreen during the episode dated December 31, 1988.

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{injuries}} in running involve the knees and the feet. Various {{studies have focused}} on the initial cause of these running related injuries and found that there are many factors that correlate to these injuries. Female distance runners who had a history of stress fracture injuries had higher vertical impact forces than non-injured subjects. The large forces onto the lower legs were associated with gravitational forces, and this correlated with patellofemoral pain or potential knee injuries. [...] Researchers have also found that these running related injuries affect the feet as well because runners with previous injuries showed more foot eversion and over pronation while running than non-injured runners. This causes more loads and forces on the medial side of the foot, causing more stress on the tendons of the foot and ankle (peroneal tendons). Most of these running injuries are caused by overuse and that running at longer distances weekly for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>duration</b> is a risk for injuring the lower legs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{intensity}} of aphasia therapy {{is determined by}} the length of each session, total hours of therapy per week, and total weeks of therapy provided. There is no consensus about what âintenseâ aphasia therapy entails, or how intense therapy should be to yield the best outcomes. Overall, treatment is considered more intense when total therapy hours per week are increased, and on average, research suggests more intense therapy leads to better outcomes. [...] For example, one study found that patients who were treated for 8.8 hours a week for 11.2 weeks progressed more than patients who were treated 2 hours a week for 22.9 weeks. Results of another study corroborate these findings. The researchers found that patients who received intensive therapy of 100 treatment hours over 62 weeks scored higher on language measures than the control group who received less intensive therapy. However, a Cochrane review of speech and language therapy for people with aphasia revealed a more nuanced finding. The review found that treatments that are higher intensity, higher dose or over <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>duration</b> of time led to significantly better functional communication but people were more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).|$|E
