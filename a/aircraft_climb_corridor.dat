2500|$|The pilots {{retracted}} {{the landing}} gear and set flaps for go-around. The aircraft pitch changed from 2 degrees to 12 degrees as the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbed,</b> its engines still at idle. Airspeed fell and the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbed</b> to a maximum altitude of [...] ATL before beginning to descend. For 13 seconds the engines remained at idle. The aircraft pitch angle decreased to near 0 and then the throttle was manually increased two seconds before impact with an embankment along the runway at 15:40. The aircraft was severely damaged by a post crash fire.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbed</b> unusually {{quickly after}} {{it left the}} runway. [...] It was {{observed}} to climb to a height of about [...] and then roll and spiral vertically to the ground.|$|R
2500|$|The inquiry {{received}} {{evidence from}} the aerodrome control officer on duty in the control tower {{at the time of}} the takeoff. [...] He observed the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climb</b> at a steeper rate than any airline-operated aircraft he had seen previously. [...] When the aircraft was at a height of about [...] the left wing dropped sharply, as if in a stall. [...] The nose dipped and the aircraft seemed to rotate through 180 degrees before dropping vertically. [...] A ground engineer also saw the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climb</b> abruptly before it nosed over and twisted twice as it dived to the ground.|$|R

5000|$|Torque roll; tailslide {{performed}} with aileron {{added in the}} direction of the engine torque. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbs</b> in the vertical until forward momentum is lost, and rolls due to the torque of the engine as it tailslides.|$|R
5000|$|The {{result was}} that after the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbed</b> to about 1000m, it then began a rapid descent with {{negative}} vertical acceleration of -1g. The subsequent crew attempts to recover were not sufficient to avoid an impact with the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Cruise is {{level flight}} after an <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbs</b> {{to a set}} {{altitude}} and before it begins to descend. [...] It is usually the majority of a flight. Cruising may include changes in heading (direction of flight) at a constant airspeed and altitude.|$|R

2500|$|A reduced {{density of}} intake air {{is caused by}} the loss of {{atmospheric}} density seen with elevated altitudes. Thus, a natural use of the turbocharger is with aircraft engines. As an <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbs</b> to higher altitudes, the pressure of the surrounding air quickly falls off. At , the air is at half the pressure of sea level, which means that the engine produces less than half-power at this altitude.In aircraft engines, turbocharging is commonly used to maintain manifold pressure as altitude increases (i.e. to compensate for lower-density air at higher altitudes). Since atmospheric pressure reduces as the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbs,</b> power drops as a function of altitude in normally aspirated engines. Systems that use a turbocharger to maintain an engine's sea-level power output are called turbo-normalized systems. Generally, a turbo-normalized system attempts to maintain a manifold pressure of [...]|$|R
5|$|The <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbed</b> {{normally}} {{from the}} runway, levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height {{and crashed into}} the harbour. The 62-year-old general died, along with 15 others. The sole survivor was the Czech-born pilot, Eduard Prchal, who was rescued by an RAF launch. The bodies of five passengers and crew, including Sikorski's daughter, were never found.|$|R
50|$|To make an <b>aircraft</b> <b>climb,</b> i.e. gain altitude, {{the pilot}} {{will raise the}} nose higher {{than it is in}} the cruise attitude. For many light aircraft, this will {{correspond}} to a sight picture where the aircraft nose appears to be on or just slightly above the horizon. The amount of movement will typically not exceed 10-15 degrees.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>aircraft</b> will <b>climb</b> slower as {{the result}} of reduced power {{production}} and lift.|$|R
50|$|As the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbed,</b> the {{pressure}} inside the cabin gradually decreased. As it passed through {{an altitude of}} 12040 ft, the cabin altitude warning horn sounded. The warning should have prompted the crew to stop climbing, but it was misidentified by the crew as a take-off configuration warning, which signals that the aircraft is not ready for take-off, and can only sound on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbed</b> to 300-400 {{feet above}} the airfield, banked steeply to the left, and side-slipped into the ground. At impact, the left thrust {{reverser}} was fully deployed and the right thrust reverser was nearly stowed. Left engine was near idle power, right engine was developing power, and there was full right rudder and aileron. Gear was down and flaps were at cca 20 degrees.|$|R

25|$|A {{turbocharger}} remedies {{this problem}} by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures (turbo-normalizing), or even much higher (turbo-charging), {{in order to produce}} rated power at high altitude. Since the size of the turbocharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the turbocharger is oversized for low altitude. The speed of the turbocharger is controlled by a wastegate. Early systems used a fixed wastegate, resulting in a turbocharger that functioned much like a supercharger. Later systems utilized an adjustable wastegate, controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or electric system. When the aircraft is at low altitude the wastegate is usually fully open, venting all the exhaust gases overboard. As the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbs</b> and the air density drops, the wastegate must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the wastegate fully closes and the engine still produces full power is the critical altitude. When the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbs</b> above the critical altitude, engine power output decreases as altitude increases, just as it would in a naturally aspirated engine.|$|R

2500|$|September 4, 2000: After departing Perth, Western Australia, {{the pilot}} of a Model 200 Super King Air {{failed to respond to}} ATC after the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbed</b> above its {{assigned}} altitude.

Dubbed the [...] "Ghost Flight" [...] by the media, an investigation concluded that the occupants likely became incapacitated due to hypoxia.|$|R
50|$|Another {{effect that}} is {{especially}} important in aircraft cooling is that the specific heat capacity changes with pressure, and this pressure changes more rapidly with altitude than the drop in temperature. Thus, generally, liquid cooling systems lose capacity as the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbs.</b> This was a major limit on performance during the 1930s when the introduction of turbosuperchargers first allowed convenient travel at altitudes above 15,000 ft, and cooling design became a major area of research.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{a control}} area (CTA) is {{the volume of}} {{controlled}} airspace {{that exists in the}} vicinity of an airport. It has a specified lower level and a specified upper level. It usually is situated on top of a control zone and provides protection to <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbing</b> out from the airport by joining the low-level control zone to the nearest airways. In the UK they are generally class A, D or E.|$|R

50|$|The climb phase, {{also known}} as climb out, of a typical flight of an {{aircraft}} is the period during which the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbs</b> to a predetermined cruising altitude after take-off. The climb phase immediately follows take-off and precedes the cruise phase of the flight. Although a single climb phase is typical, multiple climb phases may alternate with cruise phases, particularly for very long flights in which altitude is increased as the weight of fuel aboard decreases (see step climb).|$|R
50|$|In aerodynamics, the {{lift-to-drag}} ratio, or L/D ratio, is {{the amount}} of lift generated by a wing or vehicle, divided by the aerodynamic drag it creates by moving through the air. A higher or more favorable L/D ratio is typically one of the major goals in aircraft design; since a particular aircraft's required lift is set by its weight, delivering that lift with lower drag leads directly to better fuel economy in <b>aircraft,</b> <b>climb</b> performance, and glide ratio.|$|R
50|$|On 2 July 1949 a Douglas DC-3 {{aircraft}} {{departed from}} Perth, Western Australia {{for a night}} flight of 441 nmi km to Carnarvon.

It crashed about a mile north of Perth airport and burned for over an hour. It was the worst civil aviation accident in Western Australia and the third-worst in Australia.|$|R
50|$|The flight, {{operated}} with a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, {{originated from}} Dubai International Airport in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Rostov Airport was experiencing inclement weather {{at the time}} Flight 981 approached. Flight 981 aborted its first landing attempt and went into a holding pattern nearby for nearly two hours before making a second landing attempt. After aborting the second landing attempt, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>climbed</b> to 4000 ft, then descended rapidly and crashed near the threshold of Runway 22.|$|R
50|$|Wing loading has {{an effect}} on an <b>aircraft's</b> <b>climb</b> rate. A lighter loaded wing will have a {{superior}} rate of climb compared to a heavier loaded wing as less airspeed is required to generate the additional lift to increase altitude. A lightly loaded wing has a more efficient cruising performance because less thrust is required to maintain lift for level flight. However, a heavily loaded wing is more suited for higher speed flight because smaller wings offer less drag.|$|R
