5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop <b>a</b> <b>credible</b> currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining <b>a</b> <b>credible</b> currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported identifying the circumstances In which high credibility either facilitates, inhibits, or {{has no effect}} on the communica-tor's persuasiveness in relation to <b>a</b> less <b>credible</b> source. These data pro-vide support for the cognitive response view of information processing and suggest the importance of message recipient's initial opinion as a determinant of persuasion. In experimental investigations of the persuasive ef-fect of source credibility, it has been frequently demonstrated that highly trustworthy and expert spokespeople induce a greater positive attitude toward the position they advocate than do communicators with less credibility (cf. Stemthal, Phillips, and Dholakia in press). This finding can be explained in terms of cognitive response (cf. Greenwald 1968, 1970; Petty, Ostrom, and Brock 1978). According to this formulation, a message recipient's initial opinion is an important determinant of influence. In response to a persuasive appeal, individuals rehearse their issue-relevant thoughts, as well as those presented to them. Message rejection occurs when people opposed to the communicator's advocacy review counterarguments to assertions made to the message. If <b>a</b> highly <b>credible</b> source inhibits counterarguing. whereas <b>a</b> less <b>credible</b> source does not, cognitive response predicts the su-perior persuasive power of <b>a</b> highly <b>credible</b> com-municator. Consistent with this interpretation. Cook (1969) reported less counterargumentation in response to a competent source than to an incompetent source. Despite the substantial number of studies indicating that <b>a</b> highly <b>credible</b> source is more persuasive than a low credibility source, this finding is less than univocal. • Brian Stemthal is Assistant Professor, Depanment of Marketing...|$|R

David also felt that the Vita was used by a later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, felt that although Symeon knew of the Libellus, there was no evidence that he used the Vita, which would leave the author of the Vita unclear.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies.

The ZNDH's 3rd Flak Group, defending Brod na Savi (Slavonski Brod), managed to shoot down a single bomber en route to its target. The best aircraft that the ZNDH could put up to defend its homeland at the end of 1943 were 20 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, 10 Fiat G.50s, six Fiat CR.42s, five Avia BH-33s and two Ikarus IK-2 fighters – aircraft that had been obsolete in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms of Keynes's ideas {{had begun}} to gain {{significant}} acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then able to make <b>a</b> <b>credible</b> case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly {{the result of his}} scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.|$|E

He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility.
