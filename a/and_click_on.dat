2500|$|Basic {{gameplay}} {{involves the}} player selecting and commanding units. To select an individual unit, the player clicks on that unit. Once selected, {{the unit is}} surrounded by a yellow rectangle, beside which is a health meter, which diminishes as the unit takes damage. Units do not regenerate health, {{and there is no way}} to construct new units (although in some single-player missions, reinforcements are automatically received at predetermined points). To select all nearby units of a given type, the player double-clicks on any individual unit of that type. To select multiple units of different types, the player can either [...] "shift click" [...] (hold down the shift key <b>and</b> <b>click</b> <b>on</b> each individual unit) or use [...] "band-selection" [...] (click and hold the mouse button on a piece of ground, then drag the cursor across the screen. This causes a yellow box to appear, which grows and shrinks as it follows the cursor's movement. When the player releases the button, any units within the box are selected). The player can instantly select all units on screen, irrespective of type, by pressing the enter key. The player can also assign manually selected unit groupings to a specific key on the keyboard, and when that key is pressed, it instantly selects the desired group of units.|$|E
