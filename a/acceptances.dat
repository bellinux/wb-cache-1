5|$|The U.K. {{government}} attempted several {{measures to}} revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon {{the end of the}} war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid <b>acceptances</b> for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the London Stock Exchange's prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited import restrictions.|$|E

A specified number of legally defined refugees who either apply for asylum from inside the U.S. or apply for refugee status from outside the U.S., are admitted annually. Refugees compose about one-tenth of the total annual immigration to the United States, though some large refugee populations are very prominent. Since World War II, more refugees have found homes in the U.S. than any other nation and {{more than two million}} refugees have arrived in the U.S. since 1980. In the years 2005 through 2007, the number of asylum seekers accepted into the U.S. was about 40,000 per year. This compared with about 30,000 per year in the UK and 25,000 in Canada.

Regression analyses were used to test whether mindful awareness and <b>acceptance</b> interact in predicting couples satisfaction in a sample of dating or married college students (n = 138). <b>Acceptance</b> was positively associated with couples satisfaction, while awareness was unrelated. These two mindfulness facets interacted such that greater awareness was related to poorer satisfaction when <b>acceptance</b> was low, but was unrelated when <b>acceptance</b> was high. Conversely, greater <b>acceptance</b> was only related to greater satisfaction when awareness was moderate or high. These results suggest the combination of high awareness and low <b>acceptance</b> can be problematic for relationships, while at least moderate mindful awareness is needed for <b>acceptance</b> to be beneficial...|$|R

Correlations between tinnitus <b>acceptance,</b> psychological distress, and QoL were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to calculate a cutoff score for the German "Tinnitus <b>Acceptance</b> Questionnaire" (CTAQ-G) and to evaluate the screening abilities of the CTAQ-G.
