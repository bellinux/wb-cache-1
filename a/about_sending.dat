5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking <b>about</b> <b>sending</b> unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{forces in}} Gascony were around 4,400 strong, but the French army, {{commanded}} by Charles of Valois, numbered 7,000. Valois took the Agenais and then advanced further {{and cut off}} the main city of Bordeaux. In response, Edward ordered the arrest of any French persons in England and seized Isabella's lands, {{on the basis that}} she was of French origin. In November 1324 he met with the earls and the English Church, who recommended that Edward should lead a force of 11,000 men to Gascony. Edward decided not to go personally, sending instead the Earl of Surrey. Meanwhile, Edward opened up fresh negotiations with the French king. Charles advanced various proposals, the most tempting of which was the suggestion that if Isabella and Prince Edward were to travel to Paris, and the Prince was to give homage to the French King for Gascony, he would terminate the war and return the Agenais. Edward and his advisers had concerns <b>about</b> <b>sending</b> the prince to France, but agreed to send Isabella on her own as an envoy in March 1325.|$|E

25|$|In late October 2017, {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} in 2013 a well-known male MP had been sending sexually explicit messages to 19 year old female candidate he'd interviewed for a role in his office. On Sunday 28 October 2017, The Telegraph reported that Crabb was the MP responsible for sending the text messages. Earlier allegations <b>about</b> <b>sending</b> suggestive text messages had resulted in his resignation as Work and Pensions Secretary in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Another blunder {{made by the}} {{opposition}} was making an enemy of Bonaparte {{at a time when}} he was a national hero for his victories in Italy. Despite being warned by members of {{the opposition}} Club de Clichy, the outspoken Jacques-Victor Dumolard offended Bonaparte in a speech made to the Five Hundred. After thinking <b>about</b> <b>sending</b> troops from his army to overthrow the opposition in Paris, Bonaparte decided against it. On 3 June 1797, Bonaparte sent the Directory proof that Pichegru was in treasonous contact with France's enemies. Though Bonaparte proved coy, Hoche, the commander of the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse was eager to intervene on behalf of the Triumvirate. On 9 July 1797, Hoche sent 9,000 troops under Louis Lemoine marching toward Paris. The attempted coup collapsed and the troops withdrew when it was discovered that Hoche was too young to assume the position of Minister of War. Though it was obvious what was going on, the divided opposition was unable to implement effective countermeasures. Barras and his confederates resolved to try again and Bonaparte sent Augereau to help execute the coup.|$|E
25|$|There is {{significant}} controversy with the PIE and BICEPS principles. Throughout {{a number of}} wars, but notably during the Vietnam War, {{there has been a}} conflict among doctors <b>about</b> <b>sending</b> distressed soldiers back to combat. During the Vietnam War this reached a peak with much discussion about the ethics of this process. Proponents of the PIE and BICEPS principles argue that it leads to a reduction of long-term disability but opponents argue that combat stress reactions lead to long-term problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The use of psychiatric drugs to treat victims of CSR has also attracted criticism, as some military psychiatrists have come to question the efficacy of such drugs on the long term health of veterans. Concerns have been expressed as to the effect of pharmaceutical treatment on an already elevated substance abuse rate among former CSR sufferers. Recent research has caused an increasing number of scientists to believe {{that there may be a}} physical (i.e., neurocerebral damage) rather than psychological basis for blast trauma. As traumatic brain injury and combat stress reaction have very different causes yet result in similar neurologic symptoms, researchers emphasize the need for greater diagnostic care.|$|E

25|$|FOA's Torsten Magnusson {{met with}} the American envoy Howard A. Robinson in November 1954, and Malte Jacobsson from the Atom Committee talked to Counter Admiral Lewis Strauss from Atomic Energy Commission in April 1955. Sweden {{indicated}} {{that it would be}} interested in purchasing approximately 25 nuclear devices. In 1957, Ambassador Erik Boheman raised the question at the US State Department, while the Swedish Ministry of Defense inquired <b>about</b> <b>sending</b> Swedish officers to train on the use of nuclear weapons. Boheman also mentioned that Denmark and Norway had already purchased weapons systems that could carry nuclear warheads, although neither country had devices to deploy on such systems. The American response was dismissive because Sweden, as a non-NATO state, did not have any mutual defense agreement with the US, which was a requirement in American law to even consider nuclear weapons cooperation. The message was clear - if Sweden reconsidered its nonalignment policy, the US would consider a new request from Sweden, otherwise discussions would be fruitless. Analysis from the US State Department in 1959, showed that Sweden {{did not have to be}} a NATO-member for the proposed nuclear weapons sales, but it had to, at the very minimum, have an agreement with the US regarding use of nuclear weapons, which would imply Sweden renouncing nonalignment. On April 6, 1960, the United States National Security Council decided that the Americans should not support the Swedish ownership of nuclear weapons, nor did it approve of the idea of a Swedish nuclear weapons program. The US Government believed that Western interests would be best served against the Soviet Union if Sweden invested its limited resources in conventional weapons, rather than an expensive nuclear weapons program.|$|E

The same held for the chitchat of personnel at radiotelegraphic stations, where discipline was disastrously lax." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{is a song}} by British R singer Taio Cruz, {{released}} from his second studio album, Rokstarr (2009). The song was written and produced by Cruz alongside Fraser T Smith, and later released as the album's third single on 5 April 2010. Originally, Cruz wanted the female vocals {{to be done by}} Lady Gaga but opted to switch to Kesha due to heavy influence by Dr. Luke and for finding her voice unique. It was released as the third single from Rokstarr on 5 April 2010 and was later re-recorded as an album bonus track for Kesha's debut album, Animal, dubbed the [...] "Kesha edit". Lyrically, the song is <b>about</b> <b>sending</b> a dirty picture to a significant other whom you miss.|$|E

500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] is song {{composed}} {{in the dance}} genre, that encompasses a techno beat infused in its backing, as well as synthesizers. The song features auto-tuned vocals by Kesha. According to Robert Cospey of Digital Spy, the song's chorus contains [...] "trancey" [...] elements and is reminiscent of Benny Benassi's song, [...] "Satisfaction". Lyrically, Cruz explained the song's message saying, [...] "the song is actually <b>about</b> <b>sending</b> sexy pictures to your significant other, if you miss each other and you can't see each other, you're far away from each other, you send pictures to remind each other of how sexy you are." [...] According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate beat rate of 125 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of F Minor; Cruz' vocal range spans from the note of Eb4 to the note of F5.|$|E
500|$|Other {{contemporary}} newspapers took separate sides on the Sword and Lord of the Rings issue. John Batchelor, {{writing for}} The Village Voice, {{thought that it}} was the weakest of the 1977 surge in fantasy, ranking it below Stephen R. Donaldson's The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever, Seamus Cullen's Astra and Flondrix, and The Silmarillion, edited by Christopher Tolkien, while commenting that it [...] "unabashedly cop" [...] Lord of the Rings. However, he also believed that it was serviceable, simply because there is something exciting <b>about</b> <b>sending</b> off a group to face evil alone. Taking the opposite stance, L.V. Keptert in the Sydney Morning Herald believed that the book was similar enough to Tolkien that it would draw the many fans of that book to Sword, but it was only similar on a most basic level, and a valid comparison could not be made between the two. The Pittsburgh Press took a similar stance, saying that Sword embodied the Tolkien spirit and tradition but was quite able to stand apart from Lord of the Rings.|$|E
500|$|Richard Leakey, who was {{responsible}} for the first major ivory destruction in Kenya in 1989, argues that these acts are primarily <b>about</b> <b>sending</b> a message to foster a public that sees the value in wildlife itself, not its byproducts, and thereby influencing the demand side of the market. In explaining the [...] "enormous impact" [...] that he saw after the 1989 event, Leakey said that [...] "up to that time we'd been losing about three and a half thousand to four thousand elephants a year, and a year later we were losing at most sixty." [...] Consumer research in China, the world's largest consumer of ivory, showed that many potential buyers have little understanding of the connection between the ivory trade and steep declines in elephant populations. High-profile government events bring the problem to large numbers of people and affirm a government stance for anyone who had been unclear. The events also aim to signal decreasing acceptance and popularity of ivory goods, making them less desirable by lowering their status and shaming individuals, organizations, and institutions who buy, sell, or own the goods. In China, prices fell by nearly half between 2015 and 2016, following the government announcement that it would begin phasing out its domestic ivory trade. According to Hongxiang Huang in a report by NPR, the decline was not likely due to conservation reasons, but because [...] "ne thing that proud Chinese people don't want to be, these days, is behind the times." ...|$|E
