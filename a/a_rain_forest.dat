500|$|Samus {{initially}} {{lands on}} Tallon IV at <b>a</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> location {{referred to as}} [...] "Tallon Overworld". After {{a brief period of}} exploring, she discovers the Chozo Ruins, the remains of the Chozo civilization. After further investigation, Samus learns that many years ago, the planet was struck by a meteor, which carried with it a substance the Chozo call the [...] "Great Poison", commonly known as [...] "Phazon". The meteor also contained a creature called [...] "the Worm". The Chozo built an Artifact Temple over the crater to contain [...] "the Worm" [...] and to stop the Phazon from spreading over the planet. The temple's sealed entrance is controlled by twelve Chozo artifacts, which must be found {{to gain access to the}} crater. After re-obtaining the Varia Suit in the ruins, Samus finds her way to the Magmoor Caverns, a series of magma-filled underground tunnels, which are used by the Space Pirates as a source of geothermal power and connect the game's areas together. Following the tunnels, Samus travels to the Phendrana Drifts, a cold, mountainous location which is home to an ancient Chozo ruin and Space Pirate research labs used to study Metroids, as well as ice caves and valleys home to electrical and ice-creatures. After obtaining the Gravity Suit in Phendrana, Samus explores the interior of the crashed Orpheon, then infiltrates the Phazon Minesthe mining and research complex which is the center of the Space Pirates' Tallon IV operations. Here she battles Phazon-enhanced Space Pirates and obtains the Phazon Suit after defeating the monstrous, Phazon-mutated Omega Pirate.|$|E
