Hydrogen in the <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>matter</b> shows two different hydrogen sources (Yang and Epstein, 1983 a). A direct relationship is {{found between the}} δD values of the hydrogen in <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>matter</b> and the C/H ratios of the <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>matter</b> in four meteorites. This suggests that for the two sources of the hydrogen, one has a C/H = 0 and δD ≃ - 110 ‰ (phyllosilicates formed at T ≥ 200 K) and the other has a C/H ≥ 2 and δD ≥ 10, 000 ‰ (organic matter). The latter organic matter has a D/H ratio of about 0. 002, comparable to the typical D/H values (Penzias, 1980) observed for the interstellar organic molecules in giant clouds. This supports an ion-molecule reaction mechanism (Watson, 1976; Smith et al., 1982) of the D-rich molecules in the meteorites. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of the organic loading rate (OLR) on the {{anaerobic}} acidogenic fermentation of two-phase olive mill solid residue (OMSR) derived from fruits with a low ripening index was carried out in a laboratory-scale completely stirred tank reactor at mesophilic temperature (35 degrees C). Eight experimental runs were carried out at OLRs of 3. 2, 5. 6, 7. 4, 9. 6, 11. 0, 12. 9, 14. 0 and 15. 1 g T-COD/ld, which were equivalent to hydraulic retention times of 50. 0, 28. 8, 21. 8, 16. 9, 14. 7, 12. 4, 11. 5 and 10. 7 d, respectively. The experimental results obtained demonstrated that the optimum value of OLR for the acidogenic fermentation process was 12. 9 g T-COD/ld, for which a maximum production of acetic acid was achieved. It was found that inhibition of the process occurred at OLRs higher than 12. 9 g T-COD/ld. This was characterized by a significant decrease in the acetic acid concentration in the effluent and an increase in the concentration of other volatile acids that may affect the methanogenic step. The process inhibition was also characterized by the plateau in the curves of the effluent substrate concentration versus the OLR applied. It was found that a first-order kinetics satisfactorily described the influence of non-acetic <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> concentration (S-COD(*)) on the rate of <b>soluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> conversion to acetic acid (R(S-COD) (*)), and the influence of acetic acid concentration (AcH) on the rate of acetic acid production (R(AcH)), while a potential equation type adequately described the influence of acetic acid concentration on the volumetric hydrogen production (R(ACH)).

It has a considerable impact on flow and sediment transport, as well as processes of river bed deformation and landform evolution throughout a watershed. In this study, considering influences on sediment movement, especially on cohesive sediment transport, Ca 2 + and H+ were chosen as characteristic ions of <b>soluble</b> <b>matter,</b> and the total desorption quantity of Ca 2 + and pH value when the desorption equilibrium is reached were employed as two indexes representing the desorption of <b>soluble</b> <b>matter.</b> By means of an indoor experiment, desorption of <b>soluble</b> <b>matter</b> as influenced by cations in static water was investigated.

40|$|Mine soils usually exhibit {{high levels}} of metal contamination. Phytoextraction is an {{environmental}} friendly and cost-effective technique for soil remediation, which consists of removal of metals from soil by plant roots and their translocation to aerial parts. Humic substances used as soil amendments could enhance metal mobility and uptake by plants due to formation of soluble complexes. This study aimed to evaluate {{the effects of a}} commercial humic acid derived from leonardite added at different rates and pH to a contaminated soil from an abandoned copper mine in Colmenarejo (Madrid, Spain) on metal mobility. The objective was to assess its potential as soil amendment for phytoextraction. Soil samples (10 g) were sequentially extracted 6 times with 20 mL of solution containing humic acid at: 0 (control), 0. 25, 1, and 5 g L- 1. Solutions were previously adjusted to pH: 4, 6. 1 (natural soil pH) and 8. Extracts were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, metal concentrations (Cu and Zn) and ratio of absorption at 465 to 665 nm (E 4 /E 6) as an indirect measure of <b>soluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> content. Results showed that addition of higher doses of humic <b>acid</b> increased <b>soluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> content, and therefore extracted a higher concentration of Zn and particularly Cu, due to formation of soluble humic complexes.

The use of this humic acid as soil amendment could promote metal phytoextraction by tolerant plants in contaminated mine soils, but it should be applied at proper pH and other soil conditions to avoid risk of metal leaching to groundwate...|$|R
40|$|A new <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> {{extracellular}} polymeric substance (<b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> EPS) was {{extracted from}} an acetate fed aerobic granular sludge reactor operated at 35 °C. <b>Acid</b> <b>soluble</b> EPS dominated granules exhibited a remarkable and distinctive tangled tubular morphology.

Acetic acid instead of the usually required alkaline extraction medium was needed to dissolve the granules and solubilise the polymeric matrix. The extracted <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> EPS was analysed and identified using various instrumental analysis including 1 H and 13 C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the glycoconjugates were characterized by fluorescence lectin-binding analysis.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{dissolved}} organic matter (DOM) on desorption behaviour of three herbicides was investigated for a silty clay soil in batch-equilibration experiments. The adsorption of the test compounds increased {{in the range of}} decreasing water-solubilities: carbetamide < atrazine < dimefuron. For desorption with 0. 01 M CaCl_ 2 (reference system) a hysteresis effect could be observed. Also desorption studies revealed that a relationship exists between the slope of the desorption isotherms and the initial adsorbate concentration from which desorption started. Increased desorption could be observed using the DOM-fraction of sewage sludges and liquid manure, while using an extract of straw compost resulted in reduced desorption. Other DOMs used as cosolutes (humic and fulvic <b>acids,</b> soil <b>soluble</b> organic <b>matter,</b> drainage water) die not affect desorption otherwise than the reference system. Except for liquid sewage sludge, adsorption increased after the previous treatment of the soil with DOMs. Desorption isotherms were calculated using a gently modified Freudlich equation and a two compartment model. This assumes that herbicide molecules are partly desorbed according to a linear isotherm, partly correspond to molecules being strongly adsorbed and which desorb according to an exponential equation. The linear compartment is relatively independant of the composition of the desorption solution. By extrapolation it was possible to estimate a quantity of irreversibly adsorbed herbicide. (orig.)

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{adrenalectomy}} and corticosteroid administration on precursor uptake and RNA synthesis in rat kidney was studied. A number of radioactively labeled precursors (³H-uridine, ³H-cytidine, and ¹⁴C-orotic acid) {{were used to}} determine the time course of incorporation into the <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> pool and the alkaline hydrolyzate fractions of both the normal and adrenalectomized rats. The incorporation of these precursors into both RNA and <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> pool was linear for at least 20 minutes. [...] A general decrease in the rate of incorporation of ³H-cytidine and ¹⁴C-orotic acid into the alkaline hydrolyzate fraction of kidneys was observed 7 to 8 days after adrenalectomy as compared to normal animals. Administration of a single dose of aldosterone 1 or 2 hours prior to the isotope, increased the rate of incorporation into <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> pool as well as into the alkaline hydrolyzate fraction to a level greater than that in normal rats. Actinomycin D administration 2 hours prior to the ¹⁴C-orotic acid markedly decreased RNA synthesis,but had no significant effect on the uptake of precursor into the <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> pool. Actinomycin D plus aldosterone treatment, compared to actinomycin D alone, resulted in an increase in precursor uptake into the <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> pool. [...] These studies suggest that most of the stimulatory effect of aldosterone on the incorporation of exogenous precursor into RNA of rat kidney is attributable to an increase in the rate of precursor uptake. There may also be a genuine stimulation of RNA synthesis as aldosterone increases the RNA:DNA ratio of adrenalectomized rat kidneys to the levels of normal animals. [...] The effects of single injections of deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone and cortisol on the incorporation of ¹⁴C-orotic acid into the kidneys of adrenalectomized rats were also studied. Deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone stimulated the precursor incorporation into <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> pool but no effect was observed on the incorporation into the alkaline hydrolyzate fraction. On the other hand, cortisol administration caused a decrease in the incorporation of precursor into the alkaline hydrolyzate fraction without affecting precursor incorporation into the <b>acid</b> <b>soluble</b> pool, suggesting that it may decrease RNA synthesis in the kidneys of adrenalectomized rats...|$|R

In hybrids, internode length correlated positively with holocellulose and nonstructural ash and negatively with lignin. Principal component analysis indicated that a large amount of diversity exists within each of the species. The results suggest that strategic use of the WCSRG could provide both positive and negative selection for fiber-related traits could be made within all species of the collection...|$|R
40|$|Shellac can be {{produced}} by two different procedures, namely heat process and solvent process: Ordinarily, domestic shellac produced by heat process, while imported one (from India) by solvent process. Solvent process yields shellac much purer than heat processed, with relatively better properties. The physico­chemical properties of shellac produced in this experiment, i. e. : moisture content 2. 36 %, ash content 0. 15 %, <b>matter</b> <b>soluble</b> in water 0. 43 %, <b>matter</b> <b>soluble</b> in cold alcohol 97. 86 %, acid number 46. 81 and Iod number 16. 39. Shellac from fabric manufacturing have its properties i. e. : moisture content 4. 03 %, ash content 0. 27 %, <b>matter</b> <b>soluble</b> in water 3. 26 %, <b>matter</b> <b>soluble</b> in cold alcohol 89. 14 %, acid number 41. 01 and Iod number 31. 35. Result of LSD test between experiment shellac and shellac from fabric are reveal highly significant different for ash content, <b>matter</b> <b>soluble</b> in water, <b>matter</b> <b>soluble</b> in cold alcohol and Iod number, but is not significantly different for the other properties...|$|R
