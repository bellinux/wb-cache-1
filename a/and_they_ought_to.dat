He said that while he had once sought power and glory, he realized he needed to seek love and forgiveness. In 1979, Wallace said of his stand in the schoolhouse door: [...] "I was wrong. Those days are over, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be over." [...] He publicly asked for forgiveness from African Americans.|$|E

'Tis {{a strange}} thing to any body without doubt, {{that has not been}} in that clear-sighted Region, to comprehend, That those we call High-flyers in England are the only Friends to the Dissenters, and have been the most Diligent and Faithful in their Interest, of any People in the Nation; and yet so it is, Gentlemen, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have the Thanks of the whole Body for it.|$|E

60|$|And while Lady Harman {{was making}} these meritorious and industrious {{attempts}} {{to grasp the}} significance of life and to get some clear idea of her social duty, the developments of those Hostels she had started--she now felt so prematurely--was going on.

60|$|On the whole, every {{circumstance}} of mercy, and {{of comparative}} justice, does, in my opinion, plead {{in favor of}} such low, untaught, or ill-taught wretches. But above all, the policy of government is deeply interested that the punishments should appear one, solemn, deliberate act, aimed not at random, and at particular offences, but done with a relation to the general spirit of the tumults; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{be nothing more than}} what is sufficient to mark and discountenance that spirit.|$|E

6000|$|... "You see, it {{will not}} do to take too large a ship," [...] {{explained}} Barwell Dawson. [...] "A small vessel can often get through where a big one would get stuck. The Ice King is built shallow, so that instead of being crushed in the floating ice, she will slide up on it, or over it. The sides are two feet thick, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> resist a tremendous pressure. We have to have great engine power, and a steel prow, for sometimes we'll have to simply smash our way through." ...|$|E
5000|$|People reason daily {{about what}} <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do <b>and</b> how <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> act. <b>They</b> seem to reason in two {{distinct}} ways, identified as {{two kinds of}} reasoning-at-large or Rationality. They reason about legitimate ends—what <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do—and about efficient means—how <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> achieve their ends. Since antiquity, scholars have accepted this dichotomy and assigned supreme importance to understanding both kinds of rationality, as the following quotes suggest: ...|$|R

60|$|SAVVY. I'm sorry. But Mr Lubin didn't {{stand on}} much {{ceremony}} with me, did he? And Mr Burge hasnt addressed {{a single word}} to me. I'm {{not going to stand}} it.

It's the only one we are going to vote for; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be told about it for the credit of the family and the good of their own souls. You just tip them a chapter from the gospel of the brothers Barnabas, Daddy.|$|E
60|$|He wrote {{a note to}} Judge Brown, {{telling him}} that he was settled, but was taking very little part in the {{organizing}} of the House. He did not say that he was disappointed in his reception, but he was; his vanity had been hurt. His canvass had attracted considerable attention from the Democratic press of the country, and he expected to be received with great favor by them. He had come out of Republicanism for their sake, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> recognize him. He did not consider that no one knew him by sight, and that recognition was impossible.|$|E
60|$|Viscount Rooster had {{not been}} two hours in bed, when the Count de Punter (formerly of the Black Jaegers) waited upon him upon the part of M. de Castillonnes and the Earl of Kew, who had {{referred}} him to the Viscount to arrange matters for a meeting between them. As the meeting must take place out of the Baden territory, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> move before the police prevented them, the Count proposed that they should at once make for France; where, as it was an affair of honneur, they would assuredly be let to enter without passports.|$|E
