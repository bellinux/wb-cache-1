All the RAAF Beauforts were grounded until they were modified to eliminate the problem. Learmonth is credited with supplying the vital information that was necessary to identify the problem and eventually solve it. A secret World War II landing field at Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, known only by the code-name Potshot, was eventually developed into a permanent military base and named RAAF Learmonth in honour of Wing Commander Charles Learmonth.|$|E
25|$|Firearms use {{triggers}} {{to initiate}} the firing of a cartridge in the firing chamber of the weapon. This is accomplished by <b>actuating</b> a striking device {{through a combination of}} spring and kinetic energy operating through a firing pin to strike and ignite the primer. There are two primary types of striking mechanisms, hammers and strikers. Hammers are spring-tensioned masses of metal that pivot on a pin when released and strike a firing pin to discharge a cartridge. Strikers are, essentially, spring-loaded firing pins that travel on an axis in-line with the cartridge eliminating the need for a separate hammer. The connection between the trigger and the hammer is generally referred to as the sear surface. Variable mechanisms will have this surface directly on the trigger and hammer or have separate sears or other connecting parts.|$|E

25|$|The five-needle telegraph, {{which was}} mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, {{was similar to}} that of Schilling, and based on the {{principle}} enunciated by André-Marie Ampère – that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and break key, and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a magnetic needle free to turn round its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits <b>actuating</b> five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon {{it in such a way}} that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.|$|E
25|$|Revox went {{one step}} further: after much {{hesitation}} {{about whether to}} accept cassettes as a medium capable for meeting their strict standards from reel-to-reel recorders at all, they produced their B710MK I (Dolby B) and MK II (Dolby B) machines. Both cassette units possessed double capstan drives, but with two independent, electronically controlled capstan motors and two separate reel motors. The head assembly moved by <b>actuating</b> a damped solenoid movement, eliminating all belt drives and other wearable parts. These machines rivaled the Nakamichi in frequency and dynamic range. The B710MKII also achieved 20–20,000Hz and dynamics of over 72dB with Dolby C on chrome and slightly less dynamic range, but greater headroom with metal tapes and Dolby C. Revox adjusted the frequency range on delivery with many years of use in mind: when new, the frequency curve went upwards a few dB at 15–20kHz, aiming for flat response after 15 years of use, and headwear to match.|$|E
25|$|The ISS {{employs a}} total of four CMGs as primary <b>actuating</b> devices during normal flight mode operation. The {{objective}} of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative {{to the surface of the}} Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of gravity gradient, atmospheric drag, solar pressure, and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.|$|E

500|$|It was {{discovered}} that the craft was inherently unstable in forward flight, as the aerodynamic center of pressure was well forward {{of the center of}} gravity. The Avrocar thus included a mechanical stability control system that was independent of the pilot's controls. The turborotor had a fairly large angular momentum and was intended to act as a powerful gyroscope, providing a [...] "normal" [...] direction of flight. Control cables attached {{to the base of the}} rotor would be pulled when the craft moved in relation to the rotor, <b>actuating</b> the control surfaces to counteract the motion.|$|E
500|$|In the machine's {{original}} 1868 design, {{paper was}} placed horizontally {{on the top}} of the machine, held in place by a movable square frame (to provide line and letter spacing). Above the paper and centered on the device, an arm held an inked ribbon which crossed over a small metal plate. Depressing a key caused a typebar to rise from underneath the paper, pressing the paper upwards against the ribbon and thus printing an inked character. This method of imprinting required use of very thin, nonstandard paper (such as tissue paper). Two variants were produced with alternative methods of <b>actuating</b> the typebars: one in which the keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which the keys directly [...] "kicked" [...] the typebars upwards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{the concept}} of a {{convolution}} product of real-valued functions on the Special Euclidean group, SE(D) (which describes all rigid body motions in D-dimensional Euclidean space), is applied to the determination of workspaces of discretely <b>actuated</b> manipulators. These manipulators have a finite number of joint states. If a discretely <b>actuated</b> manipulator consists of P <b>actuated</b> modules, each with K states, then it can reach K P frames in space. Given this exponential {{growth in the number of}} reachable frames, brute force representation of discretely <b>actuated</b> manipulator workspaces is not feasible in the highly <b>actuated</b> case. However, by partitioning a discretely <b>actuated</b> manipulator into P modules, and approximating the workspace of each module as a density function on a compact subset of the Special Euclidean group, the whole workspace can be approximated as an P-fold convolution of these densities. A numerical approximation of this convolution is presented in this paper which is O(P) for fixed taskspace dimension. In the special case when the manipulator is composed of P identical <b>actuated</b> modules, the workspace density for the whole manipulator can be calculated in O(log P) computation time. In either case, the O(K P) computations required by brute force workspace generation are avoided.

The paper {{contrasts}} current {{views about}} the effectiveness of <b>actuated</b> signal control in urban traffic, based on a field study carried-out in Brazil, and evaluates the viability of analysis methods based on HCM performance models in predicting signal times and vehicle delays for deciding about its implementation. We argue that there is an old view about the use of <b>actuated</b> control on practical warrants (as cure for light-volume traffic signals only) in contrast to a theoretical belief on the performance superiority of <b>actuated</b> control (stated generically). The field study investigates the comparative performance of pre-timed and <b>actuated</b> control in a heavy traffic urban intersection and evaluates field measures of delay against HCM-based model estimates (a basic tool for establishing a clear criteria grounded on cost-benefit analysis). Our field study shows that potential gains from <b>actuated</b> control are not easy to realize, depends on good parameter setting for micro-regulation efficiency and, most of all, on the importance of incidents and trends that ask for an automatic macro-regulation capability. Even for evaluating micro-regulation gains, HCM-based performance models give biased results about traffic <b>actuated</b> operation, commanding care on their use for assessing the real (relative) effectiveness of traffic <b>actuated</b> control on the field, not to say about paramete...|$|R
