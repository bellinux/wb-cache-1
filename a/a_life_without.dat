25|$|The Star Sapphires {{are first}} {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} a group during a conversation between Carol Ferris and Hal Jordan immediately after Ferris has just recovered from having been possessed by the Star Sapphire stone during Mystery of the Star Sapphire. Ferris explains that while under the possession of the stone, she learned a number of things about its history and capabilities. She says that it told her that billions of years ago, when the Guardians of the Universe decided to form the Green Lantern Corps, a tribe of women left Oa because they did not agree with the Guardians' belief in living <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>without</b> emotion. They said they would continue on their own existence living with emotions, starting with love. They searched the universe for billions of years for the thing the Guardians feared, and eventually found it on a planet called Zamaron. They learned of love from the first Star Sapphire gem, which was discovered locked between the embrace of two crystallized skeletons inside a cave. She explains to him that despite the fact that he had been able to defeat the various incarnations of the Star Sapphire he'd encountered up until then, other Green Lanterns had not been as fortunate. She describes another Star Sapphire falling in love with a Green Lantern and encasing his world in violet crystal so that the two could be together forever. She also mentions that the Star Sapphire gem is like the green power rings used by Green Lanterns and the yellow power rings used by Sinestro Corps members.|$|E

500|$|In addition, {{the album}} {{includes}} {{a series of}} humorous skits that involve West joining a fictional black fraternity, [...] "Broke Phi Broke," [...] whose members pride themselves in living <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>without</b> money or worldly possessions, despite the glaring disadvantages such a lifestyle brings. His character is eventually expelled from the fraternity after their leader discovers that not only has West been making beats for cash on the side but has also been breaking some of its rules, such as eating meals everyday, buying new clothes, and taking showers. According to music writer Mickey Hess, the skits serve to encapsulate, [...] "a contradiction {{at the core of}} contemporary American life: the need to belong, to fit in, with your fellow humans versus the Darwinistic mad grab at material things, success in the latter being the very definition of success in our culture." ...|$|E
500|$|Speer {{was born}} in Mannheim, into an upper-middle-class family. He was the second of three sons of Luise Máthilde Wilhelmine (Hommel) and Albert Friedrich Speer. In 1918, the family moved {{permanently}} to their summer home Villa Speer on Schloss-Wolfsbrunnenweg, Heidelberg. According to Henry T. King, deputy prosecutor at Nuremberg who later {{wrote a book about}} Speer, [...] "Love and warmth were lacking in the household of Speer's youth." [...] Speer was active in sports, taking up skiing and mountaineering. Speer's Heidelberg school offered rugby football, unusual for Germany, and Speer was a participant. He wanted to become a mathematician, but his father said if Speer chose this occupation he would [...] "lead <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>without</b> money, without a position and without a future". Instead, Speer followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture.|$|E
500|$|Fraser Nelson, {{editor of}} The Spectator, {{suggested}} the programme had highlighted {{a section of}} society who have been forgotten by the politicians: [...] "These people are people who otherwise don’t have a voice. They don’t vote, so for many years they have just not mattered". Nelson's comments were echoed by Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily Mail, who felt the programme portrayed its participants sympathetically: [...] "The real scandal of Benefits Street, in fact, is what it tells us about a welfare system that abandons thousands of people – {{through no fault of}} their own – to <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>without</b> hope or ambition, effectively turning them into an underclass, dependent on the charity of the State." [...] Charlie Brooker also felt the programme had been [...] "broadly sympathetic" [...] to those it portrays. In the Daily Mirror, entrepreneur John Bird, founder of The Big Issue, wrote that although Benefits Street did not fully represent the spectrum of people who claim benefits, it did show what could happen to those forgotten by the system [...] "who get caught in a kind of social suicide".|$|E

500|$|The film {{also makes}} {{substantial}} use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect {{to accentuate the}} lack of control that humanity as individuals possesses. Often at each stage of his life there is a scene where Nemo {{is subject to the}} whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack all control. This is a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, it is why the smoke never goes back into the cigarette, time is always moving in one direction. [...] At the end when it assumes that the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts, and it begins to reverse. Thus signalling the absolute freedom Nemo had been seeking – being able to live <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>without</b> choice, for while you never choose all things remain possible. The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choice and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the reveal Mr. Nobody age 118 states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made has just as much significance as any alternate choice. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, to the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width and time), and to the imagination of our former selves. And once the boy Nemo knows the outcomes of either choice, he instinctively opts for another.|$|E

2500|$|Justice O'Connor {{wrote an}} opinion for herself, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justice Kennedy. [...] Under the Eighth Amendment, a narrow {{proportionality}} principle applies to non-capital sentences. [...] Before Ewing, the Court had {{from time to}} time examined lengthy sentences imposed for relatively minor crimes. [...] In Rummel v. Estelle, , the Court upheld a life sentence for obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses imposed on a three-time offender under Texas's recidivist statute. [...] In Solem v. Helm, , the Court struck down <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>without</b> parole (LWOP) sentence imposed on a defendant who had committed a seventh non-violent felony. [...] Most recently, in Harmelin v. Michigan, , the Court upheld <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>without</b> parole sentence imposed on a first-time offender convicted of possession of more than 650grams of cocaine. [...] Against this backdrop of case law, O'Connor said that the gross disproportionality principle contained in the Eighth Amendment would require striking down only an extreme noncapital sentence, such as a life sentence for overtime parking.|$|E
