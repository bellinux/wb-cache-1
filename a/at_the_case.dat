The front door had an alarm warning, and had not been forced open, as it might have been if the putative burglars had not expected anyone to be at home.|$|E

25|$|In 1885, Michelson began a {{collaboration}} with Edward Morley, spending considerable {{time and money}} to confirm with higher accuracy Fizeau's 1851 experiment on Fresnel's drag coefficient, to improve on Michelson's 1881 experiment, and to establish the wavelength of light as a standard of length. At this time Michelson was professor of physics <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Case</b> School of Applied Science, and Morley was professor of chemistry at Western Reserve University (WRU), which shared a campus with the Case School on the eastern edge of Cleveland. Michelson suffered a nervous breakdown in September 1885, from which he recovered by October 1885. Morley ascribed this breakdown to the intense work of Michelson during the preparation of the experiments. In 1886, Michelson and Morley successfully confirmed Fresnel's drag coefficient – this result was also considered as a confirmation of the stationary aether concept.|$|E
25|$|Michelson {{was fascinated}} with the sciences, {{and the problem of}} {{measuring}} the speed of light in particular. While at Annapolis, he conducted his first experiments of the speed of light, as part of a class demonstration in 1877. His Annapolis experiment was refined, and in 1879, he measured the speed of light in air to be 299,864±51 kilometres per second, and estimated the speed of light in vacuum as 299,940km/s, or 186,380mi/s. After two years of studies in Europe, he resigned from the Navy in 1881. In 1883 he accepted a position as professor of physics <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Case</b> School of Applied Science in Cleveland, Ohio and concentrated on developing an improved interferometer. In 1887 he and Edward Morley carried out the famous Michelson–Morley experiment which failed to detect evidence of the existence of the luminiferous ether. He later moved on to use astronomical interferometers in the measurement of stellar diameters and in measuring the separations of binary stars.|$|E

500|$|Born in Brevard, North Carolina, McDaniel {{attended}} Chesterville High School in Ohio.

[...] His initial postgraduate studies took place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Case</b> School of Applied Science, graduating with a master's degree in 1940. McDaniel continued postgraduate studies {{when he moved to}} Cornell University, and in 1943 he completed his doctoral thesis, examining the absorption rates of neutrons in indium. The research was not classified, but McDaniel and Robert Bacher, his adviser at Cornell, marked it as [...] "secret" [...] on their own initiative. From Cornell, McDaniel moved to MIT where he held a postdoctoral position, studying [...] "the rapidly evolving field of fast electronics", which he applied to research in particle physics.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, {{aided by}} junior counsel Sebag Shaw and Peter Rawlinson, Stevenson defended Ruth Ellis against {{the charge of}} murdering her lover. Stevenson's {{decision}} to keep his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to a minimum, and his [...] "near silent performance in court", have been severely criticised by Muriel Jakubait, Ellis's sister. He opened the defence by saying: [...] "Let me make this abundantly plain: {{there is no question}} here but this woman shot this man... You will not hear one word from me– or from the lady herself– questioning that." [...] The jury took 23minutes to find Ellis guilty; she was sentenced to be hanged, the last woman executed for murder in the United Kingdom. Public revulsion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> is thought to have played a part in the abolition of capital punishment in the UK in 1969.|$|E
500|$|Never having {{finished}} his degree at Indiana, Saban enrolled that summer at Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio.

[...] "Saban has been regarded as the best in football at his position for two years", Brown said in November. [...] "If anything, he's even better this year. He has improved on covering pass receivers." [...] He was a unanimous all-AAFC selection in 1949, when the Browns won their fourth AAFC championship in a row. Saban announced his retirement before the championship game and said in December that he was seeking the head coaching job <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Case</b> Institute of Technology in Cleveland before its merger with the Western Reserve University forming the Case Western Reserve University.|$|E

500|$|Barlow {{played the}} part of the detectives during filming, asking scripted {{questions}} to Seifert's character, but is never featured in Her Story. When watching police interviews for research, Barlow found himself empathising with the interviewee, which inspired him to exclude the detective from the game. He stated that the interviews typically feature [...] "double betrayal", in which the detectives are [...] "pretending to be the best friend". Barlow felt that removing the detective from the game empowers Seifert's character, allowing players to empathise. When conducting research for Her Story, Barlow looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> regarding the murder of Travis Alexander, which made him consider the manner that female murder suspects are treated in interrogations, stating that they [...] "tend to be fetishised, more readily turned into archetypes". This was further proved to Barlow when studying the interviews of Casey Anthony and Amanda Knox; he found that media commentary often ignored the evidence of the investigation, instead focusing on the expressions of the suspects during the interviews. Barlow conducted further research by studying texts about psychology, and the use of language.|$|E

Patients and methodsEight sport-related and 45 non-sport-related cases from 53 ulnar neuropathies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrist <b>cases</b> over 14 years. ResultsSport-related ulnar neuropathies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrist <b>cases</b> {{were due to}} cycling (5 cases), kayaking (2 cases), and big-game fishing (1 case). No patient had sensory complaints in ulnar digits, and all had motor impairment. Conduction across the wrist with recording on the first dorsal interosseous muscle was impaired in all cases, with conduction block in 5. Two cyclists showed bilateral ulnar neuropathies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrist. All <b>cases</b> recovered within 2 to 6 months with sport discontinuation. Distal lesions of the deep motor branch were more frequent in sport- than non-sport-related cases. ConclusionsThe 8 sport-related ulnar neuropathies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrist <b>cases</b> involved <b>the</b> deep motor branch. Conduction study to the first dorsal interosseous muscle across the wrist {{is the key to}} electrodiagnostics. Bilateral cases in cyclists does not require wrist imaging...|$|R
