She joined her father and stepmother at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh from July 1681 until May 1682. It was her last journey outside England.|$|E

The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death {{reached the}} King <b>and</b> <b>Anne,</b> who were overjoyed. The {{following}} day, Henry <b>and</b> <b>Anne</b> wore yellow, {{the symbol of}} joy and celebration in England, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities. In Spain, the home country of Catherine of Aragon, yellow was the colour of mourning, in addition to black. For this reason, the wearing of yellow by Henry <b>and</b> <b>Anne</b> {{may have been a}} symbol of mourning. With Mary's mother dead, Anne attempted to make peace with her. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that her heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but of cancer of the heart, something which was not understood at the time.|$|E

5|$|Anne Hyde (12 March 163731 March 1671) was Duchess of York and of Albany as {{the first}} wife of the future King James II of England.
