5|$|Major {{entry points}} to Skyline Drive located in Front Royal, Thornton Gap, Swift Run Gap, and Rockfish Gap. Fees are {{collected}} at the Skyline Drive's four access points. The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park.

A seven-day pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle.

25|$|Any {{motor vehicle}} built before the Euro {{emission}} standards were in force (called pre-E) {{is not allowed}} to enter the restricted zone (ZTL) from October 15 to April 15, as these vehicles have the worst polluting engines and the weather during this period worsens air quality. This is a restriction in force in the entire Lombardy region since 2007. Cleaner vehicles are exempted from the pollution charge and there is free access for all vehicles on Saturdays and Sundays, except as noted above. The amount of the charge payable depends on the type of vehicle according with their compliance with the European emission standards, and there is a discounted <b>annual</b> <b>pass</b> for residents within the restricted zone (ZTL). The following table details the daily and annual charges and the type of vehicles that are exempted.|$|E
25|$|Travelcards {{for seven}} days or longer are known as season tickets and allow travel {{at any time of}} the day. When bought at a London Underground station or other Transport for London agent, one day Travelcards are sold on a paper ticket with a {{magnetic}} stripe and Travelcards lasting seven days or more are loaded on to an Oyster Card. A monthly travelcard (valid for between 28 and 31 days depending on month) is sold for 3.84 times the price of a 7-day card, while annual travelcards are sold for the price of 40 7-day tickets. The price of a travelcard valid for between one month and one year will be the sum of the relevant number of months, plus a pro-rata monthly rate for the number of days in the final month. As 40 weekly tickets cost approximately the same as a 10-month-12-day ticket, it is not possible in practice to buy a travelcard for a period between 10M12D and 1 year, as an <b>annual</b> <b>pass</b> is cheaper and will be issued anyway.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} the charge {{depended}} on the vehicle's engine emissions standard and fees vary from € 2 to €10 on weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free access to the ZTL was granted to several types of alternative fuel vehicles and for conventional fuel vehicles compliant with the Euro3 and Euro4 or better. Residents within the restricted zone were exempted only if driving higher emission standard vehicles while owners of vehicles with older more polluting engines a discount only if they buy an <b>annual</b> <b>pass</b> that can go up to €250 depending on the vehicle's engine emission standards. Enforcement is carried out through digital cameras located at 43 electronic gates, with fines for offenders varying between €70 to €275. The Ecopass fee can be paid before entering the ZTL or up to midnight the next day after entering. There are daily and multiple-day passes. Payment of the fee can be made via internet, by telephone, in designated banks or by direct debit to the user's bank account, by first an Ecopass card must be issue at designated places.|$|E

2500|$|During construction, the codename [...] "Project Dylan" [...] {{was used}} to keep the movie tie-in secret. The name 'Dylan' in fact came from the project director's cat, with no actual {{relevance}} to the ride. The design team with Merlin Studios included contributions and track layout consultancy from British designer John Wardley. A large section of the Canada Creek Railway had to be rebuilt, affecting a small section of the Samurai line queue. Competition winners and <b>annual</b> <b>pass</b> holders were allowed to attend a preview event, before it {{opened to the public}} on Saturday 14 March 2009 a year later.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Austen, dispassionately. He {{had hardly}} heard what Zeb had said; his mind {{had been going}} onward. [...] "Yes. They sent me an <b>annual</b> <b>pass,</b> and I took it back." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Flint {{paused to}} light his cigar, and Austen summoned his resolution. Second by second it was {{becoming}} more and more difficult and seemingly more ungracious to return a gift so graciously given, a gift of no inconsiderable intrinsic value. Moreover, Mr. Flint had ingeniously contrived almost to make the act, in Austen's eyes, that of a picayune upstart. Who was he to fling back an <b>annual</b> <b>pass</b> {{in the face of the}} president of the Northeastern Railroads? ...|$|E
6000|$|Austen {{stared at}} it and whistled. Then he pushed back his chair, with the pass in his hand, and hesitated. He seized a pen and wrote a few lines: [...] "Dear sir, I beg to return the <b>annual</b> <b>pass</b> over the Northeastern Railroads with which you have so kindly honoured me"--when he {{suddenly}} changed his mind again, rose, {{and made his way}} through the corridors to his father's office.

60|$|We {{are back}} in Brampton, owning, as we do, an <b>annual</b> <b>pass</b> over the Truro Railroad. Cynthia has been there all the summer, and {{as it is now}} the first of September, her school has begun again. I do not by any means intend to imply that Brampton is not a {{pleasant}} place to spend the summer: the number of its annual visitors is a refutation of that; but to Cynthia the season had been one of great unhappiness. Several times Lem Hallowell had stopped the stage in front of Ephraim's house to beg her to go to Coniston, and Mr. Satterlee had come himself; but she could not have borne to be there without Jethro. Nor would she go to Boston, though urged by Miss Lucretia; and Mrs. Merrill and the girls had implored her to join them at a seaside place on the Cape.|$|E
