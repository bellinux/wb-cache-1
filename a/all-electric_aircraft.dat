40|$|Emissions from {{aviation}} {{have become}} a focus of increasing interest in recent years. The growth of civil aviation is faster than nearly all other economic sectors. Increased demand {{has led to a}} higher growth rate in fossil fuels consumption by the aviation sector. Despite more fuel-effcient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines, the growth of air travel contributes to increase pollution attributable to aviation. Aircraft are currently the only human-made in situ generators of emissions in the upper troposphere and in the stratosphere. The depletion of the stratosphere's ozone layer by CFCs and related chemicals has underscored the importance of anticipating other potential insults to the ozone layer. Different possible solutions have been advanced to reduce the environmental impact of aviation, such as electrication of ground operations, optimization of airline timetables and airspace usage, limitation of cruise altitude and increased use of turboprop aircrafts. Those improvements seem very limited answers, which allow only marginal reduction of the environmental footprint of air transport. Breakthrough concepts such as the <b>all-electric</b> <b>aircrafts</b> must be considered. Today state of electric-propulsion is demonstrating a lack of performance and operative range if compared to traditional propulsion concepts. This paper presents a novel concept which has been only envisaged before based on the increase of the performance and range of electric airplanes by an effective cogeneration on board. This concept aims to allow effective and more efcient electric aeronautic propulsion through next generation of green all electric propulsio...|$|R

In this framework, the European Commission has selected ENFICA-FC (ENvironmentally Friendly Inter City Aircraft powered by Fuel Cells), as one of the co-founded projects in the Aeronautics and Space 6 th Framework Programme. The goals of the project were the following: 1) A feasibility study in order to provide a preliminary definition of new and innovative power systems based on different fuel cell technologies; 2) The conversion of a modern and conventional two-seat <b>aircraft</b> into an <b>all-electric</b> airplane entirely powered by fuel cell. A feasibility study was carried out to provide a preliminary definition of systems (APU, primary electrical generation supply, emergency electrical power supply, landing gear, de-icing system, etc) in which fuel cells (PEM or SOFC) can be exploited. The feasibility study took into account the both present technologies and expected improvements of future generation of fuel-cell systems and thereby showed the differences in aircraft performances that could arise between conventional and more/all electric aircraft for different levels of technology development. In addition, the feasibility of an <b>all-electric</b> propulsion inter-city <b>aircraft</b> (10 - 15 seat), completely powered by fuel cells, was studied in order to assess the impact that could have a more silent and less polluting aircraft. The second part of the paper deals with the setting up and test flights of a fuel cell general aviation aircraft fuelled by hydrogen. The all-electrical power system was successfully tested during the experimental flights.

Available from: [URL] {{machines}} {{have been}} recognized {{in the last few}} years like an attractive alternative to conventional three-phase ones. This is due to their usefulness in a niche of applications where the reduction in the total power per phase and, mainly, the high overall system reliability and the ability of using the multiphase machine in faulty conditions are required. Electric vehicle and railway traction, <b>all-electric</b> ships, more-electric <b>aircraft</b> or wind power generation systems are examples of up-to-date real applications using multiphase machines, most of them taking advantage of the ability of continuing the operation in faulty conditions. Between the available multiphase machines, symmetrical five-phase induction machines are probably one of the most frequently considered multiphase machines in recent research. However, other multiphase machines have also been used {{in the last few years}} due to the development of more powerful microprocessors. This chapter analyzes the behavior of generic n-phase machines (beingn any odd number higher than 3) in faulty operation (considering the most common faulty operation, i. e. the open phase fault). The obtained results will be then particularized to the 5 -phase case, where some simulation and experimental results will be presented to show the behavior of the entire system in healthy and faulty conditions. The chapter will be organized as follows: First, the different faults in a multiphase machine are analyzed. Fault conditions are de tailed and explained, and the interest of a multiphase machine in the management of faults is stated. The effect of the open-phase fault operation in the machine model is then studied. A generic n-phase machine is considered, being n any odd number greater than three. The analysis is afterwards particularized to the 5 -phase machine, where the open phase fault condition is managed using different control methods and the obtained results are compared.

The proposed information-energy technique provides an opportunity to develop electric and hybrid aircraft with optimal weight and size and energy characteristics due to: electricity consump- tion timeline optimization through the redistribution of electric end users switch on moments, which provides a more uni- form power mode, allowing the same set of electric users to reduce generator rated power, and as a result reduce the flight weight; manage a distributed system of electricity generation that provides the ability to use diverse energy sources; faul tsafety management based on rapid changes in the power network topology; energy recovery control; the sources, convert- ers and users (input circuit) and power network real-time diagnostic operations...|$|E
40|$|The Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE) {{has imposed}} itself ambitious {{objectives}} concerning industrial leadership, {{safety and security}} as well as emissions reduction within civil aviation toward the years 2020 and 2050, respectively. Integration of electrochemical energy conversion technologies in form of secondary batteries, fuel cells or supercapacitors shows significant potential to reduce emissions of both contaminants and noise aboard future generations of aircraft. With its group Energy System Integration (ESI) the Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics (TT) at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) performs applied research and development with respect to innovative electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies; thereby, research focusses on emergency and auxiliary power for more-electric civil aircraft as well as propulsion power for small <b>all-electric</b> <b>aircraft.</b> A promising approach is the multifunctional system integration of lowtemperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (LT-PEMFC) exploiting not only their electric output power but also their waste heat, process water and oxygen-depleted air (ODA) for an effective and efficient integration into aircraft system architectures. The present talk summarizes the most recent research and development results concerning multifunctional fuel cell systems (MFFCS) for emergency and/or auxiliary power generation aboard future generations of civil aircraft, with special emphasis on conceptual designs and operation strategies. Based on measurement data and theoretical studies revealing the multipurpose power demand of existing civil short- & mid-range aircraft, general requirements are derived to dimension MFFCS. It is shown that with existing fuel cell technology it is feasible to fulfill these requirements; however, novel conceptual designs for both electric and process engineering interconnection of MFFCS demonstrate the potential to optimize the dynamical behavior and/or the degradation process of the fuel cell stacks. This potential is utilized to develop optimum power point tracking method for arrays possessing several fuel cell stacks in multifunctional system integration and deduce operation strategies for MFFCS. Finally, an outlook is provided specifying and discussing the next steps for further research and development toward a practical multifunctional system integration of fuel cells in future generations of civil aircraft...|$|E
