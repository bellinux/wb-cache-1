It was not until the appointment of Jack Charlton as manager in 1977 that the club started to climb back up the league pyramid. Charlton led the Owls back to the Second Division in 1980 before handing the reins to Howard Wilkinson, who took the club back into the top flight in 1984, after an absence of 14 years.|$|E
25|$|Douglas started Night 1 on vault {{and despite}} a hop {{backwards}} on her double-twisting Yurchenko vault, she scored a 15.150. On bars, {{she had a}} high-flying piked Tkachev connected to her Pak Salto and had an excellent landing on her double layout dismount. She scored a 15.300 on bars. On beam she had a shaky routine with balance checks but did score a 14.450. On floor she had bad wobbles on her double Y-turn and her double turn with leg at horizontal (then didn't connect to her single turn with leg at horizontal). She had low landings and <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> on her tucked full-in and scored a 13.850 to end Night 1 in 3rd with a total all-around score of 58.700.|$|E

Recovering himself, Ned flew at him, but the boy was no match for the man, and Mr. Mulready's passion was as fierce as his own; seizing his throat with his left hand and forcing him back into a corner of the room, his stepfather struck him again and again with all his force with his right.|$|R

25|$|To {{maximise}} {{his income}} and reach a broader audience, Eliot also sought {{a deal with}} magazines. Being the London correspondent for The Dial magazine and a college friend of its co-owner and co-editor, Scofield Thayer, The Dial was an ideal choice. Even though The Dial offered $150 (£34) for the poem (25% more than its standard rate) Eliot was offended that a year's work would be valued so low, especially since another contributor {{was found to have}} been given exceptional compensation for a short story. The deal with The Dial <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> through (other magazines considered were the Little Review and Vanity Fair), but with Pound's efforts eventually a deal was worked out where, in addition to the $150, Eliot would be awarded The Dials second annual prize for outstanding service to letters. The prize carried an award of $2,000 (£450).|$|E
25|$|On Night 2, Douglas {{started on}} bars where she excelled {{once again on}} her inbar-stalder pirouettes and her piked Tkachev-Pak Salto {{connection}} but she took a large step forward on her double layout dismount and <b>almost</b> <b>fell.</b> She scored a 15.100. Her total bars score of 30.400 placed her 4th on the event behind Madison Kocian, Ashton Locklear and Key (by 0.100). On beam she had a shaky routine and had {{a good number of}} balance checks and lost some connections. She had a hop and a low landing on her double pike dismount where she scored a 14.200, totaling her score to 28.650 placed her 9th on the event, 0.050 behind Raisman and Mykayla Skinner. On floor she improved her turns and connections and had better landings on her tumbling passes. She scored a 14.800 and totaled her score to 28.650, placing her 6th on the event.|$|E
25|$|In 479 Marcian {{tried to}} {{overthrow}} Zeno and reclaim the throne for himself. With {{the help of}} his brothers Procopius Anthemius and Romulus, he gathered in Constantinople troops composed of both citizens and foreigners in the house of a Caesarius, south of the Forum of Theodosius, and from there they marched at the same time on the imperial palace and on the house of Illus, who was a supporter of Zeno. The emperor <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> {{in the hands of the}} rebels, who, during the day, overwhelmed the imperial troops, who were hit also by the citizens from the roofs of their houses. During the night, however, Illus succeeded in moving inside Constantinople an Isaurian unit whose quarters were in the nearby Chalcedonia and in corrupting Marcian's soldiers, who allowed Zeno to flee. On the following morning Marcian, understanding that his situation was desperate and that the reinforcements of the Gothic general Theodoric Strabo would not arrive in time, took refuge in the church of the Holy Apostles, but was arrested with his brothers.|$|E

25|$|In 1650, New France {{had seven}} hundred colonists and Montreal {{had only a}} few dozen settlers. Because the First Nations people did most of the work of beaver hunting, the company needed few French employees. The {{severely}} underpopulated New France <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In 1660, settler Adam Dollard des Ormeaux led a Canadian and Huron militia against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, but they succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion. In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement. In 1663, New France finally became more secure when Louis XIV made it a royal province, taking control away from the Company of One Hundred Associates. In the same year the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal ceded its possessions to the Seminaire de Saint-Sulpice. The crown stimulated emigration to New France by paying for transatlantic passages and offering other incentives to those willing to move, and the population of New France grew to three thousand.|$|E
25|$|Episode two: Brian and Froso - Woodall and Constantine find Brian and Froso {{in a very}} troubled {{marriage}}. They soon {{learn that}} Brian and Froso's marriage <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> apart eighteen months before. Froso {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer on Christmas Eve that same year, and both saw a traumatic time ahead, but united as a couple throughout her treatment and subsequent mastectomy. Froso is now undergoing her recovery and coming to terms with her breast prosthesis, but the couple is experiencing a difficult time in their relationship and fail to remember when they last went out. Unable to share the truth of her body with Brian, Froso fights hard to confront her insecurities with the help of Woodall and Constantine and their silhouette screen. After she shows her body to her husband for the first time after her surgery, their relationship becomes stronger and they feel burdens released. They are soon given a new look and image. Woodall and Constantine take them to a secretly organised service where family and friends are assembled to witness the renewing their wedding vows.|$|E
25|$|Ian McTeague (Charles Napier) - A corrupt greedy businessman. He {{started up}} an illegal mining {{operation}} near the mountain, {{where he and}} his men believe that there is gold for them to dig. As they do so, they use the water from the river to irrigate their operation, where they separate the dirt from ore with chemicals, which are then later spilled out into the rest of the river heading towards the jungle. Because of this, it has caused a plague among the animals drinking it (even Tantor <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> victim to it). Even the Waziri tribe fell victim to the plague, as they used the river for their crops and drinking. Needless to say, McTeague doesn't care about the toxicity of the chemicals and continues dumping them into the river, as he still wants to be rich. Upon learning about the mine, Tarzan and his friends ally with the Waziri tribe to build a dam to block the river and then break it down to have the rushing water destroy the whole mine operation for good, leaving the river fresh and clean again. McTeague and his men then leave in a huff, but not after McTeague angrily swears revenge against Tarzan and the Waziri tribe for ruining his mining operation.|$|E

25|$|During the {{continued}} playoff drought, {{instability in the}} front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to Dallas businessman John Spano in 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off Newsday that something was amiss about their new boss. In July, Newsday exposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525 or $750) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary, Big Shot. Pickett finally found a buyer, a group led by Howard Milstein and Phoenix Coyotes co-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> through when Spectacor Management Group, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.|$|E

500|$|Albertans {{turned away}} from the United Farmers {{government}} and began to follow evangelical radio preacher William Aberhart, known as Bible Bill. The Social Credit party had been founded in 1932. Voters flocked to the radical monetary reforms proposed by Aberhart [...] and British SC theorist [...] Clifford Douglas, looking for an escape to the Great Depression. Social Credit was elected with a majority (54 percent of the vote) in the 1935 election completely wiping out the United Farmers representation (although the UFA did receive 11 percent of the vote). Aberhart had difficulty implementing the Social Credit theory and his popularity began to decline. [...] His government <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> during a 1936 caucus rebellion, in which his own MLAs forced him to promise to try to reform the banking system. But it rebounded and [...] in the 1940 election it garnered more votes than any other party and also captured a large majority of the seats. Aberhart died in 1943; he is the only premier to die in office in Alberta's history.|$|E
500|$|In November 1989, Bynoe and Bertram Lee {{purchased}} the Denver Nuggets. Lee and Bynoe had worked together in Boston years earlier, and Bynoe thought of Lee as a mentor. [...] They had kept in touch, and {{were involved in}} several real estate dealings together. But the Nuggets deal was problematic from the start. [...] In fact, it <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> through because Lee {{did not have the}} resources everyone, Bynoe among them, thought he had. [...] Media reports depicted Lee as a wealthy and successful businessman who was a financier with offices in two cities, and formerly part owner of Boston's WNEV-TV. [...] But Lee and Bynoe were unable to meet the deadline to purchase the team from then-owner Sidney Shlenker. [...] It would later be revealed that Lee had problems raising the needed capital. [...] It was Bynoe, with the assistance of David Stern, Jay Pritzker, and Jerrold Wexler, who salvaged the transaction over the course of six months. The mainstream media reported that Lee and Bynoe were now the first two blacks to own a major sports team, but several of the black newspapers pointed out that the two men were actually managing general partners rather than owners, because the revised agreement to purchase the team meant they owned only a 37.5% stake in the team. Bynoe sold his interest in the franchise in August 1992. Communications Satellite Corporation's (COMSAT) Video Enterprises subsidiary put up 62.5% of the $65 million needed to purchase the Nuggets.|$|E

Both went down, under the impetus of the rush, and the second robber immediately sprang upon Ned, and seized him by the throat. But he little knew {{the strength of the}} man with whom he had to deal. Our hero caught him in the iron grasp of his right hand, while, with his left, he hurled aside the almost inanimate form of his first assailant; then, throwing the other on his back, he placed his knee on his chest, and drew his bowie-knife.|$|R

Yes, the college is called Hearst…which I thought was funny, and it's certainly not related to publishing." [...] Hearst had never previously accepted roles where {{she was asked to}} play herself, stating that it was a [...] "pathetic attempt to get attention" [...] when other celebrities played themselves or characters similar to themselves. Hearst had heard of Veronica Mars and seen several episodes prior to her appearance; nevertheless, she still needed to talk to Thomas about the series and her character before agreeing to guest star, commenting that she discovered that the character's background was not exceedingly similar to her own life, as [...] "Selma's situation is nothing like anything I've had to deal with." [...] When reading the script for the first time, Hearst was amused by the fact that her character was the heiress to the [...] "Hearst Mart fortune", comparing it to Walmart; she stated, [...] "when I read that in the script, I burst out laughing. It was a spit-take kind of thing. I <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> over." [...] When asked whether or not the character would become a recurring one, she responded that the idea had not come up in discussions with the crew. However, she stated that she would accept if given the opportunity, and she particularly enjoyed working with Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Ed Begley, Jr..|$|E
500|$|Earlier in {{the month}} of May 1899, Luna <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> in the field at the Battle of Santo Tomas. Mounted on his horse, Luna then charged into the {{battlefield}} leading his main force in a counterattack. As they advanced, the American forces began firing upon them. Luna's horse was hit and he fell to the ground. As he recovered, Luna realized that he {{had been shot in the}} stomach, and he attempted to kill himself with his revolver to avoid capture. He was saved, though, by the actions of a Filipino colonel named Alejandro Avecilla who, having seen Luna fall, rode towards the general to save him. Despite being heavily wounded in one of his legs and an arm, with his remaining strength Avecilla carried Luna away from battle to the Filipino rear. Upon reaching safety, Luna realized that his wound was not very deep as most of the impact of the bullet had been taken by a silk belt full of gold coins that his parents had given him, which he had been wearing. As he left the field to have his wounds tended, Luna turned over the command to General Venacio Concepción, the Filipino commander of the nearby town of Angeles. Meanwhile, in recognition of his work, Luna was awarded with the Philippine Republic Medal. By the end of May 1899, Colonel Joaquín Luna, one of Antonio's brothers, warned him that a plot had been concocted by [...] "old elements" [...] or the autonomists of the Republic (who were bent on accepting American sovereignty over the country) and a clique of army officers whom Luna had disarmed, arrested, and/or insulted. Luna shrugged off all these threats, reiterating his trust for Aguinaldo, and continued building defenses at Pangasinan where the Americans were planning a landing.|$|E

[...] Despite this praise, Webb Mitovich criticised Kenneth and Tracy's [...] "office wife" [...] storyline saying that [...] "we've seen this shtick before on countless other sitcoms, {{so it was a}} bit empty and filled with 'easy' jokes." [...] Criticism was also received regarding the [...] "striped outfit... it didn't work. No," [...] referring to a joke involving Jenna trying to distract the TGS writers from her newly gained weight. Lisa Schmeiser of Television Without Pity graded this episode as a [...] "B+." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it thought that this episode [...] "started off [...] second season on a pretty strong note." [...] Porter said that this episode wasn't the best episode of 30 Rock but it was still [...] "one of the sharpest and wittiest comedies on television." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that [...] "SeinfeldVision" [...] "was a really funny beginning to the second season." [...] Sassone also notes that the appearance of Seinfeld did not feel like stunt casting. He also said that the joke about Jerry being able to buy NBC for $4 million was [...] "one of the many reasons [...] this show." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that this episode [...] "proves the low-rated show's best comedy Emmy win was no undeserved fluke." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger described this episode as [...] "really funny" [...] and thought that [...] "everyone is played in a style that's believable within [...]" [...] Linda Stasi of The New York Post said that [...] "the on-going story of the regulars that had me laughing so hard I <b>almost</b> <b>fell</b> out of bed." [...] Jake Brooks of The New York Observer thought that this episode was [...] "a rather poor 22 minutes of television (well, only [...] portion of it, the rest was pretty great)." [...] Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] "30 Rock delivers a fantastic episode to open the season. Let's hope they can also deliver an audience to keep this great show on the air." [...] Canning also awarded this episode a rating of 9.4 out of 10. Brian Lowry of Variety said that it [...] "neatly highlights this series' strengths and weaknesses, elevated by moments of inspiration and Alec Baldwin's brilliance and leavened by considerably-less-flattering silliness." [...] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times thought that [...] "SeinfeldVision" [...] "is mostly a reminder that even the most talented actors and writers sometimes slip under pressure." [...] Seinfeld was criticized as using his appearance in this episode as a plug for his upcoming feature film Bee Movie. Seinfeld, NBC and General Electric stated that this was done as metahumor.|$|E
