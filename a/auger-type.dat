30|$|However, in {{addition}} to weak Si-NCs-Er 3 + coupling, reduction in Er 3 + emission efficiency can also be due to many quenching processes accompanying the excitation and recombination of Er 3 + ions. Such processes still have not been widely investigated. Furthermore, even today, the detailed excitation mechanism of Er 3 + ions in SRSO is still not well understood. Investigations of time-resolved photoluminescence of Er 3 + ions in SRSO reveal two major excitation mechanisms leading to 1.5 -μm emission, distinguishable by their dynamics: a fast relaxation within the Si-NCs and energy transfer to ions (< 100 ns), taking Er 3 + ions directly to the first excited state, and a slow relaxation and energy transfer, exciting Er 3 + ions to higher states. In both cases, however, the emission decay should be slowed down due to slow radiative relaxation from 4 I 13 / 2 to 4 I 15 / 2 on a millisecond-microsecond time scale [18 – 20]. The fast energy transfer has already been related to <b>Auger-type</b> excitation of Er 3 + ions directly from the Si-NCs to 4 I 13 / 2 level of Er 3 + ions. In this case, excited ions should be inside the core of Si-NCs or at their surface due to the short range of <b>Auger-type</b> interactions. This mechanism can also be discussed since to obtain a high efficiency of Auger recombination within the Si-NCs, the energy levels of Si-NCs should be well separated from each other to minimize thermal relaxation which strongly reduces the <b>Auger-type</b> relaxation. It has been shown, however, theoretically that for Si-NCs, especially when surface/matrix interface is included into the calculations, the energy spectrum of Si-NCs is almost continuous above the main absorption edge [21, 22]. Besides, {{it has been shown}} recently that in the spectral range of Er 3 + emission, another emission with nanosecond decay appears which, however, cannot be related to Er 3 + ions. This emission can be assigned more likely to defect states in the SRSO film. Thus, many open questions regarding the origin of the fast process still remain.|$|E

Furthermore spectroscopic signatures of the highly doped graphene layers at the interface to SiC are observed in the near-infrared range. In the mid-infrared range, the various relaxation mechanisms, in particular scattering via optical phonons and <b>Auger-type</b> processes, are identified by comparing the experimental results to microscopic modelling.

Amorphous nanostructures may constitute an interesting system for the monolithic integration of optical and electrical functions in Si ULSI technology. In fact, they exhibit an intense room temperature electroluminescence (EL), with the advantage of being formed at a temperature of 900 °C, while at least 1100 °C is needed for the formation of Si nanocrystals. Optical and electrical properties of amorphous Si nanocluster devices have been studied in the temperature range between 30 and 300 K. The EL is seen to have a bell-shaped trend as a function of temperature with a maximum at around 60 K. The efficiency of these devices is comparable to that found in devices based on Si nanocrystals, although amorphous nanostructures exhibit peculiar working conditions (very high current densities and low applied voltages). Time resolved EL measurements demonstrate the presence of a short lifetime, only partially due to the occurrence of non-radiative phenomena, since the very small amorphous clusters formed at 900 °C are characterized by a short radiative lifetime. By forcing a current through the device a phenomenon of charge trapping in the Si nanostructures has been observed. Trapped charges affect luminescence through an <b>Auger-type</b> non-radiative recombination of excitons.

40|$|We {{consider}} Penning ionization of Rydberg atom pairs as an <b>Auger-type</b> process {{induced by}} the dipole-dipole interaction and employ semiclassical formulae for dipole transitions to calculate the autoionization width {{as a function of}} the principal quantum numbers, n d, n i, of both atoms. While for symmetric atom pairs with the well-known increase of the autoionization width with increasing n 0 is obtained, the result for asymmetric pairs is counterintuitive - for a fixed n i of the ionizing atom of the pair, the autoionization width strongly increases with decreasing n d of the de-excited atom. For H Rydberg atoms this increase reaches two orders of magnitude at the maximum of the n d dependence, and the same type of counterintuitive behavior is exhibited also by Na, Rb and Cs atoms. This is a purely quantum-mechanical effect, which points towards existence of optimal (we call them 'Tom' and 'Jerry' for 'big' and 'small') pairs of Rydberg atoms with respect to autoionization efficiency. Building on the model of population redistribution in cold Rydberg gases proposed in [1], we demonstrate that population evolution following the initial laser excitation of Rydberg atoms in state n 0 would eventually lead to the formation of such Tom-Jerry pairs with which feature autoionization widths that are enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared to that of two atoms in the initial laser-excited state n 0.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of silicon (Si) and erbium (Er) coimplanted silica (SiO 2) in which we observe, by {{combining}} high resolution {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} and selective electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), a high spatial correlation between silicon nanocrystals (Si-NCs), Er, and oxygen (O) after a single high temperature (1100 [*]°C) anneal. The observation of a spatial overlap of the EELS chemical maps of dark field (DF) images at the Er N 4, 5, Si L 2, 3, and O K edges is concomitant with an intense room temperature infrared luminescence around 1534 nm. We suggest that these observations correspond to Er–O complexes within an amorphous silicon (a-Si) shell at the Si-NC/SiO 2 interface. The presence of a crystalline phase at the Si-NC center, verified by high resolution electron micrographs and DF diffraction contrast images and the low solubility of Er in crystalline Si (c-Si) would tend to suggest a preferential Er agglomeration toward the Si-NC/SiO 2 interface during formation, particularly when high concentrations of both Si and Er are obtained in a narrow region of the SiO 2 after coimplantation. The absence of narrow Stark related features in the Er emission spectrum at low temperature and an inhomogeneous broadening with increasing temperature, which are characteristic of Er confined by an amorphous, rather than a crystalline host further support these hypotheses. After comparing the luminescence to that from a SiO 2 :Er control sample prepared in exactly the same manner but without Si-NCs, we find that, despite the observed spatial correlation, only a small fraction (∼ 7 %) of the Er are sensitized by the Si-NCs. We ascribe this low fraction to a combination of low sensitizer (Si-NC) density and <b>Auger-type</b> losses arising principally from Er ion-ion interactions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGaN/AlN {{quantum dots}} are {{semiconductor}} nanostructures where the huge conduction band offset of 1. 75 eV leads to intraband transitions at exceptionnaly short wavelengths compared to III-As semiconductor materials. For specific quantum dot dimensions, {{it was shown}} that the absorption spectrum covers the optical communication spectral range. The ultrafast relaxation dynamics observed for these materials motivates the development of opto-electronic devices, and especially ultrafast switches. However, a detailed insight into the microscopic processes governing the relaxation dynamics is still missing although of fundamental importance for the understanding and the optimization of the devices operation. In particular, there is no study of the homogeneous broadening which drives the saturation properties of GaN/AlN quantum dots-devices. In this paper, we present homogeneous linewidth measurements {{by means of the}} nonlinear optical technique of spectral hole-burning. Spectrally-resolved pump-probe experiments with cw-lasers allow us to characterize the coherence relaxation dynamics down to 5 K by resolving the homogeneous linewidth in an ensemble of GaN/AlN quantum dots. The differential transmission measured at 5 K for a TM-polarized pump shows a pronounced bleaching with an amplitude of 2 x 10 - 4 on a background signal of 5 x 10 - 5. According to the selection rules of the s-pz intraband transition in GaN/AlN QDs, we attribute the photoinduced increase of the probe transmission to the partial saturation of the quantum dots by the pump laser, and we deduce a homogeneous linewidth of 15 meV at 5 K. We find that the differential transmission signal scales like the square-root of the incident pump power, thus revealing the importance of electron-electron scattering in the population relaxation dynamics. As a matter of fact, we find that the population relaxation from the pz excited state is predominantly governed by <b>Auger-type</b> processes whereas optical phonon emission only plays a minor role, even if it may contribute to secondary processes during the carrier cascade to the fundamental s state via intermediate confined states...|$|E
