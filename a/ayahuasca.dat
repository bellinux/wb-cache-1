5|$|Many {{examples}} of rock art by the Muisca {{have been discovered}} on the Altiplano. The first rock art has been discovered by conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada during the Spanish conquest of the Muisca. The rock art consists of petroglyphs (carvings) and petrographs (drawings). The petrographs were made using the index finger. Pioneer {{in the study of}} the rock art has been Miguel Triana. Later contributions have been done by Diego Martínez, Eliécer Silva Celis and others. It is theorised that the rock art has been made under the influence of <b>ayahuasca</b> (yahé).|$|E
25|$|Shamans and {{experienced}} users of <b>ayahuasca</b> advise against consuming <b>ayahuasca</b> {{when not in}} the presence of one or several well-trained shamans.|$|E
25|$|Research {{developed}} by the Beckley Foundation suggests <b>ayahuasca</b> intake can lead to significant increases in mindfulness abilities and that <b>ayahuasca</b> can promote neurogenesis (the growth of new brain cells) in vitro.|$|E
25|$|Despite the INCB's 2001 {{affirmation}} that <b>ayahuasca</b> is {{not subject}} to drug control by international convention, in its 2010 Annual Report the Board recommended that governments consider controlling (i.e. criminalizing) <b>ayahuasca</b> at the national level. This recommendation by the INCB has been criticized as an attempt by the Board to overstep its legitimate mandate and as establishing a reason for governments to violate the human rights (i.e., religious freedom) of ceremonial <b>ayahuasca</b> drinkers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ayahuasca</b> {{is known}} by many names {{throughout}} Northern South America and Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Closely coextending with peak {{psychedelic}} effects, {{mean time}} to reach peak concentrations (Tmax) {{was determined to be}} 10–15 minutes in whole blood after IM injection, and 2 minutes in plasma after IV administration. When taken orally mixed in an <b>ayahuasca</b> decoction, and in freeze-dried <b>ayahuasca</b> gel caps, DMT Tmax is considerably delayed: 107.59 ± 32.5 minutes, and 90–120 minutes, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In modern Europe and North America, <b>ayahuasca</b> analogs {{are often}} {{prepared}} using non-traditional plants which contain the same alkaloids. For example, {{seeds of the}} Syrian rue plant {{can be used as}} a substitute for the <b>ayahuasca</b> vine, and the DMT-rich Mimosa hostilis is used in place of chacruna. Australia has several indigenous plants which are popular among modern ayahuasqueros there, such as various DMT-rich species of Acacia.|$|E
25|$|Peganum harmala {{contains}} Harmaline, {{which is}} a strong MAO-inhibitor, and it is therefore often used as a first component in <b>Ayahuasca</b> ceremonies in order to inhibit the metabolisation of an orally administered DMT molecule (2nd component). Since co-occurrence of DMT-carrying Phalaris grass and Harmala were observed at Yazd, Persepolis, Merv and Termez, the hypothesis stating that Soma/Haoma, was a biochemical Euro-Asian correlate of <b>ayahuasca,</b> cannot be a priori excluded.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingestion}} of <b>ayahuasca</b> {{can also cause}} significant, but temporary, emotional and psychological distress. Excessive use can lead to serotonin syndrome, with symptoms such as tremors, diarrhea, autonomic instability, hyperthermia, sweating, muscle spasms and possible death. Long-term negative effects are not known. A few deaths due to participation in the consumption of <b>ayahuasca</b> have been reported. Some of the deaths {{may have been due}} to unscreened preexisting heart conditions, interaction with drugs, such as antidepressants, recreational drugs, caffeine, or nicotine, or any of the various additional plants that are frequently added to brews.|$|E
25|$|Mimosa hostilis (Jurema) – root bark – not {{traditionally}} employed with <b>ayahuasca</b> by any existing cultures, though {{likely it}} was in the past. Popular in Europe and North America.|$|E
25|$|Religious use in Brazil was legalized {{after two}} {{official}} inquiries into the {{tea in the}} mid-1980s, which concluded that <b>ayahuasca</b> is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.|$|E
25|$|The Nature of Things, a CBC Television {{program by}} David Suzuki, {{explored}} an experimental drug treatment by Dr. Gabor Maté {{in which the}} substance <b>Ayahuasca</b> was used to treat addicts in Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|Dietary taboos {{are often}} {{associated}} with the use of <b>ayahuasca.</b> In the rainforest, these tend towards the purification of one's self – abstaining from spicy and heavily-seasoned foods, excess fat, salt, caffeine, acidic foods (such as citrus) and sex before, after, or during a ceremony. A diet low in foods containing tyramine has been recommended, as the speculative interaction of tyramine and MAOIs could lead to a hypertensive crisis. However, evidence indicates that harmala alkaloids act only on MAO-A, in a reversible way similar to moclobemide (an antidepressant that does not require dietary restrictions). Dietary restrictions are not used by the highly urban Brazilian <b>ayahuasca</b> church União do Vegetal, suggesting the risk is much lower than perceived and probably non-existent.|$|E
25|$|In some areas, {{there are}} purported brujos (Spanish for 'Sorcerers') who {{masquerade}} as real shamans and who entice tourists to drink <b>ayahuasca</b> in their presence. Shamans believe {{one of the}} purposes for this is to steal one's energy and/or power, of which they believe every person has a limited stockpile.|$|E
25|$|DMT is {{classified}} as a Schedule I drug under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, meaning that international trade in DMT {{is supposed to be}} closely monitored; use of DMT is supposed to be restricted to scientific research and medical use. Natural materials containing DMT, including <b>ayahuasca,</b> are not regulated under the 1971 Psychotropic Convention.|$|E
25|$|In Brazil, the brew and the liana are informally called either caapi or cipó; {{the latter}} is the Portuguese word for liana (or woody {{climbing}} vine). In the União do Vegetal of Brazil, an organised spiritual tradition in which people drink <b>ayahuasca,</b> the brew is prepared exclusively from B. caapi and P. viridis. Adherents of União do Vegetal call this brew hoasca or vegetal.|$|E
25|$|The {{speculation}} that manna was an entheogen, also paralleled in Philip K. Dick's posthumously published The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, is supported {{in a wider}} cultural context {{when compared with the}} praise of soma in the Rigveda, Mexican praise of teonanácatl, the peyote sacrament of the Native American Church, and the holy <b>ayahuasca</b> used in the ritual of the União do Vegetal and Santo Daime churches.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{members of}} the Beat Generation used {{a number of different}} drugs, including alcohol, marijuana, benzedrine, morphine, and later psychedelic drugs such as peyote, <b>Ayahuasca,</b> and LSD. They often approached drugs experimentally, initially being unfamiliar with their effects; their drug use was broadly inspired by intellectual interest and many Beat writers felt their drug experiences enhanced creativity, insight or productivity. The use of drugs was a key influence on many of the social events of the time that were personal to the Beat generation.|$|E
25|$|In December 2004, the Supreme Court {{lifted a}} stay, thereby {{allowing}} the Brazil-based União do Vegetal (UDV) church {{to use a}} decoction containing DMT in their Christmas services that year. This decoction is a tea made from boiled leaves and vines, known as hoasca within the UDV, and <b>ayahuasca</b> in different cultures. In Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, the Supreme Court heard arguments on November 1, 2005, and unanimously ruled in February 2006 that the U.S. federal government must allow the UDV to import and consume the tea for religious ceremonies under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act.|$|E
25|$|DMT is {{produced}} in many species of plants often in conjunction with its close chemical relatives 5-MeO-DMT and bufotenin (5-OH-DMT). DMT-containing plants are commonly used in South American shamanic practices. It is usually {{one of the main}} active constituents of the drink ayahuasca; however, <b>ayahuasca</b> is sometimes brewed with plants that do not produce DMT. It occurs as the primary psychoactive alkaloid in several plants including Mimosa tenuiflora, Diplopterys cabrerana, and Psychotria viridis. DMT is found as a minor alkaloid in snuff made from Virola bark resin in which 5-MeO-DMT is the main active alkaloid. DMT is also found as a minor alkaloid in bark, pods, and beans of Anadenanthera peregrina and Anadenanthera colubrina used to make Yopo and Vilca snuff in which bufotenin is the main active alkaloid. Psilocin, an active chemical in many psychedelic mushrooms, is structurally similar to DMT.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} aspects of the New Age has been its adoption of spiritual ideas and practises from other, particularly non-Western cultures. Its belief that all traditions are free for anyone to use, rather than the private property of particular communities, has resulted in New Agers adopting and marketing the practices of Third World societies. These have included [...] "Hawaiian Kahuna magic, Australian Aboriginal dream-working, South American Amerindian <b>ayahuasca</b> and San Pedro ceremony, Hindu Ayurveda and yoga, and Chinese Feng Shui, Qi Gong, and Tai Chi".|$|E
500|$|Many {{cases of}} {{serotonin}} toxicity occur {{in patients who}} have ingested drug combinations that synergistically increase synaptic serotonin. It may also occur as a symptom of overdose of a single serotonergic agent. The combination of MAOIs with precursors such as L-tryptophan or 5-HTP pose a particularly acute risk of life-threatening serotonin syndrome. The case of combination of MAOIs with tryptamine agonists (commonly known as <b>ayahuasca)</b> can present similar dangers as their combination with precursors, but this phenomenon has been described in general terms as the [...] "cheese effect". Many MAOIs irreversibly inhibit monoamine oxidase. It can take at least four weeks for this enzyme {{to be replaced by}} the body in the instance of irreversible inhibitors.|$|E
500|$|Noé {{had tried}} various {{hallucinogens}} in his youth, and used those experiences as {{inspiration for the}} visual style. Later, when the director was already planning the film, he tried the psychoactive brew <b>ayahuasca,</b> in which the active substance is DMT. This {{was done in the}} Peruvian jungle, where the brew is legal due to its traditional use as an entheogen. Noé described the experience as very intense, and said he regarded it [...] "almost like professional research." [...] Since few on the design team had ever taken a hallucinogen, it was necessary for Noé to collect and provide visual references in the forms of paintings, photographs, music videos, and excerpts from films. One reference used was the works of biologist Ernst Haeckel, whose drawings influenced the organic patterns seen during Oscar's visions.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ayahuasca</b> is used {{largely as}} a treasured sacrament. [...] People who work with <b>ayahuasca</b> in {{non-traditional}} contexts often align themselves with the philosophies and cosmologies associated with <b>ayahuasca</b> shamanism, as practiced among indigenous peoples like the Urarina of the Peruvian Amazon. While non-native users know of the spiritual applications of <b>ayahuasca,</b> a less well-known traditional usage focuses on the medicinal properties of <b>ayahuasca.</b> When used for its medicinal purposes, <b>ayahuasca</b> affects the human consciousness for less than six hours, beginning half an hour after consumption and peaking after two hours. <b>Ayahuasca</b> also has cardiovascular effects, moderately increasing [...] heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. In some cases, individuals experience significant psychological stress during the experience. It {{is for this reason}} that extreme caution should be taken with those who may be at risk of heart disease.|$|E
2500|$|Author Don Jose Campos {{claims that}} people may {{experience}} profound positive life changes subsequent to consuming <b>ayahuasca.</b> [...] Vomiting can follow <b>ayahuasca</b> ingestion; this purging {{is considered by}} many shamans and experienced users of <b>ayahuasca</b> to be {{an essential part of the}} experience, as it represents the release of negative energy and emotions built up over the course of one's life. Others report purging in the form of nausea, diarrhea, and hot/cold flashes.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Alex Grey, {{who worked}} on the {{illustrations}} for the 10,000 Days and Lateralus covers, said that many of his artworks for Tool have been based off and influenced by the visionary journeys of a brew called <b>ayahuasca.</b> He described the 10,000 Days cover as [...] "a blazing vision of an infinite grid of Godheads during an <b>ayahuasca</b> journey", and also talked about the Lateralus cover in a similar fashion. Grey stated in another interview when making the 10,000 Days cover that it depicts visions received during a DMT trip (the main chemical ingredient in <b>ayahuasca).</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, the {{practice}} of <b>ayahuasca</b> drinking began spreading to Europe, North America and elsewhere. The first <b>ayahuasca</b> churches, affiliated with the Brazilian Santo Daime, were established in the Netherlands. A legal case was filed against two of the Church's leaders, Hans Bogers (one of the original founders of the Dutch Santo Daime community) and Geraldine Fijneman (the head of the Amsterdam Santo Daime community). Bogers and Fijneman were charged with distributing a controlled substance (DMT); however, the prosecution was unable {{to prove that the}} use of <b>ayahuasca</b> by members of the Santo Daime constituted a sufficient threat to public health and order such that it warranted denying their rights to religious freedom under ECHR Article 9. The 2001 verdict of the Amsterdam district court is an important precedent. Since then groups that are not affiliated to the Santo Daime have used <b>ayahuasca,</b> and a number of different [...] "styles" [...] have been developed, including non-religious approaches.|$|E

2500|$|Individual polymorphisms in the [...] {{cytochrome}} P450-2D6 enzyme {{affect the}} ability of individuals to metabolize harmine. Some natural tolerance to habitual use of <b>ayahuasca</b> (roughly once weekly) may develop through upregulation of the serotonergic system. A phase 1 pharmacokinetic study on <b>ayahuasca</b> (as Hoasca) with 15 volunteers was conducted in 1993, during the Hoasca Project. A review of the Hoasca Project has been published.|$|E
2500|$|In Brazil, {{a number}} of modern {{religious}} movements based {{on the use of}} <b>ayahuasca</b> have emerged, the most famous of them being Santo Daime and the União do Vegetal (or UDV), usually in an animistic context that may be shamanistic or, more often (as with Santo Daime and the UDV), integrated with Christianity. Both Santo Daime and União do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world. [...] Similarly, the US and Europe have started to see new religious groups develop in relation to increased <b>ayahuasca</b> use. [...] Some Westerners have teamed up with shamans in the Amazon rainforest regions, forming <b>ayahuasca</b> healing retreats that claim to be able to cure mental and physical illness and allow communication with the spirit world.|$|E

2500|$|DMT {{is broken}} down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase through a process called deamination, and is quickly inactivated orally unless {{combined}} with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). The traditional South American beverage <b>ayahuasca,</b> or yage, is derived by boiling the <b>ayahuasca</b> vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) with leaves {{of one or more}} plants containing DMT, such as Psychotria viridis, [...] Psychotria carthagenensis, [...] or Diplopterys cabrerana. The <b>Ayahuasca</b> vine contains harmala alkaloids, highly active reversible inihibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs),C-harmine as a tracer for monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A): In vitro and in vivo studies|journal=Nuclear Medicine and Biology|volume=24|issue=4|year=1997|pages=287–293|issn=0969-8051|doi=10.1016/S0969-8051(97)00013-9|pmid=9257326}} rendering the DMT orally active by protecting it from deamination. A variety of different recipes are used to make the brew depending on the purpose of the <b>ayahuasca</b> session, or local availability of ingredients. Two common sources of DMT in the western US are reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and Harding grass (Phalaris aquatica). These invasive grasses contain low levels of DMT and other alkaloids. In addition, Jurema (Mimosa tenuiflora) shows evidence of DMT content: the pink layer in the inner rootbark of this small tree contains a high concentration of N,N-DMT.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ayahuasca</b> is the hispanicized style {{spelling}} {{of a word}} in the Quechua languages, {{which are}} spoken in the Andean states of Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia. Speakers of Quechua languages or of the Aymara language may prefer the spelling ayawaska. This word refers both to the liana Banisteriopsis caapi, and to the brew prepared from it. In the Quechua languages, aya means [...] "spirit, soul", [...] "corpse, dead body", and waska means [...] "rope" [...] and [...] "woody vine", [...] "liana". The word <b>ayahuasca</b> has been variously translated as [...] "liana of the soul", [...] "liana of the dead", and [...] "spirit liana".|$|E
2500|$|The {{psychedelic}} {{effects of}} <b>ayahuasca</b> include visual and auditory stimulation, {{the mixing of}} sensory modalities, and psychological introspection {{that may lead to}} great elation, fear, or illumination. Its purgative properties are important (known as la purga or [...] "the purge"). The intense vomiting and occasional diarrhea it induces can clear the body of worms and other tropical parasites, and harmala alkaloids themselves {{have been shown to be}} anthelmintic. [...] Thus, this action is twofold; a direct action on the parasites by these harmala alkaloids (particularly harmine in <b>ayahuasca)</b> works to kill the parasites, and parasites are expelled through the increased intestinal motility that is caused by these alkaloids.|$|E
2500|$|Along this journey, Amos, who has openly {{discussed}} {{her experiences}} with psychedelic drugs, particularly {{in relation to}} Boys for Pele, did <b>ayahuasca</b> ceremonies with a South American shaman and experienced meeting the devil, leading her to write the track [...] "Father Lucifer." ...|$|E
