25|$|The use of <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in {{research}} and therapy is not as controversial {{as the use of}} embryonic stem cells, because the production of <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> does not require the destruction of an embryo. Additionally, in instances where <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are obtained from the intended recipient (an autograft), the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.|$|E
25|$|Leblond and {{his colleagues}} also found {{evidence}} {{for the presence of}} occasional <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> even in tissues which are composed almost entirely of non-dividing cells. In skeletal muscle, the muscle fibers had been shown to exhibit an age-related {{increase in the number of}} nuclei. His studies showed that muscle satellite cells could be considered to be <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in muscle fibers.|$|E

40|$|The {{epithelial}} {{lining of}} the intestine, stomach, and skin is continuously exposed to environmental assault, imposing a requirement for regular self-renewal. Resident <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> populations drive this renewal, and much effort has been invested in revealing their identity. Reliable <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> biomarkers would accelerate our understanding of <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> roles in tissue homeostasis and cancer. Membrane-expressed markers would also facilitate isolation of these <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> populations for exploitation of their regenerative potential. Here, we review recent advances in <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> biology, highlighting the promise and pitfalls of the candidate biomarkers of the various <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> populations. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have {{limitations}} {{with their}} potency; unlike ESCs, {{they are not}} able to differentiate into cells from all three germ layers. As such, they are deemed multipotent.|$|E
25|$|Extraembryonic fetal {{stem cells}} come from extraembryonic membranes, and are {{generally}} not distinguished from <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> These stem cells are acquired after birth, they are not immortal but have {{a high level of}} cell division, and are pluripotent.|$|E
25|$|Various {{pharmacological}} agents are {{applied for the}} production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or maintain the embryonic stem cell (ESC) phenotypic via epigenetic approach. <b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> like bone marrow stem cells have also shown a potential to differentiate into cardiac competent cells when treated with G9a histone methyltransferase inhibitor BIX01294.|$|E
2500|$|All of {{the various}} <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> {{research}} approaches are supported by Palin. In an interview with Charlie Gibson, Palin differentiated between {{the two types of}} <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research [...] "And thankfully, again, not only are there other options, but we're getting closer and closer to finding a tremendous amount of other options, like, as I mentioned, the <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research".|$|R

25|$|Hedgehog {{signaling}} remains {{important in}} the adult. Sonic hedgehog {{has been shown to}} promote the proliferation of <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from various tissues, including primitive hematopoietic cells, mammary and neural stem cells. Activation of the hedgehog pathway is required for transition of the hair follicle from the resting to the growth phase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can, however, be artificially {{reverted to}} a state where they behave like {{embryonic}} stem cells (including the associated DNA repair mechanisms). This was done with mice as early as 2006 with future prospects to slow down human aging substantially. Such cells {{are one of the}} various classes of induced stem cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> express {{transporters}} of the ATP-binding cassette {{family that}} actively pump {{a diversity of}} organic molecules out of the cell. Many pharmaceuticals are exported by these transporters conferring multidrug resistance onto the cell. This complicates the design of drugs, for instance neural stem cell targeted therapies {{for the treatment of}} clinical depression.|$|E

40|$|Imprinted {{genes are}} the prototypical epigenetically {{regulated}} genes. On {{the basis of}} findings in <b>adult</b> lung <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> Zacharek etÂ al. (2011) suggest {{in this issue of}} <b>Cell</b> <b>Stem</b> <b>Cell</b> that epigenetic silencing of imprinted genes is a common requirement for maintaining self-renewal in <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> populations...|$|R
25|$|<b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are {{not able}} to proliferate and {{differentiate}} as effectively in vitro as they are able to in vivo. <b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can come from many different tissue locations, {{but it is difficult to}} isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the ability to differentiate across embryonic germ line boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or cell fusion events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used. More studies need to be done in order to standardize the yield with transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation of multipotent stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.|$|E
25|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} express telomerase, which {{allows them to}} divide {{repeatedly}} and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed only in cells that need to divide regularly especially in male sperm cells but also in epidermal cells, in activated T cell and B cell lymphocytes, {{as well as in}} certain <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> but in the great majority of cases somatic cells do not express telomerase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are {{frequently}} used in various medical therapies (e.g., bone marrow transplantation). Stem cells {{can now be}} artificially grown and transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves. Embryonic cell lines and autologous embryonic stem cells generated through somatic cell nuclear transfer or dedifferentiation have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies. Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till at the University of Toronto in the 1960s.|$|E

50|$|This {{argument}} {{is used by}} opponents of embryonic destruction, as well as researchers specializing in <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research.|$|R
25|$|Another theory {{associates}} <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (ASC) with tumor formation. This is {{most often}} associated with tissues with {{a high rate of}} cell turnover (such as the skin or gut). In these tissues, ASCs are candidates because of their frequent cell divisions (compared to most ASCs) in conjunction with the long lifespan of ASCs. This combination creates the ideal set of circumstances for mutations to accumulate: mutation accumulation is the primary factor that drives cancer initiation. Evidence shows that the association represents an actual phenomenon, although specific cancers have been linked to a specific cause.|$|E
25|$|Coleman has campaigned as {{a pro-life}} {{candidate}} {{since at least}} 1993. Coleman attributes his position on abortion {{to the death of}} two of his four children in infancy from a rare genetic disease. He supports limiting stem cell research to <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, and, in July 2006, he voted against lifting restrictions on federal research dollars for new embryonic stem cell lines. Coleman {{is a member of the}} Republican Main Street Partnership a group which supports Embryonic Stem Cell Research. Coleman voted in favor of legislative intervention to prolong the life of severely brain-damaged Floridian Terri Schiavo.|$|E
25|$|Activation of the {{hedgehog}} pathway {{has been}} implicated {{in the development of}} cancers in various organs, including brain, lung, mammary gland, prostate and skin. Basal cell carcinoma, {{the most common form of}} cancerous malignancy, has the closest association with hedgehog signaling. Loss-of-function mutations in Patched and activating mutations in Smoothened have been identified in patients with this disease. Abnormal activation of the pathway probably leads to development of disease through transformation of <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> into cancer stem cells that give rise to the tumor. Cancer researchers hope that specific inhibitors of hedgehog signaling will provide an efficient therapy for a wide range of malignancies.|$|E

25|$|Olfactory <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been}} {{successfully}} harvested from the human olfactory mucosa cells, which {{are found in the}} lining of the nose and are involved in the sense of smell. If they are given the right chemical environment these cells have the same ability as embryonic stem cells to develop into many different cell types. Olfactory stem cells hold the potential for therapeutic applications and, in contrast to neural stem cells, can be harvested with ease without harm to the patient. This means they can be easily obtained from all individuals, including older patients who might be most in need of stem cell therapies.|$|E
25|$|Mammals {{have three}} Hedgehog homologues, Desert (DHH), Indian (IHH), and Sonic (SHH), of which Sonic {{is the best}} studied. The pathway is equally {{important}} during vertebrate embryonic development and is therefore of interest in evolutionary developmental biology. In knockout mice lacking components of the pathway, the brain, skeleton, musculature, gastrointestinal tract and lungs fail to develop correctly. Recent studies point {{to the role of}} Hedgehog signaling in regulating <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> involved in maintenance and regeneration of adult tissues. The pathway has also been implicated in the development of some cancers. Drugs that specifically target Hedgehog signaling to fight this disease are being actively developed by a number of pharmaceutical companies.|$|E
25|$|Balasubramanian is {{now working}} on stem cell biology and its use in {{restoring}} lost vision. He and his group {{have been successful in}} isolating the <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> found in the limbus, around the cornea, and culturing them on human amniotic membrane. These cultured stem cells were, later, used to produce corneal epithelia that can be stitched on to human eye. Clinical tests on 200 patients who lost eyesight due to chemical or fire burns returned significantly good results with vision restoration to 20/20 levels, with or without subsequent corneal grafts or transplantation. These tests are reported to be the largest successful human trial of adult stem cell therapy in the world.|$|E
