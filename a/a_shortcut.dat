5|$|The Mitsukue {{neighborhood}} prospered as a port town {{during the}} feudal period, {{as it was}} used as a port of rest for daimyōs on their way to and from the capital as part of the sankin-kōtai system. This traffic was likely the source of the demand for Nobutaka's abortive attempt to create <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> through the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. Highway system {{laid out}} in 1925 and {{finalized}} in late 1926, U.S. Route 410 connected Aberdeen with Clarkston, following the Olympic Highway (State Road 9) to Olympia, the Pacific Highway (State Road 1)—concurrent with US 99—to Tacoma, the National Park Highway System (State Road 5) to Yakima, and the Inland Empire Highway (State Road 3) to Clarkston. This differed from present US 12 between Elma and Naches in that it followed the route through Olympia and Tacoma rather than along the Cowlitz River. However, despite {{being part of the}} state highway system since 1897, US 410's crossing of the Cascades, the first between the Columbia River Gorge and Snoqualmie Pass, was not opened to traffic until 1931. <b>A</b> <b>shortcut</b> from near Packwood east across White Pass to Naches, very close to the original plan for the east half of State Road 5, was added to the state highway system in 1931 as another branch of the highway. The roadway between Packwood and Cayuse Pass, added to the state highway system on a different alignment in 1905, was finally completed in 1940, and the White Pass Highway was dedicated on August 12, 1951, opening <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> between southwest Washington and Yakima.|$|E

5|$|On June 28, 2008, a 17-year-old South Carolina {{teenager}} was decapitated {{after being}} struck by the Batman roller coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia. The teen, who was {{on a trip to}} the park with his church's youth group, scaled two fences with a friend into a restricted area and walked into the ride's path.

5|$|The M4 {{motorway}} {{connects the}} city on an east-west axis from London to West Wales, and the M5 is a north–south west axis from Birmingham to Exeter. The M49 motorway is <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> between the M5 {{in the south and}} the M4 Severn Crossing in the west, and the M32 is a spur from the M4 to the city centre. The Portway connects the M5 to the city centre, and was the most expensive road in Britain when opened in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E

5|$|Encompassing , the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building stood {{three stories}} tall. The second and first floors (the latter of which lies {{partially}} below ground) contained laboratory space while {{the third floor}} consisted of communal and teaching spaces like classrooms and offices. Other offices {{on the first floor}} were lit via skylights. The stairwells in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get {{from one side of the}} building to the other. In spite of this, Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 that students had taken to passing through the building as <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> instead of going around it. Furnishings and carpeting in the building were deep blue and rust-colored.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} version of M-179 {{was established in}} 1935 as <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> near Le Roy between US131 and what was M-63. That route was turned back to local control in late 1958 or 1959, and the designation disappeared from the system. (The original M-63 itself was decommissioned {{a few years later}} in 1961.) On October 1, 1998, as part of the Rationalization process, a jurisdictional transfer turned county road A-42 between US131 and M-43 over to the state, which the state later designated as M-179 for the following year.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} Native American groups {{inhabited}} {{the area from}} as early as 7000BC, most recently the Timbisha around 1000AD who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains. A group of European-Americans that became stuck in the valley in 1849 while looking for <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> to the gold fields of California gave the valley its name, even though only one of their group died there. Several short-lived boom towns sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver. The only long-term profitable ore to be mined was borax, which was transported out of the valley with twenty-mule teams. The valley later {{became the subject of}} books, radio programs, television series, and movies. Tourism blossomed in the 1920s, when resorts were built around Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek. Death Valley National Monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Driving past Silent Hill as <b>a</b> <b>shortcut,</b> Travis swerves {{his truck}} to avoid hitting a spirit manifestation of Alessa. While {{following}} the spirit manifestation, he stumbles upon a burning house and rescues the real Alessa, who was immolated in a ritual to impregnate {{her with the}} cult's god. Losing consciousness outside the house, he awakens in the town and resolves to learn if she survived. During his journey, Travis unlocks his repressed childhood memories and defeats monstrous forms of his parents: {{his mother had been}} committed to a local mental institution after attempting to kill him, and his father had killed himself, unable to live with the guilt of having his wife condemned. Additionally, Travis kills the Butcher, a monster that has been slaughtering other monsters.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, a limited-access {{toll road}} called the Garden State Thruway was planned along the US 9 {{alignment}} between Toms River and Woodbridge. This freeway {{was intended to}} serve all vehicles and provide <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> to the Garden State Parkway and US 9 through central New Jersey but was never built. In the early 1970s, another plan surfaced for a US 9 freeway from Route 34 in Madison Township (now Old Bridge Township) north to Route 35 in Sayreville. The freeway, which was to cost $17 million, was not built due to financial problems. A freeway was also proposed for US 9 in Atlantic County in the late 1960s, running from the proposed Route 60 freeway in Somers Point to CR 575 in Smithville. This freeway, which was to cost $35 million and intended to alleviate traffic on the current US 9 and the Garden State Parkway, was also never built due to financial and environmental issues.|$|E
5|$|The path of SR 190 {{east of the}} Panamint Range in Death Valley National Park was {{followed}} in late 1849 and early 1850 by the Death Valley '49ers, a group of '49ers that had left the Old Spanish Trail at Enterprise, Utah to look for <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> to Walker Pass. The pioneers crossed the state line from Nevada near Ash Meadows, following the general route of present SR 190 from Death Valley Junction into Death Valley, which they left to the west into Panamint Valley and then turned south towards present State Route 178. After ore was discovered in Death Valley, the route became a primitive road, though most travel into the valley, such as the twenty-mule team borax route, was from the south.|$|E

5|$|A 1923 {{restructuring}} of the system re-assigned numbers to almost all the primary state highways. State Road 5 became a primary route and was greatly expanded, taking over the entire McClellan Pass Highway and the National Park Highway east of the Pacific Highway. The former secondary State Road 5 was realigned starting from near Packwood, heading north instead of east, alongside the Ohanapecosh River to the old McClellan Pass Highway at Cayuse Pass, west of {{the summit of the}} Cascades. The new State Road 5, named the National Park Highway System, now included four roads in the vicinity of Mount Rainier National Park, but as the road across the Cascades at Chinook Pass was not yet built, these roads did not connect with each other. Also included in this numbering was the designation of the Inland Empire Highway, including Yakima to Clarkston, as State Road 3. In 1925, a spur was added to State Road 9—the Olympic Highway, looping around the Olympic Peninsula—connecting Elma to the Pacific Highway at Grand Mound, and creating <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> between the Cowlitz River route and Aberdeen. The Olympic Highway from Elma west to Aberdeen had been added to the state highway system in 1905 west of and 1913 east of Montesano.|$|E
5|$|US219 enters Maryland in the {{southwest}} corner of Garrett County just to the west of Backbone Mountain. The U.S. Highway heads northeast from the West Virginia state line as two-lane Garrett Highway. After crossing the Youghiogheny River, US 219 meets US50 (George Washington Highway) at an intersection with a two-way stop in the hamlet of Red House. The highway turns northwest to intersect Ben Dewitt Road, <b>a</b> <b>shortcut</b> between US219 and US50 at the state line to the west, then resumes its northeasterly course heading toward Gortner, where the highway crosses Cherry Creek and Ambrose Run. US219 veers north and crosses the Little Youghiogheny River and CSX's Mountain Subdivision before entering the town of Oakland and meeting the west end of MD135 (Maryland Highway). The U.S. Highway turns west onto Oak Street while Ninth Street (unsigned MD 219) continues north. US219 heads west through the Oakland Historic District. At the intersection with MD39 (Oak Street) next to the Garrett County Courthouse, the highway turns north onto Third Street. US219 parallels Cherry Glade Run north out of town.|$|E
