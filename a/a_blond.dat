5|$|The {{likeness}} of the Captain Scarlet character has, {{since his first}} appearance, been attributed to Francis Matthews, who voiced Scarlet in the series, Cary Grant and Roger Moore. Ed Bishop later claimed that Captain Blue had been modelled on his likeness, but sculptor Terry Curtis states that he made the puppet to resemble himself and simply added <b>a</b> <b>blond</b> wig when he learnt that Bishop was to voice Blue. Curtis, a James Bond fan, based the appearance of Captain Grey on Sean Connery and Destiny Angel on Ursula Andress, Connery's co-star in the 1962 Bond film Dr No. Meanwhile, the character of Lieutenant Green was sculpted on its voice actor, Cy Grant; Rhapsody Angel on model and actress Jean Shrimpton; Melody Angel on singer and actress Eartha Kitt; and Harmony Angel on actress Tsai Chin.|$|E

At the restaurant, the owner tells them <b>a</b> <b>blond</b> man with a scar named Nick Lane (David Call) was sitting in the same place as Olivia was in her dream, and was also seen in the video surveillance from the first crime scene. Walter posits that because she never sees him in her dreams, it was Lane, not Olivia, causing the people's deaths. Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude's Mental Hospital, who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident, but left after the visit of a mysterious man. The doctor described him as hyperemotive, meaning those near him adopt his emotions.

25|$|Duchamp {{participated in}} the design of the 1938 International Surrealist Exhibition, which was held at the Galerie des Beaux-arts, Paris. The show {{featured}} more than 60 artists from different countries, including approximately 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs, and installations. The surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act, and André Breton named Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray, Salvador Dali, and Max Ernst to help him. At the exhibition's entrance he placed Salvador Dalí's Rainy Taxi, a work consisting of a taxicab rigged to produce a drizzle of water down the inside of its windows, with a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat, and <b>a</b> <b>blond</b> mannequin covered with live snails in the back. In this way Duchamp confronted guests entering the exhibition, who were in full evening dress.|$|E
25|$|Two covers {{were created}} for The Fame Monster, {{both of which}} were shot by French {{photographer}} Hedi Slimane.

The image of the deluxe version sees the singer draped in thick brown hair, her face embellished with heavy, streamy black eyeliner. At first Gaga had a dispute with her record label over the artwork; Interscope found the brunette cover to be too dark and gothic for a mainstream release. However, Gaga explained to them that both would be suitable with the yin and yang concept of the album and ultimately they agreed. The font used on the cover is the sans-serif letterform used by Christian Dior in their campaigns.|$|E
