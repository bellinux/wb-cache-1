50|$|The eye's lens is {{normally}} tinted yellow. This reduces {{the intensity of}} blue light reaching the retina. When the lens is removed because of cataract, it is usually replaced by an artificial intraocular lens; these <b>artificial</b> <b>lenses</b> are clear, allowing more intense blue light than usual to fall on the retina, leading to the phenomenon.|$|R

50|$|Sommering ring is {{the ring}} shaped growth of lens cells after {{surgical}} removal of cataractous lens in childhood. This {{is seen as}} peripheral ring after pupil dilatation. Patients who undergo <b>artificial</b> <b>lens</b> implantation in an eye that had cataract surgery in childhood, will need this technique to remove the ring remnant. Here the IOL is placed in glued IOL scaffold method and the Sommering ring is dislodged on the IOL and is removed (Fig 3).|$|E
5000|$|The lens bag {{in which}} the new <b>artificial</b> <b>lens</b> is kept may be damaged due to trauma, from birth or by surgery. During {{cataract}} surgery, when half {{or more of the}} lens is remaining and the operating surgeon notices capsule damage; the IOL scaffold technique 6 can be used to rescue the lens and prevent further complications. In this technique, the selected <b>artificial</b> <b>lens</b> or IOL is placed in the sulcus ( [...] remaining part of the lens bag) and phacoemulsification surgery using ultrasound is performed over it (Fig 1). Once the entire lens is removed {{on the surface of the}} IOL, the IOL is well positioned on the capsule remnant (sulcus). As soon as the surgeon notices the capsular tear or sinking nucleus, anterior chamber infusion can be used to stabilize the chamber. Anterior vitrectomy is performed to remove the vitreous in the pupil and anterior part of eye. Then the IOL which is already planned for placing in the lens bag is inserted under the nucleus on the remaining capsule bag. The nucleus is positioned on the IOL and the remaining surgery is completed.|$|E

50|$|Tadini was an Italian {{itinerant}} ophthalmologist {{who lived}} {{in the second half of}} the 18th century. Advertisements in old newspapers testify to the fact that he performed eye operations in many towns in Europe, including Lübeck and Ghent. Tadini had a box containing <b>artificial</b> <b>lenses</b> made of glass, which he showed to Giacomo Casanova. It is therefore probable that Tadini first conceived the idea of intraocular correction of aphakia. Presumably Casanova conveyed the idea to Casaamata, an ophthalmic surgeon in Dresden. At any rate, Casaamata was the first to actually attempt the correction of aphakia by implanting a lens.|$|R
50|$|The {{children}} {{treated with}} the experimental technique experienced fewer complications than twenty-five children treated by conventional surgery. Children are the most promising subjects because their stem cells are more vigorous than in adults. Also, conventional treatment of childhood cataracts using an <b>artificial</b> <b>lens</b> can cause complications in children because they are still growing. The technique {{has yet to be}} tried with older patients with age-related cataracts, but is expected to be less successful. Adult cataracts are more difficult to remove and adult lens stem cells regenerate more slowly.|$|E
50|$|For both {{of these}} reasons (implying realism and/or drama) <b>artificial</b> <b>lens</b> flare is a common effect in various {{graphics}} editing programs, although its use can be a point of contention among professional graphic designers. Lens flare {{was one of the}} first special effects developed for computer graphics because it can be imitated using relatively simple means. Basic flare-like effects, for instance in computer and video games, can be obtained using static or animated starburst, ring, and disc textures that are moved according to the position of the light source. More sophisticated rendering techniques have been developed based on ray tracing or photon mapping.|$|E
50|$|IOL Scaffold or Intraocular lens Scaffold {{technique}} is a surgical procedure in Ophthalmology. In {{cases where the}} lens bag is ruptured and the cataract of the eye is not yet removed one can inject an <b>artificial</b> <b>lens</b> or Intraocular lens (IOL) inside the eye under the cataract. This way the IOL acts as a scaffold and prevents the cataract pieces from falling inside the eye. One can then remove the cataract pieces safely by emulsifying it with ultrasound. This {{technique is}} called IOL Scaffold and was started by Dr. Amar Agarwal from Chennai, India at Dr. Agarwal's Eye Hospital.|$|E

50|$|Crystalens are {{implants}} which improve eyesight {{by replacing}} the natural human lens {{for people who}} have cataracts and age-related vision loss called presbyopia. The device acts like the normal human lens to improve both near and far vision. Crystalens is an <b>artificial</b> <b>lens</b> that is implanted in the eye. Its unique technology allows it to have hinges that move back and forth, so the eyes can adjust to clearly focus on objects near or far away. In this way, it can restore some of the eye's natural vision function. The refractive lensectomy procedure that is used to implant the lenses is simple and allows for fast healing. Most patients are ready to resume their normal activities shortly after the procedure.|$|E
