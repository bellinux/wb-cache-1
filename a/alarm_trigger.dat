Gretchen recognizes {{the type of}} land mine and orders Sucre to change the {{distribution}} of his weight on the trigger, {{so that she can}} disarm the firing pin. Lincoln and Sucre are distrustful of her, but she points out that she is risking her own life as well. After meeting up back at the warehouse, Michael and Mahone decode the blueprint, only to realize that Sucre isn't just stepping on a land mine, but also on an <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger.</b> Mahone rushes to GATE to stop them from dismantling the bomb, which will set off the alarm. He manually overrides the system and tells Sucre to step off the trigger, who eventually does so with great reluctance.|$|E
40|$|Microseismic {{monitoring}} and evaluation is {{one aspect of the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) research program. Roof falls are often preceded by a period of elevated microseismic activity, but not all periods of elevated activity result in a roof fall, nor do all roof falls occur after some amount of elevated activity. The objective {{of this study is to}} review periods of elevated microseismic activity and determine whether fracture activity rate can be used to anticipate the initiation of roof falls. The study was carried out at an underground limestone mine where major roof falls are associated with excessive horizontal stress. The progression of roof falls was detected by the microseismic signature produced by the rock falling from the mine roof onto the mine floor, which is termed a roof fall impact event. A total of nine elevated fracture activity periods that resulted in seven major roof falls were examined. It was observed that elevated fracture activity preceded the initial roof fall impact event in three out of four major roof falls. The initial impact event was not identified for the remaining three roof falls. Fracture event rates were analyzed and a roof fall <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger</b> of five fracture events in a ten minute time period was established for this test case. The fall <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger</b> was tested against six of the elevated activity periods. Four roof falls occurred in the six periods of elevated activity, and two would have triggered the alarm before the roof fall occurred, while two false alarms were generated. The results show that limited success would have been achieved by the microseismic system as a roof fall <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger.</b> However, the trigger would have been successful at warning of the onset of elevated activity, allowing mine employees to respond appropriately. The study highlighted some issues with implementing such a system in an operating mine, including the need for real time identification of fracture related microseismic signals among mining induced signals, and accurate location and identification of fracture clustering...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} an Electric Fence Monitoring System (EFMS) which detects and announciates fence malfunctions indicating operational ineffectiveness. The EFMS consists of a master unit and up to sixteen slave units. Each slave unit monitors a single remote point on the fence. Slave units gain their power from the electric fence pulse itself. They use a unique transmission algorithm to transmit the peak electric fence voltage, to the master unit. The electric fence wire is used to convey this transmission. The master unit uses a non-linear switched capacitor filter with variable gain control, to detect the slave unit transmissions. This unit displays the peak voltage at each monitored point and allows the setting of <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger</b> points. This thesis includes modelling of the electric fence energiser and typical electric fence line, and the detailed design of the two units that makeup the EFMS...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a practical method to detect any accidental partial shadowing on an operating photovoltaic (PV) panel in a smart generation system including a control center. Given a known solar irradiance level and temperature {{it is possible}} to make an automatic estimation of the output electrical power and to trigger an alarm in case of an accidental shadowing occurrence. Preliminary field measurements data are taken to evaluate the PV panel parameters once and for all. Simulation of the panel in operation is performed with the mathematical method of Design of Experiments (DoE) : the maximum power parameter is considered as critical for the protection and security of the PV panel. Its value is computed and any amount of partial shadowing is then detected from the difference between the measured and the calculated values of this parameter. This method can be easily implemented in any smart PV generation system as an <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger</b> in actual operation to insure complete safety of the generation system...|$|E

40|$|Varying speed {{conditions}} bring a huge {{challenge to}} incipient fault detection of rolling element bearings because both {{the change of}} speed and faults {{could lead to the}} amplitude fluctuation of vibration signals. Effective detection methods need to be developed to eliminate the influence of speed variation. This paper proposes an incipient fault detection method for bearings under varying speed conditions. Firstly, relative residual (RR) features are extracted, which are insensitive to the varying speed conditions and are able to reflect the degradation trend of bearings. Then, a health indicator named selected negative log-likelihood probability (SNLLP) is constructed to fuse a feature set including RR features and non-dimensional features. Finally, based on the constructed SNLLP health indicator, a novel <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger</b> mechanism is designed to detect the incipient fault. The proposed method is demonstrated using vibration signals from bearing tests and industrial wind turbines. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for incipient fault detection of rolling element bearings under varying speed conditions...|$|E
40|$|AStrion is an {{automatic}} spectrum analyser software, which proposes a new generic and data-driven method without any a priori {{information on the}} measured signals. In order to compute some general characteristics and derive {{the properties of the}} signal, the first step in this approach is to give some insight into the nature of the signal. This pre-analysis, the so-called data validation, contains a number of tests to reveal some of the properties and characteristics of the data, such as the acquisition validity (the absence of saturation and a posteriori in respect of the sampling theorem), the stationarity (or non-stationarity), the periodicity and the signal-to-noise ratio. Based on these characteristics, the proposed method defines indicators and <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger</b> thresholds and also categorises the signal into three classes, which helps to guide the following spectral analysis. The present paper introduces the four tests of this pre-analysis and the signal categorisation rules. Finally, the proposed approach is validated on a set of wind turbine vibration measurements to demonstrate its applicability for a long-term and continuous monitoring of real-world signals...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of airborne pathogens {{is becoming a}} subject of great concern in modern day society. Recent {{studies have shown that}} electrostatic samplers are suitable for collecting microorganisms as well as preserving their viability. In most of these studies, flow rates were lower than 12. 5 L/min or required a concentration stage to increase the flow rate to 100 L/min. In the present study, a single stage electrostatic sampler was developed for an efficient collection of microorganisms at 100 L/min. The design is based on the positive DC corona between coaxial cylinders to continuously create charged particles as they pass through the sampler. The physical collection efficiency of the device was investigated by sampling the ambient air particles. The efficiency in collecting live biological samples was determined by sampling live bacterial spores with the collector situated inside an aerosol chamber. It is shown that particles of 0. 3 – 0. 35 μm are captured with an efficiency of about 86 %, whereas cultivable spores of Bacillus thuringiensis are collected with an efficiency of about 94 %. Results are compared with an analytical predictive model. The experimental results are similar to the efficiencies previously reported in the literature; however, the current sampler design features a higher flow rate which enables the device to be used as an <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger</b> in a shorter period of time...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{autonomous}} vehicles in air, {{land and water}} has grown in recent years, with increased attention given to heavily transited areas. For the case {{of autonomous}} underwater vehicles, these regions of interest include harbors and river basins where the risk of collision rapidly increases {{with the number of}} ships. This thesis presents a collision avoidance system based on passive acoustic sensing, which may be used to alert an AUV's autonomy software of the threat that an approaching vessel may represent in such shallow water environments. Experiments were conducted to collect and process data from static and vehicle-mounted hydrophone arrays, and preliminary measurements were post-processed using various signal smoothing and data-fitting techniques. Results were then compared with a mathematical model used to describe the expected sound propagation profile, to identify how the system was limited by disturbances in the test conditions, such as variable ship speed and bearing, with respect to the vehicle's frame of reference. The benefits and limitations of each data processing approach were identified, and are herein discussed through three separate case studies to highlight the benefit of parallel-model fitting. A Bluefin SandShark AUV was used for a series of deployments performed to test the vehicle's ability to change behaviors in response to approaching vessels that present a chance of collision, relying exclusively on this passive sensing system as the <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger.</b> During the final autonomous behavior-response experiments spanning six distinct deployments, a total of 21 successful alarm triggers were recorded in the vehicle logs, along with a cumulative 142 minutes of acoustic data. by Oscar Alberto Viquez Rojas.

The project will affect the research activity associated with computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. It will transform the teaching strategy and redesign the course through the application of Matlab toolbox for the video image processing. With the image processing technology used and Matlab toolbox, more experiments and projects will be introduced to complement theoretical knowledge gained in the classes, with the goal of enhancing learning and increasing student enthusiasm and retention. Students will gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} material through hands-on experiences that emulate real life fire detection situations. The project will include the development of a research environment for both faculty and students based on video image processing on the fire detection using Matlab toolbox, resulting in more research achievements and applications on Matlab language learning and video image processing technology. This paper describes the methodology to detect fire using image processing technology. All the experiments were implemented using Matlab image processing toolbox. In this paper, authors proposed an enhanced video image processing applied to the fire detection. The enhanced system is based on previous work done by the authors and which has been described in paper [5]. The previous work has been proven to be insufficient as many false alarms are generated in various cases. In this paper, additional features are added to it in order to eliminate the false alarms in several cases. The additional features are: sudden change detector, foreground mean colour computation and foreground colour element ratio computation in order to eliminate the false alarms in several cases. Two additional features: foreground bounding box and three-level <b>alarm</b> <b>trigger</b> aim to improve the efficiency and sensitivity of the system. Several experiments were conducted to verify the performance of the enhanced system. At the end of the paper, conclusions and possible further improvements are discussed...|$|E
