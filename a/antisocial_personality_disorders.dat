Writing of the feminist theory which regards {{reinforcement}} of patriarchy as the sole cause of IPV, and the problems to which such a narrowly focused theory can lead, Murray A. Straus writes [...] "Patriarchy and male dominance in the family are clearly among the causes IPV, {{but there are many}} others. However, with rare exceptions, current offender treatment programs are {{based on the assumption that}} the primary cause is male dominance. Thus, they proceed under an erroneous assumption. Illustrative of this fallacious single-cause approach are the state-mandated offender treatment programs that forbid treating other causes, such as inadequate anger management skills." [...] In 1992, a random sample of 1,257 Canadians found that 39% of female participants reported committing minor IPV and 16.2% reported committing severe IPV. Their main reasons were confidence that their male partner would not hit back, psychological disturbance and alcohol abuse. In 2006, Rose A. Medeiros and Murray A. Straus conducted a study using a sample of 854 students (312 men and 542 women) from two American universities. They identified fourteen specific risk factors common amongst both males and females who had committed IPV; poor anger management, <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders,</b> borderline personality disorders, tendency to dominate relationships, substance abuse, criminal history, posttraumatic stress disorders, depression, communication problems, jealousy, sexual abuse as a child, stress, and a general attitudinal approval of partner violence. In 2014, a study involving 1,104 male and female students in their late teens and early twenties found that women are more likely than men to be controlling and aggressive towards their partners, more likely to demonstrate a desire to control their partners, and more likely to use physical aggression in ensuring that control.

40|$|Psychoanalysis {{and related}} psychodynamic psychotherapies have {{historically}} had a limited engagement with {{substance use and}} <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> This in part reflects an early preoccupation with ‘transference neuroses’ and in part reflects later de-emphasis of diagnosis and focus on therapeutic process. Nonetheless, psychoanalytic perspectives can usefully inform thinking about approaches to treatment of such disorders and there are psychoanalytic constructs that have specific relevance to their treatment. This paper reviews some prominent strands of psychoanalytic thinking as they pertain {{to the treatment of}} substance abuse and <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> It is argued that, while Freudian formulations lead to a primarily pessimistic view of the prospect of treatment of such disorders, both the British object relations and the North American self psychology traditions suggest potentially productive approaches. Finally the limited empirical evidence from brief psychodynamically informed treatments of substance use disorders is reviewed. It is concluded that such treatments are not demonstrably effective but that, since no form of psychotherapy has established high efficacy with substance use disorders, brief psychdynamic therapies are not necessarily of lesser value than other treatments and may have specific value for particular individuals and in particular treatment contexts...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} neurocognitive {{models of}} aggression and relates them to explanations of the <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> Two forms of aggression are distinguished: reactive aggression elicited in response to frustration/threat and goal directed, instrumental aggression. It is argued that different forms of neurocognitive model are necessary to explain the emergence of these different forms of aggression. Impairments in executive emotional systems (the somatic marker system or the social response reversal system) are related to reactive aggression shown by patients with "acquired sociopathy" due to orbitofrontal cortex lesions. Impairment in the capacity to form associations between emotional unconditioned stimuli, particularly distress cues, and conditioned stimuli (the violence inhibition mechanism model) {{is related to the}} instrumental aggression shown by persons with developmental psychopathy. ...|$|E
40|$|Background Men with <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> show lifelong {{abnormalities}} in adaptive {{decision making}} {{guided by the}} weighing up of reward and punishment information. Among men with <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> modifi cation of the behaviour of those with additional diagnoses of psychopathy seems particularly resistant to punishment. Methods We did a case-control functional MRI (fMRI) study in 50 men, of whom 12 were violent off enders with <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> and psychopathy, 20 were violent off enders with <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> but not psychopathy, and 18 were healthy non-off enders. We used fMRI to measure brain activation associated with the representation of punishment or reward information during an event-related probabilistic response-reversal task, assessed with standard general linear-model-based analysis. Findings Offenders with <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> and psychopathy displayed discrete regions of increased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula in response to punished errors during the task reversal phase, and decreased activation to all correct rewarded responses in the superior temporal cortex. This finding was in contrast to results for off enders without psychopathy and healthy non-off enders. Interpretation Punishment prediction error signalling in off enders with <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> and psychopathy was highly atypical. This finding challenges the widely held view that such men are simply characterised by diminished neural sensitivity to punishment. Instead, this fi nding indicates altered organisation of the information processing system responsible for reinforcement learning and appropriate decision making. This difference between violent offenders with <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> with and without psychopathy has implications for the causes of these disorders and for treatment approaches...|$|R

40|$|Psychopathy has {{traditionally}} been characterised as a <b>disorder</b> primarily of <b>personality</b> (particularly affective deficits) and, to a lesser extent, behaviour. Although often used interchangeably, the diagnostic constructs of psychopathy, <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> and dissocial <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> are distinct. In this article, the relevant historical and contemporary literature concerning psychopathy is briefly reviewed. The diagnostic criteria for psychopathy, <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> and dissocial <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> are compared. Consideration {{is given to the}} assessment, prevalence, and implications of psychopathy for violence risk and treatment efficacy. The DSM-IV-TR criteria for <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> in particular, are largely behaviourally based. The ICD criteria for dissocial <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> while paying more attention to affective deficits, also do not represent the broad personality and behavioural components of psychopathy. Since 1980, a great deal of research on these disorders has been conducted, using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, Revised (PCL-R). The PCL-R assesses both personality (interpersonal and affective) and behavioural (lifestyle and antisocial) deficits. As such, the research and clinical implications of psychopathy, as operationalised by the PCL-R, cannot be readily extrapolated to the diagnoses of <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> and dissocial <b>personality</b> <b>disorder.</b> As currently construed, the diagnosis of <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> grossly over-identifies people, particularly those with offence histories, as meeting the criteria for the diagnosis. For example, research shows that between 50 % and 80 of prisoners meet the criteria for a diagnosis of <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> yet only approximately 15 % of prisoners would be expected to be psychopathic, as assessed by the PCL-R. As such, the characteristics and research findings drawn from the psychopathy research may not be relevant for those with <b>antisocial</b> or dissocial <b>personality</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|R

Evaluation measures included qEEG analysis with Nx Link data base, MMPI, T. 0. V. A tests and SA- 45 questionaries at baseline, {{and at the end of}} neurofeedback treatment.
