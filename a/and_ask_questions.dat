25|$|The final {{nomination}} show on Day 93 (23 July 2007) was {{a special}} where the housemates {{did not need to}} nominate and instead Killeen went into the Rewards Room to interview the housemates individually <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> supplied by the viewers.

25|$|One {{important}} aspect of shyness is social skills development. Schools and parents may implicitly assume children are fully capable of effective social interaction. Social skills training is not given any priority (unlike reading and writing) and as a result, shy students are not {{given an opportunity to}} develop their ability to participate in class and interact with peers. Teachers can model social skills <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> in a less direct and intimidating manner in order to gently encourage shy students to speak up in class, and make friends with other children.|$|E
25|$|Master Sergeant Rico Velasquez is {{a veteran}} of the ISA. He is a human tank who prefers to shoot first <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> later, if at all. He is all attitude, but despite this, he has a good heart. Rico prefers an up-front fight and is a {{character}} of extremes; he gets agitated easily and does not refrain from taking action. During the orbital defense platform crisis, Rico was left stranded by a brutal Helghast attack and consequently befriended Templar, Luger, and Hakha. Later, he became embedded with Alpha Team to spearhead the invasion on Helghan’s capital, Pyrrhus.|$|E
25|$|Wikis {{have found}} some use within the legal profession, and within government. Examples include the Central Intelligence Agency's Intellipedia, {{designed}} to share and collect intelligence, dKospedia, which {{was used by the}} American Civil Liberties Union to assist with review of documents pertaining to internment of detainees in Guantánamo Bay; and the wiki of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, used to post court rules and allow practitioners to comment <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions.</b> The United States Patent and Trademark Office operates Peer-to-Patent, a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding prior art relevant to examination of pending patent applications. Queens, New York has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park. Cornell Law School founded a wiki-based legal dictionary called Wex, whose growth has been hampered by restrictions on who can edit.|$|E

500|$|Azazel later {{uses his}} pact with Mary to enter {{their home in}} the pilot episode, and {{ultimately}} kills her. The second season episode [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One" [...] reveals that she had witnessed the demon secretly feeding his blood to Sam. John investigated the incident and learned {{of the existence of}} the supernatural. His desire to find and kill Azazel led him to become a hunter of supernatural creatures. He took his sons with him during his travels, but often left them alone in motels {{for long periods of time}} during his hunts, leaving Dean with instructions to [...] "shoot first <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> later" [...] while watching over Sam.|$|E
500|$|John Beresford of TV Scoop {{thought the}} episode {{lived up to}} many of his expectations, with sharp {{dialogue}} and some humour, a well-plotted story, and a good pace overall with a [...] "heap of action", despite the episode's slow start. Beresford also praised the reintroduction of UNIT from the [...] "old, tired UNIT" [...] to a [...] "newly revamped and spiffy UNIT with lots of cool gadgets", the Doctor's meeting with Rattigan, calling the scene [...] "an inspired piece of writing", and the episode's cliffhanger, calling it [...] "the best yet". He also believed the ATMOS idea worked well. The only weak spot Beresford noted was that the Sontarans {{appeared to have been}} softened from their previous appearance, stating that Staal would [...] "shoot first <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> later." ...|$|E
500|$|Production advisor Miriam Geiger quickly {{compiled}} a handmade film textbook for Welles, a practical reference book of film techniques that he studied carefully. He then taught himself filmmaking by matching its visual vocabulary to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which he ordered from the Museum of Modern Art, and films by Frank Capra, René Clair, Fritz Lang, King Vidor and Jean Renoir. The one film he genuinely studied was John Ford's Stagecoach, which he watched 40 times. [...] "As it turned out, {{the first day}} I ever walked onto a set was my first day as a director," [...] Welles said. [...] "I'd learned whatever I knew in the projection room—from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I'd run Stagecoach, often with some different technician or department head from the studio, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions.</b> 'How was this done?' 'Why was this done?' It was like going to school." ...|$|E

500|$|The United States Supreme Court first {{clarified}} {{the applicability}} of the Fourth Amendment to searches and seizures on buses in the 1991 case Florida v. Bostick, where the Court held that police officers may approach bus passengers on a random basis <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> and request their consent to searches, [...] "provided a reasonable person would understand {{that he or she is}} free to refuse". The Court rejected the argument that police questioning on board a bus constitutes a per se seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and instead held that courts should use a [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] test to determine whether a passenger would have felt [...] "free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter", or whether a passenger was free [...] "to ignore the police presence and go about his business". Additionally, the Court ruled that even if law enforcement officers have no basis for suspecting individuals are engaged in criminal activity, officers may still approach passengers, ask them questions, request identification, and request consent to search luggage, so long as officers do not coerce passengers to cooperate with their efforts.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the same}} day, the IAEA's Mohamed ElBaradei criticized the raid, {{saying that to}} bomb first <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> later [...] "undermines the system and it doesn't lead to any {{solution}} to any suspicion." [...] The IAEA had been observing the disabling of the DPRK Yongbyon nuclear facilities since July 2007, and {{was responsible for the}} containment and surveillance of the fuel rods and other nuclear materials from there.|$|E
2500|$|After Priestley {{moved to}} Birmingham in 1780, he {{encouraged}} the town's children {{to play with}} his apparatus <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> about his laboratory: the Priestley home became a place of scientific education for the town's children. Priestley's rain gauge and [...] "perambulator" [...] (a wheelbarrow for recording distances) delighted them. The boys often played with his air-gun, aiming at a wig of Priestley's which he had fastened to a post. Priestley designed magic lantern shows for them and shocked them with his electrical machine.|$|E

2500|$|To replace Jenna, Nation created Dayna Mellanby, {{a skilled}} combat expert partly {{based on the}} {{character}} of Miranda from Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Nation [...] "...thought {{it would be interesting to}} have a girl who was aggressive, to have somebody who would kill first <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> later, and it was nice to give what are generally masculine attitudes to a woman". Josette Simon was chosen to play Dayna; Simon had recently graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and did not have an Equity card.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, while {{holed up}} in the United States Embassy in Beijing, Chinese {{dissident}} Chen Guangcheng telephoned Smith to seek his advice. Smith suggested that Chen seek to depart China and continue to push for human rights in China from outside the country. [...] After leaving the embassy, and while being treated at a Beijing hospital, he telephoned Smith during a session of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. Smith spoke with Chen and allowed Chen to make statements <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> to those present in the Committee room.|$|E
2500|$|Allegedly, {{he passed}} laws {{allowing}} landowners to execute workers as a [...] "disciplinary" [...] measure. He also openly {{identified as a}} fascist; he admired Mussolini, Franco, and Hitler, saying at one point: [...] "I am like Hitler. I execute first <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> later." [...] Ubico was disdainful of the indigenous population, calling them [...] "animal-like", and stated that to become [...] "civilized" [...] they needed mandatory military training, comparing it to [...] "domesticating donkeys." [...] He gave away {{hundreds of thousands of}} hectares to the United Fruit Company (UFCO), exempted them from taxes in Tiquisate, and allowed the U.S. military to establish bases in Guatemala.|$|E

2500|$|The local borough {{pledged to}} carry out a full {{investigation}} into the fire. Prime Minister Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, saying that people [...] "deserve answers" [...] to why the fire was able to spread as quickly as it did. Sophie Khan, who acted as solicitor for some families in the Lakanal House fire, told BBC Two's Newsnight that inquests would be better for the families as they would allow the families to participate <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions.</b> She said the coroner was independent but a public inquiry was government-led and she wondered what information the Prime Minister knew that she wanted to hide.|$|E
2500|$|As {{more patient}} cohorts become adept at using {{technology}} {{in their daily}} lives, it will become easier to integrate technology into patient care and compliance. Already there are multiple opportunities to use technology to boost patient compliance rates, and {{make it easier for}} patients to become involved in their own care. As part of the push to encourage implementation of electronic health records in hospitals and private practices, the US government has set [...] "meaningful use" [...] objectives and benchmarks. One such objective is the use of a patient portal, through which patients can securely view lab reports, request prescription refills, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> of their providers - all of which can increase patient compliance with care plans.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 January 2012, Regenvanu {{received}} a letter from Prime Minister Kilman terminating his position as minister. Regenvanu said the letter accused him of being disloyal to the government, without further explanation, although he thought it might be due to his having voted against Vanuatu's entry in the World Trade Organisation. He described his sacking as [...] "appropriate", as no minister in the country's history had ever voted against a government bill before, but said that he did not regret voting against WTO accession, as he had voted in accordance with the wishes of people. He added that, being outside the cabinet, he would now [...] "be able to be much more critical of government policy <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> - something I wasn't able to do as a minister". In a press release shortly thereafter, he evoked the other reasons which might have led to his dismissal, presenting himself as a conviction politician who had opposed government decisions he saw as wrong: ...|$|E
