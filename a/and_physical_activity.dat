5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their {{behavior}} {{as a result of}} experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E

In this section, we study whether a co-evolution relationship exists between the given user’s network positions <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> Such analysis not only considers cases where network positions <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> both increase or decrease over time, but also takes into account cases where network positions <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> co-evolve in alternative, e.g., wave-like patterns over time. Here, for a given user, a strong co-evolution relationship would mean that when the user’s network centrality values increase, the user’s <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> also increase (positive correlation) or decrease (negative correlation).|$|R

As this paper intended to investigate the participation of children with cerebral palsy in sports <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> an ecological framework was used to organize relevant papers into those studies that considered the consequences of inactivity, the diversity and frequency of participation, that activity preferences of children and adolescents, the predictors of participation and the barriers and facilitators to participation. Results: Children with Cerebral Palsy participate less frequently in sports <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> {{than the general population}} making them more likely to lead sedentary lives and placing them most at risk of becoming overweight, obese and at risk of experiencing poor <b>physical,</b> emotional health <b>and</b> wellbeing.

The project was designed to support the school's strategic aim of raising academic standards and increasing whole school participation in Physical Education and Sport. In ten years over 10,000 children and 1,000,000 hours of PE have been assessed. The evidence shows that participation in physical activity enables young people to significantly improve their physical competence, confidence and self-esteem. More active pupils were also found to generally achieve higher academic attainment with 62% of physically active pupils achieving five or more A*-C GCSE grades including mathematics and English compared to 38% of the least active pupils.|$|E

25|$|The {{first line}} {{treatment}} is change of lifestyle (e.g., Dietary Guidelines for Americans <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity).</b> However, if in {{three to six months}} of efforts at remedying risk factors prove insufficient, then drug treatment is frequently required. Generally, the individual disorders that compose the metabolic syndrome are treated separately. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors may be used to treat hypertension. Cholesterol drugs may be used to lower LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, if they are elevated, and to raise HDL levels if they are low. Use of drugs that decrease insulin resistance, e.g., metformin and thiazolidinediones, is controversial; this treatment is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Weight loss medications may result in weight loss. As obesity is often recognized as the culprit behind many of the additional symptoms, with weight loss and lifestyle changes in diet, physical activity, the need for other medications may diminish.|$|E
25|$|Whether an {{individual}} develops certain diseases or disorders is also established, {{to a certain}} degree, {{on the basis of}} nature and nurture. Genes often predispose individuals to certain disorders or diseases, while environmental factors can trigger the onset. Susceptibility of diabetes is determined by inherited differences in DNA, but environmental factors such as diet, weight, age, <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> seem to be triggering the onset of the disease. Genetic make-up, in addition to the environment with which the genes are exposed to, is influencing the behaviour of consumers with regard to the food choices they make. Addiction to substance abuse is partially determined by genes, which predispose individuals to have addictive personalities; however the stimuli with which an addiction develops is dependent on the environment. Addiction is persistent and compulsive, and has a significant impact upon consumer behaviour. Individuals who experience substance abuse, for example, are prone to basing their consumption primarily around the purchasing of alcohol, even {{at the expense of other}} important aspects of well-being.|$|E
