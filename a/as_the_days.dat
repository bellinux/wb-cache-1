These hindrances continued during the Battle of Malvern Hill, with both Magruder and Huger making mistakes in the deployment of their forces.|$|E

5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E

25|$|Bharuch {{was a major}} {{sea port}} in the {{important}} pre-compass coastal trading routes to points West, perhaps as far back <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the Pharaohs, which utilised the regular and predictable Monsoon winds or galleys.

25|$|Approximately 1800 of the world's 10,000 {{bird species}} are long-distance migrants. The primary {{motivation}} for migration {{appears to be}} food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter. Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for breeding birds to feed their young. This helps diurnal birds to produce larger clutches than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season. These advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration such as predation.|$|E

It was a ship building centre and sea port in the pre-compass coastal trading routes to points West, perhaps {{as far back}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the Pharaohs. The route made use of the regular and predictable monsoon winds or galleys. Many goods from the Far East (the famed Spice and Silk trade) were shipped there during the annual monsoon winds, making it a terminus for several key land-sea trade routes.

25|$|Maximilian {{sent his}} wife Charlotte to Europe to plead against the {{withdrawal}} of French troops. After an unsuccessful attempt at negotiating with Napoleon III, Charlotte then traveled to Rome to plead with Pius in 1866. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> passed Charlotte's mental state became overtly paranoid. She sought refuge with the pope, and she would eat and drink only what was prepared for him, fearful that everything else might be poisoned. The pope, though alarmed, was accommodating to her and even agreed to let her stay in the Vatican one night after she voiced anxiety about her safety. She and her assistant were the first women to stay the night inside the Vatican.|$|E
25|$|When a {{good number}} of days passed without the {{reinforcements}} of ships promised by president Jefferson, the attack on Tripoli was renewed by Preble on August 24. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> passed, Tripoli showed no signs of surrender, which now prompted Preble to devise another plan. Intrepid, the same ship that captured Philadelphia, was loaded with barrels of gunpowder and other ordnance and sent sailing into a group of Tripolitan vessels defending the harbor. The attack on the harbor and Tripoli proved successful and ultimately caused the Bashaw of Tripoli to consider surrender and the return of American prisoners held captive, including Commodore Bainbridge of Philadelphia, who had been held prisoner since October 1803 when that ship was captured after running aground near Tripoli harbor. On June 4, 1805, the Bashaw of Tripoli finally surrendered and signed a peace treaty with the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{early stage}} of the siege of Uthman's house was not severe, but <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> passed, the rebels {{intensified}} their pressure against Uthman. With {{the departure of the}} pilgrims from Medina to Mecca, the hands of the rebels were further strengthened, and as a consequence the crisis deepened further. The rebels understood that after the Hajj, the Muslims gathered at Mecca {{from all parts of the}} Muslim world might march to Medina to relieve Uthman. They therefore decided to take action against Uthman before the pilgrimage was over. During the siege, Uthman was asked by his supporters, who outnumbered the rebels, to let them fight against the rebels and rout them. Uthman prevented them in an effort to avoid the bloodshed of Muslim by Muslim. Unfortunately for Uthman, violence still occurred. The gates of the house of Uthman were shut and guarded by the renowned warrior, Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr. The sons of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali, were also among the guards.|$|E
25|$|The estrous cycle (also spelled oestrous) {{controls}} when a mare is sexually receptive {{toward a}} stallion, {{and helps to}} physically prepare the mare for conception. It generally occurs during {{the spring and summer}} months, although some mares may be sexually receptive into the late fall, and is controlled by the photoperiod (length of the day), the cycle first triggered when the days begin to lengthen. The estrous cycle lasts about 19–22 days, with the average being 21 days. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> shorten, the mare returns to a period when she is not sexually receptive, known as anestrus. Anestrus - occurring in the majority of, but not all, mares - prevents the mare from conceiving in the winter months, as that would result in her foaling during the harshest part of the year, a time when it would be most difficult for the foal to survive.|$|E
25|$|In February 1984, the Toyota {{franchise}} officially takes a {{leave of}} absence from the league after suffering from huge losses in terms of revenues. This also forced the hand of then team manager Jack Rodríguez (who replaced Ricky Silverio, Jr., the son of the team owner who replaced Carlos) to sell the franchise to Beer Hausen of Lucio Tan's Asia Brewery. The lock, stock and barrel deal stated that all Toyota players will be sold as well, to be led by no less than their starting center Ramon Fernandez. Robert Jaworski and his bossom buddy Francis Arnaiz balked at the sale, refusing to heed the contract that they were obligated to follow. This made Arnaiz mouth the famous line, “di kami por kilo” in reference to the non-transparent ways that the Toyota management did in selling the franchise without informing the players. With the controversy becoming even bigger <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> wore on, then Ginebra team owner Carlos “Honeyboy” Palanca, III, who was also the PBA President at that time, decided to secure Jaworski's services. Jaworski was joined by Francis Arnaiz in the Palanca franchise, while Chito Loyzaga and Arnie Tuadles were taken in by Great Taste Coffee. Prior to the sale of the franchise, Abe King joined the San Miguel Group then called Gold Eagle Beer. The majority of the Toyota players led by Fernandez (along with Coloso, Cordero, Herrera, Legaspi, Bulaong, Relosa, etc.) went to Beer Hausen.|$|E
