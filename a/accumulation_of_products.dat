The stable storage of different seed proteins is a remarkable presumption for successful germination and growth. These strategies have been adapted and used in several molecular farming projects.

Multimers larger than 460 kDa in size are routinely produced, which is above the native size of the FLAG protein. The storage of seeds for eight weeks and one year at an ambient temperature of 15 °C does not influence the accumulation level. Even the extended storage time does not influence the typical pattern of multimerized bands.

While previous investigation on seed origin was almost exclusively through fossil comparison in paleobotany, a wealth of information about the key role of LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC 1) in seed formation of spermatophyte inspired a new approach to investigating the seed origin mystery.

40|$|A flux of {{hydroxyl}} radicals {{generated by}} gamma-irradiation can fragment monoamine oxidase in the membrane of submitochondrial particles. This fragmentation can be inhibited by mannitol {{and in addition}} is more extensive in monoamine oxidase preparations that have been depleted of lipid. This latter observation {{is consistent with the}} higher yields of fragmentation induced by hydroxyl radicals in soluble proteins in the absence of added lipids. In the absence of oxygen, gamma-irradiation of submitochondrial particles leads to cross-linking reactions. A flux of hydroperoxyl radicals also causes fragmentation, whereas one of superoxide is virtually inactive in this respect. The irradiation of submitochondrial particles leads in addition to the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> of lipid peroxidation. When these irradiated preparations are exposed to ferrous or cupric salts a further fragmentation of monoamine oxidase ensues, especially at acid pH.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the photochemical reduction of CO{sub 2 } in aqueous solution to form C{sub 1 } products {{using a variety of}} oxide semiconductors and near UV light. Conventional oxide photosemiconductors including TiO{sub 2 } and SrTiO{sub 3 }, as well as modified oxide semiconductors including Pt/TiO{sub 2 } and SrTiO{sub 3 }/Cr-Sb, TiO{sub 2 }/Fe{sub 3 }O{sub 4 } or TiO{sub 2 }/Fe(CN) {sub 6 }{sup 3 -} were used. Analysis for formate, acetate, formaldehyde, methanol and methane were conducted by a variety of analytical methods. Despite extensive published data on the facile reduction of CO{sub 2 } by these semiconductors, we found only trace quantities of formate and acetate (typically less than 1 ppm) and no unequivocal evidence for formation of the other products. The quantum efficiencies of TiO{sub 2 } and SrTiO{sub 3 } for forming formate and acetate from CO{sub 2 } are estimated to be 0. 1 - 0. 2 % or less. The spectral properties of the unmodified oxides (TiO{sub 2 }, SrTiO{sub 3 }) restricts their use of solar irradiation to about 10 % of the available near UV and visible spectrum, thereby giving an overall quantum and spectral efficiency of less than 0. 01 %. Semiconductor oxides modified with, Cr and Sb, Fe{sub 3 }O{sub 4 } or Fe(CN) {sub 6 }{sup 3 -} exhibited no enhanced efficiency. However, Pt/TiO{sub 2 } does produce more formate and acetate than TiO{sub 2 } alone by about a factor of two. Addition of 0. 6 mM 2 -propanol to an irradiated CO{sub 2 }/TiO{sub 2 } suspension led to formation of larger amounts (0. 55 mM, 25 ppm) of formate, but no formaldehyde. The higher yield is probably because re-oxidation of formate by semiconductor holes was competitively blocked by propanol acting as a sacrificial electron donor. Reoxidation of formate by TiO{sub 2 } under argon is 80 times faster than reduction. Thus, reoxidation could be an important process limiting the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and will require new design strategies for reducing <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> in the photocatalytic zone if the an efficient process is to be developed. New photosemiconductors are needed which have broad spectral absorbance extending to 600 nm.

Although a perfectly efficient (100 %) system could be as small as 10 km{sup 2 }, to begin to approach that size plant footprint will require a dramatic improvement in semiconductor photocatalysis efficiency over that which is currently available...|$|E

The most influential parameter was concentration of the main substrate, namely feathers. It is natural that substrate concentration appears {{as one of the}} most important factors, not only for accumulation of degradation products, but also on keratinolytic activity (Paul et al. 2014). It determines not only carbon availability for bacteria and the initial output level of hydrolysis products, but also affects bacterial growth and enzyme activity through faster <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products.</b> The presence of additional carbon sources, like saccharides or peptones, besides the keratinous inducer, was confirmed by some authors to be relevant for production of keratinases (Ramnani and Gupta 2004; Cai and Zheng 2009), however it becomes less rational when biodegradation of the feather substrate is the goal. In the case of K. rosea feather substrate concentration along with magnesium sulphate appeared to be most influential for keratinase production (Bernal et al. 2006). Sulphates are typical mineral medium components for culturing bacteria in the presence of keratins, and is often considered in optimization studies. Nevertheless, the results from Plackett–Burman design revealed negative impact of increasing magnesium sulphate concentration in the tested range.|$|E

Biochemistry of ABE fermentation helps us understand the overall mechanism and pH dependency of the process. Here we consider the overall process of fermentation and pervaporative separation represented in form of simple mathematical model to explain its intricacies. The set of differential equation were solved using Berkeley Madonna 8. 0 version differential equation solver. The inhibition constant for the process was determined and rp factor for including pervaporation effect into the model was taken into account. It was found inhibition constant has an important role in the overall process and also rp factor had pronounced effect on the concentration of products and substrate in the process. Minor modification in rp factor lead to large variation in the fermentation dynamics. After several trial runs it was concluded rp factor is dependent on the type of membrane considered for pervaporation. Apart from this the biomass concentration in both models reached similar level a fact supporting both the models. ...|$|E
