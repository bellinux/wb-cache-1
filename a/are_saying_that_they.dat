When he was released his family returned to Khothian. People of Khothian witnessed the presence of white marks on the palm of Shah Sahab. During the English rule the descendants of Sultan declared themselves as Jut Wadhan. Now they <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are Malik’s and descendants of Qutab Shah which is nothing but a cruel lie. If we go through the parental record of Mr. Sultan written by his descendant Mohammad Nawaz in his book it is clear, that name of at least 10 persons above Sultan are Hindu’s name. Which is obscure that how a Muslim person can have Hindu name in the period of Muslim Regime? For example, one of these 10 persons was named Khothi, which clearly shows that it is a non- Muslim name. Over time, the village became associated with the Sahgal family, and was renamed as Saigolabad. The Sahgal family financed the construction of a school and hostel in Saigolabad in the 1950s. This is known as Saigolabad Model High School. Now it has the status of [...] "Union Council Khothian" [...] and 12 other small villages (Rabal, Sarkal, Budhial, Chabri, Chabar, Chak Jharhy, Punjain, Mohrha Gujran, kehwal, Dhok Mian Mehr and Chak Kharak) are associated with it.

In fact this piece of land is the property of landlord Raib Khan the great who gifted this to legend Muhammad Sultan Khothi who was already Muslim and migrated from famous village of Khothian(Jalip) Jehlum in reward to protect Raib Khan from Sikh invaders and looters while Syed Haji Shah sahib(RA) was also residing there.|$|E

She gives breakfast to Faisal (Ali Abbas) and tells her that they can win suit when they will ask general knowledge questions and she asks if she participate but her mother-in-law (Nargis Rasheed) calls her and she maintains her hair and takes care of her. She has sneezing problem. She tells her that in her building people are coming to promote new lawn and she agrees. Her neighbour again calls her and she gives her lawn's suit and says her to check and she sees and returns her after seeing.

On next day, that woman again calls her that all women <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> want lawn's all three-piece suit but she says she is not one of them. In accordance to Zubia, that her Khursheed aunt and Shaista Aapa is one of them. She tells to her mother-in-law that Annie's husband brings all things for her and she says that he is an engineer that's why and Zubia tells her that Faisal ought be engineer at first. She later asks from her the general questions and her mother-in-law knows all the answers. Faisal also asks her questions she knows and she tells all answers and he says her that they will not ask from her these easy questions and says her he has not problem with her quizz but he has problem with her attitude and says her that she has also other occupations to do. She later wears clothes and OMG!! her mother-in-law is unconscious. She brings her to hospital. Faisal says her {{to take care of her}} mother-in-law. Her neighbour calls her and says in accordance, Jameela aunt also won the three-piece suit. Zubia on next day polished his shoes and says Faisal to buy a new one but he refuses, saying that his mother needs care and this home, all money is spent here. Her neighbour Annie calls her to buy some important things to buy. She buys and gives her taking cash herself and said her that no cash given. She shies on her mistake and wants to return her. She writes letter to Annie saying that she done a mistake that she didn't give her a cash money she got from there but she returns her saying that she can take it. Faisal calls her saying that he got a new tuition who give her advance fee. She becomes happy and excited but he says that she shouldn't be happy. In night, he says her what she is thinking but she tells her that if there would be a baby, how would we afford money. He sleeps while she thinks to say him that she loves blue colored-suits but there are no enough blue suits. She on next day gets Rs. 320 from cash account from her neighbour. She gives him dinner and they talk about affording suit. She says him that from some days, she is working for Kifayat Sha'ari (Saving) to her neighbor. He says that this is a very good thing and she can buy one lawn three-piece suit per month. He finds shoes from dining table. She tells him that apart from the three-piece suit, they can buy other things as well. He becomes very happy and he also gives her gift of Happy Anniversary Day. He gives her blue-coloured suit which she liked always. She says to him thank you so much, and they live a very happy life.|$|E

How can this reliance be reconciled with what preceded it? I argue that an adaptive trait - incorporating new data that potentially conflicts with one’s pre-existing worldview so as to preserve as much of that worldview as possible - proved to be maladaptive in this circumstance. There was a plausible story investors could tell themselves about why the rating agencies could ‘get it right’ about the complex securities at issue while having gotten it spectacularly wrong about Enron.

40|$|A very {{interesting}} dialogue {{has been established}} here concerning the role of insurance in our society. I would, however, like to {{step back from the}} insurance issue to discuss several major developments that will shape how genetic information is used in our society. First, revolutionary change is going on among employers in the way they respond to the cost of health insurance. Employers <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> just can't afford to pay any more. This process may eventually have major implications for the use of genetic testing. Second, there will be phenomenal growth {{in the use of the}} genetic data banks, a development which may have tremendous implications for our notion of privacy. Third, there is a revolution going on in the way that disabled persons are beginning to assert their rights. The recent enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act heralds a decade in which disabled citizens will become empowered. To defend my first assertion, concerning the way employers are balking at the cost of health insurance, I shall quote several articles taken from business journals and newspapers.

This {{is the point of}} departure for our study. Using a questionnaire based upon the work of Geert Hofstede, we surveyed employees of a MNC headquartered in Germany with branches in the US. We create three stress groupings: High, Middle and Low based upon selected variables meas-ured on Likert-type scales, e. g., How often do you feel nervous or tense at work? We examine these stress groups on a variety of variables to develop profiles of these three groups. The dataset with 1, 300 observations on more than 75 variables provides a rich rendering of the profiles both overall and by country. For example, we find for both the German and US respondents that more stress is associated with less satisfaction in particular respecting Fringe Benefits and Having Challenging Work. And the German employees, who were classified as exhibiting high levels of stress, are less satisfied with Fringe Benefits than their US counterparts. ...|$|E

40|$|The risk in {{conventional}} arms sales along with nuclear energy deals Charles D. Ferguson At {{the same time}} as major powers <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> want to rein in nuclear proliferation, they are offering both nuclear energy programs and conventional weapons to client states. Military arms sales may shore up certain countriesÕ defenses, but such sales may also stimulate conventional arms races and conventional force imbalances may serve as a rationale for states to acquire nuclear weapons as great equalizers. More nuclear weapons in more states could increase the likelihood of losing control of these weapons to terrorists, crim-inals, or other malicious actors. This author evaluates nuclear energy deals that could result in changing security perceptions and shifting security alliances, and writes that such evaluations are important in the context of global security. Military and nuclear suppliers have incentives to sell conventional arms and nuclear technologies to clients, he writes, but both suppliers and clients {{need to be aware of}} the potential security consequences.

40|$|The affair {{is an act}} or acts of {{deviate from}} the things they deserve. Infidelity happens in the marital life due to the man or another woman {{in the life of}} someone who is bound by legal marriage, whether through {{emotional}} or physical relationship. Infidelity is a phenomenon that existed since instituted marriage.

Infidelity can occur in all circles, including to the police, where a police officer every day to face and must relate to the community. This research is a qualitative description of the type of research that attempted to link psychological phenomena with other aspects that are considered important. The results obtained show that the phenomenon of husband's infidelity that occurs because of the need for a friend who can be invited to communicate, physical keterpikatan that occur between husbands and their mistresses, the influence of the existing environment so as to make the husband having an affair, and certainly the perceived sexual satisfaction husband when dealing with the affair. It must be realized that in order to dare to separate himself from the cheating partner is difficult, it takes energy, thoughts, sacrifice, and incredible time. This involves the liver needs, tastes, and biological. The occurrence of cheating actually started because of the situation himself the husband who was in dire need of attention and affection touches to create different nuances of everyday life is her husband. Based on {{the results of this study}} can be concluded that generally the husband who cheated on the need to release tension caused by biological, they need a friend to talk, they need someone who can be invited to communicate and so forth.
