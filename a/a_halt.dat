The ports were quickly brought back into service, together with the railroad system in Southern France. Thereafter, large quantities of supplies could be moved north to ease the supply situation. In October, 524,894 tons of supplies were unloaded, which was more than one third of the Allied cargo shipped to the Western front.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to <b>a</b> <b>halt.</b> First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1920s saw {{a slight}} growth in traffic, the network's {{expansion}} slowed to <b>a</b> <b>halt.</b> Private motoring had arrived {{to put an}} end to its monopoly. The rising power of buses and trolleybuses, the Great Depression in France, and above all the Second World War that ravaged Rouen and Normandy, condemned the tramway to death. The last trams stopped running in 1953, after seventy-six years of service. However, in 1994, a new Rouen tramway came to the Norman capital.|$|E

It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E
