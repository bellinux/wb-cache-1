50|$|Between 2000 and 2005 Dutchman Ron Bouwland, {{sponsored}} by the Dutch Bridge Federation, developed Bridgemate, <b>an</b> electronic <b>bridge</b> <b>scoring</b> device. The original Bridgemate is connected to a computer by cable, while its successor, Bridgemate II, uses a wireless connection. Within the Low Countries, Bridgemate is used by around 1,400 bridge clubs. The World Bridge Federation, the European Bridge League and the American Contract Bridge League also use the device in competitions.|$|R
40|$|The {{neighborhood}} overlap (NOVER) of an edge u-v {{is defined}} as the ratio of the number of nodes who are neighbors for both u and v to that of the number of nodes who are neighbors of at least u or v. In this paper, we hypothesize that an edge u-v with <b>a</b> lower NOVER <b>score</b> <b>bridges</b> two or more sets of vertices, with very few edges (other than u-v) connecting vertices from one set to another set. Accordingly, we propose a greedy algorithm of iteratively removing the edges of a network in the increasing order of their neighborhood overlap and calculating the modularity score of the resulting network component(s) after the removal of each edge. The network component(s) that have the largest cumulative modularity score are identified as the different communities of the network. We evaluate the performance of the proposed NOVER-based community detection algorithm on nine real-world network graphs and compare the performance against the multi-level aggregation-based Louvain algorithm, as well as the original and time-efficient versions of the edge betweenness-based Girvan-Newman (GN) community detection algorithm...|$|R

60|$|Of all {{the open}} {{spaces in the}} city, that before the Church of St. Mark alone bears the name of Piazza, and the rest are called merely campi, or fields. But if {{the company of the}} noblest {{architecture}} can give honor, the Piazza San Marco merits its distinction, not in Venice only, but in the whole world; for I fancy that no other place in the world is set in such goodly bounds. Its westward length is terminated by the Imperial Palace; its lateral borders are formed by lines of palace called the New Procuratie on the right, and the Old Procuratie on the left; [Footnote: In Republican days the palaces of the Procuratori di San Marco.] and the Church of St. Mark fills up almost its whole width upon the east, leaving space enough, however, for a glimpse of the Gothic perfection of the Ducal Palace. The place then opens southward with the name of Piazzetta, between the eastern façade of the Ducal Palace and the classic front of the Libreria Vecchia, and expands and ends at last on the mole, where stand the pillars of St. Mark and St. Theodore; and then this mole, passing the southern façade of the Doge's Palace, stretches away to the Public Gardens at the eastern extremity of the city, over half <b>a</b> <b>score</b> of <b>bridges,</b> between lines of houses and shipping--stone and wooden walls-- in the long, crescent-shaped quay called Riva degli Schiavoni. Looking northward up the Piazzetta from the Molo, the vision traverses the eastern breadth of the Piazza, and rests upon the Clock Tower, gleaming with blue and gold, on which the bronze Giants beat the hours; or it climbs the great mass of the Campanile San Marco, standing apart from the church {{at the corner of the}} New Procuratie, and rising four hundred feet toward the sky--the sky where the Venetian might well place his heaven, as the Moors bounded Paradise in the celestial expanse that roofed Granada.|$|R
