5000|$|Like the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF mount used on {{previous}} Pentax digital SLRs, the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF2 lacks the mechanism to mechanically sense a lens's <b>aperture</b> <b>ring</b> setting. For that reason, {{when using the}} manual <b>aperture</b> <b>ring</b> on K-mount lenses, {{it is necessary to}} set the 'Use aperture ring' setting in the 'Custom Menu' to 'Permitted' and use stop-down metering mode (Pentax calls it optical preview) to ensure proper exposure. KA and KAF lenses with aperture rings are fully compatible when the <b>aperture</b> <b>ring</b> is set to automatic ('A'), giving control over the aperture to the camera body.|$|E

50|$|F-mount lenses lock {{by turning}} {{counter-clockwise}} (when {{looking at the}} front of lens) and unlock clockwise. Nearly all F-mount lenses have zoom and focus controls that rotate in the clockwise direction (as viewed from behind the camera) to increase focal length and focus distance respectively. This convention is also used in Pentax K-mount and Sony A-mount lenses but is opposite of the direction normally used by Canon. F-mount lenses also typically have <b>aperture</b> <b>rings</b> that turn clockwise to close.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Pen F had a double-stroke {{film advance}} and a distinctive logo rendered in a gothic font. The later Pen FT added a single-stroke film advance, and an uncoupled, integrated light meter, which used {{a system of}} exposure numbers rather than f-stops. The exposure numbers {{were added to the}} <b>aperture</b> <b>rings</b> of later Pen F lenses; the rings could be pulled out and rotated to show conventional f-stops instead. A side-effect of the FT's light meter was a dimmer viewfinder. The Pen FV was essentially a Pen FT with the light meter deleted and the F's brighter viewfinder reinstated.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} breech-lock FD {{lenses and}} the New FD lenses are completely functionally interchangeable, and may each {{be used on}} any FD camera body. A minor operational difference between New FD and earlier lenses occurs only when using a Canon New F-1 body with the AE Finder FN in aperture preferred AE mode. The New FD lenses' <b>aperture</b> <b>rings</b> were placed closer {{to the rear of}} the lens so that the aperture value is visible in the new F-1's viewfinder, via an optical prism. Earlier lenses' aperture scales do not align properly with the prism, and are therefore not visible.|$|R

5000|$|AI-S — The {{successor}} to AI, the AI-S specification added two mechanical enhancements — standardized aperture control, and the Focal Length Indexing Ridge — {{required for the}} shutter priority and other auto-aperture exposure modes of the Nikon FA, F-301/N2000, F-501/N2020, and F4 cameras. Later cameras did not require these features, and interoperate with AI and AI-S lenses identically. The term AI-S is now commonly {{used to refer to}} manual focus lenses, and Nikon continues to produce eight prime lens models in its AI-S line. All Nikon AF lenses with <b>aperture</b> <b>rings</b> (non-G) also meet the AI-S specification, except for their lack of a Meter Coupling Prong (which can be added).|$|R
50|$|Certain {{third-party}} mechanical adapters {{also provide}} circular control rings that provide some mechanical {{control of the}} aperture of Nikon G, Pentax DA and Canon EF lenses, as these {{do not have a}} mechanical <b>aperture</b> control <b>ring</b> on their lens barrels.|$|R
30|$|We {{will report}} {{the design and}} {{performance}} of a MR-compatible SPECT system that utilizes a dual-FOV aperture design for microscopic SPECT imaging of small animals inside an pre-existing MR scanner. The MRC-SPECT-DF system consists of a full ring of high resolution CdTe detectors and an aperture that consists of dual-FOV aperture system design that has two sets of <b>aperture</b> <b>rings</b> along the axis, one providing a large FOV {{and the other one}} allowing an ultrahigh resolution microscopic imaging of a selected target region in the object. The switching between apertures does not require mechanical shifting of either the aperture or the CdTe detector ring. This is critical for integrating the SPECT system with the MR scanner, and minimizing the interference between both sub-system while operation.|$|R

But up to now, the main methods reported to obtain the Wigner distribution of 2 D signals are through optical ways. The discrete numerical methods reported to obtain Wigner distribution is only limited to one dimension, for the Wigner distribution of 2 D signals contain 4 D variables (2 D space variable and 2 D frequency variables), its calculation is intricate, and till now, there is no report of this aspect.

50|$|The OM Series lenses had the <b>aperture</b> control <b>ring</b> {{located at}} the front of the lens barrel. This was done to move it away from the shutter speed control, which was a ring on the camera body {{concentric}} with the lens mount.

50|$|These lenses are {{coated with}} glazes {{that make the}} lenses more {{suitable}} for digital cameras. However, they also support older 35mm camera formats, as they provide full frame coverage. The series originally consisted only of two macro lenses - a 50mm and a 100mm - which both featured an <b>aperture</b> <b>ring.</b> In 2009 the 100mm {{was replaced by a}} weather resistant (WR) version without an <b>aperture</b> <b>ring,</b> that was co-developed with Tokina. The series was revived in February 2015 when the D FA* 70-200mm f2.8 and D FA 150-450mm f4.5-5.6 telephoto zoom lenses were announced along with first pictures of a (then unnamed) K-1 mock-up.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{demonstrate}} sub-wavelength <b>ring</b> <b>aperture</b> arrays in a {{metal film}} {{which can be used}} for communications, material sensing, and nonlinear optics. We show in simulation and experiment extraordinary optical transmission through <b>ring</b> <b>apertures</b> on a metal film both in terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions. For THz metallic <b>ring</b> <b>aperture</b> arrays, transmission of 60 % is obtained with an aperture-to-area ratio of only 1. 4 %. We show that the high transmission can be suppressed by over 18 dB with a thin layer of free carriers in the silicon substrate underneath the metal film. We also experimentally demonstrate graphene-based active electro-optic modulation of THz waves. The metallic nanostructure provides ~ 4 times absorption enhancement and ~ 50 % modulation depth is obtained with monolayer graphene. These results suggest that CMOS-compatible terahertz modulators can be built by controlling the carrier density near the aperture. We also demonstrate extraordinary optical transmission in MIR metallic <b>ring</b> <b>aperture</b> arrays. We observe enhanced field-matter interaction with the MIR <b>ring</b> <b>apertures</b> due to enhanced near field, and we present its applications in sensing and nonlinear optical effects. We demonstrate using the devices for enhancing the absorption of PMMA by ~ 8 times. We also show in simulation the enhanced sensing of monolayer graphene with different Fermi level. We obtain a 60 cm- 1 shift of resonance frequency per 0. 1 eV change of Fermi level in graphene, and a 6 % change in transmission peak intensity. Next we experimentally demonstrate enhanced 2 D IR spectrum by using the MIR concentric apertures. At last, we experimentally show polarization-independent Fano resonance in concentric metallic <b>ring</b> <b>apertures</b> both in THz and MIR regions. A high-Q and intensive dark mode is indirectly excited by coupling with a low-Q bright mode. The coupling is enabled by the intrinsic asymmetry between the two concentric rings. A coupled optical resonator model is used to analyze the coupling process between the bright and dark modes. We find the Q of the dark mode is 3 ~ 6 times higher than that of the bright mode. We show that the dark mode can be selectively disabled without affecting the bright mode due to its unique current flow pattern. We also observe enhanced field-matter interaction and the absorption-induced transparency effect caused by the intense E-field in the aperture when a material absorption line is aligned with the dark mode...|$|R
50|$|Almost {{all other}} Pentax K mount bayonet lenses will {{function}} properly under manual focusing, with the AF system providing focus indication - Asahi Optical called this TTL Electronic Focus. This includes lenses with the Pentax K-A mount (introduced 1983) and the K-AF/AF2 mounts. However, the newest SMC-Pentax FA J (1997) and SMC-Pentax DA (2004) types, lacking an <b>aperture</b> control <b>ring,</b> have severely restricted functionality. There were over thirty contemporary manual focus Asahi Optical made lenses of the SMC Pentax-M and SMC Pentax-A types.|$|R
2500|$|For some lenses, {{including}} a few long telephotos, lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic aperture control was not provided. [...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] aperture, which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens <b>aperture</b> <b>rings,</b> with one <b>ring</b> setting the <b>aperture</b> and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture. [...] Examples of lenses {{with this type of}} preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28mm 3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75mm 4.5. [...] The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85mm 2.8D lens incorporates a mechanical pushbutton that sets working aperture when pressed and restores full aperture when pressed a second time.|$|R
