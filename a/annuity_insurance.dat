40|$|When people retire, {{purchasing}} the <b>annuity</b> <b>insurances</b> using their retirement fund {{is one way}} against the longevity risk. However, it has some shortcoming; the annual payment may be insufficient for daily life consumption, can’t be adjusted for any urgent need (liquidity risk), and moreover, if the policyholders unfortunately pass away early, they couldn’t leave the rest policy account value as bequest. Under these considerations, many people won’t purchase the <b>annuity</b> <b>insurances</b> right away at retirement; they can do their consumption choices and do asset allocation at the mean time like as “selfannuitization”(the “investment/consumption plan”, 2006, Gerrard, Haberman and Vigna), and then convert their portfolios into annuity pension on an adequate moment post-retirement to solve the longevity problem. This paper investigates the adequate annuitization timing and optimal asset allocation under different investment strategies {{that can be found}} according a time- series of safety level as a utility function for a retiree. The utility function set as a mean-variance form with a time-varying weight of the second moment that increasing with time. It reasonably describes that the older dislikes volatility risk.

40|$|Actuaries usually compute {{multiple}} life premiums {{based on}} the unrealistic assumption of independence of the lifelengths of insured persons. Many clinical studies, however, have demonstrated dependence of the lifetimes of paired lives such as husband and wife. In this respect, the present article tries to give {{an answer to the}} following question: does this simplifying hypothesis constitute a real financial danger for the insurance company? The answer turns out to be affirmative: this dependence materially affects the values of <b>annuities</b> and <b>insurances</b> involving multiple lives. In order to quantify the impact of a possible dependence on the amount of premium charged for <b>annuities,</b> <b>insurances</b> and widow's pension, we resort here on the Fr echet bounds, Markov processes and some copula models. These techniques are applied to classical insurance contracts issued to married couples and illustrated on NIS data as well as on observations from Brussels city...|$|R
