2500|$|Like the Mk VI, the Mk VII {{was a high}} {{altitude}} pressurised variant, this time powered by the Merlin 64 (F. Mk. VII) or 71 (H.F. Mk. VII) series engine with two-stage, two-speed superchargers. The cockpit was pressurised {{in a similar way}} to that of the Mk VI, although the details were slightly different. Other changes to the airframe are noted above. The Mk VII used a Marshall manufactured compressor for pressurising the cockpit; this was mounted on the right of the engine and drew its air through a long intake under the starboard exhaust stubs. An <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> allowed a maximum pressure differential of +2lb./sq.in. This was built up during the climb [...] and was maintained at heights of 28,000ft and above.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exhaust valve}} lets the diver vent {{expanding}} {{gas from the}} suit during the ascent. On ascent {{the air in the}} suit expands making buoyancy control difficult or impossible. [...] This may cause an uncontrolled ascent resulting in missed decompression stops, decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism or pulmonary barotrauma. The manual exhaust allows the diver to control the suit volume; this may incorporate an automatic, adjustable exhaust or there may be a separate automatic, auto dump, valve on the shoulder. [...] Automatic valves can be set to release at a pre-set pressure and in most situations, the diver can leave the <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> at a constant setting throughout the dive so that it releases {{with a small amount of}} over-pressure venting as needed automatically as the diver ascends. There are many different configurations but automatic vents are generally at the left shoulder, and manual vents are at the wrist. Environmentally sealed suits used for diving in contaminated water have no dump valve, but are clamped to the helmet with a watertight seal, so the exhaust valve of the helmet functions as a dump valve. Some, now rare, older dry suits may have no vents, requiring the diver to lift one of the wrist seals or the neck seal open to vent the suit.|$|E

50|$|In two-pipe steam systems, {{there is}} a return path for the {{condensate}} and it may involve pumps as well as gravity-induced flow. The flow of steam to individual radiators can be modulated using manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Control valves {{can also}} work with {{hydraulic}} actuators ({{also known as}} hydraulic pilots). These types of valves are also known as <b>Automatic</b> Control <b>Valves.</b> The hydraulic actuators will respond to changes of pressure or flow and will open/close the <b>valve.</b> <b>Automatic</b> Control <b>Valves</b> do not require an external power source, meaning that the fluid pressure is enough to open and close the valve.|$|R
2500|$|While at Rio, {{the crew}} noticed {{one of the}} engines had {{noticeable}} carbon buildup from being run at low speed during the propaganda flight days earlier. [...] On the return flight from South America, the <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> for gas cell 3 stuck open. [...] Gas was transferred from other cells through an inflation line. It was never understood why the valve stuck open, and subsequently the crew only used the hand-operated maneuvering valves for cells 2 and 3. 38 hours after departure, one of the airship's four Daimler-Benz 16-cylinder diesel engines [...] (engine car no. 4, the forward port engine) suffered a wrist pin breakage, damaging the piston and cylinder. Repairs were started immediately and the engine functioned on fifteen cylinders {{for the remainder of}} the flight. Four hours after engine 4 failed, engine no. 2 (aft port) was shut down, as one of two bearing cap bolts for the engine failed and the cap fell into the crank case. The cap was removed and the engine was run again, but when the ship was off Cape Juby the second cap broke and the engine was shut down again. The engine was not run again to prevent further damage. [...] With three engines operating at a speed of [...] and headwinds reported over the English Channel, the crew raised the airship in search of counter-trade winds usually found above , well beyond the airship's pressure altitude. Unexpectedly, the crew found such a wind at the lower altitude of [...] which permitted them to guide the airship safely back to Germany after getting emergency permission from France to fly a more direct route over the Rhone Valley. The nine-day flight covered [...] in 203 hours and 32 minutes of flight time. All four engines were later overhauled and no further problems were encountered on later flights. For the rest of April, Hindenburg remained at its hangar where the engines were overhauled and the lower fin [...] and rudder received a final repair; the ground clearance of the lower rudder was increased from 8 to 14 degrees.|$|E
50|$|Behind the {{pressure}} vessel, {{there is a}} pressure control valve which is controlled by an iron weight suspended from a gear rack thus making up an adjustable <b>automatic</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hydronic {{systems are}} usually {{connected}} to a water supply (such as the public water supply). An <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> regulates {{the amount of water}} in the system and also prevents backflow of system water (and any water treatment chemicals) into the water supply.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1930s, {{helped by}} high customs {{barriers}} and import bans on certain products, Clausen {{was successful in}} producing and selling {{a long list of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>valves</b> for refrigeration plants, which had previously been imported from the United States.|$|R
50|$|Watt {{never ceased}} {{improving}} his designs. This further improved the operating cycle speed, introduced governors, <b>automatic</b> <b>valves,</b> double-acting pistons, {{a variety of}} rotary power takeoffs and many other improvements. Watt's technology enabled the widespread commercial use of stationary steam engines.|$|R
50|$|Another {{factor is}} the {{decision}} to let the airship rise above the cloud layer, causing heating and then expansion of the hydrogen, which triggered <b>automatic</b> <b>valving</b> of the gas. Once the engines were restarted, the ship dived through the cloud into freezing air again and, either because the <b>automatic</b> <b>valves</b> were jammed open, or because the ship had already lost too much gas above the clouds, it could no longer stay aloft. Although Umberto Nobile {{was the victim of}} a smear campaign after the crash, one criticism of him, from the master airship pilot Hugo Eckener is perhaps justified — that Nobile should never have climbed above the cloud layer in the first place.|$|R
50|$|The proper {{construction}} of this claim {{was that it}} covered an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> in combination with a contrivance consisting of a pinhole and pin, by which the valve may be raised from its seat, so as to leave the valve hole permanently open, or by which the valve may be rigidly closed upon its seat, making a closed or plug valve.|$|E
50|$|The bag of the redpipe is {{stuffed with}} filling {{material}} and a pneumatically driven <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> {{that controls the}} pressure of the bag. By applying pressure with the arm the player can start and control the chanter and drones, as well as the overblowing function. The pressure that has to be applied to the bag can be adjusted, which allows players handicapped by age or physical restraints to play the instrument easily. The bag must be filled with air before starting to play, either by the breath of the player or automatically.|$|E

50|$|In 1933, Mads Clausen, an {{engineer}} specializing in {{air conditioning and}} refrigeration, established the Danish Cooling Automatic and Appliance Factory in his boyhood attic room in Elsmark, on the Danish island of Als.

5000|$|In most {{engineering}} {{applications of}} a FLS, a number (and not a fuzzy set) is needed as its final output, e.g., the consequent {{of the rule}} given above is [...] "Rotate the valve a bit to the right." [...] No <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> will know what this means because [...] "a bit to the right" [...] is a linguistic expression, and a valve must be turned by numerical values, i.e. by {{a certain number of}} degrees. Consequently, the fired-rule output fuzzy sets have to be converted into a number, and this is done in the Fig. 3 Output Processing block.|$|E
50|$|The {{disaster}} {{began as}} Olympic Pipeline was transporting gasoline from Cherry Point Refinery to terminals in Seattle and Portland, Oregon. A {{pressure relief valve}} that was not configured properly failed {{to open in the}} 16 inch mm pipeline, which resulted in a surge of pressure after an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> shut for reasons unknown. This resulted in the line rupturing at 3:25 that afternoon, and gasoline began spilling into adjacent Hanna and Whatcom Creeks. As the gasoline continued to spill, many people in the area called 911 to report the leak, and an Olympic Pipeline employee who was in the area called the company to report it.|$|E
5000|$|Two main {{theories}} have been postulated {{as to how}} gas could have leaked. Dr. Eckener believed a snapped bracing wire had torn a gas cell open (see below), while others suggest that a maneuvering or automatic gas valve was stuck open and gas from cell 4 leaked through. During the airship's first flight to Rio, a gas cell was nearly emptied when an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> was stuck open, and gas had to be transferred from other cells to maintain an even keel. However, no other valve failures were reported during the ship's flight history, and on the final approach {{there was no indication}} in instruments that a valve had stuck open.|$|E

50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} to release trapped air as it collects.

50|$|In {{the warmer}} months the {{previously}} heated water {{is taken from}} the short-term storage tank to the Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES). The Borehole Thermal Energy Storage unit is 144 holes located 37 m below the ground and stretches over an approximate area of 35 m in diameter. The water returns to the short-term storage tanks in the Energy Centre to be heated again in order to complete the circuit. During colder months {{the water from the}} BTES passes back to the short-term storage tank and is then directed to each home. Similar to a hot water tank, the heated water goes through a heat exchanger that blows air across the warm fan coil. Heat travels from the water to the air and is directed through the house via ductwork. When the temperature reaches that said on the thermostat, an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> shuts off the heat transfer unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{showed that}} Bailey {{was not the first}} to conceive the idea of a device for opening or closing rigidly an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve.</b> The same thing had been done by means of wedges and screws and other devices. He cannot therefore cover by his patent all the devices for producing this result, no matter what their form or mode of operation. The claim must be confined to the specific device described in the specification and claim—namely a pinhole and pin. If this construction of the claim be adopted, it is clear that no infringement is shown, for the appellees do not use a pinhole and pin for holding their valve open or closed, but a screw, sleeve, or cap, and therefore one of the elements of the combination, covered by the second claim of appellant's patent, is wanting in the device used by the appellees.|$|E

40|$|Most furrow {{irrigation}} systems have low performance due to deep percolation at the upstream end and tailwater runoff at {{the downstream end}} of the field. To eliminate this problem improving {{furrow irrigation}} performance is necessary. Since the inflow discharge has high effect on infiltration along the furrow which consequently affects the application efficiency and water distribution uniformity, {{it would be important}} to apply different furrow inflow hydrograph shapes based on the field data such as field slope, soil texture and furrow length to save water. To produce different furrow inflow hydrograph shapes, an <b>automatic</b> <b>valve</b> which was connected to a stepper motor was designed to change the inflow discharge with time according to the desired inflow hydrograph shape.
