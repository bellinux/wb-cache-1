5|$|When Mauser enters, Chuck flashes on his watch, {{identifying}} him as <b>a</b> <b>Fulcrum</b> agent. Mauser tells Chuck that {{he knows}} that Casey and Sarah are CIA {{and that they are}} protecting an unknown asset. He reveals that Ned is <b>a</b> <b>Fulcrum</b> agent who caused the disturbance so Mauser could infiltrate the Buy More. At this point, it is revealed that Ned is far more competent than the hostages were led to believe, having intentionally shot Casey in the foot and separated Chuck from his handlers. Mauser threatens to shoot the hostages if Chuck does not reveal where Bryce Larkin and the government database the Intersect are. Chuck reveals to Mauser that the Intersect has been uploaded to his brain.|$|E
5|$|As Mauser escorts {{him from}} the Buy More, Chuck urges Devon to disarm Ned. As Chuck is taken in an {{ambulance}} to <b>a</b> <b>Fulcrum</b> facility, Devon, Jeff Barnes (Scott Krinsky), Lester Patel (Vik Sahay), Big Mike (Mark Christopher Lawrence), and Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) make a plan. Lester unsuccessfully tries to tackle Ned, but Morgan manages to distract Ned long for Big Mike and Devon to tackle him and end the hostage situation.|$|E
5|$|Time and Chance (2002), a New York Times Bestseller, {{continues}} {{the story of}} Eleanor of Aquitaine and her husband, and focuses on the rift between Henry II and Thomas Becket. Time and Chance spans a 15-year period from 1156 to 1171 as Henry II became estranged from his wife (although Eleanor and Henry have eight children during thirteen years), and from his close friend and advisor Thomas Becket. King Henry's decision to elevate Becket to the Archbishop of Canterbury becomes <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum</b> for discord between Henry and Eleanor.|$|E
50|$|In rowing, oars {{are used}} to propel the boat. Oars differ from paddles in that they use <b>a</b> fixed <b>fulcrum,</b> <b>an</b> oarlock {{attached}} {{to the side of}} the boat, to transfer power from the handle to the blade, rather than using the athlete's shoulders or hands as the pivot-point as in canoeing and kayaking.|$|R

5|$|The {{appointment}} of Arsène Wenger as Arsenal manager in September 1996 marked {{a turning point}} in Bergkamp's career. Wenger, who had moderate success coaching in France and Japan, recognised Bergkamp's talent and wanted to use him as <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum</b> of the team's forward play. Both were advocates of a continental style of attacking football, and Wenger's decision to impose a strict fitness and health regimen pleased Bergkamp. Despite making fewer appearances in the 1996–97 season, Bergkamp was more influential in the first team, creating 13 assists. Against Tottenham Hotspur in November 1996, he set up an 88th-minute winner for captain Tony Adams to volley in using his left foot. He then scored in injury time, controlling a high ball with his left foot and evading his marker Stephen Carr in a tight area to set up his shot. Bergkamp received his first red card against Sunderland in January 1997 for a high tackle on midfielder Paul Bracewell in the 26th minute. Arsenal went on to lose the match 1–0, but a run of 8 wins in their final 16 matches gave the club a third-place finish, missing out on a spot in the UEFA Champions League via goal difference.|$|E
25|$|The lever is a movable {{bar that}} pivots on <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum</b> {{attached}} to a fixed point. The lever operates by applying forces at different distances from the fulcrum, or a pivot.|$|E
25|$|The {{extensor}} pollicis longus (EPL) originates on the {{dorsal side}} of the ulna and the interosseous membrane. Passing through the third tendon compartment, it is inserted onto {{the base of the}} distal phalanx of the thumb. It uses the dorsal tubercle on the lower extremity of the radius as <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum</b> to extend the thumb and also dorsiflexes and abducts the hand at the wrist. It is innervated by the deep branch of the radial nerve (C7-C8).|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} <b>a</b> modified <b>fulcrum</b> {{design to}} overcome limitations of <b>a</b> traditional <b>fulcrum.</b> The modified <b>fulcrum</b> is <b>a</b> triangular prism–shaped foam with rounded and padded edges. The 3 {{faces of the}} fulcrum represent 3 different heights (17. 0 cm, 17. 5 cm, and 21. 0 cm). For fulcrum bending radiographs of the thoracic curve, the patient is placed on an X-ray table in a lateral decubitus position over the fulcrum. The apex of the appropriate height of the fulcrum is positioned under the rib corresponding to {{the apex of the}} curve, such that the ipsilateral shoulder is lifted off the X-ray table for maximum passive bending force to the curve. For fulcrum bending radiographs of the lumbar curve, the fulcrum is positioned directly under the apex of the curve such that the ipsilateral iliac crest is lifted off the X-ray table.

25|$|Knowledge of equine forelimb anatomy is {{especially}} useful for understanding navicular syndrome. The navicular bone lies behind the coffin bone {{and under the}} small pastern bone. The deep digital flexor (DDF) tendon runs {{down the back of}} the cannon and soft tissue in that area and under the navicular bone before attaching {{to the back of the}} coffin bone. The DDF tendon flexes the coffin joint, and the navicular bone acts as <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum</b> that the DDF tendon runs over.|$|E
25|$|A lever is a beam {{connected}} to ground by a hinge, or pivot, called <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum.</b> The ideal lever does not dissipate or store energy, which {{means there is}} no friction in the hinge or bending in the beam. In this case, the power into the lever equals the power out, and the ratio of output to input force is given by {{the ratio of the}} distances from the fulcrum to the points of application of these forces. This is known as the law of the lever.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} front vise design is the leg vise. It's called a leg vise {{because one of}} the bench's legs is an {{integral}} part of it - usually forming the inside jaw. The outside jaw also goes all the way to the floor - or nearly so. There is a single screw mounted between a quarter and a third of the way down that goes through both jaws with the nut on the back of the leg. Finally, there is some sort of horizontal beam at the bottom to act as <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum.</b> This beam may take the form of a board that can be adjusted by means of holes and pegs, or it can even be another screw. The leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front vises, and it is very strong.|$|E

25|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} cracks formed {{along the southern}} part of the embankment, allowing the acidic tailings solution to penetrate and weaken the embankment. A sand beach was constructed to protect the face of the embankment from the tailings solution, but it was not properly maintained. Prior to the collapse, the level of the tailings solution in the holding pond had risen two feet higher than the dam's designed limit, and the sand beach no longer provided the dam protection. The United States Army Corps of Engineers concluded in its report to Governor Bruce King of New Mexico that the principal cause of failure was differential settlement of the foundation beneath the dam wall, and the report commissioned by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission corroborated this conclusion. Critical variations in tailings pond operation practice from approved procedures contributed further to the dam failure. United Nuclear's Chief Operating Officer, J. David Hann, blamed the failure of dam on the pointed shape of the bedrock beneath the embankment, which he said acted as <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum</b> and weakened the dam.|$|E

500|$|In 2005 Ballard {{replaced}} Rossy as {{the drummer}} in Mehldau's trio. This, {{in the view}} of critic Ray Comiskey, did not radically change the trio's sound, but it did give them [...] "a harder edge and pushed Mehldau more, with bassist Larry Grenadier left more in <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum</b> role, the centre around which piano and drums cavort." [...] Another critic, Ben Ratliff, suggested that the new trio's sound was [...] "denser and more tumultuous", with rhythms more overt than with the previous trio. In February 2005 Mehldau performed in Hong Kong for the first time, with his new trio. Their first album, Day Is Done, was recorded the following month.|$|E

500|$|Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone {{called the}} track a [...] "striking departure" [...] in sound for Del Rey, and said its groove {{transformed}} her [...] "from chanteuse into frontwoman {{for a few}} glorious moments". In a review of Ultraviolence, Mike Diver of Clash {{said that in the}} context of the album, [...] "West Coast" [...] took on greater significance by serving as <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum</b> which balances the record into [...] "leaving a better impression than it otherwise might". Consequence of Sound's Sasha Geffen described the song as [...] "a counterintuitive gem" [...] and [...] "the sort of thing that rings beautifully from old car windows on hot summer evenings," [...] while Marissa G. Muller of Vice called the track [...] "one of the Golden State's best-ever anthems".|$|E
2500|$|A lever {{is modeled}} as a rigid bar {{connected}} to a ground frame by a hinged joint called <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum.</b> The lever is operated by applying an input force [...] FA at a point A located by the coordinate vector rA on the bar.

2500|$|... he levered the bat up {{by pushing}} {{down with the}} top hand, whilst using the bottom hand as <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum.</b> As it neared {{the top of the}} back-lift, Bradman manoeuvred the bat through a {{continuous}} arc and back towards the plane of the ball during the downswing in preparation for impact. Additionally, his backswing (according to former Australian captain Greg Chappell) kept his hands in close to his body, leaving him perfectly balanced and able to change his stroke mid-swing, if he was initially deceived by the flight of the ball.|$|E

2500|$|The Coulthard-Tankard {{affair was}} seen as the {{culmination}} of a recent trend in the sport harking back to the violence and brutality of 1860s football. The Argus supported the VFA, saying [...] "it ought to be thanked and applauded by footballers, as it assuredly is by the public." [...] Other publications considered the sentence too severe on the grounds that no similar charge had previously been brought against Coulthard, and that the VFA had shown leniency in similar, if not worse cases. The incident also served as <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum</b> for debate {{on the role of the}} media; one journalist in particular was criticised for sensationalising the fight, and in turn, influencing the VFA's decision to investigate it.|$|E

The people of Efon Alaaye and Okemesi communities speak a similar dialect to Ijesha of Osun State. The uniqueness of speaking and understanding Ekiti language in any locality of the state, regardless of the dialectal variations, would suffice.

2500|$|This was {{followed}} by the conquest of the region by Muslim forces in 711. The settlement escaped attacks by the Leonese forces during the 11th century, but, its position near Christian kingdoms meant that a fortification was required to protect their settlement. Yet, by 1057, the first Christian Foral Charter [...] was instituted by the Ferdinand I of León and Castile, insinuating the fall of the Moorish fortress; the foral constituted one of the oldest geographic forals, defining the extent of Portuguese borders. During the High Middle Ages, the location already possessed a long cultural heritage, a factor that allowed it to become <b>a</b> <b>fulcrum</b> along the Douro River.
