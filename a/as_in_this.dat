5|$|DeHavilland's career spanned 53 years, from 1935 to 1988. During that time, she {{appeared}} in 49 feature films, {{and was one of}} the leading movie stars during the golden age of Classical Hollywood. She began her career playing demure ingénues opposite popular male stars, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made her breakout film Captain Blood in 1935. They would go on to make eight more feature films together, and became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. Her range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Following her film debut in the Shakespeare adaptation A Midsummer Night's Dream, deHavilland achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedies, such as The Great Garrick and Hard to Get, and Western adventure films, such as Dodge City and Santa Fe Trail. In her later career, she was most successful in drama films, such <b>as</b> <b>In</b> <b>This</b> Our Life and Light in the Piazza, and psychological dramas playing non-glamorous characters in films such as The Dark Mirror, The Snake Pit, and Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes {{topped the}} time sheets {{in the second}} session, now {{switching}} to the soft compound tyres as well, with Nico Rosberg two and a half-tenths of a second clear of Kimi Räikkönen, while Lewis Hamilton was third fastest, more than seven tenths off Rosberg's time. Räikkönen's running was interrupted for a while when he was called back into the pitlane to investigate a fuel system problem, but {{was able to get}} back out. Fernando Alonso was seventh fastest for McLaren, but needed a replacement of his car's plank after running wide over artificial grass surrounding the track. His teammate, Jenson Button, also experienced problems, having to stop {{at the end of the}} pitlane early in the session with an electrical issue. Renault's problem from the first session continued: Jolyon Palmer, back in his car in place of Ocon, suffered a tyre failure on the start-finish straight, bringing out red flags in the process. Renault and tyre supplier Pirelli were left puzzled over the failure, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> incident, no sign of a cut from debris was found.|$|E
5|$|The incisors {{are large}} and ungrooved. Their enamel is orange, but paler on the lowers. The {{orientation}} of the upper incisors is opisthodont, with the cutting edge oriented backwards. The molars are brachydont (low-crowned) and have two rows of main cusps separated by deep valleys and complemented by a network of crests and smaller cusps. The first upper molar is broader than in T.talamancae. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> species, but unlike in many other rice rats, including H.alfaroi, the mesoflexus on the second upper molar, which separates the paracone (one of the main cusps) from the mesoloph (an accessory crest), is not divided in two by an enamel bridge. The hypoflexid on the second lower molar, the main valley between the cusps, is very long, extending more than halfway across the tooth; in this trait, it is similar to T.talamancae but unlike H.alfaroi. Each of the upper molars has three roots (two on the outer {{and one on the}} inner side) and each of the lowers has two (one at the front and another at the back).|$|E
5|$|The upper incisor is opisthodont, {{with the}} cutting edge {{oriented}} backward. As usual in oryzomyines, the molars are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). The first upper molar is narrower than in T.bolivaris. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> species, but unlike in many other rice rats, including H.alfaroi and E.nitidus, the mesoflexus on the second upper molar, which separates the paracone (one of the main cusps) from the mesoloph (an accessory crest), is not divided in two by an enamel bridge. The hypoflexid on the second lower molar, the main valley between the cusps, is very long, extending more than halfway across the tooth; in this trait, the species is again similar to T.bolivaris but unlike H.alfaroi. Each of the upper molars has three roots (two at the labial, or outer, side and one at the lingual, or inner, side) {{and each of the}} lowers has two (one at the front and one at the back); T.talamancae lacks the additional small roots that are present in various other oryzomyines, including species of Euryoryzomys, Nephelomys, and Handleyomys.|$|E

These are designed to resonate at designated frequencies to achieve the desired values. Looking at the make-up of the split ring, the associated magnetic field pattern from the SRR is dipolar. This dipolar behavior is notable because this means it mimics nature's atom, but on a much larger scale, such <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case at 2.5 millimeters.
