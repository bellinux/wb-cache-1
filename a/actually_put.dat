5|$|The 1961–62 season {{proved to}} be highly disappointing, as Leicester {{finished}} 14th {{in the league and}} exited the FA Cup at the hands of Stoke City. The only highlight was the club's participation in the European Cup Winners' Cup, which <b>actually</b> <b>put</b> Banks in the difficult position of choosing to play for his club against Spanish club Atlético Madrid or choosing to attend the England versus Portugal match as a non-playing squad member. He elected to attend both games, leaving London at full-time to reach Leicester 30 minutes before the kick-off against Madrid. A last-minute goal earned the Spaniards a 1–1 draw at Filbert Street. In the return leg, Banks saved an Enrique Collar penalty, but Atlético were awarded a second penalty which Collar converted, and Leicester lost the game 2–0 (losing the tie 3–1 on aggregate).|$|E

Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by Habibullah Kalakani. Prince Mohammed Nadir Shah, Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in 1933 by Abdul Khaliq, a fifteen-year-old Hazara student.|$|E
25|$|A Coast Guard {{investigation}} concluded several {{facts about}} the Marine Sulphur Queen which, by themselves, should have prevented the ship from going to sea at all. The most important were the incidents of fire beneath and {{along the sides of}} the four large sulphur tanks; according to former crewmen these fires were so common that ship's officers gave up sounding the fire alarm. On one occasion the ship sailed into a New Jersey harbor, off-loaded cargo, and sailed out with a fire still burning. When a fire was <b>actually</b> <b>put</b> out, the sulphur would puddle and cake around equipment, once shorting out a major electrical generator.

25|$|He {{also worked}} {{on the design of}} a {{propeller}} with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911, and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908. At the time, contemporary propeller designs were not advanced enough to <b>actually</b> <b>put</b> Wittgenstein’s ideas into practice, and it would be years before a blade design that could support Wittgenstein’s innovative design was created. Wittgenstein’s design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to combustion chambers on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited. Propellers of the time were typically wood, whereas modern blades are made from pressed steel laminates as separate halves, which are then welded together. This gives the blade a hollow interior, and therefore creates an ideal pathway for the air and gas.|$|E

500|$|After {{writing his}} 2010 album Airtight's Revenge with themes {{intended}} for male listeners, Bilal wrote A Love Surreal for female listeners with lyrics about love.

He also drew on the shelving of his unreleased album Love for Sale, which inspired A Love Surreals title.

So this record is almost like a sonic art piece." [...] Bilal had wanted to sign with eOne because of the artistic freedom the label had given fellow recording artist Dwele. The album's title was also inspired by John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme.|$|E
500|$|The Hurt Locker {{is based}} on {{accounts}} of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad {{in the war in}} Iraq for two weeks in 2004. The director Kathryn Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short-lived television series The Inside in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences. Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events. He said of the film's goal, [...] "The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show {{the kinds of things that}} soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't <b>actually</b> <b>put</b> photographers in with units that are this elite."

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009, and lasted for approximately 67 days. Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It was important to me that this world feel real, and anytime I could build something I did. So I hired guys that I went to architecture school with to work on the sets for this film, and hopefully people who watch the film feel like there’s a certain physicality to this world that hopefully they appreciate, knowing that real architects <b>actually</b> <b>put</b> this whole thing together." [...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field." [...] The film's beginning portions were shot in 2D, while forty minutes of the film were vertically enhanced for IMAX. Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy.

500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can <b>actually</b> <b>put</b> pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E
