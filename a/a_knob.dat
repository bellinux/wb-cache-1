5|$|The bat is a hitting tool, {{traditionally}} {{made of a}} single, solid {{piece of}} wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in <b>a</b> <b>knob.</b> Bats used by adults are typically around 34inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42inches (106 centimeters).|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} the specimen, van Grouw {{noticed that the}} legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life, not the outer. The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having <b>a</b> <b>knob</b> {{at the base of}} its bill, {{similar to that of the}} Nicobar pigeon. This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas; it was depicted with <b>a</b> <b>knob</b> as late as 2002. This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess <b>a</b> <b>knob,</b> and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes. It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird, yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.|$|E

5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and <b>a</b> <b>knob.</b> Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning <b>a</b> <b>knob</b> controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E

5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and <b>a</b> <b>knob</b> on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E

40|$|The {{complement}} regulation protein CD 46 is {{the primary}} attachment receptor for most species B adenoviruses (Ads). However, significant variability exists in sequence and structure among species B Ads in the CD 46 -binding regions, correlating with differences in affinity. Here, we report a structure-function analysis of {{the interaction of the}} species B <b>Ad</b> 21 <b>knob</b> with the two N-terminal repeats SCR 1 and SCR 2 of CD 46, CD 46 -D 2. We have determined the structures of the <b>Ad</b> 21 <b>knob</b> in its unliganded form as well as in complex with CD 46 -D 2, and we compare the interactions with those observed for the Ad 11 knob– CD 46 -D 2 complex. Surface plasmon resonance measurements demonstrate that the affinity of <b>Ad</b> 21 <b>knobs</b> for CD 46 -D 2 is 22 -fold lower than that of the <b>Ad</b> 11 <b>knob.</b> The superposition of the Ad 21 and <b>Ad</b> 11 <b>knob</b> structures in complex with CD 46 -D 2 reveals a substantially different binding mode, providing an expla-nation for the weaker binding affinity of the <b>Ad</b> 21 <b>knob</b> for its receptor. A critical difference in both complex structures is that a key interaction point, the DG loop, protrudes more in the <b>Ad</b> 21 <b>knob</b> than in the <b>Ad</b> 11 <b>knob.</b> Therefore, the protruding DG loop does not allow CD 46 -D 2 to approach the core of the <b>Ad</b> 21 <b>knob</b> as closely as in the Ad 11 knob–CD 46 -D 2 complex. In addition, the engagement of CD 46 -D 2 induces a conformational change in the DG loop in the <b>Ad</b> 21 <b>knob</b> but not in the <b>Ad</b> 11 <b>knob.</b> Our results contribute to a more profound understanding of the CD 46 -binding mechanism of species B Ads and hav...|$|R

5|$|Tennis for Two is {{a sports}} video game {{developed}} in 1958, which simulates {{a game of}} tennis, {{and was one of}} the first games developed in the early history of video games. American physicist William Higinbotham designed the game for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition after learning that the government research institution's Donner Model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance. He designed the game, displayed on an oscilloscope and played with two custom aluminum controllers, in a few hours, after which he and technician Robert V. Dvorak built it over three weeks. The game's visuals show a representation of a tennis court viewed from the side, and players adjust the angle of their shots with <b>a</b> <b>knob</b> on their controller and try to hit the ball over the net by pressing a button.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and <b>a</b> <b>knob,</b> and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.|$|E

25|$|The PfEMP1 {{molecule}} is deposited at the RBC membrane at the knobs. These knobs {{are easily}} identified as conspicuous bumps on the infected RBCs {{from the early}} trophozoite stage onward. The malarial parasite cannot induce its virulence on RBCs without knobs. As many as 10,000 knobs are distributed throughout {{the surface of a}} mature infected RBC, and each knob is 50-80nm in diameter. The export of pfEMP1 from Maurer's cleft to RBC membrane is mediated by binding of another protein produced by the parasite called knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP). KAHRP enhances the structural rigidity of infected RBC and adhesion of PfEMP1 on the knobs. It is also directly responsible for forming knobs, as indicated by the fact that kahrp gene-deficient malarial parasites do not form knobs. To form <b>a</b> <b>knob,</b> KAHRP aggregates several membrane skeletal proteins of the host RBC, such as spectrin, actin, ankyrin R, and spectrin–actin band 4.1 complex. Upon arrival at the knob, PfEMP1 is attached to the spectrin network using the PHIST proteins.|$|E

Protoconch is glossy, teleoconch whorls are with obtuse growth-lines, {{which are more}} rib-like on the more narrowly sculptured, cervical part of the last whorl. Peristome is double; inner lip recognizable as a narrow ridge, contacting the body whorl and closing the umbilicus (visible in not fully grown specimens); outer lip very strongly thickened, with some prominent growth-ridges, tube-like protruding. Neck is with {{a more or less}} clearly developed basal crest. Aperture is obliquely pear-shaped to narrowed elliptical, with a sinulus bordered by the lamella parietalis and <b>a</b> <b>knob</b> on the peristome, whitish inside. Peristome is continuous, white, broadly reflexed. In frontal view, the prominent lamella parietalis (= superior), and the more inconspicuous lamella columellaris (= inferior) and plica principalis are seen, whereas the frontal end of the lamella subcolumellaris is usually discernible as a blunt denticle. The lamella parietalis is connected with the spiralis, which reaches as far as the lamella subcolumellaris inside, i.e. hardly further than the columellaris; there is no lamella inserta. Ventro-laterally, next to the plica principalis, there are four short, nearly parallel plicae palatales. Clausilial blade is rather broad, curvature of its outer border dictated by the position of the short palatal plicae.|$|E
