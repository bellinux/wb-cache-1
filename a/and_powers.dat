Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} {{field-programmable gate array}} (FPGA) -based {{integrated}} circuit (IC) for computing apparent <b>powers</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> factors of power systems. In a nonsinusoidal <b>and</b> unbalanced three-phase <b>power</b> system, the calculation of apparent <b>powers</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> factors has many definitions. Load characteristics of harmonic and unbalance can not be expressed in the traditional apparent <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> factor, which only consider the fundamental and three-phase balanced sinusoidal conditions. This paper utilizes the FPGA chip to develop the platform to implement the calculation methods of apparent <b>powers</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> factors. The proposed design scheme is developed using the very high speed integrated-circuit hardware description language (VHDL), which provides high flexibility and technology independence. This paper discussed the effective <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> factor, the arithmetic <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> factor, <b>and</b> the fundamental <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> factor. The design of filters for the computation of fundamental frequency components is given. ModelSim is used at first to simulate the calculation of apparent <b>powers</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> factors to ensure the accuracy of timing and function. Research {{results show that the}} designed chip can compute accurately the apparent <b>powers</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> factors considering the effects of nonsinusoidal and unbalanced conditions...|$|R

40|$|Delay {{minimization}} <b>and</b> <b>power</b> minimization are {{two important}} objectives {{in the design}} of the high-performance, portable, and wireless computing and communication systems. Retiming is a very effective way for delay optimization for sequential circuits. In this paper we propose a unified framework for multi-level partitioning and floorplanning with retiming, targeting simultaneous delay <b>and</b> <b>power</b> optimization. We first discuss the importance of retiming delay <b>and</b> visible <b>power</b> as opposed to the conventional static delay <b>and</b> total <b>power</b> for sequential circuits. Then we propose GEOPD algorithm for simultaneous delay <b>and</b> <b>power</b> optimization <b>and</b> provide smooth cutsize, wirelength, <b>power</b> <b>and</b> delay tradeoff. In GEO-PD, we use retiming based timing analysis <b>and</b> visible <b>power</b> analysis to identify timing <b>and</b> <b>power</b> critical nets <b>and</b> assign proper weights to them to guide the multi-level optimization process. In general, timing <b>and</b> <b>power</b> analysis are done at the original netlist while a recursive multi-level approach performs partitioning and floorplanning on the sub-netlist as well as its coarsened representations. We show an effective way to translate the timing <b>and</b> <b>power</b> analysis results from the original netlist to a coarsened sub-netlist for effective multi-level delay <b>and</b> <b>power</b> optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper addressing simultaneous delay <b>and</b> <b>power</b> optimization in multi-level partitioning and floorplanning...|$|R

Macrinus was the first emperor to hail from the equestrian class, rather than the senatorial and also the first emperor of Mauretanian descent. He adopted the name of Severus, in honor of the Severan dynasty, and conferred the imperial title of Augusta to his wife Nonia Celsa and the title of Caesar and name of Antoninus to his son Diadumenianus in honor of the Antonine dynasty, thus making him second in command.
