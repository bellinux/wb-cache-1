25|$|Some {{years passed}} before he again {{attempted}} romance writing, {{and then the}} first two parts of Gil Blas de Santillane were published in 1715, without the popularity of Le Diable boiteux. Lesage worked <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, and did not bring out the third part till 1724, nor the fourth till 1735. During these twenty years he was, however, continually busy. Notwithstanding the great merit and success of Turcaret and Crispin, the Théâtre Français did not welcome him, and in 1715 he began to write for the Théâtre de la foire, the comic opera held in booths at festival time. According to one computation he produced, either alone or with others, about a hundred pieces, varying from strings of songs with no regular dialogues, to comediettas only distinguished from regular plays {{by the introduction of}} music. He was also industrious in prose fiction. Besides finishing Gil Blas he translated the Orlando innamorato (1721), rearranged Guzman d'Alfarache (1732), published two more or less original novels, Le Bachelier de Salamanque and Estevanille Gonzalez, and in 1733 produced the Vie et aventures de M. de Beauchesne, which resembles certain works of Daniel Defoe. Besides all this, Lesage was also the author of La Valise trouvée, a collection of imaginary letters, and of some minor pieces including Une journée des Parques. He did not retire until 1740, when he was more than seventy years of age; he and his wife went to live with his second son, who was a canon at Boulogne-sur-Mer. Lesage's eldest son, Louis-André, had become an actor, and Lesage had disowned him. Lesage's last work, Mélange amusant de saillies d'esprit et de traits historiques les plus frappants, appeared in 1743.|$|E

[...] Huston explored the use of [...] "stylistic framing", especially well-planned close-ups, in much of his directing. In his first film, The Maltese Falcon, for instance, Huston sketched out all of his scenes beforehand, [...] "like canvases of paintings". His daughter, Anjelica Huston adds that even for his subsequent films, he sketched storyboards [...] "constantly". She agrees that for her father, [...] "it was a form of study, and my father was a painter, a very good one."

2500|$|Good {{friends in}} real life, Fred Allen and Jack Benny {{inadvertently}} hatched a running gag in 1937, {{when a child}} prodigy, violinist Stuart Canin, gave a very credible performance on the Allen show, inspiring an Allen wisecrack about [...] "a certain alleged violinist," [...] who should hide in shame over his poor playing. Allen often mentioned his show-business friends on the air ("Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts" [...] was Allen's way of saying hello to his pal Jack Haley), and on the Canin broadcast Allen knew Benny would be listening. Benny, according to Allen biographer Taylor, burst out laughing, then responded in kind on his own program.

The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has been monitoring the violence between Boko Haram and Nigerian armed forces {{as part of a}} preliminary investigation. It has stated that {{there is reason to believe}} that Boko Haram is responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity and that the violence between Boko Haram and the armed forces has reached the level of an armed conflict of non-international character under international law. This paper assesses certain types of behaviour of Boko Haram from an Islamic law perspective and examines whether Islamic law condemns or justifies such acts. Arguably, it would help the ICC in asserting the legitimacy of its judgments, if it was able to prove that such judgments are compatible with the legal and belief system recognised by the actors at trial. In turn it would enable the Court to deal with at least some of the criticism aimed <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>for</b> being <b>an</b> imperialistic institution...|$|R

40|$|Most of today’s voting {{protocols}} {{are vulnerable}} to coercion and votebuying because they allow the voter to carry away a “receipt ” which proves what vote he has cast. We take a look <b>at</b> what <b>it</b> means <b>for</b> <b>a</b> protocol to be receipt-free. Unfortunately, no uniform definition for this concept exists today. Even worse, definitions used in literature are often far too simple to capture and treat all relevant aspects adequately. Important in this respect is the precise relationship of voter, adversaries and authorities {{as well as the}} inherent differences between coercion and vote-buying. We argue why we consider vote-buying to be the more dangerous attack. We show why existing protocols offering receipt-freeness are not useful <b>for</b> real-life elections. <b>A</b> short overview of the most prominent protocols is given. Finally two practical models where receipt-freeness is possible proposed. We sketch ideas of how protocols for these models could be constructed...|$|R
