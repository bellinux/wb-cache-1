25|$|The Thermal wind is {{wind that}} varies with height {{due to a}} balance between the Coriolis and pressure-gradient forces in the atmosphere. It is the primary {{physical}} mechanism for the jet stream and {{plays an important role in}} other large-scale atmospheric phenomena. The thermal wind ensures the jet stream is typically strongest in the upper half of the troposphere, which is the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>layer</b> extending from the surface of the planet up to a height of 12 km to 15 km.|$|E
25|$|Mars {{lost most}} of its {{magnetic}} field about four billion years ago. As a result, solar wind and cosmic radiation interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere. This keeps the atmosphere thinner than it would otherwise be by solar wind action constantly stripping away atoms from the outer <b>atmospheric</b> <b>layer.</b> Most of the historical atmospheric loss on Mars {{can be traced back}} to this solar wind effect. Current theory posits a weakening solar wind and thus today's atmosphere stripping effects are much less than those in the past when the solar wind was stronger.|$|E

25|$|Evolution of {{potential}} novae begins with two main sequence {{stars in a}} binary system. One of the two evolves into a red giant, leaving its remnant white dwarf core in orbit with the remaining star. The second star—which may be either a main sequence star or an aging giant—begins to shed its envelope onto its white dwarf companion when it overflows its Roche lobe. As a result, the white dwarf steadily captures matter from the companion's outer atmosphere in an accretion disk, and in turn, falls into the atmosphere. As the white dwarf consists of degenerate matter, so the accreted hydrogen does not inflate, but its temperature increases. Runaway fusion occurs when the temperature of this <b>atmospheric</b> <b>layer</b> reaches ~20million K, initiating nuclear burning, via the CNO cycle.|$|E

2500|$|Venera 4 ( [...] meaning Venus 4), also {{designated}} 1V (V-67) s/n 310 was a probe in the Soviet Venera {{program for}} the exploration of Venus. In 1967 {{it was the first}} successful probe to perform in-place analysis of the environment of another planet. It may also have been the first probe to land on another planet, with the fate of its predecessor Venera 3 being unclear. Venera 4 provided the first chemical analysis of the Venusian atmosphere, showing it to be primarily carbon dioxide with a few percent of nitrogen and below one percent of oxygen and water vapors. The station detected a weak magnetic field and no radiation field. The outer <b>atmospheric</b> <b>layer</b> contained very little hydrogen and no atomic oxygen. The probe sent the first direct measurements proving that Venus was extremely hot, that its atmosphere was far denser than expected, and that it had lost most of its water long ago.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} reasons to expect that climate changes, from {{whatever}} cause, may be enhanced in the Arctic, relative to the mid-latitudes and tropics. First, is the ice-albedo feedback, whereby an initial warming causes snow and ice to melt, exposing darker surfaces that absorb more sunlight, leading to more warming. Second, because colder air holds less water vapour than warmer air, in the Arctic, a greater fraction of any increase in radiation absorbed by the surface goes directly into warming the atmosphere, whereas in the tropics, a greater fraction goes into evaporation. Third, because the Arctic temperature structure inhibits vertical air motions, {{the depth of the}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>layer</b> that has to warm in order to cause warming of near-surface air is much shallower in the Arctic than in the tropics. Fourth, a reduction in sea-ice extent will lead to more energy being transferred from the warm ocean to the atmosphere, enhancing the warming. Finally, changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns caused by a global temperature change may cause more heat to be transferred to the Arctic, enhancing Arctic warming ( [...] 2004).|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two methods}} of naming clouds in their {{respective}} layers of the atmosphere; Latin and common. [...] Cloud types in the troposphere, the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>layer</b> closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names due to the universal adaptation of Luke Howard's nomenclature. Formally proposed in 1802, it became {{the basis of a}} modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms that appear in any or all of three altitude levels (formerly known as étages). [...] These physical types, in approximate ascending order of convective activity, include stratiform sheets, cirriform wisps and patches, stratocumuliform layers (mainly structured as rolls, ripples, and patches), cumuliform heaps, and very large cumulonimbiform heaps that often show complex structure. [...] The physical forms are divided by altitude level into ten basic genus-types. [...] The Latin names for applicable high-level genera carry a cirro- prefix, and an alto- prefix is added to the names of the mid-level genus-types. [...] Most of the genera can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. New high {{temporal}} and spectral resolution observations of BW Vul are presented. The line doubling phases, occurring twice per pulsation cycle during the velocity discontinuities, are interpreted {{in terms of}} shock waves. The first and largest doubling is seemingly due {{to the formation of}} a shock wave during the supersonic infalling motion of the atmosphere. The famous observed stillstand would be only the last phase of the ballistic motion which seems marked by a small bounce of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>layers</b> on the photosphere. Then, a new shock wave, probably initiated by the iron κ-mechanism, sweeps the layers upward.
