5|$|Passing {{from these}} {{historic}} examples {{we find the}} chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it stood {{at the head of}} the lord’s table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed with a key.|$|E

25|$|World {{ratios for}} {{silver and gold}} were {{significantly}} different, gold being generally valued much higher than silver, at about 15 to 16 weights of silver for 1 weight of gold.

25|$|The Naassenes {{had one or}} {{more books}} out of which Hippolytus of Rome largely quotes in the Philosophumena, which professed to contain heads of discourses communicated by James, the brother of Jesus, to Mariamne.

The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, James W. Hyatt succeeded Roswell P. Flower as president. Just {{before the}} take over plans were started {{to build the}} final stretch from South Norwalk to Belden's Point. This would give the {{railroad}} a direct connection with New York City and other points along the Sound by means of ferries. Construction started quickly and on July 4, 1882, the pier was opened. The new pier was an enormous boost to traffic on the line. Trains were running 24 hours a day. Just after completion of the pier James W. Hyatt was succeeded by F. St. John Lockwood. The new pier made the D <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> railroad to take over. On October 1, 1886, the D would become the Danbury & Norwalk Division of the Housatonic Railroad, {{by means of a}} 99-year lease. This was eight years after the first proposal by the Housatonic Railroad.|$|E

25|$|The {{specialized}} {{structures of}} the plant reveal <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> coevolution and symbiosis between these two species. A recent study performed by Céline Leroy et al. (2008) revealed many characteristics that the plant has adapted to support the ants. First, the domatia are located next to the stems that the ants use for hunting. Second, they contain extrafloral nectaries and food bodies to feed the ants {{if they do not}} have other sources of food. Third, there are less chloroplasts found inside of the domatia, which means that it has a lower photosynthetic capacity. Fourth, stomata were found inside of the domatia, although at a lower density, possibly to capture the carbon dioxide from the ants’ respiration taking place inside. Finally, there was a greater deposit of cellulose found in the domatia, which would result in a thicker cell wall and a more rigid surface to support the weight of the ants. These findings show that the areas destined to become domatia are inherited and a result of coevolution; they were solely produced to support this specific species of ant.|$|E
25|$|As of 1997–98, {{in terms}} of Public Schools, in the Tolagnaro area there are 109 Primary schools, {{with an average of}} 42 {{students}} per teacher. There are 5 CEGs and 1 Lycee. The Amboasary region has an additional 73 Primary schools, 4 CEGs, but no Lycees. In terms of private schools, the Tolagnaro region has 33 Primary schools, with an average of 50 students per teacher. There are 3 Secondary (1st cycle) and 3 Secondary (2nd cycle) schools. Amboasary has 30 Primary schools, but just 1 Secondary school (1st cycle). Unfortunately, some of the Primary Schools in rural Anosy are in such poor state of repair they've been closed, with the nearest operating school up to 20km away. One of the organizations working {{to increase the number of}} schools in this area, with the support of external funding, is Azafady. For an explanation of a school they've built in the Mahatalaky area with the support of the Peretti Foundation, see.

25|$|The BC Express began {{a weekly}} round trip service from Fort Gorge to Tête Jaune Cache, {{carrying}} capacity loads of freight and passengers. The passenger fare was $35, meals and berths extra, and the freight rate was $80 a ton. This latter seemed quite costly, until the shipper investigated the alternative shipping method, which was shipping his cargo by scow for $70 a ton, with {{no guarantee that}} the shipment would arrive intact, or at all. The risk to scows was mostly at the Grand Canyon, and the deadly whirlpool within it, which was responsible for the loss of at least eighty lives that summer alone, as well as the loss of approximately one in ten scows, and thousands of dollars of merchandise. Needless to say, the BC Express did a brisk business that season, often grossing $12,000 on a single trip. She was the only sternwheeler to offer freight and passenger service to the general public, as the Operator and Conveyor were strictly used for hauling their own workers and supplies needed for rail construction. The BC Express also had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> season in 1913 and many stories of what occurred that summer were told and retold for years afterwards.|$|E

25|$|A short {{distance}} past {{the church is}} Nutgrove Avenue, widened and extended during the 1960s to link up with Churchtown. The old quiet tree shaded avenue has been completely swept away, along with the narrow lanes a cramped passage bounded on both sides by towering walls and full of right angled bends, which wended its crooked course between Loreto Convent cemetery and the garden of Nutgrove House. A massive gateway stood {{at the entrance to}} this avenue until about 1911, which bore the inscription Nutgrove School Established 1802. In 1839 the school was under the supervision of Mr. Philip Jones, who continued to hold the post of principal until 1866 when the position was held by Mrs. Anne Jones. In 1876 the school closed down and the house was occupied as a private residence by various tenants down to recent years becoming the parish councilheadquarters. The new avenue was laid through the former school grounds and the house, shorn of its ornamental gardens, stood with its front against the footpath. At some time the house had been disfigured with a rather unsightly concrete porch and the old brickwork covered with cement plaster, concealing {{the fact that this was}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> eighteenth century building containing a fine stairs and coved ceilings with good plaster decoration. Unfortunately the house fell into very bad repair and eventually was demolished. Joyce in his Neighbourhood of Dublin states that this house was at one time the dower house of Rathfarnham Castle but in this he is almost certainly mistaken, as Frizell's map of 1779 shows that it was outside the estate. It is possible that he confused it with the other old house on the opposite side of the avenue which was formerly named Ely Cottage, later altered to Ely Lodge, and which was shown to be within the boundary of the estate. This house was in very bad repair but has recently been restored in a very tasteful manner.|$|E
25|$|Russell then {{discovered}} that Gottlob Frege had independently arrived at equivalent definitions for 0, successor, and number, and {{the definition of}} number is now usually {{referred to as the}} Frege-Russell definition. Russell drew attention to Frege's priority in 1903, when he published The Principles of Mathematics (see below). The appendix to this work, however, described a paradox arising from Frege's application of second- and higher-order functions which took first-order functions as their arguments, and Russell offered his first effort to resolve what would henceforth {{come to be known as}} the Russell Paradox. Before writing Principles, Russell became aware of Cantor's proof that there was no greatest cardinal number, which Russell believed was mistaken. The Cantor Paradox in turn was shown (for example by Crossley) to be a special case of the Russell Paradox. This caused Russell to analyse classes, for it was known that given any number of elements, the number of classes they result in is greater than their number. This in turn led to the discovery of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> class, namely, the class of all classes. It contains two kinds of classes: those classes that contain themselves, and those that do not. Consideration of this class led him to find a fatal flaw in the so-called principle of comprehension, which had been taken for granted by logicians of the time. He showed that it resulted in a contradiction, whereby Y is a member of Y, if and only if, Y is not a member of Y. This has become known as Russell's paradox, the solution to which he outlined in an appendix to Principles, and which he later developed into a complete theory, the Theory of types. Aside from exposing a major inconsistency in naive set theory, Russell's work led directly to the creation of modern axiomatic set theory. It also crippled Frege's project of reducing arithmetic to logic. The Theory of Types and much of Russell's subsequent work have also found practical applications with computer science and information technology.|$|E
