5|$|The {{game was}} played on 18 November on an icy pitch (straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before), which nearly caused the game to be cancelled. The All Blacks kicked off, and had {{the best of the}} first ten minutes. Scotland {{eventually}} got a scrum near the All Blacks goal-line, and after winning the scrum, passed to Ernest Simson, who dropped a goal to put Scotland ahead 4–0. It {{was the first time the}} All Blacks had been behind on tour. The All Blacks replied with a try under the posts, which was unconverted. A second try was then scored, by Smith; again it went unconverted. Scotland then scored an unconverted try, to lead at half time 7–6. With less than ten minutes to go the score remained 7–6 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the All Blacks might lose their first match on tour. However, with four minutes to go the All Blacks had a scrum on halfway; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for a try. Bill Cunningham then scored a try with seconds remaining, and the All Blacks were victorious 12–7.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Sun would {{match their}} 2005 record <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a return {{trip to the}} Finals was certain. Mike Thibault {{received}} the WNBA Coach of the Year Award, and it appeared as if no team could stop the Sun. All five starters were named to the WNBA Eastern Conference All-Star team: Katie Douglas, Margo Dydek, Taj McWilliams-Franklin, Nykesha Sales and Lindsay Whalen. This feat {{had never before been}} achieved in WNBA history. In the playoffs, the Sun would quickly sweep the Washington Mystics. But in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sun were upset by the Detroit Shock, 2 games to 1, on the Sun's home floor.|$|E
25|$|Several {{events leading}} up to TripeManía XVII put the {{participation}} of Jack Evans, Konnan and Silver King in question. The Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission had suspended both Evans and Konnan {{as a result of a}} backstage fight between the two and Juventud Guerrera <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> neither would be allowed to appear at the show. While AAA kept promoting Evans as a participant the plans to have Konnan wrestle in the main event were changed early on, giving him a less active role on the show in case the Commission suspended him. The suspension was lifted on both wrestlers in the weeks leading up to Triplemanía XVII.|$|E

25|$|India {{made a bad}} start, {{falling to}} 3/73. The middle order scored fluently, with Mohammed Azharuddin, (64 from 74 balls, 7 fours) top scoring. Before Azharuddin was removed lbw by Eddie Hemmings, India were at 5/204, needing 5 runs an over from the last 10 overs, with 5 wickets in hand, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> {{it would be a}} very close game. However, the middle and tailend order for India collapsed, as India lost 5/15. India were {{eventually}} bowled all out for 219 (all out, 45.3 overs), giving England both a berth in the final and a measure of revenge for the loss they suffered to India in the semifinal of the World Cup four years earlier in England.|$|E
25|$|Soon, {{the only}} things keeping most {{passenger}} trains running were legal obligations. Meanwhile, companies {{who were interested in}} using railroads for profitable freight traffic were looking for ways to get out of those legal obligations, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> intercity passenger rail service would soon become extinct in the United States beyond a few highly populated corridors. The final blow for passenger trains in the U.S. came with the loss of railroad post offices in the 1960s. On May 1, 1971, the federally funded Amtrak took over (with a few exceptions) all intercity passenger rail service in the continental United States. The Rio Grande, with its Denver-Ogden Rio Grande Zephyr and the Southern with its Washington, D.C.–New Orleans Southern Crescent chose to stay out of Amtrak, and the Rock Island, with two intrastate Illinois trains, was too far gone to be included into Amtrak.|$|E
25|$|The Dynamo {{then had}} to face New York Red Bulls who had bested them {{during the regular season}} in all three meetings, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> they would thrash the Dynamo in the playoffs as well after the Red Bulls jumped out to a 2–0 lead during the first leg in Houston. Ricardo Clark was able to get on the board at the 50', and Omar Cummings, {{recently}} returned to full form, scored in stoppage time to complete the Dynamo exciting comeback. The 2nd leg in New York proved to be just as exciting. Bradley Wright-Phillips put the Red Bulls in the series lead again in the 23', but Brad Davis punished a mistake from the Red Bull defense to level the score before the half. Enter Omar Cummings for a second time, and for a second time, he scored a thrilling stoppage time goal to put the Houston Dynamo into the Conference Championship for the 3rd consecutive year.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 160s, Fronto's {{son-in-law}} Victorinus was stationed as a legate in Germany. He {{was there with}} his wife and children (another child had stayed with Fronto and his wife in Rome). The condition on the northern frontier looked grave. A frontier post had been destroyed, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> all the peoples of central and northern Europe were in turmoil. There was corruption among the officers: Victorinus had to ask for the resignation of a legionary legate who was taking bribes. Experienced governors had been replaced by friends and relatives of the imperial family. Lucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus, a distant relative of Hadrian, was in Upper Pannonia, succeeding the experienced Marcus Nonius Macrinus. Lower Pannonia was under the obscure Tiberius Haterius Saturnius. Marcus Servilius Fabianus Maximus was shuffled from Lower Moesia to Upper Moesia when Marcus Iallius Bassus had joined Lucius in Antioch. Lower Moesia was filled by Pontius Laelianus' son. The Dacias were still divided in three, governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators. The peace could not hold long; Lower Pannonia did not even have a legion.|$|E
25|$|Nick Barmby {{marked his}} 500th career {{appearance}} {{against one of}} his former clubs as Middlesbrough visited Hull City for the first ever top-flight match between the two sides. Hull lined up with former Boro captain George Boateng in midfield after his departure during the summer. The previous four league meetings between the two sides had all ended in 0–0 draws, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the match was heading for another until Tuncay opened the scoring on 79 minutes. Boro's lead didn't last long however, as Bernard Mendy's shot hit the post and rebounded off of goalkeeper Ross Turnbull to go down as an own goal. It got worse for the visitors as just a few minutes later, Hull were awarded a soft penalty when Wheater tangled with Geovanni – a challenge which also saw the Middlesbrough defender receive a red card. TV replays showed that Geovanni was offside when the ball was played to him, but nothing was awarded by the assistant referee. Marlon King converted the penalty to give Hull a 2–1 victory.|$|E
25|$|The rivalry {{began when}} the Red Wings {{switched}} divisions for the 1981–82 season. The rivalry would develop in the late 80's when they had intense division battles. In 1988, the Red Wings would defeat the Blues in five games in the Norris division final. The rivalry really heated up in the 90's. In 1991, the Blues would defeat the Red Wings in 7 games in the Norris division semi-finals after overcoming a 3–1 deficit. They would meet up in the playoffs three straight times between 1996–98; all three, which the Red Wings won. However, the Blues almost defeated the Red Wings in 1996. They held a 3–2 advantage <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the Blues would upset the Wings in Game 6, but the Wings would win {{the last two games}} including a double overtime victory in Game 7. This would also be part of the 1997 and 1998 Stanley Cup runs. When the Divisions realigned in 1998, this was the most intense rivalry in the Central division as they had many division battles until the 2004 season. They met during the playoffs in 2002 in the conference semifinals. The Red Wings defeated the Blues in five games as part of their 2002 Stanley Cup run. The rivalry instantly died in the post lockout as the Blues entered a slump, only reviving as the teams fought for the Central Division title in the 2011–12 season. The rivalry died for good after Detroit moved to the Eastern Conference during the 2013 realignment.|$|E

500|$|Lovering {{appeared}} in the 2006 documentary loudQUIETloud, which covered the Pixies' 2004 reunion tour. His father died midway during the tour, and Lovering began drinking heavily as a result. According to Thompson, Lovering [...] "messed {{up a couple of}} songs" [...] during a number of live shows. [...] "It was all caught on film", said Thompson, [...] "but they re-edited this to look like it happened in the middle of our tour <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> this whole tour careened into this drunken stupor with David. It really wasn't like that at all". He toured with the Pixies throughout 2005 and 2006, while performing at the Magic Castle on Friday nights with The Unholy Three. In 2007, Lovering played a benefit concert for Wally Ingram as part of The Martinis. Later that year, he formed a new band called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with Los Angeles musicians Amit Itelman and Oscar Rey.|$|E

2500|$|Saigh's {{tenure as}} sole owner was short-lived. Several {{questionable}} tax practices—including the tax dodge {{he had used}} to buy the Cardinals—came to light in April 1952, and he pleaded no contest to two lesser counts of tax evasion. [...] Under pressure from Commissioner Frick, and with a 15-month prison sentence looming, Saigh put the Cardinals up for sale rather than face certain expulsion from baseball. For a time, no credible offers surfaced from St. Louis interests, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the Cardinals would indeed be forced {{to move out of}} town. The most promising offer came from a consortium of businessmen in Houston, Texas. The Cardinals owned the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League; under major-league rules of the time, they also held the major-league rights to Houston. [...] The only question was whether Buffalo Stadium could be upgraded to major-league standards.|$|E
2500|$|Bahraini {{human rights}} groups and {{opposition}} parties have heavily criticized recruiting mercenaries in the Bahraini security forces. Nabeel Rajab said [...] "They're told {{they are going to}} go to a holy war in Bahrain to kill some non-Muslims or kafir [...] or Shias ... And those are maybe responsible for a lot of killing and a lot of systematic torture and human rights violations committed in the past months and years". Michael Stephens, of the Royal United Services Institute linked recruiting mercenaries in the Bahraini security forces to the lack of government confidence in its own citizens. [...] "So they rely on foreign recruits to unquestioningly carry out orders of violently suppressing protests", he said. Bruce Riedel, a leading American expert on South Asia said [...] "when the very serious demonstrations began <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the regime might even be toppled at a certain point, their hiring of mercenaries went up substantially".|$|E

Savage then joined with Nash and others to form the nWo Wolfpac, a split from Hogan's group. Savage went on to feud with both Hart and Roddy Piper.|$|E

Another passenger, Dan Copeland, said: 'an officer jumped on the door to my left and screamed, [...] "Everybody out!" [...] People just froze in their seats cowering for a few seconds and then leapt up. As I turned out the door on to the platform, I heard four dull bangs.' Menezes's cousin Alex Pereira, who lived with him, asserted that Menezes had been shot from behind: 'I pushed my way into the morgue. [...] They wouldn't let me see him.

[...] The quartet built a maximum lead of ten minutes, Jones grabbed the intermediate sprint points, and Dempster was first atop the Mesa Grande (cat. 4). The latter was dropped on the slopes of Palomar Mountain, a ten mile long challenge featuring a 4,5% average slope, which Jones crested first. The leading group, now reduced to a trio, cooperated on the twisting descent and on the flatter sections afterward, until they tackled the last categorized difficulty, the Cole Grade. The Canadian Marsh Cooper was unable to follow the pace on the short but steep climb, as Stemper and Jones powered away.

2500|$|Many boxing pundits {{felt that}} an aging Morales, {{fighting}} {{a couple of}} divisions above his best weight, stood little chance against the hard hitting Maidana. However, Morales turned back the clock and gave his best performance since beating Pacquiao. The opening bell saw Maidana jump on the older Morales. Morales' eye was badly swollen {{in the first round}} by a series of hard shots, especially a devastating uppercut, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the rout was on. However, Morales held his own through the next few rounds before rallying in the 8th–10th rounds. Although Maidana was using combos to hurt [...] "El Terrible," [...] Morales started turning the tide mid-fight, throwing very heavy counter-punches and almost knocking Maidana down. However, just when the fight seemed within Morales' grasp, Maidana took over by throwing combos, giving him the final rounds of the fight. Morales put up a valiant effort, performed better than anyone thought possible, won the crowd over and gave the boxing public another [...] "Fight of the Year" [...] candidate. However, it just wasn't enough. In the end, Maidana's youth and Morales' age and mileage were just too much to overcome, and Maidana eked out a majority decision victory with scores of 114–114 and 116–112 twice.|$|E
