The DMPC interviewed Formby about three songs that had been included in Bell-Bottom George: [...] "Swim Little Fish", [...] "If I Had a Girl Like You" [...] and [...] "Bell-Bottom George". Formby was summoned to the BBC's offices to perform his three songs in front of the committee, with his song checked against the available sheet music. A week later, on 1 February, the committee met and decided the songs were innocuous, although Formby was told {{that he would have to}} get further clearance if the lyrics were changed. Bret opines that he had been the victim of a plot by a member of the Variety Artists' Federation, following Formby's scathing comments on entertainers who were too scared to leave London to entertain the troops. The comments, which appeared in the forces magazine Union Jack, were then widely reported in the press in Britain. The Variety Artists' Federation demanded that Formby release names, and threatened him with action if he did not do so, but he refused to give in to their pressure.|$|E

In 2006, she co-starred with Simon Baker in Something New, a romantic comedy; as Michelle Landau, the much younger wife of a Texas businessman (Larry Hagman) during the fourth season of the television series, Nip/Tuck; and in 2008 as Andrea in Tyler Perry's The Family That Preys. The film also features Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates; it was released in the U.S. on September 12, 2008. In an interview with NPR, Lathan said the script took a fresh approach to telling an interracial love story, by describing the internal conflict some African-American women confront {{when it comes to}} dating interracially. [...] "I feel like with black women, in a way, I feel like it has been harder for us to go there just in terms of culturally. I know that there's this statistic that says that like 13 percent of black men are in interracial relationships. And don't quote me on this, but it's like four percent or three percent of black women are in interracial relationships; and I think that says <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about,</b> <b>you</b> know, either black women's loyalty her black man or her either guilt about stepping outside of the race." ...|$|E

You can let the story and the dialogue support you if it's good. I had great people around me and I took from all the people who were around." [...] He also stated, when he compared Carroll O'Connor's character to his acting mentor's real-life persona: [...] "Carroll O'Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views.

40|$|Essential Italian Grammar is an {{up-to-date}} {{introduction to}} Italian grammar. You don't {{need to know}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> grammar before <b>you</b> start. Everything is explained simply {{and there are lots}} of examples to illustrate each point. Unlike more traditional grammars, Essential Italian Grammar is structured so that you can look up language forms according to what you want to say, even if you don't know the grammatical term for them. If you already know some grammar, then you can use the 'reference grammar' section at the back of the book to look up the points you need. The course consists of 22 units illustrating the various uses to which the language can be put, for example, giving instructions or talking about the recent past. The more traditional reference grammar deals with grammatical structures, such as the imperative or the perfect tense. All grammatical terms are explained in the glossary at the back of the book. Each unit contains exercises for you to practise what you have learnt and there is a key at the back of the book for you to check your answers. The new page design in this edition means that the book is even easier to use and the main headings are in English so that you can find your way around the book quickly. This edition contains a 'taking it further' section which will direct you to further sources of real Italian. ...|$|R
40|$|I've been {{thinking}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> lately <b>about</b> how <b>you</b> issue commands from Java user interfaces {{and how we}} can use the Command design pattern to make this process simpler. Recall that these patterns we keep referring to are not just convenient abstractions, but catalogs of useful ways for objects to communicate. When you build a Java user interface, you provide menu items, buttons, checkboxes and so forth to allow the user to ell the program what to do. When a user selects one of these controls, the program receives an ActionEvent which it must trap by subclassing the actionPerformed event. Let's suppose we build a very simple program that allows you to select the menu items File | Open and File | Exit, and click on a button marked Red which turns the background of the window red. This program is shown in Figure 1 : Figure 1 The program consists of the File Menu object with the mnuOpen and mnuExit MenuItems added to it. It also contains one button called b nRed. A user action on any of these causes an actionPerformed event that we can trap with the following code: public void actionPerformed (ActionEvent e) { Object obj = e. getSource(); if (obj = = mnuOpen) fileOpen(); //open file if (obj = = mnuExit) exitClicked(); //exit from program if (obj = = btnRed) redClicked(); //turn red The three private methods that this method calls are just private void exitClicked() ...|$|R
