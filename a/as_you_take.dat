Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. [...] The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, [...] "one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, {{is that many of the}} things which can never be, often are".

50|$|One {{interesting}} little quirk to {{the game}} was that, {{it was possible to}} bomb your own ship <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> off from it.
