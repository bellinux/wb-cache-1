40|$|International audienceTime domain {{specifications}} such as overshoot, {{rise time}} and tracking behaviour can be extracted from an <b>amplitude</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response.</b> For uncertain systems we use for this an {{upper bound on}} the maximum <b>amplitude</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response.</b> There are tools which can compute this upper bound for each frequency in a grid. Computing this upper bound can be computational expensive when studying a large scale system hence {{it is interesting to}} have a low dense frequency grid. However, in such a case, it can for example occur that the maximum peak of the <b>amplitude</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> occurs at a frequency which is not in this grid. A consequence is that the overshoot will not be determined well for the system. In this paper we will present a method such that this can not occur. We will augment the uncertainty set with an additional uncertain parameter. This uncertain parameter will cover the frequencies which are not covered by the grid. This allows us to do a robustness analysis for a range of frequencies. In this case we are sure that we do not miss any crucial information with respect to the <b>amplitude</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> lying in between the frequencies in the grid. We illustrate this using two simulation examples...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review {{is to examine the}} {{literature}} that has investigated mechanomyographic (MMG) <b>amplitude</b> and <b>frequency</b> <b>responses</b> during dynamic muscle actions. To date, the majority of MMG research has focused on isometric muscle actions. Recent studies, however, have examined the MMG time and/or <b>frequency</b> domain <b>responses</b> during various types of dynamic activities, including dynamic constant external resistance (DCER) and isokinetic muscle actions, as well as cycle ergometry. Despite the potential influences of factors such as changes in muscle length and the thickness of the tissue between the muscle and the MMG sensor, there is convincing evidence that during dynamic muscle actions, the MMG signal provides valid information regarding muscle function. This argument is supported by consistencies in the MMG literature, such as the close relationship between MMG amplitude and power output and a linear increase in MMG amplitude with concentric torque production. There are still many issues, however, that have yet to be resolved, and the literature base for MMG during both dynamic and isometric muscle actions is far from complete.

40|$|Frequency {{response}} measurement on {{a transformer}} {{is a low}} voltage, off-line exercise. So, it virtually permits determination of any network/system function, by imposing any desired terminal condition for the nontested windings. The terminal conditions employed have significant influence on the achievable fault detection ability, and maximizing this ability should obviously {{be one of the}} main aims of frequency response measurements. Simply stated, this requirement translates to the ability to identify/measure as many natural frequencies as possible. However, there is a practical limitation that not all network/system functions can exhibit all natural frequencies. Hence, it is necessary to determine the most appropriate combination of terminal connection and system function for achieving this objective. Considering a two-winding transformer representation, system functions for different terminal conditions were computed. Depending on number of natural frequencies distinguishable in the <b>amplitude</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> of a system function, each measuring condition was ranked.
