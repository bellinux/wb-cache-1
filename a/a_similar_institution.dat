After establishing the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), Clark was invited {{by the government}} of Japan to establish <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>institution,</b> the Sapporo Agricultural College (now the University of Hokkaido). Clark's fame persists in Japan where he is a household name due to the revolutionary western ideas he brought to Hokkaido and the influence he had {{on the development of the}} island. His military experience during the Civil War was an important factor in earning the respect of his Japanese superiors.|$|E
25|$|The 1680s saw the {{congregation}} grow significantly and finally gain a strong {{foothold in the}} city of Québec. The new bishop in the colony, Jean-Baptiste De La Croix de Saint-Vallier, had been impressed with the vocational school that Bourgeoys had established in Ville-Marie and worked with her towards establishing <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>institution</b> in Quebec. A large number of sisters were also brought to Île d'Orléans to help the growing community in that area.

The orphanage was set up to educate the daughters of Scottish Presbyterian soldiers and Indian Navy Seamen. The success of the Scottish Female Orphanage led to the establishment of <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>institution</b> for boys known as the Orphanage for the Sons of Presbyterians in 1857. In 1859, the Scottish Female Orphanage and the Orphanage for the Sons of Presbyterians were merged to form The Bombay Presbyterian Male and Female Orphanage. In 1863, the name of the institution was altered to the Bombay Scottish Orphanage. On 18 February 1867, the first general meeting of subscribers to the Bombay Scottish Orphanage Trust was held.|$|E

Scholars who chose to investigate the Underground State were also confronted {{with the issue of}} its uniqueness (no country or nation has ever created <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>institution),</b> and hence, the problem of defining it. Polish historian Stanisław Salmonowicz, discussing the historiography of the Polish Underground State, defined it as a [...] "collection of state-legal, organizational and citizenship structures, which were to ensure constitutional continuation of Polish statehood on its own territory". Salmonowicz concluded that [...] "This constitutional continuity, real performance of the state's functions on its past territory and the loyalty of a great majority of Polish society were the most significant elements of its existence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Notably, Straucher {{received}} {{support from}} Yiddishist scholar Nathan Birnbaum, who spoke {{in his favor}} at Jewish National Party caucuses during the 1907 Austrian elections. Together with Diamant and Birnbaum, Straucher organized the first Conference for the Yiddish Language, held in Czernowitz between August 31 and September 3, 1908. The initial demand was for the proceedings {{to be held at}} the Jewish House, but the Conference was ultimately hosted by <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>institution</b> of the local Ukrainians and the local Music Society. The reason for this failure is disputed: some attribute it to opposition from the [...] "Hebraist" [...] adversaries, others suggest that Straucher was in reality unconvinced about the Conference platform, sabotaging his own Yiddishist campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Interested in the idea, Raguet {{approached}} associates, Richard Peters, Clement C. Biddle and Thomas Hale {{on creating}} <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>institution</b> in Philadelphia. A meeting {{was held on}} November 25 to discuss the plan. A total of twelve men agreed {{to work together to}} form the bank. Along with Raguet, Peters, Biddle, and Hale, the other men, called associate founders, were Charles N. Bancker, Andrew Bayard, Samuel Breck, John McCrea, William Schlatter, John C. Stocker, John Strawbridge and Roberts Vaux. Over several meetings the group figured out the bank's structure and positions. Andrew Bayard was elected the first president of the bank during the third meeting on November 28. The bank was named the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society because Raguet felt the name [...] "bank" [...] was unpopular and calling it a society would make it easier to receive a charter from the state legislature.|$|E
2500|$|Development soon spread eastwards {{along the}} East Cliff, {{and one of}} the first {{buildings}} there was Donaldson and Wilkes' Library (1798). [...] This later took the name Tuppen and Walkers' Library. [...] It occupied a site between Charles Street and Manchester Street. [...] Donaldson became the Prince of Wales's official librarian and bookseller in 1806. [...] Other contemporary libraries situated along the East Cliff were the New Steine Library, Pollard's on Marine Parade and Parsons' on the same road. [...] The Royal Marine Library, meanwhile, faced the Chain Pier and kept telescopes for visitors to look out to sea. [...] The focal point for these early libraries, though, remained the Steine, North Street and the square that linked them, Castle Square. [...] In this area were the Castle Square Circulating Library; Eber's; Minerva; Folthorp's; Large's; Loder's; and Wright and Son's Royal Colonnade Library, Music Saloon and Reading Rooms. [...] Loder's Library specialised in scientific publications and had 20,000 volumes, and Wright and Son stocked 8,000. [...] It also kept national newspapers and British and foreign journals and periodicals. [...] Raggett's Subscription House stood opposite Baker's Library on the north side of St James's Street and was <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>institution.</b> [...] Several of these libraries struggled financially in the 1780s, and some proprietors diversified into other activities to try to keep them open.|$|E

60|$|So far the King of Scots {{had succeeded}} in {{awakening}} martial fire in the boy, but he found him less the companion in other matters than he had intended. When at Paris, James would have taken him to explore the learned hoards of the already venerable University of Paris, where young James Kennedy--son to Sir James Kennedy of Dunure, and to Mary, an elder sister of the King--was studying with exceeding zeal. Both James and Dr. Bennet were greatly interested in this famous abode of hearing--the King, indeed, was already sketching out designs {{in his own mind}} for <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>institution</b> in Scotland, designs that were destined to be carried out after his death by Kennedy; and Malcolm perforce heard many inquiries and replies, but he held aloof from friendship with his clerkly cousin Kennedy, and closed his ears as much as might be, hanging back as if afraid of returning to his books. There was in this some real dread of Ralf Percy's mockery of his clerkliness, but there was more real distaste for all that appertained to the past days that he now despised.|$|E
60|$|In France, {{where the}} mere {{will of the}} {{government}} could accomplish greater changes, the consequence of an enlarged spirit of scientific discovery was, that a decisive stop was put to the witch-prosecutions which had heretofore been as common in that kingdom as in England. About the year 1672 {{there was a general}} arrest of very many shepherds and others in Normandy, and the Parliament of Rouen prepared to proceed in the investigation with the usual severity. But an order, or arret, from the king (Louis XIV.), with advice of his council, commanding all these unfortunate persons to be set at liberty and protected, had the most salutary effects all over the kingdom. The French Academy of Sciences was also founded; and, in imitation, a society of learned Germans established <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>institution</b> at Leipsic. Prejudices, however old, were overawed and controlled--much was accounted for on natural principles that had hitherto been imputed to spiritual agency--everything seemed to promise that farther access to the secrets of nature might be opened to those who should prosecute their studies experimentally and by analysis--and the mass of ancient opinions which overwhelmed the dark subject of which we treat began to be derided and rejected by men of sense and education.|$|E
