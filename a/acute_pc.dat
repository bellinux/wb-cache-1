40|$|The role {{of cardiac}} nerves on {{development}} of myocardial tissue injury after acute coronary occlusion remains controversial. We investigated whether acute cardiac decentralization (surgical) modulates coronary flow reserve and myocardial protection in preconditioned dogs subject to ischemia-reperfusion. Experiments {{were conducted on}} four groups of anesthetised, open-chest dogs (n = 32) : 1 - controls (CTR, intact cardiac nerves), 2 - ischemic preconditioning (PC; 4 cycles of 5 -min IR), 3 - cardiac decentralization (CD) and 4 - CD+PC; all dogs underwent 60 -min coronary occlusion and 180 -min reperfusion. Coronary blood flow and reactive hyperemic responses were assessed using a blood volume flow probe. Infarct size (tetrazolium staining) was related to anatomic area at risk and coronary collateral blood flow (microspheres) in the anatomic area at risk. Post-ischemic reactive hyperemia and repayment-to-debt ratio responses were significantly reduced for all experimental groups; however, arterial perfusion pressure was not affected. Infarct size was reduced in CD dogs (18. 6 ± 4. 3; p = 0. 001, data are mean ± 1 SD) compared to 25. 2 ± 5. 5 % in CTR dogs and was less in PC dogs as expected (13. 5 ± 3. 2 vs. 25. 2 ± 5. 5 %; p = 0. 001); after <b>acute</b> CD, <b>PC</b> protection was conserved (11. 6 ± 3. 4 vs. 18. 6 ± 4. 3 %; p = 0. 02). In conclusion, our findings provide strong evidence that myocardial protection against ischemic injury can be preserved independent of extrinsic cardiac nerve inputs...|$|R

Pre-SCT host immune-microenvironment and changes of B cell homeostasis could influence GVH- and Graft-versus-Tumor reactions.

40|$|The authors {{report on}} their {{personal}} experience with percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) in 36 cases of <b>acute</b> cholecystitis (AC). <b>PC</b> was successful in 34 cases, improving the clinical condition of the patients within the first hour following treatment and normalizing the laboratory data within 24 - 48 hours. Twenty-seven patients with calculous AC underwent cholecystectomy within 4 - 15 days. In 6 cases (3 calculous and 3 acalculous ACs) PC was the only treatment performed; in one case (calculous AC) PC was combined with lithotomy, the stone fragments being extracted via the cholecystostomy. According to literature reports, to date PC has been performed mainly [...] {{as an alternative to}} surgical cholecystostomy [...] on the patients unsuitable for cholecystectomy due to their age or to severe impairment of their conditions.

40|$|Surrogate {{reports by}} {{patients}} about their relatives, and vice versa, are potentially of great use {{in studies of}} the genetic and environmental causes of the familial aggregation of cancer. To assess the quality of such information in a family study of melanoma aetiology in Queensland, Australia, the authors compared surrogate reports with self-reports of standard melanoma risk factors obtained by mailed self-administered questionnaire. There was moderate agreement between surrogate reports provided by the cases and relatives' self-reports for questions on ability to tan (polychoric correlation coefficient (pc) = 0. 60), skin colour (pc = 0. 57), average propensity to burn (pc = 0. 56), and hair colour at age 21 (kappa coefficient = 0. 55), although relatives in the extreme risk factor categories were misclassified by surrogates {{at least half of}} the time. Agreement was lower for questions on degree of moliness (pc = 0. 45), tendency to <b>acute</b> sunburn (<b>pc</b> = 0. 42), and number of episodes of painful sunburn (pc = 0. 23). The quality of relatives' surrogate reports about cases was similar to that of cases' surrogate reports about relatives. Cases who reported a family history of melanoma provided better surrogate information than did cases who indicated no family history, and female cases provided better surrogate reports than did males. Cases were better able to report for their parents and children than for their siblings. The authors conclude that when the use of surrogate reports of melanoma risk factors is unavoidable, results should be interpreted cautiously in the light of potentially high rates of misclassification. In particular, surrogate reports appear to be a comparatively poor measure of self-assessment of number of moles, the strongest known phenotypic indicator of melanoma risk, and may bias comparisons between families with and without a history of melanoma...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{success in}} treatment of early stage localized prostate cancer (<b>PC),</b> <b>acute</b> inadequacy of late stage PC treatment and its inherent heterogeneity poses a formidable challenge. Clearly, an improved understanding of PC genesis and progression {{along with the}} development of new targeted therapies are warranted. Animal models, especially, transgenic immunocompetent mouse models, have proven to be the best ally in this respect. A series of models have been developed by modulation of expression of genes implicated in cancer-genesis and progression; mainly, modulation of expression of oncogenes, steroid hormone receptors, growth factors and their receptors, cell cycle and apoptosis regulators, and tumor suppressor genes have been used. Such models have contributed significantly {{to our understanding of the}} molecular and pathological aspects of PC initiation and progression. In particular, the transgenic mouse models based on multiple genetic alterations can more accurately address the inherent complexity of PC, not only in revealing the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and progression but also for clinically relevant evaluation of new therapies. Further, with advances in conditional knockout technologies, otherwise embryonically lethal gene changes can be incorporated leading to the development of new generation transgenics, thus adding significantly to our existing knowledge base. Different models and their relevance to PC research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} multi-centre {{retrospective}} survey from the United Kingdom to evaluate the aetiology and diagnostic performance of tryptase in anaphylaxis during general anaesthesia (GA). Data were collected retrospectively (2005 - 12) from 161 patients [mean[*]±[*]standard deviation (s. d.), 50 [*]±[*] 15 years] referred to four regional UK centres. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were constructed to assess the utility of tryptase measurements in the diagnosis of immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated anaphylaxis {{and the performance of}} percentage change from baseline [percentage change (PC) ] and absolute tryptase (AT) quantitation. An IgE-mediated cause was identified in 103 patients (64 %); neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) constituted the leading cause (38 %) followed by antibiotics (8 %), patent blue dye (6 %), chlorhexidine (5 %) and other agents (7 %). In contrast to previous reports, latex-induced anaphylaxis was rare (0 · 6 %). A non-IgE-mediated cause was attributed in 10 patients (6 %) and no cause could be established in 48 cases (30 %). Three serial tryptase measurements were available in 34 % of patients and a ROC analysis of area under the curve (AUC) showed comparable performance for PC and AT. A[*]≥[*] 80 % PPV for identifying an IgE-mediated anaphylaxis was achieved with a PC of > 141 % or an AT of > 15 · 7 [*]mg/l. NMBAs were the leading cause of anaphylaxis, followed by antibiotics, with latex allergy being uncommon. Chlorhexidine and patent blue dye are emerging important health-care-associated allergens that may lead to anaphylaxis.

40|$|Approximately 30 % of {{the general}} {{population}} suffers from insomnia. Given that insomnia causes many problems, amelioration of the symptoms is crucial. Recently, we found that a nonessential amino acid, glycine subjectively and objectively improves sleep quality in humans who have difficulty sleeping. We evaluated the effects of glycine on daytime sleepiness, fatigue and performances in sleep-restricted healthy subjects. Sleep was restricted to 25 % less than the usual sleep time for three consecutive nights. Before bedtime, 3 g of glycine or placebo were ingested, sleepiness and fatigue were evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and a questionnaire, and performance were estimated by personal computer (PC) performance test program on the following day. In subjects given glycine, the VAS data showed a significant reduction in fatigue and a tendency toward reduced sleepiness. These observations were also found via the questionnaire, indicating that glycine improves daytime sleepiness and fatigue induced by <b>acute</b> sleep restriction. <b>PC</b> performance test revealed significant improvement in psychomotor vigilance test. We also measured plasma melatonin and the expression of circadian-modulated genes expression in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to evaluate the effects of glycine on circadian rhythms. Glycine did not show significant effects on plasma melatonin concentrations during either the dark or light period. Moreover, the expression levels of clock genes such as Bmal 1 and Per 2 remained unchanged. However, we observed a glycine-induced increase in the neuropeptides arginine vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the light period. Although no alterations in the circadian clock itself were observed, our results indicate that glycine modulated SCN function. Thus, glycine modulates certain neuropeptides in the SCN and this phenomenon may indirectly contribute to improving the occasional sleepiness and fatigue induced by sleep restriction...|$|R
40|$|Ashish Shah, Dmitriy N FeldmanGreenberg Division of Cardiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USAAbstract: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death in the US. For {{patients}} with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), urgent reperfusion of the culprit arterial occlusion, often achieved via primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), reduces post-MI mortality and other major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Adjunctive antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies are used during PCI to reduce MACE rates. Currently, a variety of antithrombotic options are available for peri-procedural use. The most commonly used agents include unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin &plusmn; glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI). These agents reduce the rates of peri-procedural ischemic and thrombotic events, though these benefits come at the cost of an increase in bleeding complications. Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor with a short half-life and linear pharmacokinetics, which results in predictable serum concentrations and anticoagulant effect. Bivalirudin has emerged as an efficacious and safe alternative to heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in both stable coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome patients. In the HORIZONS-AMI trial, monotherapy with bivalirudin was compared with the combination of heparin and a GPI in a large population of patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI. Bivalirudin treatment was associated with improved event-free survival at 30 days and reduced rates of major bleeding. Based on the results of the trial, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines have incorporated recommendations for bivalirudin use in the setting of STEMI. Recently, 3 -year follow-up data from the HORIZONS-AMI cohort were published, demonstrating sustained benefits in patients treated with bivalirudin, including reduced rates of mortality, cardiovascular mortality, reinfarction, and major bleeding events. These results further support the use of bivalirudin in the setting of primary PCI for STEMI given that its benefits are maintained through long-term follow-up.

40|$|Chlorisondamine (CHL) blocks {{behavioural}} {{responses to}} nicotine {{for several weeks}} or months in rats. Persistent blockade has also been demonstrated ex vivo, in assays of nicotine-evoked striatal dopamine release. Central administration of [3 H]-CHL leads to long-term retention of radiolabel in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and in few other cell groups. We investigated whether an analogous blockade also occurs in noradrenergic neurons {{in the brain and}} in cultured pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells, which have a similar noradrenergic phenotype. Administration of CHL (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 s. c. or 10 [*]μg i. c. v.), 21 days prior, resulted in a near-total block of nicotine-evoked release of hippocampal [3 H]-noradrenaline ([3 H]-NA) from superfused rat synaptosomes; NMDA-evoked [3 H]-NA release was unaffected. Three weeks after administration of [3 H]-CHL (10 [*]μg i. c. v.), preferential accumulation of radiolabel was observed in the locus coeruleus, which provides the entire noradrenergic innervation to hippocampus, as well as in previously noted structures. In rat pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells, nicotine evoked [3 H]-NA release (EC 50 approximately 30 [*]μM). This effect was blocked by co-incubation with mecamylamine (10 [*]μM) or CHL (1 [*]μM) but was not affected by α-bungarotoxin. As in the hippocampus, the nicotinic agonist cytisine was at least as efficacious as nicotine. <b>Acute</b> exposure of <b>PC</b> 12 cells to CHL 10 or 100 [*]μM (but not 1 [*]μM), followed by 90 [*]min wash-out, almost completely blocked release evoked by 30 [*]μM nicotine. More prolonged (24 [*]h) exposure to CHL 100 [*]μM (but not 1 or 10 [*]μM), followed by 3 days of wash-out, partially inhibited release evoked by nicotine, leaving responses to high K+ unchanged. A significant (30 %) reduction was also seen 5 days after exposure. We conclude that persistent nicotinic blockade by CHL is neither restricted to mesostriatal dopamine neurons, nor to the CNS, nor to neurons possessing the same nicotinic receptor pharmacology. In addition, the persistent blockade does not appear to result from an acute blocking action, but may be dependent upon intracellular accumulation of the antagonist...|$|R
40|$|Increasing human {{exposure}} to brominated flame retardants (BFRs), including the widely used polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), raises concern about possible neurotoxicity in humans, particularly through developmental exposure. Recently, also several hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs) {{have been detected}} in human serum and cord blood. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate mechanisms underlying previously observed behavioral impairments in rodents after neonatal exposure to BFRs. Effects of neonatal exposure to the environmentally relevant BDE- 47 on a form of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), were investigated in mice. After exposure to BDE- 47, LTP and several hippocampal postsynaptic proteins were reduced, without presynaptic effects. Nonetheless, modest increases of vesicular catecholamine release as well as basal and depolarization-evoked intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) were observed in PC 12 cells when acutely exposed to a high concentration of BDE- 47, by using amperometry and imaging of the fluorescent Ca 2 +-sensitive dye Fura- 2, respectively. To investigate differences in neurotoxic potential, acute in vitro effects of PBDEs and metabolites as well as HBCD on vesicular catecholamine release and basal and depolarization-evoked [Ca 2 +]i were also investigated. No effects on basal or depolarization-evoked [Ca 2 +]i were observed during exposure to BDE- 49, BDE- 99, BDE- 100, BDE- 153 or methoxylated BDE- 47. <b>Acute</b> exposure of <b>PC</b> 12 cells to 6 -OH-BDE- 47 induced vesicular catecholamine release, which coincided with a transient increase in [Ca 2 +]i observed shortly after the onset of exposure. To investigate possible structure-activity relationships, the effects of other OH-PBDEs on [Ca 2 +]i were also investigated in PC 12 cells. All OH-PBDEs induced Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores, although with different lowest-observed-effect concentrations (LOECs). It was found that the major intracellular Ca 2 + sources were either endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or both ER and mitochondria. Lower LOECs were observed for some OH-PBDEs when investigating fluctuations in [Ca 2 +]i. OH-PBDEs and HBCD dose-dependently inhibited depolarization-evoked [Ca 2 +]i. For OH-PBDEs, this inhibition was potentiated by preceding increase in basal [Ca 2 +]i. The inhibition appeared more sensitive to Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores than to influx of extracellular Ca 2 +, suggesting involvement of Ca 2 +-dependent regulatory processes close to voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels. In a heterogeneous in vitro model for neurodevelopment, human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), BDE- 47 and 6 -OH-BDE- 47 also increase [Ca 2 +]i. In these cells, LOECs of both BDE- 47 and 6 -OH-BDE- 47 are an order of magnitude lower compared to in PC 12 cells, suggesting a higher sensitivity for disturbance of [Ca 2 +]i in hNPCs. In summary, a reduction of LTP together with changes in postsynaptic proteins in the mouse hippocampus could be related to the neurobehavioral effects of PBDEs. OH-PBDEs are more potent in disturbing [Ca 2 +]i and neurotransmitter release compared to BDE- 47 or methoxylated BDE- 47. Shielding of the OH-group on both sides with large atomic groups lowers the potency of OH-PBDEs. Besides increasing basal [Ca 2 +]i, OH-PBDEs inhibit depolarization-evoked [Ca 2 +]i, depending on preceding basal [Ca 2 +]i. HBCD inhibits depolarization-evoked [Ca 2 +]i and neurotransmitter release. The findings in this research indicate that bioactivation by oxidative metabolism adds considerably to the neurotoxic potential of PBDEs, raising concern for the developing brain. Therefore, oxidative metabolism {{should be included in the}} risk assessment for (developmental) neurotoxicity by PBDEs in human...|$|R
