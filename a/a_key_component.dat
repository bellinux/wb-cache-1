It is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>component</b> and emergent tree in the endangered central semi-evergreen vine thickets—also known as bottletree scrub—of the Queensland Brigalow Belt. Remnant trees are often left by farmers on cleared land for their value as shade and fodder trees.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of the South Dakota economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still {{very important to the}} state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state.

5|$|Florida State placekicker Sebastian Janikowski, who {{was born}} in Poland, also was <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of the Seminoles' scoring offense. In his career at Florida State prior to the Sugar Bowl, Janikowski made 65 of 83field goal attempts, {{including}} 33 of his previous 38kicks of less than 50yards. Janikowski also handled kickoffs, kicking the ball so hard that 57 of his 83kickoffs were touchbacks. Janikowski was considered to have the potential to be an early selection in the 2000 NFL Draft by several scouts for professional teams.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E

5|$|Monsanto {{was already}} working on <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of the device. In April 1943, Robert Serber had {{proposed}} {{that instead of}} relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the bomb should be triggered by a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources were radium-beryllium and polonium-beryllium. The later was chosen as it had a 140-day half life, which made it intense enough to be useful but long-lived enough to be stockpiled. Thomas brought in Monsanto {{to work on the}} development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the urchin detonators.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} the supply of {{palladium}} and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into less noxious substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor). Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, groundwater treatment, and jewelry.

Two tubulin beta-4 chain {{proteins}} are encoded {{in the human}} genome by the genes TUBB4A (this entry) and TUBB4B. Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>components</b> of the cytoskeleton. It binds two moles of GTP, one at an exchangeable site on the beta-chain and one at a non-exchangeable site on the alpha-chain. TUBB4A is preferentially and highly expressed in the central nervous system.|$|R
5|$|The largest use of {{palladium}} {{today is}} in catalytic converters. Palladium {{is also used}} in jewelry, dentistry, watch making, blood sugar test strips, aircraft spark plugs, surgical instruments, and electrical contacts. Palladium {{is also used to}} make professional transverse (concert or classical) flutes. As a commodity, palladium bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and 964. Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum. Because it absorbs hydrogen, palladium is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Trade was <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of Maya society, {{and in the}} {{development}} of the Maya civilization. The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods, or portage routes. Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history. The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt. In the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in a flourishing slave trade with wider Mesoamerica.|$|E

He scored his first goal for England in a 5–0 victory over Albania at Wembley on 26 April 1989. He made his first start in the following game against Chile, and kept his first team place for most matches in the run in to the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He also played four games for the England B team.

5|$|In Philadelphia, Rollins {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as an excellent defensive shortstop. In July 2001, Rollins became the Phillies' leadoff hitter, a role he retained for almost ten years. He made three All-Star Game appearances early in his career. While a Phillie, Rollins compiled a 38-game hitting streak, which spanned the end of the 2005 season and the start of the 2006 season, the longest in team history. Rollins was named the National League Most Valuable Player in 2007, as the Phillies won their division in the first of five consecutive seasons. He was also <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of the 2008 World Series champion team. In his final season with the Phillies, he became the franchise's all-time leader in hits. During the offseason, he was traded to the Dodgers for the 2015 season.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{is perhaps}} most closely {{associated}} outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In the Second (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks {{on the development of}} human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic and sanguine).|$|E

5|$|The first {{reported}} sighting of Lord Howe Island {{took place on}} 17 February 1788, when Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, commander of the Armed Tender HMS Supply, was en route from Botany Bay to found a penal settlement on Norfolk Island. On the return journey Ball sent a party ashore on Lord Howe Island to claim it as a British possession. It subsequently became a provisioning port for the whaling industry, and was permanently settled in June 1834. When whaling declined, the 1880s saw {{the beginning of the}} worldwide export of the endemic kentia palms, which remains <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of the Island's economy.

5|$|To win, {{the player}} must fight monsters {{to improve the}} characters' {{experience}} levels and get gold to buy better weapons and armor.
