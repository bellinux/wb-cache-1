5|$|Fucking Machines (also {{known as}} fuckingmachines.com and fuckingmachines) is a pornographic website founded in 2000 that {{features}} video {{and photographs of}} women engaged in autoerotic sexual stimulation with penetrative sex-machines and sex toys. Based in San Francisco, California, the site is operated by Kink.com. Web entrepreneur Peter Acworth launched Fucking Machines on September 25, 2000, as his company's second website after Kink.com. Devices shown on the site were created {{with the intent to}} bring women authentic orgasms. Performers were instructed to <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be recorded experiencing pleasure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} the Siberian Yupik people, killer whales are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be killed.|$|E
5|$|John, like Basil II before him, was a {{slow but}} steady campaigner. His armies made careful, {{measured}} gains over time, rarely exposing themselves to excessive risks, but nevertheless advancing inexorably towards their objectives. However, the Turks were resilient, {{and they did not}} <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be decisively defeated in any one engagement. They knew that it was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time, as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention.|$|E

5|$|Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and a German {{battalion}} from Banja Lukaabout 10,000 soldiersattacked the Partisan-held {{territory in}} Kozara on 18August 1941. The enemy troops {{broke through the}} Partisan front line and penetrated into the area. They burnt houses and looted cattle and grain in the villages. Some of the villagers became demoralised, and blamed the Partisans for their losses; some placed white flags on their houses. The Partisan units retreated deeper into forested areas in the mountains. Stojanović led the Kozara Detachment toward Lisina, the highest peak of Kozara. In the evening, he assembled his men {{and told them that}} they were in the army of the KPJ and all peoples of Yugoslavia, so they could not <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be attached to any specific village or area. He advised those who could not detach themselves from their homes to lay down their weapons and leave. Several men left the detachment, which then moved toward Lisina where they organised a camp and spent some time in military training and political indoctrination. The attack of 18August was the first counter-insurgency operation in Kozara, and the Partisans emerged from it without significant losses.|$|E
5|$|Kỳ {{specifically}} said {{nine or ten}} {{other officers}} should be dismissed for involvement in the coup, but refused to identify who he had in mind. Some observers accused Kỳ and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before putting it down in order to embarrass Khánh and <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to gain prominence and prestige on the political stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the northern town of Da Nang, claimed that during a meeting with Kỳ and Thi {{a few days before}} the coup, the officers had discussed their plans for overthrowing Khánh. Another conspiracy claim was propagated by General Trần Văn Đôn, who conjectured that Khánh had tried to provoke or bait rival generals, such as Khiêm, into revolting against him so he could defeat and remove them from the scene, thereby strengthening himself and boosting his political image.|$|E

25|$|A {{feral cat}} is a cat that lives {{outdoors}} {{and has had}} little or no human contact. They do not <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be handled or touched by humans, and will run away if they are able. They typically remain hidden from humans, although some feral cats become more comfortable with people who regularly feed them. Even with long term attempts at socialization, feral cats usually remain fearful and avoidant of humans.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure they}} {{would win the}} Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham (with reports {{suggesting}} that the opposition would <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be easily beaten to prevent their deadly local rivals Arsenal from retaining the title), but Tottenham took an early lead in the match. Beckham scored the equaliser with a curling strike from 25 yards out into the top left corner of the goal and United {{went on to win}} the match and the league.|$|E

25|$|Their first {{threat was}} {{the return of}} the Red Skull- more specifically, a clone of the Skull created in 1942 and kept in stasis in the event of the original's death- who usurped Professor X's body to provide himself with telepathic powers, which he would use to provoke {{citizens}} of New York into a mass assault against mutants, or anyone who could be one, and force the Scarlet Witch and Rogue to <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be attacked. With the help of the S-Man Honest John, he managed to even manipulate Thor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{behaviors}} are commonly observed among feral cats, {{although there is}} disagreement among veterinarians, rescuers, and researchers on the prevalence of some. In a free-roaming environment, feral cats avoid humans. They do not <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be handled or touched by humans, and back away or run when {{they are able to}} do so. If trapped, they may hiss, growl, bare their teeth, or strike out. They remain fairly hidden from humans and will not approach, although some feral cats gradually become more comfortable around humans who feed them regularly.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{government}} {{response to}} the drought and famine was the decision to uproot large numbers of peasants {{who lived in the}} affected areas in the north and to resettle them {{in the southern part of}} the country. In 1985 and 1986, about 600,000people were moved, many forcibly, from their home villages and farms by the military and transported to various regions in the south. Many peasants fled rather than <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be resettled; many of those who were resettled sought later to return to their native regions. Several human rights organizations claimed that tens of thousands of peasants died as a result of forced resettlement.|$|E

25|$|But years later, Valenzuela {{testified that}} Rizal had been {{favorable}} to an uprising {{as long as}} the Filipinos were well-prepared, and well-supplied with arms. Rizal had suggested that the Katipunan get wealthy and influential Filipino members of society on their side, or at least ensure they would stay neutral. Rizal had even suggested his friend Antonio Luna to lead the revolutionary forces since he had studied military science. In the event that the Katipunan was discovered prematurely, they should fight rather than <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be killed. Valenzuela said to historian Teodoro Agoncillo that he had lied to the Spanish military authorities about Rizal's true stance toward a revolution in an attempt to exculpate him.|$|E
25|$|For some time, Singh {{had been}} {{exploiting}} {{the power of}} drama {{as a means to}} inspire the revolt against the British, purchasing a magic lantern to show slides that enlivened his talks about revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil who had {{died as a result of}} the Kakori conspiracy. In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims. Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, Singh's plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly. The nominal intention was to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and the Trade Dispute Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were being enacted by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual intention was for the perpetrators to <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be arrested so that they could use court appearances as a stage to publicise their cause.|$|E
25|$|Drift diving {{occurs when}} the divers <b>allow</b> <b>themselves</b> to be {{conveyed}} past the bottom by the prevailing current, minimising the effort required to cover a relatively large distance, but moving the divers away from the start position and making their surfacing position uncertain. The usual way of monitoring {{the position of a}} group is by the lead diver towing a surface marker buoy, and the divers of the group all following the dive leader. The dive boat follows the buoy at a distance where the lookouts can see if any diver surfaces near the buoy. Divers from the group either surface along the buoy line, or if there is current shear or they are separated from the group, deploy their own DSMB and surface on that. Groups of inexperienced divers may be escorted by a second divemaster who tries to keep them together, directs stragglers back to the dive leader, and keeps track of remaining gas. Divers may be formally grouped in buddy pairs, surfacing together when the first is low on gas, or more informally, and rely on the divemasters if they have a problem.|$|E
