50|$|The <b>ashy</b> <b>minivet</b> (Pericrocotus divaricatus) is a {{passerine}} bird {{of eastern}} Asia {{belonging to the}} minivet genus Pericrocotus in the cuckooshrike family Campephagidae. While most of the minivets have shades of yellow, orange and red in their plumage, this species has only greys, whites and blacks. The male is distinctive with a white face and black nape although females can {{be confused with the}} female of the brown-rumped minivet. They forage in the canopy, often along with other minivets and join mixed-species foraging flocks.|$|E
50|$|It breeds in {{south-east}} Siberia, north-east China, Korea and Japan. Birds in the Ryūkyū Islands {{of southern}} Japan are commonly {{considered to be}} a separate species - Ryukyu minivet (P. tegimae). The <b>ashy</b> <b>minivet</b> is a long distance migrant, wintering in South and South-east Asia as far south as Sumatra, Borneo and the Philippines. It is found in forest as well as in more open areas with scattered trees. It forages in the tree canopy for insects sometimes joining mixed-species foraging flocks. Migrant birds can often be seen in large flocks.|$|E
50|$|Other {{significant}} sightings {{during the}} survey included {{those of the}} large hawk cuckoo (Cuculus sparverioides), broad-billed roller (Eurystomus orientalis) and <b>ashy</b> <b>minivet</b> (Pericrocotus divaricatus). About half of the large mammals found in Kerala are reported from Chimmony Wildlife Sanctuary, especially some of the globally threatened species such as tiger (Panthera tigris), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and wild dog (Cuon alpinus). Other red-listed species found here include the Indian giant squirrel (Ratufa indica) and the endemic primates-lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), Nilgiri langur (Trachypithecus johnii) and slender loris (Loris lydekkerianus). There are 39 species of mammals, 160 species of birds, 25 species of reptiles, 14 species of amphibians, and 31 species of fishes are reported from the sanctuary.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} show the {{population}} trend of forest and wetland summer visitors to Japan, field observations, literature surveys, and questionnaire surveys were conducted in 1995 - 1997. Field observations and literature surveys showed {{that the number of}} seven species of summer visitors drastically declined in some areas of Japan: Black Paradise Flycatchers Terpsiphone atricaudata, <b>Ashy</b> <b>Minivets</b> Pericrocotus divaricatus, Yellow-breasted Buntings Emberiza aureola, Ruddy Kingfishers Halcyon coromanda, Brown Hawk Owls Ninox scutulata, Jungle Nightjars Caprimulgus indicus, and Porzana Crakes Porzana fusca. These seven species were the focus of questionnaires sent {{to the members of the}} Wild Bird Society of Japan. It was shown that all these species declined in many areas of Japan during the past 25 years, although the pattern of decline varied somewhat by species. Serious habitat destruction and deterioration did not occur in half of the study areas of six forest and grassland species. Longterm observation records showed that in many areas the number of species decreased in summer visitors but did not change or increased in residents. It seems that the population decline of summer visitors is mostly associated with habitat destruction in their wintering areas of Southeast Asia...|$|R
50|$|Among the birds, the <b>ashy</b> drongo, scarlet <b>minivet,</b> grey-headed canary-flycatcher, white-crowned forktail, brown fish owl, crested serpent eagle, shikra, velvet-fronted nuthatch, blue-throated barbet, {{coppersmith}} barbet, blue-winged leafbird, brown-cheeked fulvetta and red junglefowl deserve mention. The Khun Tan mountains also act as {{a natural}} barrier for species west and east of the range, such as the pied bushchat.|$|R
5000|$|The bird {{sanctuary}} {{is a popular}} destination for bird-watchers and hikers in the Mumbai area. The sanctuary is home to over 222 species birds of which 161 are resident species, 46 are winter migrant species, three are breeding migrants, seven species are passage migrants and five species are vagrant. Following eight species endemic to Western Ghats {{has been found in}} Karnala: Grey-fronted Green-pigeon (Treron affinis), Nilgiri Woodpigeon (Columba elphinstonii), Malabar (Blue-winged) Parakeet (Psittacula columboides), Malabar Grey Hornbill (Ocyceros griseus), White-cheeked Barbet (Megalaima viridis), Malabar Lark (Galerida malabarica), Small Sunbird (Leptocoma minima) and Vigor's Sunbird (Aethopyga vigorsii).. Five rare birds, the <b>ashy</b> <b>minivet,</b> three-toed kingfisher, Malabar trogon, Slaty-legged Crake (Rallina eurizonoides), and Rufous-bellied Eagle (Lophotriorchis kienerii) have been sighted here[...] The sanctuary is also home to 114 species of butterflies.|$|E
50|$|The La Mesa Watershed {{comprises}} {{a variety}} of ecosystems {{that is home to}} many indigenous and endemic species of flora and fauna. Approximately 1800 ha are under forest cover and 300 ha are open areas, pastures and areas under cultivation. Several portions of the La Mesa reservoir are shallow with exposed mudflats, swampforest, reed and other swamp vegetation. Its forest serves as an important breeding area for {{a variety of}} wildlife species and birds such as the little heron, black-crowned night heron, osprey, Japanese sparrowhawk, plain bush-hen, common moorhen, Eurasian coot, Philippine coucal, Philippine nightjar, island swiftlet, spotted wood kingfisher, common kingfisher, white-collared kingfisher, Philippine pygmy woodpecker, barn swallow, pied triller, <b>ashy</b> <b>minivet,</b> Philippine bulbul, black-naped oriole, Oriental magpie robin, Arctic warbler, grey-streaked flycatcher, pied fantail, yellow-bellied whistler, grey wagtail, brown shrike, olive-backed sunbird, and lowland white-eye.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} was to determine and compare the density and diversity of water birds and terrestrial birds using distance sampling point count method at Paya Indah Wetland Reserve, Selangor Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 13872 bird individuals from 100 bird species were recorded in the wetland reserve. Out of the total, 25 (22. 26 % of all detections) and 75 (77. 74 % of all detections) bird species belong to water birds and terrestrial birds respectively. The results showed that total bird density of the wetland reserve is 83. 92 ± 4. 53 birds ha - 1 and ranged from 75. 40 - 93. 41 birds ha - 1 (95 % confidence interval). The terrestrial birds have higher density (70. 26 ± 4. 48 birds ha - 1) as compared to water birds (13. 09 ± 1. 78 birds ha - 1). The highest water bird density was recorded for Purple Swamphen (5. 05 ± 0. 89 birds ha - 1) and the lowest was Ballion's Crake (0. 31 ± 0. 13 birds ha - 1). The highest terrestrial bird density was recorded for Yellow-vented Bulbul (12. 97 ± 1. 05 birds ha - 1) and the lowest was <b>Ashy</b> <b>Minivet</b> (0. 31 ± 0. 18 birds ha - 1). The highest species diversity i. e. Shannon’s index (N 1 = 20. 83), species richness i. e. Margalef’s index (R 1 = 7. 97) and species evenness, i. e., McIntosh’s index (E = 0. 73) was recorded in terrestrial birds. This study indicated that Paya Indah Wetland Reserve is a highly important habitat and provides diverse food, shelter, nesting and roosting sites for water birds as well as terrestrial birds...|$|E
