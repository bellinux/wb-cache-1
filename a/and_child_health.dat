40|$|Background: Australia has a {{well-established}} universal <b>child</b> <b>and</b> family <b>health</b> service predominately staffed by specialist/qualified <b>child</b> <b>and</b> family <b>health</b> nurses. Two common and interrelated concerns are {{the need for}} nurses {{to be ready for}} practice after completing a nursing education program and the means to ensure ongoing nursing competence. Objective: To investigate the readiness of CFH nurses to practise after qualification and their continuing engagement with learning. Design: The study used an interpretive descriptive approach. Setting: This paper presents data from four questions from a larger survey of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> family <b>health</b> nurses across Australia. Participants: 1098 <b>child</b> <b>and</b> family <b>health</b> nurses responded to the survey. Method: Qualitative survey responses from the four education questions were analysed using inductive thematic content analysis. Results: Five significant themes were identified: hands-on experience (student clinical practice/placement); drawing on prior experience; learning on the job; learning (learning over time); and barriers to learning. Conclusion: This paper provides insights into nurses 2 ̆ 7 readiness for practice at the completion of a postgraduate <b>child</b> <b>and</b> family <b>health</b> nursing qualification and their maintenance of competence and specialist knowledge. It highlights: the need for clinical placement to be retained and enhanced; the significant contribution of more experienced <b>child</b> <b>and</b> family <b>health</b> nurses mentoring newly graduated <b>child</b> <b>and</b> family <b>health</b> nurses; the need for minimum education standards; the importance of reviewing education courses in relation to graduates 2 ̆ 7 readiness for <b>child</b> <b>and</b> family <b>health</b> nursing practice; the importance of supporting ongoing professional development; and the removal of barriers to accessing education opportunities...|$|R
