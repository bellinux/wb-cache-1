5|$|A {{mirror on}} the back wall {{reflects}} the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King PhilipIV(10) and Queen Mariana(11). The most common <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows {{their view of the}} scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{absolute}} {{minimum requirement}} of any body of Freemasons {{is that the}} candidate must be free, and considered to be of good character. There is usually an age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) capable of being overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge. The underlying <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the candidate should be a mature adult.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the filtering {{capacity of}} the lung has a threshold radius {{of the size of}} a red blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can pass to the arterial side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, bubbles grow to a larger size and remain trapped in the lung. This may explain why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the arterial circulation.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores how {{neoconservative}} ideology {{informed the}} Bush Administration’s interpretation/use of intelligence, {{leading to the}} decision to invade Iraq. The Administration based its decision to invade Iraq upon four neoconservative assumptions. The first <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Saddam Hussein’s regime {{was on the verge}} of acquiring nuclear weapons and had already amassed stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. The second <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the regime had meaningful links with Al Qaeda and had something to do with 9 / 11. The third <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> within Iraq, the regime’s fall would be followed by rapid and peaceful democratization. The fourth <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a similar democratic transformation would be precipitated elsewhere in the region. This paper examines primary source documents authored by key members of the Bush Administration (President Bush, VP Cheney, Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice). These accounts are compared to other relevant primary source documents such as the “ 9 / 11 Commission Report” and the “National Intelligence Estimate. ” In addition, the preexisting 9 / 11 ideology held by top officials in the Bush Administration that shaped the decision to invade Iraq is examined.

25|$|A more Catholic interpretation, less dualistic in its <b>assumptions,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the halo}} {{represents}} {{the light of}} divine grace suffusing the soul, which is perfectly united and {{in harmony with the}} physical body.|$|R
5|$|The {{instructions}} in Compendium ferculorum are succinct and often vague, lacking such elements of modern culinary recipes as lists of ingredients used, measurements or proportions, and cooking times. The underlying <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they are to}} be used by a professional chef rather than a person with little cooking experience. The recipe for stewed meat in saffron sauce, cited below, is typical is this regard.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected}} to hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E
30|$|In {{cases where}} the {{coefficient}} was equal to 0 between an independent variable and a dependent one, the <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> for the dependent value there was no correlation and hence {{it was to be}} excluded from the model.|$|R
50|$|The assassin class, a sub-class of {{the thief}} in first edition, was {{excluded}} from the second edition core rules. The <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> an assassin could be treated mechanically as a normal thief who simply specialized in assassination-related skills.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} some issues {{connected}} with the determination of optimal land use in rural areas. A method of Bajerowski was applied and two basic <b>assumptions</b> <b>were</b> made. The first <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> possible, {{on the basis of}} a set of 56 selected features, to initially determine the optimal function of a given rural area. The second <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the features selected and compiled in this set, represented, sufficiently adequately, the impact of all other features regarded essential for generating the optimal function of a given rural area. The described concept of optimal land use makes it possible to approach the methodology of determining the optimal state/mode of land use as one of the elements and a part of a study of conditions and trends in managing a rural gmina (commune) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E
5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E
5|$|It {{took some}} time before a Bishop of Lithuania was {{appointed}} because of various conflicts of interest. The Bishop of Gniezno appointed Vito (Lithuanian: Vitas), a monk of the Dominican Order, to this position, {{but he was not}} recognized by Mindaugas or accepted by the populace. The activities of Vito in Lithuania are unknown, although he is sometimes associated with Mindaugas' Cathedral. Finally, in 1254, Christian (Lithuanian: Kristijonas) from the Livonian Order was appointed. Mindaugas endowed him with some lands in Samogitia, but not much is known about his activities. Historical sources do not mention any sponsorship of missionaries, education of priests, or construction of churches during that time, and Bishop Christian went back to Germany in 1259, where he died in 1271. The establishment of Mindaugas' Cathedral remains problematic, but recent archeological research found the remains of a 13th-century brick building {{on the site of the}} present-day Vilnius Cathedral. The general <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the remains are those of Mindaugas Cathedral, built to satisfy the agreement with the pope. However, as later events showed, Lithuanians resisted Christianization, and Mindaugas' baptism had only a temporary impact on further developments.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{management}} practices aim {{to reduce the}} number of old, slow-growing fish, leaving more room and resources for younger, faster-growing fish. Most marine fish produce huge numbers of eggs. The <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> younger spawners would produce plenty of viable larvae.|$|R
50|$|The Gallows Corner Flyover, {{providing}} a free-flow link between Eastern Avenue and Southend Arterial Road, opened {{as a temporary}} link in 1969. The eventual <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the flyover would {{be replaced by the}} M12 motorway, which was never constructed.|$|R
50|$|An {{analysis}} made in 1979 {{estimated that}} trolleybuses {{will become more}} common worldwide and cheaper {{by the end of}} the 1980s due to larger production series. Another <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> diesel oil price will increase faster compared to electricity price.|$|R
25|$|Each meal {{provides}} about 1200Calories (5020.8kJ). They {{are intended}} to be eaten for a maximum of 21 days (the <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> logistics units can provide fresh food rations by then), and have a minimum shelf life of three years (depending on storage conditions).|$|E
25|$|Aircraft flight instruments, however, operate using {{pressure}} differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate {{this way because}} the stagnation pressure sensed by a Pitot tube is dependent on altitude as well as speed.|$|E
25|$|Around 1960, Ray Solomonoff {{founded the}} theory of {{universal}} inductive inference, {{the theory of}} prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. This theory is a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 1970s, {{the legal}} <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> once hospitalized, a patient had no role in {{treatment}} decisions. Hospitals could medicate and use other means of control or treatment without consultation with the patient or the patient's family.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{management}} practices aim {{to reduce the}} number of old, slow-growing fish, leaving more room and resources for younger, faster-growing fish.

5000|$|The key <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> science {{educational}} practices require systemic reform {{within the}} undergraduate science {{subject matter and}} education classes, prospective teachers’ field-based experiences, and professional development during new teachers induction years (NSF, 1993; NRC, 1997; Sunal, Wright, & Day, 2004.) ...|$|R
25|$|Qubes {{implements}} a Security by Isolation approach. The <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{there can}} be no perfect, bug-free desktop environment. Such an environment counts millions of lines of code, billions of software/hardware interactions. One critical bug in any of these interactions may be enough for malicious software to take control over a machine.|$|E
25|$|Biosemiotics is a {{relatively}} new discipline, inspired in large part by the discovery of the genetic code in the early 1960s. Its basic <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Homo sapiens is not alone in its reliance on codes and signs. Language and symbolic culture must have biological roots, hence semiotic principles must apply also in the animal world.|$|E
25|$|The general goal of {{the test}} is to provide data about {{cognition}} and personality variables such as motivations, response tendencies, cognitive operations, affectivity, and personal/interpersonal perceptions. The underlying <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> an individual will class external stimuli based on person-specific perceptual sets, and including needs, base motives, conflicts, and that this clustering process {{is representative of the}} process used in real-life situations.|$|E
50|$|Their {{military}} <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> without {{crops and}} people, the rebels could neither feed themselves nor raise new fighters. This attrition quickly began to bite, {{and it also}} meant that the Ulster chiefs were tied down in Ulster to defend their own territories.|$|R
50|$|In thermodynamics, {{the term}} (and its synonym, environment) {{is used in}} a more {{restricted}} sense, meaning everything outside the thermodynamic system. Often, the simplifying <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> energy and matter may move freely within the surroundings, and that the surroundings have a uniform composition.|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} <b>assumptions</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> foreign owned {{companies have}} strategic asset advantage which can cause, both, {{positive and negative}} effect on the host economy. The productivity gaps between foreign and domestic firms are related to ownership, however corrected for firm and industry characteristics some outcomes may differ...|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the traditionally followed approach of metabolic modeling using coupled ordinary differential equations, flux balance analysis requires very little information {{in terms of the}} enzyme kinetic parameters and concentration of metabolites in the system. It achieves this by making two assumptions, steady state and optimality. The first <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the modeled system has entered a steady state, where the metabolite concentrations no longer change, i.e. in each metabolite node the producing and consuming fluxes cancel each other out. The second <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the organism has been optimized through evolution for some biological goal, such as optimal growth or conservation of resources. The steady-state assumption reduces the system to a set of linear equations, which is then solved to find a flux distribution that satisfies the steady-state condition subject to the stoichiometry constraints while maximizing the value of a pseudo-reaction (the objective function) representing the conversion of biomass precursors into biomass.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} task in stochastic geometry network models is choosing {{a mathematical model}} for {{the location of the}} network nodes. The standard <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the nodes are represented by (idealized) points in some space (often Euclidean Rn, and even more often in the plane R2), which means they form a stochastic or random structure known as a (spatial) point process.|$|E
25|$|When {{decision}} making is emphasized, the objective of solving a multi-objective optimization problem is referred to supporting a decision maker in finding the most preferred Pareto optimal solution according to his/her subjective preferences. The underlying <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one {{solution to the problem}} must be identified to be implemented in practice. Here, a human decision maker (DM) plays an important role. The DM is expected to be an expert in the problem domain.|$|E
50|$|In February Shelbourne {{were forced}} to {{withdraw}} from the 2007 Setanta Sports Cup shortly before it was due to commence. The general <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the club would be unable to field a team. St. Patrick's Athletic were invited to fill the vacancy, and they duly accepted.|$|R
50|$|KNM ER 1805 is a {{specimen}} {{of an adult}} H. habilis made of three pieces of cranium dating to 1.74 million years old from Koobi Fora, Kenya. Previous <b>assumptions</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> this specimen belongs to H. erectus based {{on the degree of}} prognathism and overall cranial shape.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{the school}} started {{with a group of}} 10 Arabs and 10 Jews from the Wadi Ara area, as a {{reaction}} to the October 2000 riots. Their <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> joint education for their children would be an effective way to overcome violence and hatred.|$|R
