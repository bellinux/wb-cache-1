500|$|Writer Howard Gordon has {{expressed}} his disappointment with the episode, {{feeling that it}} was too similar to his earlier work on the episode [...] "Shadows", and finding that it was [...] "not done particularly interestingly". Series creator Chris Carter also felt that [...] "Born Again" [...] was [...] "just not one of [...] favorites", adding that he [...] "thought the direction was a little sloppy, but it's one of those episodes that plays a little closer to reality <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> about it".|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, Jones became romantically {{involved}} with mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins. They first met in 2005 when she appeared on Blue Peter {{and he was}} struck by how good she was with kids: [...] "You kind of think people like that are all going to be false, but she really wasn't at all, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> She really is lovely, a typical Neath girl." [...] It was reported they met after Jenkins sang [...] "Time to Say Goodbye" [...] with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli on an episode of Strictly Come Dancing, broadcast on 21 October 2007. Jenkins's spokesman has said: [...] "They're old friends and they've been on several dates. But people shouldn't consider buying hats just yet." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{started his}} {{campaign}} with {{little in the}} way of reserve cash. [...] "I won't let this distract me from my duties as a congresswoman," [...] Schmidt told The Cincinnati Enquirer upon McEwen's announcement. [...] "I have a job to do. I can't worry about this." [...] Anti-pornography activist Phil Burress told the Associated Press that a race between Schmidt and McEwen would be tough. [...] "They are two totally different types of personalities. Bob is a statesman, and I love that. Jean will get in your face in a heartbeat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> too," [...] said Burress. Also running were Deborah A. Kraus, who worked for the West Clermont school district's computer services department, and James E. Constable, who ran to protest the care his disabled son received from a state hospital.|$|E
5000|$|She married Jeffrey Archer in July 1966, having {{met him at}} Oxford University, where Jeffrey {{had been}} {{studying}} for a Diploma in Education. She has described Jeffrey as being [...] "fun, ebullient ... he was older than my contemporaries <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that.</b> He did things I'd never sort of done." ...|$|R

50|$|Writing in Drèents is {{and always}} will be a curious affair. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it <b>that</b> way. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the offbeat. It's what gives life an {{interesting}} twist.|$|R
500|$|Albert Brooks {{plays the}} foul-mouthed, morose Bernie Rose. When Refn {{suggested}} him, Gosling agreed, but thought the actor {{would not be}} up for playing a character who is violent and sullen, or for appearing in a film {{that he did not}} work on himself. Brooks accepted the role to go against type, and because he loved that Bernie was not a cliché. [...] "There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> the director was thinking outside of the box. For me, it was an opportunity to act outside the box. I liked that this mobster had real style. Also, he doesn't {{get up in the morning}} thinking about killing people. He's sad about it. Upset about it. It's a case of, 'Look what you made me do.'" ...|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} his legacy after being {{discharged}} from hospital, he said, [...] "There are very, very few people who are neutral about Jack MacDonald, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it <b>that</b> way".|$|R
5000|$|Producer David Foster {{approached}} Roger Donaldson {{to direct}} in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no {{as he did}} not want to do a remake. Then he read the script [...] "and <b>I</b> really <b>liked</b> it," [...] said Donaldson. [...] "And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that,</b> too. <b>I</b> saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{regards to}} the album as a whole, Amos surmised, [...] "I {{would say that it}} embraces the rebirth of light, but light means knowledge, light means consciousness. Everybody can attain that and have that in their life. Consider the idea that it’s inner God. It’s in every child that’s born; every child carries this ability within them. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> sentiment." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked by}} Ryan Seacrest in 2013 the {{favourite}} people he's produced for he said [...] "Definitely The Saturdays. Without a doubt. I {{had a lot}} of fun working with them and was really impressed with their voices. They were very down to earth <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> a lot in an artist. I wish them all the best in America and think they could end up as big as The Spice Girls." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy {{spoke about the}} inspiration for [...] "Dark Cousin", [...] "Well the episode {{is one of my}} favorites because I think it just has great performances and I really love what it's about. I love Franny [...] and she and I were presenting at the Creative Arts Emmys and I said, 'I think I have something really good for you, sort of the opposite of what you did last year.' She and Jessica [...] loved working together. So we came up with this character <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> she's around in all the individual stories at that pivotal moment of are you going to fight {{or are you going to}} die." [...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy. You could see why people would want her to kiss them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Greer grew up Catholic, {{although}} at age 10 she convinced her parents {{let her go}} to Presbyterian church as {{she thought she would}} be closer to God there, although the real reason was she thought there were cuter boys at that church. During a 2014 interview, Greer stated that she is no longer a practicing Catholic. [...] In 2014, she told Glamour, [...] "I had been wanting to try and learn how to meditate, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did research on the different types of meditation. TM seemed the easiest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> it wasn't religious in any way." ...|$|R

2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E

5000|$|Campbell {{explains}} {{the story of}} the volume's original mistitling in his 'Afterword' to the new edition, as follows: [...] "... I suggested The Inhabitant of the Lake. Derleth thought we might add and Other Unwelcome Tenants, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> too. Alas, when he sent Frank Utpatel instructions for the cover art, he misremembered the addition as and Less Welcome Tenants (perhaps with his own forthcoming Colonel Markesan and Less Pleasant Persons in mind). The title had to be changed to match the cover, though I felt few tenants could be less welcome than Glaaki. Now, for the first time ever, the book bears the chosen title. Welcome!" ...|$|R
