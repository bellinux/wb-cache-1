40|$|Background: The {{theoretical}} {{concept of}} existential/life positions describes person’s basic beliefs about oneself and others. Most of authors on TA postulated {{that every person}} has one of four possible basic life positions: I’m OK, you’re OK; I’m not OK, you’re OK; I’m OK, you’re not OK and I’m not OK, you’re not OK. The {{aim of this study}} was the authentication of Existential positions as theoretical concepts in Transaction Analysis, and it’s potential to discriminate clinical from non-clinical examinees, and paranoid from depressive examinees within the clinical population. Subjects and methods: The research conducted was co-relational. The sample belongs to the convenience sample type, and comprised 200 examinees, 100 from the non-clinical and 100 from the clinical population of adults. Results: The results of the research confirm a statistically significant difference between the non-clinical and clinical part of the sample in the examined theoretical concept. The “I am not OK” existential position is more expressed in the clinical part of the sample. The differences between the examinees with depressive and paranoid disorders indicate that the examinees with the depressive disorder are more likely to express the “I <b>am</b> not <b>OK,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> OK” and “I <b>am</b> not <b>OK,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not OK” Existential position. Conclusion: In general, we can infer that the assumptions which the research was aimed at testing received partial validation. Examinees from the clinical part of the sample have a statistically significantly higher score at the position “I am not OK”. Examinees with depressive characteristics have a more pronounced “I <b>am</b> not <b>OK,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not OK” position...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLife {{positions}} scale {{developed by}} Boholst in 2002 {{consists of four}} sub-dimensions and 24 items. The language adaptation of the scale was done by Ahmet R. Özpolat. The correlations between turkish and english forms used for language adaptation were found significant {{at the level of}} p<. 05, that is. 79 for the whole scale,. 77 for the I am Ok sub scale. For the sub scale I am not Ok, the result is. 69,. 76 for the <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>OK</b> subscale, and. 70 for the <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not <b>OK</b> subscale. During the reliability studies, the scale was applied to 370 university students at Erzurum Atatürk University. To determine the adequacy of the samples, the Kasier-Mayer-Olkin (KMO) value was observed and the result was. 89. The coefficient of {{the internal consistency of the}} items was (a). 84. Principal components factor analysis was also used for the construct validity and the data were subjected to varimax axis convert. Results showed that the scale displayed similar distribution to the original scale. The confirmatory factor analysis findings showed the following results (960. 94) sd (195) (χ 2 /sd= 4. 92), RMSEA (. 07) RMR (. 08) SRMR (. 07) GFI (. 97) AGFI (. 96) CFI (97). These findings verifies the correspondance of the original scale's structure. Therefore, it can be said that this scale can be appropriately used in the studies in Turkey to measure life positions...|$|R

40|$|The {{patient was}} a 13 -year-old female. Six years previously, she {{developed}} alopecia areata {{when her parents}} divorced. One year after that, the bald area drastically expanded when her mother remarried. She was treated at her local hospital; however, no improvement was observed. She then visited our hospital for examination. A bald patch was covering > 80 % of her head. Self Grow-Up Egogram indicated the basic interpersonal relationship stance of ‘I <b>am</b> not <b>OK,</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> OK'. We therefore implemented a transactional analysis approach to increase the patient's score on the Free Child subscale. New hair growth was observed after 6 months and the bald patch disappeared after 2 years. Our results suggest that this method could also be easily applied in a clinical setting by dermatologists...|$|R
