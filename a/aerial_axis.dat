The authors have demonstrated that the required accuracy of the angular inclination is achieved only in a relative phase mode, which is not always feasible. The application of filtering for measured parameters of navigation equipment has namely been used for planimetric coordinates. Filtering is performed using the second order Kalman filter. It has significant effect; thus, even at a speed of 1 rpm, there is no disruption in the autonomous coded mode; for the relative phase mode, the required accuracy is achieved at 3 rpm...|$|E

Estudou-se a anatomia de raízes, caules, folhas e escapos de espécies de Paepalanthus subseção Aphorocaulon. Estas plantas apresentam caules reduzidos com folhas em roseta, de onde crescem os paracládios (sistemas de inflorescências). As espécies apresentam raízes com epiderme unisseriada e córtex com células isodiamétricas. Tanto os caules reduzidos como os paracládios apresentam espessamento resultante da atividade do periciclo, denominado Meristema de Espessamento Primário (MEP). Ambos apresentam estrutura anatômica semelhante. Os escapos apresentam endoderme descontínua, periciclo sinuoso, o córtex apresenta costelas salientes (5 - 6). As folhas apresentam células epidérmicas alongadas no sentido longitudinal com paredes levemente espessadas, estômatos somente na face abaxial, com câmara subestomática especializada, feixes vasculares colaterais com bainha dupla. Essas estruturas anatômicas são comuns para as espécies da subseção Aphorocaulon.

40|$|Glandular trichomes play a {{major role}} in the {{morphological}} characterization of the Bignoniaceae. Due to their great diversity of forms and functions, this study aimed to inventory the glandular trichomes present in the <b>aerial</b> vegetative <b>axis</b> of Amphilophium magnoliifolium, Martinella obovata and Stizophyllum riparium, analyze their structure and register the participation of ants in these plants. Fresh samples from the nodal region, petiole and from medium to apical regions of the leaflet blade were fixed and processed according to usual methods in light and scanning electron microscopies. The glandular trichomes found were: peltate, capitate, stipitate, and patelliform/cupular. Peltate trichomes are the most abundant ones and present the most uniform distribution. Patelliform/cupular trichomes occur at specific regions, such as prophylls, leaflet blade and nodal regions. Martinella obovata is the only species that presents capitate and stipitate trichomes, which are widely distributed along the entire <b>aerial</b> vegetative <b>axis.</b> Ants were found in all species, mainly at nodal regions. The occurrence of the capitate-type trichome is reported for the first time to the genus...|$|R

40|$|As plantas do gênero Cordyline possuem estruturas caulinares peculiares geralmente chamadas de rizoma. Um autor do início do século XX sugeriu que havia uma relação entre esse órgão de Cordyline e o órgão formador de raiz de Selaginella. O termo rizóforo foi originalmente cunhado para Selaginella e significa ó̈rgão portador de raízesë também passou a ser aplicado aos órgãos caulinares subterrâneos de Vernonia, Dioscorea e Smilax e ao que tradicionalmente era chamado de raiz aérea em Rhizophora mangle. Recentemente admitiu-se que as estruturas de Cordyline fruticosa são rízóforos, mas nenhum estudo de desenvolvimento foi apresentado a fim de confirmar tal hipótese. Rizóforo é um caule com geotropismo positivo não originário da plúmula do embrião, presente em plantas com sistema caulinar bipolar de ramificação, isto é, a planta possui ramos aéreos, as quais tem geotropismo negativo e formam folhas, e ramos basais, os quais tem geotropismo positivo e formam raízes. Em Cordyline, os rizóforos se desenvolvem a partir de gemas laterais e possuem crescimento secundário do mesmo modo que o eixo aéreo. O espessamento do caule de Cordyline já foi amplamente analisado em sua porção aérea, mas trabalhos a respeito da porção caulinar subterrânea são mais escassos. Esse espessamento é resultado direto e indireto da atuação do periciclo. No corpo primário, o periciclo produz tecido {{vascular}} adicional aumentando o diâmetro do caule concomitante com a atividade meristemática da endoderme. O periciclo ainda é o responsável pela formação do MES, o qual proporciona o espessamento secundário e atua de maneira semelhante na porção aérea e no rizóforo, com pequena variação. A vascularização das raízes adventícias conecta-se à vascularização do caule pelo periciclo durante o crescimento primário e pelo MES durante o crescimento secundário. As características morfológicas e anatômicas do rizóforo estão diretamente relacionadas com uma maior produção de raízes, assim, sua principal função é o aumento da rizosfera. Outras funções importantes dessa estrutura é o acúmulo de reservas e a reprodução vegetativa. O presente estudo averiguou a natureza dos órgãos subterrâneos de Cordyline fruticosa, C. australis e C, spectabilis, através de estudos anatômicos e observações do desenvolvimento ontogenético. Plants of {{the genus}} Cordyline possess distinctive caulinar structures usually known as rhizomes. An author from {{the early twentieth century}} suggested that there was a relationship between this organ in Cordyline and the root-generating organ in Selaginella. The term rhizophore - meaning r̈oot-bearing organ-̈ was coined originally for Selaginella and was later applied to the subterranean stem organs of Vernonia, Dioscorea and Smilax and to the structures traditionally known as aerial roots in Rhizophora mangle. Recently, these structures in Cordyline fruticosa have been categorized as rhizophores, but this hypothesis has not previously been confirmed by any published developmental study. A rhizophore is a stem with positive geotropism which does not arise from the plumule of the embryo, and is present in plants with a stem system having bipolar branching, i. e. with aerial branches, which have negative geotropism and form leaves, and basal branches, which have positive geotropism and form roots. The rhizophores of Cordyline develop from lateral buds and have secondary growth of the same type as in the <b>aerial</b> <b>axis.</b> The stem thickening of Cordyline has already been extensively studied in its aerial parts, but there are few such studies regarding the subterranean part of the stem. This thickening is the direct and indirect result of the activity of the pericycle. In the primary body, the pericycle produces additional vascular tissue, which increases the diameter of the stem concomitant with the meristematic activity of the endodermis. The pericycle is also responsible for the generation of the STM, which provides the secondary thickening and functions in a similar way in the aerial stem and the rhizophore, with little variation. The adventitious roots vascular tissue are connected to the vascular system of the stem by the pericycle during primary growth and by the STM during secondary growth. The morphological and anatomical features of the rhizophore are directly related to an increased production of roots, and thus its main function is the rhizosphere expansion. Beside that, the rhizophore is important as a storage organ and vegetative reproduction. The present study investigated the structure of the subterranean organs of Cordyline fruticosa, C. australis and C. spectabilis by anatomical techniques and observations of their ontogenetic development...|$|E

The present work has as objective the study of the <b>aerial</b> vegetative <b>axis.</b> Stem is cylindrical and hairy, having five wings, which are arisen from their leaves. The blade shows the presence of uniseriate epidermis, which is covered by the cuticle of variable thickness; and non-glandular and glandular trichomes. The non-glandular trichomes are uniseriate and multicellular and have their apex cell in whip form, while the glandular trichomes are multicellular, uniseriate or biseriate. The mesophyll is dorsiventral with uni-stratified palisade parenchyma in most of the cases and lacunal parenchyma formed by three to four layers of irregular cells. Only one collateral vascular bundle occurs in the midvein. Stem in transversal section is covered by epidermis with trichomes similar to leaves; the cortex is constituted by a discontinuous area of angular collenchyma, which is followed by chlorophyll parenchyma. Vascular cylinder that is delimited by pericycle shows vascular bundles of collateral type. In the secondary structure, the periderm is originated from epidermal and subepidermal tissues. In vascular region, the fascicular cambium differs into secondary xylem and phloem, while interfascicular cambium produces sclerenchymatous tissue...|$|R
