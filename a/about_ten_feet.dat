25|$|The {{original}} {{site was}} bounded {{on three sides}} by an earthwork circular enclosure, <b>about</b> <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> high and encompassing a square mile. Occupation of Nanih Waiya and several smaller nearby mounds likely continued through 700 CE, the Late Woodland Period. The smaller mounds {{may also have been}} built by later cultures. As they have been lost to cultivation since the late 19th century and the area has not been excavated, theories have been speculation.|$|E
25|$|The uptown {{tracks are}} <b>about</b> <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> below the {{original}} grade {{at the point}} where they turn off. The old uptown express and local trackways that used to lead to the 42nd Street Shuttle are visible from the uptown local track. As the alignment of the original trackways curves into the old Grand Central station on the 42nd Street Shuttle, it passes through the rebuilt area for the proposed Grand Central station shuttle platform. From the public passageway, none of the original support columns and roof are visible, since they were removed in exactly this area to open the way for the unused shuttle station. The unused ramps leading from the 42nd Street Shuttle are still in place, just south of this station.|$|E

25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all know {{something}} about my trip and {{the condition of the}} country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is <b>about</b> <b>ten</b> <b>feet,</b> sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{discovery}} of the chalybeate spring in the area now known as The Pantiles in 1606, many local landowners attempted to establish rival springs on their own land. One such spring was situated at the then Burnthouse farm and can still be seen in Dunorlan Park today. It was described in 1832 (before Marnock came to design the landscape) by John Britton as a spring which [...] "rises rapidly into a stone basin, placed in the centre of a circular excavation, <b>about</b> <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> in diameter and six or eight feet deep, which is bricked round, and with the remains of stone steps leading down to the basin at the bottom".

2500|$|Fish {{populations are}} {{hindered}} by two storm water detention systems: the M-1 Dam (or [...] "Boeing Creek Detention Facility"), an in-stream retention device {{on the main}} fork, and the Retention-Detention Ponds, an off-channel system in Boeing Creek Park. Three other structures influence stream ecology: Hidden Lake and its associated dam; an artificial waterfall, <b>about</b> <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> high, constructed from concrete, just downstream from Innis Arden Way; and the [...] "Seattle Country Club Golf Course Dam", a metal dam and pump station about 200 meters downstream of Innis Arden Way, which forms of reservoir that supplies the Seattle Country Club golf course with irrigation water. None of the dams provide fish passage and therefore present a total barrier, limiting stream use by anadromous species to the lower third of the creek.|$|E
2500|$|Great changes {{took place}} in the crater after the eruption. Before 1911, the crater floor was higher than Taal lake and had several {{separate}} openings in which were lakes of different colors. There was a green lake, a yellow lake, a red lake and some holes filled with hot water from which steam issued. Many places were covered with a shaky crust of volcanic material, full of crevices, which was always hot and on which it was rather dangerous to walk. Immediately after the explosion, the vari-colored lakes had disappeared and in their place was one large lake, <b>about</b> <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> below the level of the lake surrounding the island. The crater lake gradually rose until it is on a level with the water in Taal Lake. Opinions after the creation of the lake that the presence of the water in the crater has a tendency to cool off the material below and thus lessen the chances of an explosion or make the volcano extinct, but the preponderance of expert opinion was otherwise.(The subsequent eruption in 1965 and succeeding activities came from a new eruptive center, Mount Tabaro.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{helicopter}} crew lowered {{a line to}} survivors to tow them to shore. First {{to receive}} the line was Bert Hamilton, who was treading water <b>about</b> <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> from the plane's floating tail. The pilot pulled him across the ice to shore while avoiding {{the sides of the}} bridge. By then some fire/rescue personnel had arrived to join the military personnel and civilians who pulled Hamilton (and the next/last three survivors) from the water's edge up to waiting ambulances. The helicopter returned to the aircraft's tail, and this time Arland D. Williams Jr. (sometimes referred to as [...] "the sixth passenger") caught the line. Williams, not able to unstrap himself from the wreckage, passed the line to flight attendant Kelly Duncan, who was towed to shore. On its third trip back to the wreckage, the helicopter lowered two lifelines, fearing that the remaining survivors had only a few minutes before succumbing to hypothermia. Williams, still strapped into the wreckage, passed one line to Joe Stiley, who was holding on to a panic-stricken and blinded (from jet fuel) Priscilla Tirado, who had lost her husband and baby. Stiley's co-worker, Nikki Felch, took the second line. As the helicopter pulled the three through the water and blocks of ice toward shore, both Tirado and Felch lost their grip and fell back into the water.|$|E

60|$|Odd, {{grotesque}} shapes they were; {{unlike anything}} that I {{had ever seen}} upon Mars, and yet, at a distance, most manlike in appearance.

60|$|At {{the foot}} of the first ridge of the main Cordillera, in the ravine of Maricongo, and at an {{elevation}} which, from the extreme coldness and appearance of the vegetation, I estimated at <b>about</b> <b>ten</b> thousand <b>feet,</b> I found beds of white sandstone and of limestone including the Pecten Dufreynoyi, Terebratula aenigma, and some Gryphites. This ridge throws the water on the one hand into the Pacific, and on the other, as I was informed, into a great gravel-covered, basin-like plain, including a salt- lake, and without any drainage-exit. In crossing the Cordillera by this Pass, it is said that three principal ridges must be traversed, instead of two, or only one as in Central Chile.|$|R
5000|$|Approximately {{eight years}} after the McGinnis dig, another group called the Onslow Company sailed from central Nova Scotia to Oak Island {{with the goal of}} {{recovering}} what they believed to be secret treasure. They continued the excavation down to approximately 90 ft; layers of logs or [...] "marks" [...] were found <b>about</b> every <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> (3 m). In addition to these finds, they also discovered layers of charcoal, putty and coconut fibre. According to the earliest account written in 1862, at 80 - 90 ft, they also recovered a large stone bearing an inscription of symbols. The excavation was abandoned though when the pit subsequently flooded up to the 33 ft level, and bailing did nothing to help the problem.|$|R
