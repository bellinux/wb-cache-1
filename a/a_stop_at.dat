5|$|From 1891 to 1937, the Rainier Valley {{was served}} by the Rainier Avenue Electric Railway, an {{interurban}} railway on Rainier Avenue that traveled to Downtown Seattle, including <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> McClellan Street {{in the vicinity of}} the modern light rail station.

5|$|Greyhound {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{operators}} of Amtrak's Thruway Motorcoach service even though the two companies are competitors in some markets. Amtrak issues rail passengers a ticket for a regularly scheduled Greyhound route that connects with their train, often with buses making <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the train station. These Thruway Motorcoach routes allow Amtrak to serve passengers in areas without rail service and offer passengers in areas with rail service a wider selection of destinations.|$|E
5|$|If built, {{the light}} rail would have as its western {{terminus}} a maintenance facility across Highway 82 from the airport. It would include <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Buttermilk and parallel the highway, using the old Maroon Creek Bridge, until it reached Monarch Street downtown. There {{it would turn}} south to its eastern terminus at Rubey Park. If there is not sufficient support or funding for the light rail, it could be built as bus lanes at first.|$|E

5|$|A modern {{light rail}} system was {{proposed}} by a newly formed regional transit authority (RTA) in 1995, including a line running through the Rainier Valley on Martin Luther King Jr. Way with <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> South Henderson Street to serve Rainier Beach. The $6.7 billion proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, and the RTA proposed a smaller, $3.9 billion transit system with an at-grade station at South Henderson Street; the new proposal was approved by voters in November 1996. The RTA, which renamed itself to Sound Transit, selected an at-grade alignment for light rail on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South in 1999, with a station at South Henderson Street.|$|E

5|$|A modern {{light rail}} system was {{proposed}} by the newly-formed Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (RTA) in 1995, including a line running through the Rainier Valley with <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> South Othello Street.
