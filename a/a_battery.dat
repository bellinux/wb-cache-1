5|$|In all 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were {{distributed}} {{of which the}} great majority were installed in 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy petrol depots at short notice. The size of <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> varied from just one drum {{to as many as}} fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum. Where possible, half the barrels in <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>battery</b> {{electric}} vehicle (BEV) uses chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs as its only source for propulsion. BEVs use electric motors and motor controllers instead of internal combustion engines (ICEs) for propulsion.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> reserve <b>battery</b> is {{distinguished}} from <b>a</b> backup <b>battery,</b> in that <b>a</b> reserve <b>battery</b> is inert {{until it is}} activated, while <b>a</b> backup <b>battery</b> is already functional, {{even if it is}} not delivering current.|$|R
50|$|Battery life: Up to 9 {{hours of}} <b>battery</b> life with <b>a</b> 6-cell <b>battery</b> {{and up to}} 15 hours with <b>a</b> 9-cell <b>battery.</b> This battery life could be {{increased}} to 23 hours with <b>a</b> 9-cell <b>battery</b> and <b>an</b> external <b>battery</b> pack.|$|R
50|$|Typically, <b>a</b> <b>battery's</b> SoH will be 100% at {{the time}} of {{manufacture}} and will decrease over time and use. However, <b>a</b> <b>battery's</b> performance {{at the time}} of manufacture may not meet its specifications, in which case its initial SoH will be less than 100%.|$|R
5|$|About {{ten o'clock}} last night four {{companies}} of picked men moved over the Long Bridge, as an advance guard.

5|$|Adelaide's first {{experiment}} with electric powered trams was a demonstration {{run on the}} Adelaide and Hindmarsh Tramway company's line. <b>A</b> <b>battery</b> powered tram fitted with Julien's Patent Electric Traction ran in 1889 to Henley Beach. The trial was unsuccessful due to the batteries poor capacity, and the promoters' deaths in a level crossing accident shortly after precluded further experiments.|$|E
5|$|At the New York Navy Yard, De Soto {{was fitted}} out for naval service, {{including}} {{the installation of}} <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> consisting of one 30-pounder Parrott rifle and eight 32-pound guns.

5000|$|<b>A</b> deep-cycle <b>battery</b> is <b>a</b> {{lead-acid}} <b>battery</b> {{designed to}} be regularly deeply discharged using most of its capacity. In contrast, starter batteries (e.g. most automotive batteries) are designed to deliver short, high-current bursts for cranking the engine, thus frequently discharging {{only a small part}} of their capacity. While <b>a</b> deep-cycle <b>battery</b> can be used as <b>a</b> starting <b>battery,</b> the lower [...] "cranking current" [...] implies that <b>an</b> oversized <b>battery</b> may be required.|$|R
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the island {{became part of the}} front line for invasion and was heavily fortified. Along with other coastal resorts, the island drew in evacuees from London, though as the war progressed, these were moved to safer settlements further inland. 2000 troops were stationed on the island to guard against invasion. <b>A</b> <b>battery</b> of 4.7 inch guns was installed along the beach along with <b>a</b> <b>Battery</b> Observation post and a number of searchlights and pillboxes. Several of these installations survived and can still be seen along the south coast of the island, one of which has been converted into a cafe. After the war, the island suffered from severe winter weather in 1947 which destroyed much of the oyster fishery, and from the flooding of 1953, where numerous beach huts were swept out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Colonel England's 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was {{supported}} by the guns of the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and a troop of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment. The tanks were late in arriving, and England postponed his attack to 1030. The battalion came under artillery fire, mostly from <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> north of Bardia that was then engaged and silenced by the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The advance resumed, only to come under machine gun and artillery fire from Wadi el Gerfan. An eight-man section under Lance Corporal F. W. Squires was sent to reconnoitre the wadi but attacked <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> position instead and returned with 500 prisoners. The wadi was found to contain large numbers of Italian soldiers from technical units who, untrained for combat, surrendered in large numbers. One company captured over 2,000 prisoners, including 60 officers.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 {{the system}} was {{extended}} to include <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> bank charged by two photovoltaic solar arrays, and by a 6kW wind turbine sited at a redundant telecommunications tower on {{the high point of}} the island.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, it {{consisted}} of two brigades; two garrisons and four battalions were merged to become six battalions.

5|$|Tesla Motors {{designed}} its Model S {{to allow}} fast battery swapping. In June 2013, Tesla announced their goal to deploy <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> swapping station {{in each of}} its supercharging stations. At a demonstration event Tesla showed that <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> swap operation with the Model S takes just over 90 seconds, {{about half the time}} it takes to refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event. The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to Tesla, a large number of Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. These will be followed by the Washington, DC to Boston corridor.|$|E
50|$|Much like <b>a</b> {{traditional}} <b>battery</b> such as <b>a</b> Li-ion <b>battery,</b> <b>an</b> organic radical <b>battery</b> {{consists of}} <b>a</b> cathode and an anode that {{are separated by}} a porous film and submerged in an electrolyte. In a pure organic radical battery, both terminals are made of organic radical polymers (a p-type and an n-type polymer), while <b>a</b> metal/ORB hybrid <b>battery</b> usually has <b>a</b> radical polymer cathode and a Li-ion/graphite anode.|$|R
5000|$|Reserve {{capacity}} minutes (RCM) is <b>a</b> <b>battery's</b> {{ability to}} sustain a minimum stated electrical load; it {{is defined as the}} time (in minutes) that <b>a</b> lead-acid <b>battery</b> at 80 °F (27 °C) will continuously deliver 25 amperes before its voltage drops below 10.5 volts.|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>battery</b> of BM-13-16 {{launchers}} included four firing vehicles, two reload {{trucks and}} two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having {{a crew of}} six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard procedure was {{to switch to a}} new position some 10km away due to the ease with which the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E

Thyroid function tests include <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> of blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|A ship of {{the line}} was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> of up to 120 smoothbore guns and carronades. The ship {{of the line}} {{developed}} gradually over centuries and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of line of battle tactics in the early 17th century {{and the end of}} the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.|$|E
