5|$|Although animals {{generally}} express fewer {{variants of}} the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals produces an <b>antiviral</b> response.

A similar role in immunity may operate in C. elegans, as argonaute proteins are upregulated in response to viruses and worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{development}} of <b>antiviral</b> drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic. <b>Antiviral</b> drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed <b>antiviral</b> drugs.|$|E

50|$|Epithelial {{keratitis}} {{is treated}} with topical <b>antivirals,</b> {{which are very}} effective with low incidence of resistance. Treatment of the disease with topical <b>antivirals</b> generally should be continued for 10-14 days. Aciclovir ophthalmic ointment and Trifluridine eye drops have similar effectiveness but are more effective than Idoxuridine and Vidarabine eye drops. Oral acyclovir is as effective as topical <b>antivirals</b> for treating epithelial keratitis, {{and it has the}} advantage of no eye surface toxicity. For this reason, oral therapy is preferred by some ophthalmologists.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{pandemic}} {{response has}} involved {{the use of}} <b>antivirals.</b> These <b>antivirals</b> are often allocated to households dynamically throughout the pandemic with the aim being to retard the spread of infection. A drawback {{of this is that}} there is a delay until infection is confirmed and <b>antivirals</b> are delivered. Here an alternative allocation scheme is considered, where <b>antivirals</b> are instead preallocated to households at the start of a pandemic, thus reducing this delay. To compare these two schemes, a deterministic approximation to a novel stochastic household model is derived, which allows efficient computation of key quantities such as the expected epidemic final size, expected early growth rate, expected peak size and expected peak time of the epidemic. It is found that the theoretical best choice of allocation scheme depends on strain transmissibility, the delay in delivering <b>antivirals</b> under a dynamic allocation scheme and the stockpile size. A broad summary is that for realistic stockpile sizes, a dynamic allocation scheme is superior with the important exception of the epidemic final size under a severe pandemic scenario. Our results, viewed in conjunction with the practical considerations of implementing a preallocation scheme, support a focus on attempting to reduce the delay in delivering <b>antivirals</b> under a dynamic allocation scheme during a future pandemic.

5|$|Herpes <b>antiviral</b> therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the {{experimental}} use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal <b>antiviral</b> treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered <b>antiviral</b> medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised <b>antiviral</b> treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir <b>antiviral</b> treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{chance of}} an {{influenza}} pandemic {{is real and}} clinicians should keep themselves informed about the rationale and science behind preventive and therapeutic principles relating to an (impending) influenza pandemic. Discussion Vaccination is considered the best prevention {{in case of a}} pandemic threat and first choice to contain the impact of a pandemic. Pending the availability of an effective pandemic vaccine, <b>antivirals</b> are likely the only effective agents for prevention and treatment. When an influenza pandemic is impending, all interventions aim to prevent people becoming infected and to suppress replication and transmission of the virus as much as possible. <b>Antivirals</b> will be prescribed to patients with laboratory confirmed pre-pandemic influenza as well as to their contacts (post-exposure prophylaxis) which may delay development of or even prevent a pandemic. During a manifest influenza pandemic, however, there is large-scale spreading of the influenza virus. Therefore, preventive use of <b>antivirals</b> is less efficient to prevent transmission. Delaying the pandemic is then important in order to prevent exhausting public health resources and disruption of society. Thus, during a manifest pandemic everyone with influenza symptoms should receive <b>antivirals</b> as quickly as possible, regardless of virological confirmation. To ensure optimal effectiveness of <b>antivirals</b> and to minimize development of drug resistant viral strains, the use of <b>antivirals</b> for annual influenza should be restrictive. The crucial position of family physicians during an (impending) influenza pandemic necessitates the development of primary health care guidelines on this topic for all countries. Summary Family physicians will {{play a key role in}} assessing and treating victims of a new influenza virus, and in reassuring the worried well. We outline various possible interventions in the event of an impending and a manifest influenza pandemic, such as non-medial measures, prescription of <b>antivirals,</b> and vaccination, and emphasize the need for pandemic influenza preparedness. </p...|$|R
