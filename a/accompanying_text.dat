5|$|In 1255, Louis IX of France gave an {{elephant}} to Henry III of England for his menagerie in the Tower of London. A drawing by the historian Matthew Paris for his Chronica Majora {{can be seen}} in his bestiary at Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. An <b>accompanying</b> <b>text</b> cites elephant lore suggesting that elephants did not have knees and were unable to get up if they fell.|$|E
5|$|The 30-word {{design was}} the most popular {{recruitment}} poster at the time having been printed ten times the volume of Leete's image. Leete's image has been praised for being more arresting while his <b>accompanying</b> <b>text</b> is also far less verbose. The official wording, taken from a Kitchener speech, may seem more fitting for a character in a Henry James novel. The 30-word recruiting poster was developed as Britons' collective hopes of the war being over by Christmas were dashed in January 1915 and volunteer enlistments fell.|$|E
5|$|Dvořák often adapted Bohemian {{folklore}} for his compositions, and {{his previous}} four symphonic poems {{were based on}} actual poems by the Czech poet Karel Jaromír Erben, especially Erben's collection of ballads Kytice. A Hero's Song broke away from this pattern of programmatic symphonic works, as Dvořák did not specify a specific <b>accompanying</b> <b>text,</b> and he only roughly outlined its plot in a later letter. The lack of a fixed programme has been hypothesized {{as a reason for}} its relative neglect when compared to Dvořák's other symphonic works. It has also been suggested that the work was intended to be autobiographical, an unusual approach for Dvořák. This was Dvořák's only symphonic poem that pursued Franz Liszt's idealized view of the genre, as Dvořák's other four works were based on eerie subjects not appropriate to Liszt's conception.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the ensuing}} {{plagiarism}} suit, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] became somewhat stigmatised by association, {{to the point}} where no mention of the song was complete without a reference to [...] "He's So Fine".

While acknowledging the common ground between the two songs, music critic David Fricke describes Harrison's composition as [...] "the honest child of black American sacred song". Writing around the time of All Things Must Passs 2001 reissue, again for Rolling Stone, Anthony DeCurtis described [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] as [...] "capturing the sweet satisfactions of faith", while to Mikal Gilmore, it is an [...] "irresistible devotional".|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, The Crab {{with the}} Golden Claws, along with King Ottokar's Sceptre, {{became the first}} Tintin adventures {{published}} in the United States, in Little Golden Books. However, Casterman, working with the American publisher Western Publishing, {{made a number of}} changes: Jumbo, the sailor who Tintin leaves bound and gagged in Captain Haddock's cabin, as well as another man who beats Haddock in the cellar, could not be black Africans as depicted in the original; these were changed to a white sailor and an Arab due to the American publisher's concerns depicting blacks and whites mixing together. The <b>accompanying</b> <b>text</b> was not changed, however, and Haddock still refers to the man who beat him as a [...] "Negro". Also by request of the Americans, scenes of Haddock drinking directly from bottles of whiskey on the lifeboat and the plane were blanked out, keeping only the text. The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Hergé to be more acceptable, and they appear this way in published editions around the world. Casterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of the fourth volume in their [...] collection. In 1989, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition.|$|E

500|$|A stela was {{not just}} {{considered}} a neutral portrait, it {{was considered to be}} 'owned' by the subject, whether that subject was a person or a god. Stela3 from ElZapote in Guatemala is a small monument dating from the Early Classic period, the front of the stela bears a portrait of the rain god Yaxhal Chaak, [...] "Clear Water Chaak". The <b>accompanying</b> <b>text</b> describes how the deity Yaxhal Chaak himself was dedicated, not just his image on the stela. This could be taken to imply that the stela was seen as the embodiment of the deity and is also true of those stelae bearing royal portraits, which were seen to be the supernatural embodiment of the ruler they represented. The stela, combined with any accompanying altar, was a perpetual enactment of royal ceremony in stone. [...] David Stuart has stated that stelae [...] "do not simply commemorate past events and royal ceremonies but serve to perpetuate the ritual act into eternity", thus ascribing a magical effectiveness to stela depictions. In the same vein, stelae bearing royal portraits may have been magically loaded extensions of the royal person (uba 'his self'), extremely powerful confirmations of political and religious authority. Stelae bearing images of multiple people, for instance of several nobles performing a ritual or of a king with his war captives, were likely to be exceptions to this idea of the stela as sacred embodiment of the subject.|$|E
