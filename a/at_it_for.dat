25|$|Some {{years passed}} before he again {{attempted}} romance writing, {{and then the}} first two parts of Gil Blas de Santillane were published in 1715, without the popularity of Le Diable boiteux. Lesage worked <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a long time, and did not bring out the third part till 1724, nor the fourth till 1735. During these twenty years he was, however, continually busy. Notwithstanding the great merit and success of Turcaret and Crispin, the Théâtre Français did not welcome him, and in 1715 he began to write for the Théâtre de la foire, the comic opera held in booths at festival time. According to one computation he produced, either alone or with others, about a hundred pieces, varying from strings of songs with no regular dialogues, to comediettas only distinguished from regular plays {{by the introduction of}} music. He was also industrious in prose fiction. Besides finishing Gil Blas he translated the Orlando innamorato (1721), rearranged Guzman d'Alfarache (1732), published two more or less original novels, Le Bachelier de Salamanque and Estevanille Gonzalez, and in 1733 produced the Vie et aventures de M. de Beauchesne, which resembles certain works of Daniel Defoe. Besides all this, Lesage was also the author of La Valise trouvée, a collection of imaginary letters, and of some minor pieces including Une journée des Parques. He did not retire until 1740, when he was more than seventy years of age; he and his wife went to live with his second son, who was a canon at Boulogne-sur-Mer. Lesage's eldest son, Louis-André, had become an actor, and Lesage had disowned him. Lesage's last work, Mélange amusant de saillies d'esprit et de traits historiques les plus frappants, appeared in 1743.|$|E

In December 1643, Temple was prominent in the defence of the crossing of the River Adur at Bramber Castle against a Royalist attack during Lord Hopton's attempt to obtain control of Sussex for the King. His actions were described by Dr Cheynell: [...] "Upon the 12th of December I visited a brave soldier of my acquaintance, Captn Jas Temple, who did that day defend the fort of Bramber against a bold and daring enemy to the wonder of all the country and I did not marvel <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>for</b> {{he is a man}} that hath his head full of stratagems, his heart full of piety and valour, and his hand as full of success as it is of dexterity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{large amount}} of footage, {{and the fact that}} the filmmakers were [...] "in a sense... looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the first time", meant that the film's concept only became clear during editing. The events of 11–13April gave it [...] "a new {{dramatic}} centre", although Bartley and ÓBriain were keen that the film did not concentrate entirely on the coup. They had intended to include more historical and political context; it wasn't until late in post-production that the focus narrowed to include more emphasis on the media's role in Venezuelan politics. In October 2002, a two-hour [...] "rough cut" [...] was shown to Stoneman and Brendan McCarthy, BSÉ's head of Production and Development. This version included the [...] "witness" [...] accounts that Bartley and ÓBriain had captured after April 2002. Stoneman felt that these sequences reinforced the film's claims, but [...] "diluted its originality". He argued that they be cut, and that to compensate, Bartley and ÓBriain should record a voice-over and place themselves more in the frame as witness-protagonists, ideas that the filmmakers initially resisted.|$|E
500|$|The actors' {{performances}} were praised by several critics. Carman thought McCormack and Messing worked [...] "nicely" [...] together, {{and called the}} supporting cast [...] "an asset". Kay Mcfadden of the Seattle Times also praised McCormack, Messing and the supporting cast as [...] "very funny". Robert Laurence of The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote: [...] "Messing and McCormack play wonderfully together, tossing lines {{back and forth as}} if they'd been <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> years, making their relationship quite believable. Sean Hayes, as the flamboyantly gay Jack, adds to the mix. Jack is flighty, temperamental, good-humored and highly likable."

[...] "I know it won't happen soon; NBC is so skittish about the so-called Ellen 'gay show' stigma, it's gone to Herculean lengths to avoid mentioning Will's sexuality.
