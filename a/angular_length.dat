40|$|We {{present the}} results of our {{analysis}} of the geometrical tidal tail characteristics for nearby and distant interacting galaxies. The sample includes more than two hundred nearby galaxies and about seven hundred distant ones. The distant galaxies have been selected in several deep fields of the Hubble Space Telescope (HDF-N, HDF-S, HUDF, GOODS, GEMS) and they are at mean redshift z= 0. 65. We analyze the distributions of lengths and thicknesses for the tidal structures and show that the tails in distant galaxies are shorter than those in nearby ones. This effect can be partly attributed to observational selection effects, but, on the other hand, it may result from the general evolution of the sizes of spiral galaxies wih z. The location of interacting galaxies on the galaxy luminosity (L) [...] tidal tail length (l) plane are shown to be explained by a simple geometrical model, with the upper envelope of the observed distribution being l ∝√(L). We have solved the problem on the relationship between the observed distribution of tail flattening and the tail length in angular measure by assuming the tidal tails to be arcs of circumferences visible at arbitrary angles to the line of sight.

40|$|AbstractWe {{demonstrate}} that the apparent length of a thin white arc on a black disk, rotating concentrically at 2. 5 rps, varies with <b>angular</b> <b>length</b> and exposure duration. While short arcs (9 – 18 °) gradually expand, long arcs (36 – 72 °) first undergo a brief contraction, before they also expand. On average, perceived elongation asymptotes after 15 s equivalent to visual persistencies ranging from 68 to 170 ms. Using bi- and tri-colored arcs, {{we find that the}} apparent increase in length derives from the rear end of the rotating stimulus, while the initial shrinkage derives from contraction of the middle. After 15 s of adaptation, perceived length of the arc decays to actual stimulus length within an average of 6 s and, upon re-exposure of the arc, reaches its former value after only 5 s (priming). When the rotating arc is presented first to one eye and then to the other, apparent elongation transfers partially (46 %), suggesting a contribution by the binocular cells in the visual cortex. A partial transfer (26 %) also occurs from clockwise to counterclockwise rotation. When tested interocularly, the directional transfer is more pronounced (47 %) and equals the interocular transfer under equidirectional conditions, suggesting that the directional transfer (cw versus ccw) might derive from non-directional cortical units. Whereas the initial contraction may be attributable to backward masking, the observed elongation likely reflects a cumulative build-up of after-discharge in cortical neurons over time...|$|E
40|$|Consider {{a path of}} {{non-degenerate}} eigenstates |ψs〉, 0 ≤ s ≤ 1, of unitary operators Us or Hamiltonians Hs {{with minimum}} eigenvalue gap ∆. The eigenpath traversal problem is to transform one or more copies of |ψ 0 〉 into |ψ 1 〉. Solutions to this problem have appli-cations ranging from quantum physics simulation to optimization. For Hamiltonians, the conventional way of doing this is by applying the adiabatic theorem. We give “digital” methods for performing the transformation that require no assumption on path continuity or differentiability other than the absence of large jumps. Given sufficient information about eigenvalues and overlaps between states on the path, the transformation can be accomplished with complexity O((L/∆) log(L/)), where L is the <b>angular</b> <b>length</b> of the path and is a specified bound on the error of the output state. We show that the required information can be obtained in a first set of transformations, whose complexity per state transformed has an additional factor that depends logarithmically on a maximum angular velocity along the path. This velocity is averaged over constant angular distances and does not require continu-ity. Our methods have substantially better behavior than conventional adiabatic algorithms, with fewer conditions on the path. They also improve on the previously best digital methods and demonstrate that path length and the gap are the primary parameters that determine the complexity of state transformation along a path.

40|$|We {{present the}} first CCD flux-calibrated {{images of the}} snr G 82. 2 + 5. 3 in major optical {{emission}} lines. The [O III] 5007 line provides the first direct evidence of optical emission originating from G 82. 2 + 5. 3. Filamentary emission is detected {{in the west and}} east areas, roughly defining an ellipsoidal shell. The [O III] emission is rather well correlated with the radio emission suggesting their association, while typical fluxes are found in the range of 20 - 30 x 10 ^{- 17 } erg s^{- 1 } cm^{- 2 } arcsec^{- 2 }. Deep long-slit spectra taken at specific positions of the remnant verify that the filamentary emission originates from shock heated gas with shock velocities ~ 100 km/s and low electron densities, while the diffuse [O III] emission in the south results from photoionization processes. The X-ray surface brightness is quite patchy, missing obvious limb brightening and is dominated by a bright bar-like emission region which is off-set from the geometric center by ~ 9 '. The X-ray emission is thermal and requires two temperatures of 0. 2 keV and 0. 63 keV. The bright bar region shows overabundant Mg, Si and Fe, which might indicate still radiating ejecta matter. The azimuthally averaged radial surface profile is consistent with the matter density changing with distance r from the center ~e^{-r/r_ 0 } with a characteristic <b>angular</b> <b>length</b> of 36 ', or, alternatively, with an r^{- 1 / 2 } density profile.

40|$|Scaphitid ammonites (scaphites) {{are common}} in the Upper Cretaceous Pierre Shale and Bearpaw Shale of the Western Interior of North America. We redescribe Hoploscaphites nodosus (Owen, 1852) and H. brevis (Meek, 1876) from the Baculites compressusB. cuneatus zones of the upper Campanian. The types of both of these species were {{collected}} in the mid- 19 th century {{in what was then}} called Nebraska Territory, and included parts of present-day South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana. Based on our present knowledge of the distribution of these species, the type material was probably collected from the B. compressusB. cuneatus zones in the Pierre Shale at Sage Creek, a tributary of the Cheyenne River, Pennington County, South Dakota. Traditionally, the more robust, more coarsely ornamented scaphites (comprising the "nodosus group") from the Pierre Shale and Bearpaw Shale were assigned to Jeletzkytes Riccardi, 1983, and the more slender, more finely ornamented scaphites were assigned to Hoploscaphites Nowak, 1911. However, our large collections of these scaphites from the Baculites compressusB. cuneatus zones reveal a complete intergradation between the two morphological extremes, and for many specimens, the choice of genus is arbitrary. In addition, our studies of other biostratigraphic zones in the Pierre Shale and Bearpaw Shale reveal that cooccurring species of these two "genera" share more in common with each other than they do with congeneric species from other horizons. Furthermore, contrary to earlier assumptions, Jeletkytes is not endemic to the Western Interior Basin of North America and occurs, for example, in the U. S. Atlantic Coastal Plain and Europe. We thus provisionally treat Jeletzkytes as a junior subjective synonym of Hoploscaphites. This expanded definition of Hoploscaphites is consistent with present-day concepts of other scaphitid genera such as Discoscaphites Meek, 1876, and Trachyscaphites Cobban and Scott, 1964. In Hoploscaphites nodosus and H. brevis, the juvenile shell is planispirally coiled with a small umbilicus. The whorl section is initially depressed and becomes more compressed through ontogeny. The angle of the body chamber in juveniles is approximately two-thirds of a whorl. At the approach of maturity, the shell uncoils, forming a relatively long shaft and recurved hook. The ratio of whorl width to whorl height reaches a minimum value at midshaft. The apertural margin at maturity is constricted and terminates in a flared lip. Commonly, {{the last two or three}} septa, corresponding to the formation of the hook, are more closely spaced (approximated). These features indicate that the rate of growth decreased and eventually stopped at maturity ("morphogenetic countdown" associated with determinate growth). Both species of scaphites occur as dimorphs, which are referred to as macroconchs (presumably females) and microconchs (presumably males). In samples of specimens of the same species within a single concretion, macroconchs are approximately 20 larger than microconchs. In addition to size, dimorphs are distinguished by differences in shape, including the presence or absence of an umbilical bulge, the size of the umbilical diameter, the outline of the umbilical shoulder relative to that of the venter in side view, and the relative change in whorl height in passing from the mature phragmocone to the shaft of the body chamber. The holotype of Hoploscaphites nodosus, by monotypy, is UC 6381, the original of Scaphites nodosus Owen (1852 : 581, pl. 8, fig. 4). Adults exhibit a range of variation in size, degree of compression, and coarseness of ornament. The exposed phragmocone occupies most of the coiled portion of the shell, and is approximately two-thirds of a whorl in <b>angular</b> <b>length.</b> Adults are large (LMAX averages 91. 8 mm in macroconchs and 78. 0 mm in microconchs) and ellipsoidal in side view, with a strongly recurved hook (apertural angle averages 73 ° in macroconchs). The ratio of whorl width to whorl height at midshaft averages 0. 99 in macroconchs and 1. 02 in microconchs. The whorl section is subquadrate/ovoid to reniform, with broadly rounded to flat flanks, and a broadly rounded venter. Ribs are straight to slightly flexuous and cross the venter with a weak adoral projection. There are 57. 25 ribs/cm on the venter at midshaft in macroconchs and 68 ribs/cm on the venter at midshaft in microconchs. Umbilicolateral tubercles usually appear midway on the exposed phragmocone, but may already be present near the point of exposure. At midshaft, they occur at one-third to one-half whorl height and are relatively widely and evenly spaced, and usually extend to the aperture. Ventrolateral tubercles are generally present at the point of exposure. They are unevenly spaced on the exposed phragmocone, becoming more evenly spaced on the shaft. They attain their maximum size at midshaft, sometimes forming large, subspinose clavi that project out to the side. They become smaller and more closely spaced on the hook, and usually extend to the aperture. The suture is characterized by a broad, asymmetrically bifid first lateral saddle and narrow, symmetrically to asymmetrically bifid first lateral lobe. The holotype of Hoploscaphites brevis, by original designation and monotypy, is USNM 367, the original of Scaphites nodosus var. brevis Meek (1876 : 428, pl. 25, fig. 1). Adults exhibit a wide range of variation in size, degree of compression, and coarseness of ornament. Adults are small to large (LMAX ranges from 29. 5 to 101. 5 mm in macroconchs and from 26. 7 to 81. 2 mm in microconchs), and rounded to ellipsoidal in lateral view. The body chamber consists of a relatively short shaft and a weakly recurved hook (apertural angle averages 59 ° in macroconchs). The ratio of whorl width to whorl height averages 0. 73 at midshaft in both macroconchs and microconchs. The whorl section is subquadrate/ovoid, with fairly flat flanks, and a broadly rounded venter. Ribs are fine and flexuous and cross the venter with a weak adoral projection. There are 614 ribs/cm on the venter at midshaft in macr oconchs and 818 ribs/cm on the venter at midshaft in microconchs. In most small specimens, umbilicolateral tubercles are absent on the phragmocone and, instead, the primary ribs are strong and adorally concave in this area. In large specimens, umbilicolateral tubercles usually appear midway or near the adoral end of the exposed phragmocone. They are small and relatively evenly spaced. In almost all specimens, umbilicolateral tubercles are present on the body chamber, and occur at one-fourth to one-third whorl height. They are more or less uniformly spaced with, occasionally, some approximation near the point of recurvature. In specimens that are rounded in lateral view, the umbilicolateral tubercles are arranged in a broad arc, which is one of the hallmarks of this species. Ventrolateral tubercles are stronger than umbilicolateral tubercles, and are usually present on the phragmocone starting anywhere from the point of exposure to the adoral end of the phragmocone. In general, they are unevenly spaced on the phragmocone, commonly occurring in pairs or clusters, becoming more evenly spaced on the shaft. As in H. nodosus, they attain their maximum size at midshaft. The ventrolateral tubercles usually die out near the point of recurvature, but if not, they become smaller, more bullate, and more closely spaced toward the aperture. The suture is the same as that in H. nodosus. Hoploscaphites landesi Riccardi, 1983, is a junior subjective synonym of H. brevis. The holotype is a small, compressed, finely ornamented microconch of H. brevis. It grades into larger, more robust specimens, with coarser ornament. We thereby expand the definition of H. brevis to include a wide range of variation in adult size, and argue that such variation reflects variation in the age (and size) at which individuals reach maturity. Establishment of separate species for different size specimens, given that all other aspects of their morphology (shell shape, whorl cross section, pattern of ribs, distribution of umbilicolateral and ventrolateral tubercles, and suture) are the same, seems unwarrented. Hoploscaphites nodosus and H. brevis are widespread in the Baculites compressus-B. cuneatus zones in the Western Interior of North America, which represent a time interval of approximately 580 ky (Cobban et al., 2006). They are also present in parts of the underlying Didymoceras cheyennense Zone and the overlying B. reesidei Zone, but their exact distribution in these zones is not yet known. Hoploscaphites nodosus and H. brevis occur in the Bearpaw Shale in Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Bearpaw Shale and Pierre Shale in Montana, and the Pierre Shale in North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, and Kansas. They occur in nearshore deposits such as the unnamed shale member of the Pierre Shale in Grand County, Colorado, in offshore deposits such as the DeGrey Member of the Pierre Shale in Buffalo County, South Dakota, and in cold methane seeps in the Pierre Shale in Custer County, South Dakota. They are absent in the U. S. Gulf and Atlantic Coastal plains and northern Europe, although similar forms are present in both these areas in strata above and below the biostratigraphic interval containing the ranges of H. nodosus and H. brevis. Thus, although H. nodosus and H. brevis are endemic to the Western Interior of North America, they are part of a more broadly distributed clade that is also present in the U. S. Gulf and Atlantic Coastal plains and northern Europe. © American Museum of Natural History...|$|E

We further extracted parasite trajectories from the recorded videos, and statistically analysed the following trajectory-step features: step <b>length,</b> <b>angular</b> change of direction, longitudinal and transverse displacements with respect to the previous step, and mean square displacement. Based on the resulting observations, we developed a mathematical model to simulate parasite trajectories. The fact that the model predictions closely match most of the experimentally observed parasite-trajectory characteristics, allows us to conclude that the model is an accurate description of T. cruzi motility...|$|R
40|$|Using the Phoenix radio survey, a {{homogeneous}} survey selected at 1. 4 GHz and covering {{an area of}} 3 deg^ 2, we analyse the clustering of the sub-mJy radio population using angular correlation function analysis. Extensive simulations are carried out to investigate {{the significance of the}} estimated angular correlation amplitudes. Our analysis show that for the S_ 1. 4 > 0. 5 mJy sub-samples the radio source distribution is anisotropic at the 2 σ significance level. Additionally, we estimate upper limits for the angular correlation amplitudes that, despite the large uncertainties, are in good agreement with the amplitude estimates for sources brighter than 1 mJy, detected in the FIRST radio survey (Cress et al. 1997). Adopting a radio luminosity function and assuming an evolving spatial correlation function of the form parametrised by ϵ, we find an upper limit for the <b>angular</b> correlation <b>length</b> r_o 9 h^- 1 Mpc for S_ 1. 4 > 0. 5 mJy and γ= 2. 1. This agrees well with the value r_o 6 - 8 h^- 1 Mpc estimated from the FIRST radio survey for sources brighter than 1 mJy. Additionally, we quantify the characteristics, in terms of areal coverage and limiting flux density, of future deep radio surveys to yield a significant correlation amplitude detection and to explore possible changes of the correlation amplitude with flux density...|$|R
40|$|The {{insights}} {{gained from}} present land cover classification activities suggest integration of multiangle data into classification attempts for future progress. Land cover types that exhibit distinct signatures {{in the space}} of remote sensing data facilitate unambiguous identification of cover types. In this first part, we develop a theme for consistency between cover type definitions, uniqueness of their signatures and physics of the remote sensing data. The idea of angular signatures in spectral space is proposed to provide a cogent synthesis of information from spectral and angular domains. Three new metrics, <b>angular</b> signature slope, <b>length</b> and intercept indices, are introduced to characterize biome signatures. The statistical analyses with these indices confirm the idea that incorporation of the directional variable should improve biome classification result. The consistency principle is tested with the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) leaf area index algorithm by examinin [...] ...|$|R
30|$|While osteotomies are {{necessary}} for rotational correction and limb lengthening, angular correction or moderate length inhibition may be achieved by other, less invasive means. Several techniques of epiphysiodesis have evolved, enabling gradual correction of <b>angular</b> correction and/or <b>length</b> equalisation through guided growth. This manuscript comprises a historical and comparative review of those techniques. The 8 -plate method of guided growth affords the opportunity to provide a tension band (rather than compression) that expedites angular correction, compared to stapling or transphyseal screws, which rely upon the principle of compression. When applied to each side of a given physis, longitudinal growth is inhibited, {{in the same fashion}} as stapling or epiphysiodesis. The physis and periosteum are spared any direct insult, thus making this a reversible process, suitable for use in younger children. The 8 -plate is simple to insert and, compared to staples or transphyseal screws, easy to remove.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We analyze X-ray sources {{detected}} over 4. 2 pseudo-contiguous sq. deg. in the 0. 5 – 2 keV and 2 – 10 keV bands down to fluxes of 2 × 10 − 15 and 8 × 10 − 15 erg s − 1 cm − 2 respectively, {{as part of}} the XMM-Newton Large Scale Structure Survey. The logN–logS in both bands shows a {{steep slope}} at bright fluxes, but agrees well with other determinations below∼ 2 × 10 − 14 erg s − 1 cm − 2. The detected sources resolve close to 30 per cent of the X-ray background in the 2 – 10 keV band. We study the twopoint angular clustering of point sources using nearest neighbours and correlation function statistics and find a weak, positive signal for ∼ 1130 sources in the 0. 5 – 2 keV band, but no correlation for ∼ 400 sources in the 2 – 10 keV band below scales of 100 arcsec. A sub-sample of ∼ 200 faint sources with hard X-ray count ratios, that is likely to be dominated by obscured AGN, does show a positive signal with the data allowing for a large <b>angular</b> correlation <b>length,</b> but only at the ∼ 2 (3) σlevel, based on re-sampling (Poisson) statistics. We discuss possible implications and emphasize the importance of wider, complete surveys in order to fully understand the large scale structure of the X-ray sky. Key words.

5000|$|The small dorsal fins have blunt apexes and {{straight}} to gently convex trailing margins; {{the first is}} slightly taller but shorter-based than the second. The origin {{of the first and}} second dorsal fins lie over the rear of the pelvic fins and anal fin respectively. The pectoral fins are small and broad, with rounded corners. The pelvic fins are long and low; adult males have slender claspers and a slight [...] "apron" [...] formed from the fusion of the pelvic fin inner margins. The anal fin is elongated, its base measuring roughly a tenth of the total <b>length,</b> and rather <b>angular.</b> The <b>length</b> of the anal fin base exceeds the distance between the anal and pelvic fins, and is comparable to the distance between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin is short and low, with a small lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The body and fins are entirely covered by minute, overlapping dermal denticles; each has an ovoid crown with a horizontal ridge leading to a marginal cusp. There are distinctive crests of enlarged, spiny denticles along the anterior half of the caudal fin upper margin, and beneath the caudal peduncle. This species is light grayish brown {{on the back of the}} body and tail, with a series of dark brown saddles numbering 10-16 before the dorsal fins, of which a few are wider than the others. The flanks, underside, and fins are whitish.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIdentification of {{a highly}} {{conductive}} orebody buried in Earth using an equivalent, perfectly conducting, triaxial model ellipsoid is investigated. The real data available (three-component magnetic fields collected along a borehole due to a single-frequency current loop at the Earth surface) are simulated via a low frequency, closed-form power series expansion of the electromagnetic fields scattered off an equivalent ellipsoid within a homogeneous, conductive medium, the source itself being idealized as a vertical magnetic dipole nearby. The approach provides formulations amenable to fast yet accurate computations, {{most of the work}} being {{in the construction of the}} formulations themselves, not in the numerical computations. The inversion scheme is described, which sees the iterative minimization of the least-square discrepancy between the fields due to a given ellipsoid and the data available. Unknowns are semi-axis <b>lengths,</b> <b>angular</b> orientations and coordinates of its centre. Numerical simulations illustrate the approach, before considering experimental single-well log data in a surface-to-borehole configuration at a mining site...|$|R
