500|$|According to {{the most}} popular version of the story, Pipp showed up at Yankee Stadium that day with a severe headache, and asked the team's trainer for two aspirin. Miller Huggins, the Yankees' manager, noticed this, and said [...] "Wally, take the day off. We'll try that kid Gehrig at first today <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> back in there tomorrow." [...] Gehrig played well and became the Yankees' new {{starting}} first baseman. This story first appeared in a 1939 New York World-Telegram on Gehrig's career, in which Pipp was interviewed. Pipp was later quoted to have said, [...] "I took the two most expensive aspirin in history." ...|$|E
500|$|Mikey MiGo of 411mania {{wrote that}} the song is a [...] "welcomed change" [...] from Timberlake's past work. She stated that the song [...] "has qualities of Prince that I've never seen anyone muster up before". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic called the song [...] "musically and melodically great", but criticized its lyrics. She {{wrote that the}} lyrics sound like the {{dialogue}} of a [...] "low-rent porn film", highlighting the lines: [...] "She's pressed up on me; I think she's ready to blow?" [...] and [...] "All I need is a moment alone, to give you my tongue <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> out of control". According to Murray, [...] "It makes one question exactly what films Timberlake was starring in during his sabbatical." [...] She concluded that [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound" [...] establishes a pattern {{for the rest of}} FutureSex/LoveSounds: [...] "infectiously catchy and in many cases accomplished pop music, marred by retardedly retarded lyrics".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{resistance}} to the character, Bungie staff defended the character's introduction. [...] "I'd much rather experiment and do something surprising, and not have everybody appreciate it, than just turn the crank and do another alien war movie with a space marine," [...] said Halo 2 design lead Jaime Griesemer. Community lead Brian Jarrard attributed some of the fan backlash to a discord between the game's marketing and the actual gameplay. [...] "I think, {{even more so than}} playing as the Arbiter, the thing that people were disappointed with and angry about is that they were promised this experience, through the marketing, of being really backs against the wall, Earth's under siege, we're going to do all we can to save our home planet... In reality, the game only had two missions that actually did that." [...] Referring to Halo 2s cliffhanger ending, Griesemer said, [...] "I think if we'd been able to finish that last couple of missions <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> properly back on Earth, a lot of the reaction would have been placated." ...|$|E

500|$|Clarkson favored [...] "Run Run Rudolph" [...] as her {{favorite}} classic, saying: [...] "Just because {{it got to}} be a little more rock and roll." [...] She also remarked that [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics. Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, [...] "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album. She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Brandon Blackstock, Reba McEntire's stepson, saying: [...] "Every Christmas, I was just like, 'This is going to be different, right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life?'". The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley's [...] "Blue Christmas". Its follow-up, a rendition of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside", features Ronnie Dunn. Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying: [...] "Like, it's straight-up his personality to say all of that to try <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> to stay, and have a drink." [...] "Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)" [...] was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to [...] "Every Christmas". Dedicated to Blackstock, the song accounts her holiday after meeting him. She remarked: [...] "Christmas changes, it morphs, it comes to life a little more… It’s just a happier time." ...|$|E
