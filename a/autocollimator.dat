They are typically used to align components and measure deflections in optical or mechanical systems. An <b>autocollimator</b> works by projecting an image onto a target mirror and measuring the deflection of the returned image against a scale, either visually or {{by means of}} an electronic detector. A visual <b>autocollimator</b> can measure angles as small as 0.5 arcminute (0.15 mrad), while an electronic <b>autocollimator</b> can have up to 100 times more resolution.|$|E

50|$|Light from an {{origin point}} O is {{collimated}} (made parallel) {{by a high}} quality objective lens. If the collimated beam falls perpendicularly onto a plane reflecting surface, the light is reflected back along its original path and is brought to a focus at a point coincident with the origin point. If the reflector is tilted through an angle θ, the reflected beam is deflected through an angle 2θ, and the image I is displaced laterally from the origin 0.The amount of displacement is given by d=2θf where f is the focal length of the lens, and θ is in radians.Light from an illuminated target graticule at the focus of an objective lens is directed towards the lens by a beam splitter. After reflection by a mirror on the workpiece, the light returns through the <b>Autocollimator</b> and passes through the beam splitter, forming {{an image of the}} target graticule in the plane of an eyepiece graticule. The eyepiece graticule and the reflected image of the target graticule are viewed simultaneously through the eyepiece.The image of the target graticule is always seen in focus and at constant magnification in the eyepiece, regardless of the distance between the <b>Autocollimator</b> and the reflecting surface. However, at long working distances only a portion of the reflected target graticule may appear in the eyepiece, owing to the failure of obliquely returning rays to enter the <b>Autocollimator.</b> This will result in a restricted measuring range.|$|E

The term absolute in the name of this apparatus reflects the nature of the position measurement, which, unlike in a conventional electronic <b>autocollimator,</b> is based absolutely on the position of the image rather than on an assumed proportionality between the position and the levels of processed analog electronic signals. The term Cartesian in the name of this apparatus reflects the nature of its optical target. Figure 1 depicts the electronic functional blocks of an electronic absolute Cartesian <b>autocollimator</b> along with its basic optical layout, which is the same as that of a conventional <b>autocollimator.</b> Referring first to the optical layout and functions only, this or any <b>autocollimator</b> is used to measure the compound angular deviation of a flat datum mirror with respect to the optical axis of the <b>autocollimator</b> itself. The optical components include an illuminated target, a beam splitter, an objective or collimating lens, and a viewer or detector (described in more detail below) at a viewing plane. The target and the viewing planes are focal planes of the lens. Target light reflected by the datum mirror is imaged on the viewing plane at unit magnification by the collimating lens. If the normal to the datum mirror is parallel to the optical axis of the <b>autocollimator,</b> then the target image is centered on the viewing plane. Any angular deviation of the normal from the optical axis manifests itself as a lateral displacement of the target image from the center. The magnitude of the displacement is proportional to the focal length and to the magnitude (assumed to be small) of the angular deviation. The direction of the displacement is perpendicular to the axis about which the mirror is slightly tilted. Hence, one can determine the amount and direction of tilt from the coordinates of the target image on the viewing plane...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} a control scheme of such optoelectronic devices with matrix photo-detectors as  <b>autocollimators,</b> microscopes, star trackers and other film equipment an d the control {{is carried out}} {{with the help of}} a collimator. A number of factors (structure discreteness, photo-detector noise, consistency in collimator test-object size, photo-detector pixel size and point scattering function of optical components) exert an influence on control accuracy. In the context of control problems and alignment of optoelectronic devices the paper studies a scheme which includes two components: controlling component that is a collimator and a component to be controlled that is a tele-centric system). A mathematical model for control schemes has been proposed with the purpose to determine an effect of the above-mentioned factors and its mathematical implementation has been described in the paper. Due to simulation an optimal ratio has been selected for component parameters of the optical control scheme: point scattering function for a collimator objective and a telecentric system,  collimator test-object size, photo-detector pixel size.   A collimator test-object size has been determined in the paper. Using the considered scheme the size will give the smallest measurement error caused by photo-detector discreteness of a controlled device. A standard deviation of the gravity energy center for a collimator test-object caused by photo-detector noise has been determined in the paper.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop tools for {{understanding}} the influence of crystal quality and crystal mounting on harmonic-generation efficiency at high irradiance. Measuring the homogeneity of crystals interferometrically, making detailed physics calculations of conversion efficiency, performing finite- element modeling of mounted crystals, and designing a new optical metrology tool were key elements in obtaining that understanding. For this work, we used the following frequency-tripling scheme: type I second- harmonic generation followed by type II sum-frequency mixing of the residual fundamental and the second harmonic light. The doubler was potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), and the tripler was deuterated KDP (KD*P). With this scheme, near-infrared light (1053 nm) can be frequency tripled (to 351 nm) at high efficiency (theoretically > 90 %) for high irradiance (> 3 GW/cm&sup 2;). Spatial variations in the birefringence of the large crystals studied here (37 to 41 cm square by about 1 cm thick) imply that the ideal phase-matching orientation of the crystal {{with respect to the}} incident laser beam varies across the crystal. We have shown that phase-measuring interferometry can be used to measure these spatial variations. We observed transmitted wavefront differences between orthogonally polarized interferograms of {lambda}/ 50 to {lambda}/ 100, which correspond to index variations of order 10 - 6. On some plates that we measured, the standard deviation of angular errors is 22 - 23 µrad; this corresponds to a 1 % reduction in efficiency. Because these conversion crystals are relatively thin, their surfaces are not flat (deviate by k 2. 5 urn from flat). A crystal is mounted against a precision-machined surface that supports the crystal on four edges. This mounting surface is not flat either (deviates by + 2. 5 µm from flat). A retaining flange presses a compliant element against the crystal. The load thus applied near the edges of the crystal surface holds it in place. We performed detailed finite-element modeling to predict the resulting shape of the mounted crystal. The prediction agreed with measurements of mounted crystals. We computed the physics of the frequency-conversion process to better quantify the effects on efficiency of variation in the crystal� s axis, changes {{in the shape of the}} crystal, and mounting-induced stress. We were able to accurately predict the frequency-conversion performance of 37 -cm square crystals on Beamlet, a one-beam scientific prototype of the NIF laser architecture, using interferometric measurements of the mounted crystals and the model. In a 2 {omega} measurement campaign, the model predicted 64. 9 % conversion efficiency; 64. 1 % was observed. When detuned by 640 µrad, the model and measurement agreement is even better (both were 10. 4 %). Finally, we completed the design and initial testing of a new optical metrology tool to measure the spatial variation of frequency conversion. This system employs a high-power subaperture beam from a commercial laser oscillator and rod amplifier. The beam interrogates the crystal� s aperture by moving the crystal horizontally on a translation stage and translating the laser beam vertically on an optical periscope. Precision alignment is maintained by means of a full-aperture reference mirror, a precision-machined surface on the crystal mount, and <b>autocollimators</b> (the goal for angular errors is 10 µrad). The <b>autocollimators</b> track the mounting angle of the crystal and the direction of the laser beam with respect to the reference mirror. The conversion efficiency can be directly measured by recording l{omega}, 2 {omega}, 3 {omega} energy levels during the scan and by rocking (i. e., tilting) the crystal mount over an angular range...|$|R

The Master Equatorial is a small telescope mounted {{on the top of}} a tower located inside the antenna structure. In the Antenna Encoder mode antenna encoders are used to close the feedback loop. In the <b>Autocollimator</b> mode the Master Equatorial is a master that follows a target, and the antenna is a slave that follows the Master Equatorial. In the Master Equatorial Encoder mode the “master-slave’’ relationship is reversed. In the paper the analysis begins with the description of the open loop models of the antenna and of the Master Equatorial. We obtained the models by using field test data and system identification techniques. Next, we analyzed and evaluated the performance of the three modes of the antenna control system. The analysis showed that the <b>Autocollimator</b> and Master Equatorial Encoder tracking modes are feasible for high-rate tracking, and that the latter mode has the smallest tracking error. Finally, we analyzed the switching between antenna modes, necessary while tracking near the keyhole. We showed that switching causes jerks of magnitudes within the acceptable threshold.
