5|$|Three of {{the small}} vessels managed to return to England: MLs 160, 307 and 443. They had reached the {{rendezvous}} <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> 10:00 for the destroyers to appear. Having already been attacked once, they moved further out into the Atlantic to try and avoid the German Air Force, but a Junkers 88 appeared overhead at 07:30 and approached them at low level for a closer look. The ships opened fire and hit the Junkers in the cockpit. The plane went into the sea. The next aircraft to appear was a Blohm & Voss seaplane which attempted to bomb the ships, but left after being damaged by machine-gun fire. The surviving MLs eventually reached England unaided the following day.|$|E
5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a volley toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit and went down. Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and volley, descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot and the other two were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded. Though short, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend had a lasting impact and influence {{on the rest of the}} war.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II, with Operation Nordlicht, the Germans {{used the}} {{scorched}} earth tactic in Finnmark and northern Troms to halt the Red Army. As a consequence of this, few houses survived the war, and {{a large part of}} the population was forcefully evacuated further south (Tromsø was crowded), but many people avoided evacuation by hiding in caves and mountain huts <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the Germans were gone, then inspected their burned homes. There were 11,000 houses, 4,700 cow sheds, 106 schools, 27 churches, and 21 hospitals burned. There were 22,000 communications lines destroyed, roads were blown up, boats destroyed, animals killed, and 1,000 children separated from their parents.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of June 29, Stuart's advance party, the 4th Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, chased two {{companies}} of the 1st Delaware Cavalry Regiment a long distance {{down the road to}} Baltimore from Westminister, Maryland, losing two lieutenants in the process. On June 30, the riders leading Stuart's column saw a large column of Union cavalry across their path. Encumbered by the wagon train and some new prisoners, Stuart's vanguard clashed with Union cavalry under the command of Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick at the Battle of Hanover near Hanover, Pennsylvania. When the engagement broke off, Stuart detoured five miles to the east through Jefferson, Pennsylvania <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> nightfall to resume his ride in order to better protect the threat from Kilpatrick's force to his left flank, including the wagons.|$|E
25|$|Ganteaume had got his fleet {{ready for}} sea by 24 March, but Brest was being closely {{blockaded}} by Vice-Admiral Cotton's 17 ships of the line. Ganteaume had orders to avoid battle, <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> conditions seemed favourable on 26 March, when a fog came down {{that would help}} him to slip past the British. But {{as he made his}} way out the weather changed suddenly, blowing away the fog and making it difficult to return to the anchorage. Temporarily trapped outside the port Ganteaume reluctantly prepared for battle as Cotton's force approached. Cotton did not however risk an engagement with night closing, many shoals and with the enemy fleet under the guns of French shore batteries, and chose to merely observe and blockade Ganteaume. The following day the wind changed, allowing Ganteaume to return to port, where he spent the rest of the campaign.|$|E

25|$|In retaliation, Belisarius ordered John {{to move on}} Picenum. John, after {{defeating}} a Gothic force under Ulithus, {{an uncle}} of Vitiges, was free to roam the province at will. However, he disobeyed Belisarius' instructions, and {{did not attempt to}} take the fortified towns of Auxinum (modern Osimo) and Urbinum (modern Urbino), judging that they were too strong. Instead, he bypassed them and headed for Ariminum (Rimini), invited there by the local Roman population. Ariminum's capture meant that the Romans had effectively cut Italy in two, but in addition, the city was barely a day's march away from the Gothic capital of Ravenna. Thus, at the news of Ariminum's fall, Vitiges decided to withdraw in all haste towards his capital. 374 days after the siege had begun, the Goths burned their camps and abandoned Rome, marching northeast along the Via Flaminia. But Belisarius led out his forces, <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> half the Gothic army had crossed the Milvian Bridge before attacking the remainder. After initially fierce resistance, the Goths finally broke, and many were slain or drowned in the river.|$|E
25|$|The Army Council instead sanctioned {{a mortar}} attack on Downing Street, and in mid-1990 two IRA members {{travelled}} to London {{to plan the}} attack. One of the IRA members was knowledgeable about the trajectory of mortars and the other, from the IRA's Belfast Brigade, was familiar with their manufacture. An active service unit bought a Ford Transit van and rented a garage, and an IRA co-ordinator procured the explosives and materials {{needed to make the}} mortars. The IRA unit began making the mortars and cutting a hole in the roof of the van for the mortars to be fired through. They reconnoitred locations in Whitehall to find a suitable place from which the mortars could be fired at the back of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence and office. Once preparations were complete the two IRA members returned to Ireland, as the IRA leadership considered them valuable personnel and did not wish to risk them being arrested in any follow-up operation by the security services. In November 1990 Margaret Thatcher unexpectedly resigned from office, but the Army Council decided the planned attack should still go ahead, targeting her successor John Major. The IRA planned to attack when Major and his ministers were likely to be meeting at Downing Street, <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the date of a planned cabinet meeting was publicly known.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual {{declaration of war}} against Germany that was deemed the aggressor {{in the war in}} Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II {{on the side of the}} Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with France or the United Kingdom <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from the German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse. Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in Egypt where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the Battle of Britain. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. The war became prolonged—contrary to Mussolini's plans—resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance.|$|E

25|$|In {{a stroke}} of fortune, Northern Zhou's Emperor Wu {{suddenly}} died and his general Yang Jian attempted to take the throne. This stopped the southern advance of the Northern Troops. The respite was short though as after Yang Jian defeated his rival General Yuchi Jiong, he usurped the throne from Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou and established the Sui dynasty, crowning himself Emperor Wen of Sui. He proceeded to invade the south to reunify China. Emperor Xuan had just died and his incompetent son Chen Shubao (Houzhu of Chen) took power. He was licentious and wasteful, resulting in chaos and corruption in the government; many officials heavily exploited the people, causing great suffering. In planning tactics to defeat the Chen dynasty, Emperor Wen of Sui took the suggestion of his general Gao Jiong <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the South were harvesting their crops to entirely burn the farmland, crippling {{the strength of the}} Chen dynasty. In 588, Emperor Wen of Sui sent his son Yang Guang (who would become Emperor Yang of Sui) to finally vanquish the Chen dynasty. Chen Shubao relied on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River and continued as always with his festive and licentious activities. The next year, Sui forces captured the Chen capital of Jiankang. Chen Shubao and his favorite concubine Zhang Lihua attempted to hide in a well but eventually were captured by Sui forces, thus ending the Chen dynasty.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{two groups}} sent north led by Wilson Zimba was to attack the {{headquarters}} of the Magomero estate, which also stored rifles for part of the Nyasaland Volunteer Reserve. The other group under Jonathon Chigwinya was to attack the Mwanje plantation, a part of the Magomero estate some distance from the headquarters. There would normally have been three European men at the headquarters, William Jervis Livingstone, his assistant Duncan MacCormick (also from the Isle of Lismore) and J T Roach, the Australian estate engineer. But this night Roach was absent. There were also four European women and five children there. Zimba’s men surrounded Livingstone’s house <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the family retired for the night at around 9 pm, when several of them broke in, attacked Livingstone with spears and severely wounded him while he attempted to defend himself, using his rifle as a club. He was apparently still alive when he was decapitated with an axe in front of his wife and two small children in their family bedroom. Duncan MacCormick lived alone in a small cottage a few hundred yards from Livingstone's main estate house. His cottage was not surrounded before the attack on Livingstone, but when MacCormick became aware of the commotion, he ran to investigate without arming himself with his rifle and was speared to death. Roach’s house was attacked after the deaths of Livingstone and MacCormick. When he was found to be absent, two rifles and ammunition he kept there were taken. The whole attack on the headquarters was over by 9.30 pm.|$|E

[...] Yandra attempted to ram the submarine, lost contact, regained contact at 23:03, and dropped six depth charges. At the time of the attack, it was assumed that the depth charges had destroyed or disabled the midget, but M-21 survived.

500|$|Gardner Lake is {{a natural}} lake and is named for the Gardner family which owned {{a large portion of}} the {{surrounding}} area, but the history of the lake itself is more identified as the site of [...] "an extremely public miscalculation". Thomas LeCount, a grocer from Niantic, Connecticut wanted to move his two-story summer house from the south side of the lake to the east side of the lake, but believed that moving the house conventionally would be inefficient. LeCount raised up his fully furnished house and placed it on sleds <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> February 1895 when the lake was frozen. After moving the house about [...] off the south shore, the house slid sideways into a snowbank. The ice cracked as LeCount attempted to pull the house back, before abandoning the work at nightfall. That night, the mill operators utilized some of the lake's water for power and made a gap between the ice and surface of the water, causing the house to crack through the ice and pitch over. LeCount's summer home remained in this position until the spring thaw where it came to rest in [...] of water with the second story and attic positioned above the water like a small lighthouse. For years, the house was the subject of children who fished off it in summer and ice skated through the house in the winter, but an enduring tale told by fishermen is that the house's piano could be heard playing on quiet nights. By 2005, the house was mostly rotted away.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the verdict}} of a {{successful}} D-Day for the 3rd CID, the failure of Canadian units to reach their final objectives has proven more disputed than {{the reasons for their}} success. Terry Copp places the blame on Keller, who committed the entirety of the 9th Brigade reserve to land on the narrower beaches of the 8th Brigade—which was itself still fighting to clear the seaside towns—after receiving reports of poor progress by the 7th Brigade. Dutch historian Dan Van der Vat notes that [...] "the planned breakout of the 9th Brigade was held up by a huge jam of vehicles". Wilmot also places the blame with logistical difficulties of the landing, saying that [...] "on the whole it was not so much the opposition in front as the congestion behind—on the beaches and in Bernières—that prevented the Canadians from reaching their final D-Day objective". Stacey offers a different view, suggesting that it was not impossible for the 3rd CID to reach its D-Day objectives, and that the failure to do so rests in the fact that [...] "British and Canadian forces were usually better at deceiving the enemy and achieving initial success in an assault than they were at exploiting surprise and success once achieved. Perhaps they were rather too easily satisfied". Copp disagrees with Stacey's assessment, suggesting that such caution was not the result of poor planning but of the fact that [...] "the British and Canadians fought the way they had been trained, moving forward to designated objectives in controlled bounds and digging in {{at the first sign of}} a counterattack". He also disputes whether the capture of the final objectives would have been strategically intelligent, observing that [...] "if 9th Brigade had reached Carpiquet and dug in, with artillery in position to offer support, the commander of the 26th Panzer Grenadiers might have followed orders <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> a coordinated counterattack with other divisions had been organized. Such an attack might well have done far more damage to the Allied beachhead than the hastily improvised operation actually carried out [...] ".|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us {{think that it would be}} fun to do [...] And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting for us to do it for a live audience and see if we get live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because we felt we had sort of interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> McCarthy-Miller—a recurring 30 Rock director—was available to helm it.
