5|$|Flower, Sun, <b>and</b> <b>Rain</b> was {{developed}} by Grasshopper Manufacture. The game was conceived by studio founder Goichi Suda, beginning development in 1999 after completion of the studio's debut title The Silver Case. The staff number for The Silver Case was under ten people and thus they had to adjust their development goals based on that. For Flower, Sun, <b>and</b> <b>Rain</b> five or six more people were involved and thus the scope was increased, such as including exploration and action elements. According to Suda, Flower, Sun, <b>and</b> <b>Rain</b> {{was part of the}} studio's transition towards more action-oriented titles. While The Silver Case was published on the original PlayStation, that console was nearing the end of its viable life cycle, so Flower, Sun, <b>and</b> <b>Rain</b> {{was developed}} for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). Flower, Sun, <b>and</b> <b>Rain</b> moved away from the purely text-driven structure of The Silver Case, but it still carried over many of the previous game's themes and concepts. As with The Silver Case, Suda wanted to include puzzles, but felt that he had gone too far with the variety and challenge of puzzles within The Silver Case. Instead, Suda created a single puzzle system revolving around numerical combinations, which both simplified puzzles and tied in with Mondo's character.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} the Florida Straits, the hurricane {{turned to the}} northeast, producing tropical storm winds along the Florida Keys. High rainfall caused flooding, while three tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged houses in the Miami area. The hurricane reached peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) on October6 while moving through the Bahamas. It subsequently weakened and became extratropical on October8. The former hurricane lashed the coast of Nova Scotia with high winds <b>and</b> <b>rain,</b> leaving about $1million (1933CAD) in damage. Rough seas sank several ships and killed nine people in the region. The remnants of the hurricane eventually dissipated on October9 {{to the south of}} Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is loneliness, it uses shoes <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that neither can be controlled or stopped.|$|E
5|$|Data on nesting {{success rates}} is limited; {{one study of}} 35 nests found 28 (80%) {{resulted}} in the fledging {{of at least one}} young currawong.

The PS2 version remained exclusive to Japan, while the DS version received an international release.

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{entered the}} Caribbean as a Category2 {{hurricane}} through the Saint Lucia Channel on August 17. It moved briskly between the Lesser Antillean islands of St. Lucia and Martinique, with its storm surge <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> bands reaching every {{island in the}} chain. Damage was most severe in Martinique where total damage was estimated at €400million and three indirect deaths, while nearby Guadaloupe suffered €400million of damage. In St. Lucia, damage was mostly caused by the high seas and was estimated at US$18million.|$|E
5|$|In Odile's {{developmental}} stage, {{its heavy}} rainfall and storm surge inflicted minor coastal damage across southwestern Mexico and three deaths in Oaxaca and Jalisco. The most significant storm impacts {{occurred on the}} Baja California Peninsula, where damages amounted to approximately MXN$16.6billion (US$1.22billion). Power outages spurred by Odile's intense winds <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> cut electricity to 92%of the population of Baja California Sur. Severe flooding also occurred, causing rivers to swell and the mass evacuation {{of people out of}} hazardous low-lying areas. The remnants of Odile brought rains and unseasonably powerful thunderstorms to the southwestern United States. In total, Odile led to the deaths of 18people throughout its nine-day existence.|$|E

5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{wrote that}} some Han thinkers {{believed}} that rain {{fell from the}} Heavens (i.e. where the stars were located). Wang argued that, although rain fell from above, this common theory was false. He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the evaporation of water on earth, and that since clouds disperse rain, clouds <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the water cycle.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a mixture}} of sand and cement {{was applied to the}} {{external}} faces of the mosque with the intention of protecting the mosque from wind <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> damage. However, this treatment resulted in substantial damage to the building as moisture became trapped in the walls built of mud and started a deterioration process of the structure, with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions. This resulted in part of the mosque collapsing and during the repair work it caused some distortions of the structural elements and the exterior of the mosque.|$|E
