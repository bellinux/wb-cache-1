During an elvish Blood-Oath Celebration, Eragon is changed by a symbolic dragon, giving him elf-like abilities (speed, strength) and completely healing his back as well as all of his other injuries. Eragon then reveals his true feelings to Arya. After much persistence, Arya angrily rejects Eragon's suit. Meanwhile, Nasuada moves the Varden to the separate country of Surda which is ruled by King Orrin, and Roran moves the villagers of Carvahall to Surda, after their village was destroyed by the Ra'zac, who also captured Katrina. Roran is promoted to Captain while Nasuada allows the Urgals to join the ranks of the Varden, even though her decision is opposed by many. Eragon and Saphira confront Murtagh and Thorn, who slew King Hrothgar.Thorn hatched for Murtagh and was magically made <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> Saphira.

Undeclared income from self-employed Greeks (particularly doctors and lawyers) amounted to €28 billion in 2009, more than 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product that year. The state lost €11.2 billion in tax revenues as a result. Above all, ship owners benefit from dozens of tax exemptions. A rapid increase in government revenues through implementing a more effective tax collecting system has been recommended but several successive Greek governments had failed to improve the situation. Implementing proper reforms is estimated to be a slow process, requiring at least two legislative periods before they start to work.|$|R
