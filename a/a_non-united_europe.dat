40|$|Abstract Introduction Osteopetrosis {{introduces}} technical {{limitations to}} the traditional treatment of fracture management that may be minimised with specific pre-operative planning. Extreme care and caution are required when drilling, reaming, or inserting implants in patients with osteopetrosis. Caution must be exercised throughout the postoperative course when these patients are at greatest risk for device failure or further injury. Case presentation We present our experience of treating such a fracture where a patient presented with <b>a</b> <b>non-united</b> fracture of the humerus. The bone was already osteoporotic. We successfully used a new technique {{which has not been}} described in the literature before. This included the use of a high-speed drill to prepare the bone for screw fixation. Bone healing was augmented with bone morphogenic protein. Conclusion This technique can give invaluable experience to surgeons who are involved in treating these types of fracture. </p...|$|R

30|$|SNAC {{is due to}} <b>a</b> <b>non-united</b> {{fracture}} of the scaphoid and is a common cause of wrist arthropathy, with a pattern of osteoarthritic change which {{is very similar to}} the pattern seen with SLAC wrist. Although SNAC and SLAC are in fact two different derangements, they have a similar pathophysiology and therefore SNAC wrist {{can be thought of as}} a variant of SLAC wrist. The difference between these two entities is that as opposed to SLAC where the scapholunate ligament is interrupted with resultant scapholunate diastasis, with SNAC the scaphoid is fractured and the scapholunate ligament and joint are usually preserved. The proximal pole of the fractured scaphoid behaves similar to a small lunate because the fragment is a small spheroid shaped bone which is situated within the spheroidal portion of the scaphoid fossa. This configuration of the non-united scaphoid causes osteoarthritic changes to occur between the radius and the distal scaphoid fracture fragment, progressing proximally but only up to the non-union site [3, 8].|$|R
40|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the relation between ulnar styloid process nonunion and outcome in patients with distal radius fractures.

30|$|The {{importance}} of fibular stabilisation {{in the treatment}} of CPT has been emphasised by several authors. As previously mentioned, persistent fibular non-union favours valgus deformities. Moreover, fibular pseudarthrosis was also found to be related to failure of tibial union [27]. The findings of the current study could not support this statement, as all patients had <b>a</b> resected or <b>non-united</b> fibula. <b>As</b> previously mentioned, there was no intention to obtain fibular union.|$|R
30|$|We {{considered}} pseudarthrosis, fibrous union, or fibrous non-union as <b>a</b> <b>non-united</b> fracture. Yates’ Chi-square {{test was}} used to determine if there were differences in the pooled union rates or pain rates at final follow-up when operative treatment was compared to non-operative treatment. Frequency-weighted means were used to determine the average ages of the patients involved in the study. Ulnar nerve symptoms, deformity, and functional outcomes were analyzed descriptively. Ulnar nerve symptoms were given as an indication for surgery in several studies [e.g., 114], and, hence, it would be inappropriate to apply meta-analytic statistical analysis to them (because, by definition, they would occur more often in the operative group). Deformity was often poorly described and inconsistently documented; as such, we described the findings of the individual studies in our results. Many different definitions of ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ outcomes were described for clinical scoring. As such, it would have been inappropriate to pool this data for the purposes of analysis. Funnel plots were also created to assess for publication bias; reasonably symmetric plots were found, so we concluded that no significant publication bias by small study effects existed. We also regressed the number of operative and non-operative patients by year of publication to assess for publication bias by year; this regression found no significant publication bias by year (P =  0.890 and 0.104, respectively), though there was subjectively a decreasing number of patients treated operatively in later years. Methods of fixation, length of follow-up, and other variables were significantly variable between studies; therefore, a random effects model was constructed using the DerSimonian and Laird model to assess the difference in union rates between operative and non-operative patients in studies which included both types, and pain in operative versus non-operative patients in studies which included both types. Meta-analytic statistics were calculated with MIX software (Kitasato Research Center, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan) [134, 135, 136]; other statistics were calculated with the SPSS package (version 15.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).|$|R
40|$|Infection of the {{shoulder}} joint is a challenging problem for the orthopaedic surgeon. Several treatment options have been proposed. Here, we evaluate the results achieved following resection arthroplasty of {{the shoulder}} in seven patients. We performed resection arthroplasty in seven cases to treat a chronic uncontrollable infection {{of the shoulder}}. Three patients had an infected shoulder arthroplasty, one had <b>an</b> infected <b>non-united</b> arthrodesis, one was treated for an infected osteosynthesis, one had an infected rotator cuff repair and one patient had a septic arthritis of the shoulder joint. All patients were reviewed after a mean of 252 days. The functional outcome was evaluated using the Constant and DASH score. C-Reactive Protein levels were determined to evaluate the presence of residual infection. Except for one doubtful result, all our patients remained free of infection and there was excellent pain relief after the resection. Nevertheless, the functional outcome was poor: the mean Constant score was 25. 7 and the mean DASH score was 69. 3.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThis {{pilot series}} sought {{to assess the}} use of {{external}} ultrasound stimulation (Exogen™) {{in the treatment of}} femoral or tibial non-union. Materials and methodsA continuous retrospective study was conducted from 2004 to 2009. It included patients with <b>a</b> <b>non-united</b> fracture or osteotomy at 6 months or more post-surgery, with less than 10 mm inter-fragment gap. Daily 20 -min ultrasound sessions were continued until bone healing was achieved or for a maximum 6 -month duration. Radio-clinical control was performed at months 3 and 6; treatment compliance and transmitter positioning were checked at each follow-up visit. ResultsSixty non-unions were included in the series. One patient was excluded for early material breakage. Mean fracture-to-surgery interval was 271 days. The 6 -month consolidation rate was 88 %. There was no loss to follow-up. Mean ultrasound treatment duration was 151 days (range, 90 – 240 days). Bone healing correlated significantly with stability of the internal fixation assembly (P= 0. 01). The seven cases of failure included four fixations,considered unstable at inclusion, one femoral non-union associated with BMI 45 and one inadequate subchondral roughening (at the time of arthrodesis). There was a significant difference in delay to non-union treatment start between the groups with (251 days) and without (420 days) bone healing. DiscussionThe present results are in line with the literature. The main prognostic factors were fracture fixation stability, short time to treatment, and inter-fragment gap less than 10 mm. Bone healing rates in the literature are around 80 % for non-union treated at around 6 months, versus 60 % for more than 12 months’ delay. Factors such as gender, bone site, smoking, numbers of previous operations or type of osteosynthesis do not impact consolidation. External treatment offers an alternative to traditional surgery (graft, or bone-marrow concentrate or bone morphogenetic protein injection), provided that the fracture fixation is stable. Bone healing rates are better, and the procedure is non-invasive. External treatment results using ultrasound are similar to those using electromagnetic fields; the main difference lies in treatment session duration, which is 20 min for ultrasound, versus 3 hours for electromagnetic fields. Active patient commitment is vital, as the treatment is delivered at home, although the machine is equipped with a monitor to count treatment cycles. ConclusionThe 88 % bone healing rate supports advocating first-line implementation in non-union of less than 10 mm with stable osteosynthesis. This rate is higher than in traditional surgery, with a unit cost at least 60 % lower: € 1772 for external therapy, versus € 4480 for decortication with or without fracture fixation exchange (itemized 08 c 50 under the French healthcare treatment coding system).

40|$|Objective. We {{analyzed}} the clinical evolution of pancreas allografts in simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) cases after asynchronous kidney allograft loss and kidney retransplantation at <b>a</b> single <b>non-United</b> States center. Patients and Methods. We performed {{a retrospective analysis}} of 168 SPKT from December 2000 to June 2007. Results. the 5 -year kidney allograft survival rate was 71 %. Excluding cases of death with a functioning graft after SPKT (n = 35; 74. 4 %), 12 kidney allografts were lost due to acute rejection (n = 7; 15 %) or chronic allograft nephropathy (n = 5; 10. 6 %). Delayed graft function contributed to kidney allograft loss. Five of 12 patients underwent kidney retransplantation. Sixty percent of pancreas allografts were lost after this procedure, which was attributed to either the diabetogenic effects of the immunosuppressive regimen or to the perioperative stress. Oral glucose tolerance tests performed before kidney retransplantation identified patients with good pancreas allograft function versus those with intolerance on glucose tests who received reduced glucocorticoid doses. Conclusions. in SPKT, pancreas allograft function was seriously affected by kidney retransplantation. Oral glucose tolerance tests performed before kidney retransplantation were helpful to assess beta-cell function and suggest prescription of lower steroid doses to decrease the pancreas allograft dysfunction.
