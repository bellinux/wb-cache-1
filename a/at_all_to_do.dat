5|$|Some {{critics have}} noted {{similarities}} between names in Septimus Heap {{and those in}} Harry Potter, such as Petroc Trelawney (Jenna's pet rock) and Sybill Trelawney (a professor in Harry Potter); also both series feature Boggarts (which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape-shifters in Harry Potter). In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is nothing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise will be known over the air. Think: why would Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly logical... And as for Boggarts, they've been around here in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example. They're not really like either Sage's or Rowling's creatures, but pre-exist either of them.|$|E

Polanyi further {{asserted that}} all knowledge is personal and therefore the scientist must be performing a very personal if not necessarily subjective role when doing science. Polanyi added that the scientist often merely follows intuitions of [...] "intellectual beauty, symmetry, and 'empirical agreement'". Polanyi held that science requires moral commitments {{similar to those found}} in religion.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Lucy Puryear, {{an expert}} witness hired by Yates' defense team, countered their {{contention}} regarding the administration of her antidepressants, saying the dosages prescribed by Dr. Saeed are not uncommon in practice and had nothing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her re-emergent psychosis. She suggested rather that her psychosis returned {{as a result of}} the Haldol having been discontinued by her doctor two weeks earlier. The oral form of haloperidol (Haldol) takes 4–6 days after discontinuation to reach a terminal plasma level of under 1.5%—a medical standard for [...] "complete" [...] elimination of a drug from the body.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{agreeing to}} play at Live 8, he said: [...] "There {{was more than one}} reason, firstly to support the cause. The second one is the energy-consuming and uncomfortable {{relationship}} between Roger and me that I was carrying along in my heart. That is why we wanted to perform and to leave the trash behind. Thirdly, I might have regretted it if I declined." [...] On 20 February 2006, Gilmour commented again on Pink Floyd's future when he was interviewed by Billboard.com, stating, [...] "Who knows? I have no plans <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. My plans are to do my concerts and put my solo record out." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Avi Primor, {{president}} of the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, Grass was the only important German cultural figure who had refused {{to meet with him}} when he served as Israeli ambassador to Germany. Primor noted: [...] "One explanation for [...] strange behavior might be found in the fact that Grass (who despite his poem is probably not the bitter enemy of Israel that one would imagine) had certain personal difficulties with Israel." [...] Primor said that during Grass's earlier visit to Israel, he [...] "was confronted with the anger of an Israeli public that booed him in successive public appearances. To be sure, the Israeli protestors were not targeting Grass personally and their anger had nothing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with his literature. It was the German effort to establish cultural relations with Israel to which they objected. Grass, however, did not see it that way and may well have felt personally slighted." ...|$|E

Several women of social standing were listed as patronesses such as the Duchess of Buccleuch, Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury, Dowager Countess Harcourt, Lady Emily Pusey, Lady Eyre and Lady Mackintosh. At this meeting Richard Martin contradicted the impression held in public circles that he had founded the Society: [...] "I have nothing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it," [...] he said [...] "it is quite a child of Mr Broome's and he has acted the part of a good father to it." [...] Broome also sought that year to develop an anti-vivisection position and requested written advice from several medical practitioners concerning the efficacy of surgical or laboratory experiments on animals and received letters that did not support vivisection.|$|E
2500|$|After the Reactionaries disbanded, Boon and Watt formed Minutemen in January 1980. Watt {{has said}} their name had nothing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the brevity of their songs; rather, it was derived partly from the fabled minutemen militia of colonial times and partly to lampoon a right-wing reactionary {{group of the}} 1960s that went by that name. In the {{documentary}} We Jam Econo, Watt also states that the name was a play on [...] "minute" [...] ( [...] ). After a month with no drummer, during which Boon and Watt wrote their first songs, the band rehearsed and played a couple of early gigs with local welder Frank Tonche on drums. The group had originally wanted George Hurley to join, but he had joined a hardcore punk band called Hey Taxi! with Michael Ely and Spider Taylor after the Reactionaries disbanded. Tonche quit the group, citing a dislike of the audience the band initially drew, and Hurley took over as drummer in June 1980. (Early rehearsal recordings with Tonche on drums later became the georgeless EP.) Their first live gig was as an opening band for Black Flag.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 Beat the Blizzard webzine's article, {{the writer}} Jan Lindsø states that [...] "any metal fans {{are of the}} opinion that Christians should 'not be allowed' to use the black metal {{aesthetics}} musically since they do not inherit this evil and perhaps misantropic [...] trait that many people say is necessary in order to be convincing as black metal musicians". Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. I mean, {{if you want to be}} a Christian, be it with all you've got, and if you want to be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E

The story is about children who have happenings [...] "as they called their adventures", and this may be the first written example of the usage of the word, [...] "happening" [...] in this way. This book was published in French by Editions G. P. in 1962 under the title La famille Cherry de la maison sur la Riviere, translated by Genevieve Meker and illustrated in colour by Pierre Le Guen.

(Car rally quiz, fictional St Dennis Bay setting inspired by Minnis Bay at Birchington-on-Sea, first Black Jack story); (5) Nothing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> (sending messages via animals, set in St Mary Cray); (6) Find me who can!
