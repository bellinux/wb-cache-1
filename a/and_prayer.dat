5|$|In {{the same}} year of 1542, Calvin {{published}} Catéchisme de l'Eglise de Genève (Catechism of the Church of Geneva), which was inspired by Bucer's Kurze Schrifftliche Erklärung of 1534. Calvin had written an earlier catechism during his first stay in Geneva which was largely based on Martin Luther's Large Catechism. The first version was arranged pedagogically, describing Law, Faith, <b>and</b> <b>Prayer.</b> The 1542 version was rearranged for theological reasons, covering Faith first, then Law <b>and</b> <b>Prayer.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lander {{argues that}} the {{structure}} of the work is itself symbolic. As well as the division of the poem into 23 parts, each signifying and describing one day of Donne's illness, each part is itself split in three – representing the Trinity. The use of three elements – Meditation, Expostulation, <b>and</b> <b>Prayer</b> – also matches the three services found in the Book of Common Prayer, a common influence on devotional writers of Donne's era.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to his village, Ramprasad {{spent most of his}} time in sadhana, meditation, <b>and</b> <b>prayer.</b> Traditional accounts tell of several esoteric sadhanas that he performed, including standing neck-deep in the river Ganges, singing songs to Kali. Ramprasad would regularly practice his sadhana in a panchavati: a grove with five trees—banyan, bael, amalaki, ashoka, and peepul—all regarded as holy in Tantric tradition. He would reportedly spend hours meditating on a panchamundi asana (an altar inside which are interred five skulls–that of a snake, frog, rabbit, fox, and man). According to popular stories he had a vision of Kali in her form of Adyashakti Mahamaya.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his first}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, about three months after taking office at the end of May 1723. A festive service at the Nikolaikirche was an annual event, celebrating the inauguration of a new town council, always held on the Monday after St. Bartholomew (August 24). The text by an anonymous poet includes psalm verses and an excerpt from Martin Luther's German Te Deum. It is focused on acknowledgement of authority as a gift of God, thanks for past blessings, <b>and</b> <b>prayer</b> for future help.|$|E

5|$|By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially {{registered}} synagogues <b>and</b> <b>prayer</b> {{houses that}} spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life {{had moved to}} new centres like Podgórze. This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz {{and the development of}} new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{political}} upheaval, the Egyptian temple style continued to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence. Whereas earlier temple building mostly focused on male gods, goddesses and child deities grew increasingly prominent. Temples {{focused more on}} popular religious activities such as oracles, animal cults, <b>and</b> <b>prayer.</b> New architectural forms continued to develop, such as covered kiosks in front of gateways, more elaborate column styles, and the mammisi, a building celebrating the mythical birth of a god. Though {{the characteristics of the}} late temple style had developed by the last period of native rule, most of the examples date from the era of the Ptolemies, Greek kings who ruled as pharaohs for nearly 300 years.|$|E
5|$|Living a worldly {{life during}} the day, he {{reportedly}} spent his evenings in vigils <b>and</b> <b>prayer,</b> putting into practice {{the writings of}} two authors—Marcus Eremita and Diadochos of Photiki—that were {{given to him by}} his spiritual father. It was during this time that Symeon had his first experience of God as divine light, as he described later in one of his Discourses (Disc. 22.2–4). He attributed the experience to the prayers of Symeon the Studite. In spite of the experience, the young Symeon confessed that he still fell into worldly ways of living. Direct personal experience of God was to become one of Symeon's central teachings in his writings, and to the monks who followed him.|$|E

5|$|Nur ad-Din ruled as Zengid emir of Damascus from 1154 {{until his}} death in 1174. He took up {{residence}} in the citadel and rebuilt or refurbished its residential structures. After an earthquake hit Damascus in 1170, Nur ad-Din built a wooden house for sleeping <b>and</b> <b>prayer</b> next to the original stone residence of the citadel. In addition, he built a mosque and a fountain in the citadel. Between 1165 and 1174, Nur ad-Din re-fortified Damascus with a concentric wall, and it is possible that he also strengthened the defences of the citadel. Nur ad-Din died of an illness in the citadel on 15 May 1174 and was buried there; his body was later transferred to the Nur ad-Din Madrasah in Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 {{attacks on}} Christians in {{southern}} Karnataka {{refer to the}} wave of attacks directed against Christian churches <b>and</b> <b>prayer</b> halls in the Indian city of Mangalore {{and the surrounding area}} of southern Karnataka in September and October 2008 by Hindu extremist organisations, Bajrang Dal and the Sri Ram Sena. The attacks were widely perceived by Christians in southern Karnataka to be punishment from right-wing Hindu nationalist organisations because they had been outspoken about Christian persecution in Orissa, after the assassination of Hindu monk Swami Lakshmanananda Saraswati allegedly by local christian community and also because the New Life Fellowship Trust (NLFT), a non-denominational Christian Church, was alleged by Bajrang Dal to be responsible for forced conversions of Hindus to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|The poem is {{described}} as a poem of water and hope. It begins with images of the sea, water, and of Eliot's past; this water later becomes a metaphor for life and how humans act. This transitions into an image of a ringing bell and a discussion on time <b>and</b> <b>prayer.</b> Images of men drowning dominate the section before leading into how science and ideas on evolution separate mankind from properly understanding the past. This ends with Krishna stating that the divine will, and not future benefits or rewards, matters. The fourth section is a prayer to the Virgin Mary for fishermen, sailors, and the drowned.|$|E
