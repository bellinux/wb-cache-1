5|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{domestic}} country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from the government to the firm hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> easily polarized such as I−. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion + is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form +; silver salts are dissolved in photography due {{to the formation of}} the thiosulfate complex 3−; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex −. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C≡N→Ag–C≡N→}; silver thiocyanate has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine complexes +.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E

25|$|Another female {{tactic to}} counter {{coercion}} {{is to try}} to avoid males that may cause them harm. To do this, females often change their habitats to get away from aggressive males, as is seen in wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Female bottlenose dolphins behave in similar ways by moving into shallow waters where there <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> many males. Other species that practice mate avoidance are Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis, a species of damselfly, who often try to hide from large groups of males to avoid harassment.|$|E

The most significant decision on limiting primary picketing is BCGEU v. BC (1988) where employees at the British Columbia Supreme Court, who were protesting as part of a province-wide public service employee strike, were ordered back to work by the Chief Justice of the court. The order was found to clearly violate section 2(b) but the Supreme Court upheld it on section 1.|$|E

25|$|The loon, {{the size}} of a large duck or small goose, resembles these birds in shape when swimming. Like ducks and geese but unlike coots (which are Rallidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae), the loon's toes are {{connected}} by webbing. The bird may be confused with cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> distant relatives of divers and like them are heavy set birds whose bellies – unlike those of ducks and geese – are submerged when swimming. Flying loons resemble plump geese with seagulls' wings that are relatively small in proportion to the bulky body. The bird points its head slightly upwards during swimming, but less so than cormorants. In flight the head droops more than in similar aquatic birds.|$|E
25|$|Running from Zonguldak in {{the west}} to Rize in the east, the narrow coastal strip widens at several places into fertile, {{intensely}} cultivated deltas. The Samsun area, close to the midpoint, is a major tobacco-growing region; east of it are numerous citrus groves. East of Samsun, the area around Trabzon is world-renowned for the production of hazelnuts, and farther east the Rize region has numerous tea plantations. All cultivable areas, including mountain slopes wherever they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> steep, are sown or used as pasture. The mild, damp climate of the Black Sea coast makes commercial farming profitable. The western part of the Black Sea region, especially the Zonguldak area, is a center of coal mining and heavy industry.|$|E
25|$|The ancient {{library of}} the White Monastery {{is rich in}} many {{categories}} such biblical, hagiographical, liturgical, etc. This provides the researcher with good knowledge about what the monks were reading {{and what they were}} allowed to read at different stages of the monastery development. However, the early times <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> well represented in the surviving fragments, This can be either attributed to their frequent use or simply they were victims of time and of decline of the monastery in later times. The dialect of these manuscripts were predominantly in Sahidic Coptic, which was perfected in its literary form by Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite. There were also some bilingual manuscripts. The early ones were in Sahidic Coptic and Greek, while the latter ones had Sahidic Coptic and Arabic. The writing material employed were mostly parchment, because of its prevalence, but some of the later ones were found on paper.|$|E

In particular, we prove that if the gas <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> dense, the classical Fisher-Hartwig conjecture holds for the discrete Toeplitz determinant as well. Our analysis suggests that if the gas is any denser than this, the formula needs to be modified...|$|R
25|$|Members of the Sparassidae {{are common}} in Australia, but also in many warm-temperate-to-tropical parts of the world. They have been accidentally {{introduced}} to {{many parts of the}} world, including South America, southern parts of the United States, such as Florida, Guam and Puerto Rico and western parts of Texas and Northwest Tennessee, Pakistan, India, China, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines. Heteropoda venatoria can be found in Hawaii, where it is commonly known as the cane spider. In general {{they are likely to be}} found wherever ships may bring them as unintended passengers to areas that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> cold for them to survive in the winter. In some uncommon scenarios, some sightings have been in colder climates, such as New York, Ohio, and Maine. Typically, the huntsman finds shelter in warehouses, and warm buildings. In southern Africa they are commonly known as rain spiders because of their tendency to seek shelter before rain storms, often entering human habitations when doing so.|$|E
25|$|In cool climates (such as in {{the high}} Arctic or at high elevations), the depth of a scrape nest can be {{critical}} to both the survival of developing eggs and the fitness of the parent bird incubating them. The scrape must be deep enough that eggs are protected from the convective cooling caused by cold winds, but shallow enough that they and the parent bird <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> exposed to the cooling influences of ground temperatures, particularly where the permafrost layer rises to mere centimeters below the nest. Studies have shown that an egg within a scrape nest loses heat 9% more slowly than an egg placed on the ground beside the nest; in such a nest lined with natural vegetation, heat loss is reduced by an additional 25%. The insulating factor of nest lining is apparently so critical to egg survival that some species, including Kentish plovers, will restore experimentally altered levels of insulation to their pre-adjustment levels (adding or subtracting material as necessary) within 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|These rural {{appliances}} {{are extremely}} important for keeping South Australia protected from fires. Almost every town in South Australia would {{have at least}} two of these rural fire trucks. The reason that there are many different types of rural trucks, is because the terrain changes a lot in South Australia. A 14 appliance, only carries 1000 litres nominally but is extremely useful for getting into small tracks which larger appliances can not. Large 34s often have trouble in getting into smaller areas. 24s are the most common, because they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> heavy and big, but carry a reasonable amount of water, which can last a good time before having to fill up. In most parts of South Australia outside major centres there is no water mains, so this is where Bulk Water Carriers come in handy. These BWCs, often at a rural fire, will be stationary at the edge of it, for smaller trucks to fill up from. when empty it is their job to go and find water in places including, rivers, dams, swimming pools and water tanks.|$|E
