40|$|In this work, various aerosol {{particle}} transport and deposition mechanisms were studied through the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modeling, including inertial impaction, gravitational effect, lift force, interception, and turbophoresis, within different practical applications including aerosol sampling inlet, filtration system and turbulent pipe flows. The objective of the research is to obtain {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms that affect {{aerosol particle}} transport and deposition, and to determine the feasibility and accuracy of using commercial CFD tools in predicting performance of aerosol sampling devices. Flow field simulation was carried out first, and then followed by Lagrangian particle tracking to obtain the aerosol transport and deposition information. The CFD-based results were validated with experimental data and empirical correlations. In the simulation of the aerosol inlet, CFD-based penetration was in excellent agreement with experimental results, and the most significant regional particle deposition occurred due to inertial separation. At higher free wind speeds gravity had less effect on particle deposition. An empirical equation for efficiency prediction was developed considering inertial and gravitational effects, which will be useful for directing design of similar aerosol inlets. In the simulation of aerosol deposition on a screen, a "virtual surface" approach, which eliminates the need for the often-ambiguous user defined functions, was developed to account for particle deposition due to interception. The CFD-based results had a good agreement compared with experimental results, and also with published empirical correlations for interception. In the simulation of <b>turbulent</b> <b>deposition</b> in pipe flows, the relation between particle deposition velocity and wall-normal turbulent velocity fluctuation was quantitative determined for the first time, which could be used to quantify <b>turbulent</b> <b>deposition,</b> without having to carry out Lagrangian particle tracking. It suggested that the Reynolds stress model and large eddy simulation would lead to the most accurate simulated aerosol deposition velocity. The prerequisites were that the wall-adjacent y+ value was sufficiently low, and that sufficient number of prism layers was applied in the near-wall region. The "velocity fluctuation convergence" would be useful criterion for judging the adequacy of a CFD simulation for <b>turbulent</b> <b>deposition...</b>|$|R

40|$|Ozone {{is a key}} {{trace gas}} in the troposphere; {{because it is a}} {{greenhouse}} gas, it is very reactive, and it is potentially toxic to humans, fauna, and vegetation. The main sink processes for ozone are chemical reactions and the <b>turbulent</b> <b>deposition</b> flux to the earth’s surface. The deposition process itself is rather complex: The interactions between co-varying drivers such as the tropospheric ozone concentration, turbulence, and chemical reactions are not well understood. In the case of ozone deposition to vegetation, another aspect that must be studied is the role of stomatal regulation {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Therefore, we measured <b>turbulent</b> <b>deposition</b> fluxes of ozone with the eddy covariance technique during the peak of the growing season in 2014 over a managed, rewetted peatland in NW Germany. The deposition flux was large during the day (up to − 15 nmol m− 2 s− 1) and relatively small during the night (between − 1 and − 2 nmol m− 2 s− 1). Flux partitioning by applying the surface resistance analogy and further analysis showed that the stomatal uptake was smaller than non-stomatal deposition. The correction of stomatal conductance with the gross primary production (GPP) improved the estimation of day- and nighttime stomatal deposition fluxes. Statistical analysis confirmed that the friction velocity (u*) was the single most important driver of non-stomatal ozone deposition and that relationships with other environmental drivers are not linear and highly variable. Further research is needed to develop a better process understanding of non-stomatal ozone deposition, to quantify the role of surface deposition to the ozone budget of the atmospheric boundary layer, and to estimate uncertainties associated with the partitioning of ozone deposition into stomatal and non-stomatal fluxes...|$|R

Next to {{legislative}} initiatives to lower atmospheric pollutants, much research has been conducted on the potential of urban trees as mitigation tool for atmospheric particles. While leaf-deposited dust has shown to vary significantly throughout single tree crowns, this study evaluated the influence of micro-scale tree crown morphology (leaf density) on the amount of leaf-deposited dust. Using a ground-based LiDAR approach, the three-dimensional tree crown morphology was obtained and compared to gravimetric measurements of leaf-deposited dust within three different size fractions (> 10, 3 – 10 and 0. 2 – 3 µm). To our knowledge, this is the first application of ground-based LiDAR for comparison with gravimetric results of leaf-deposited particulate matter. Overall, an increasing leaf density appears to reduce leaf-deposition of atmospheric particles.

A new stochastically weighted operator splitting Monte Carlo (SWOSMC) method is first proposed and developed in the present study in which weighted numerical particles and operator splitting technique are coupled in order to reduce statistical error and accelerate the simulation of particle-fluid systems undergoing simultaneous complex aerosol dynamic processes. This new SWOSMC method is first validated by comparing its simulation results with the corresponding analytical solution for the selected cases. Some cases involving the evolution and formation of complex particle processes in fluid-particle systems are studied using this SWOSMC method. The obtained results are compared with those obtained by the sectional method and good agreement is obtained. Computational analysis indicates that this new SWOSMC method has high computational efficiency and accuracy in solving complex particle-fluid system problems, particularly simultaneous aerosol dynamic processes. In order to solve multi-dimensional aerosols dynamics interacting with continuous fluid phase, this validated SWOSMC method for population balance equation (PBE) is coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) under the Eulerian-Lagrangian reference frame.

Inclusion <b>turbulent</b> <b>deposition</b> is investigated using direct numerical simulation of the liquid flow combined with Lagrangian particle tracking under conditions of one-way coupling. The interface is modelled as a non-deformable free-slip surface. Unsheared turbulence is generated by random forcing in a finite-height region parallel to the free-slip surface. In between, the turbulence diffuses toward the free surface. The inclusions are randomly introduced in the forcing region and tracked through the diffusion region up to the interface. In the particle dynamic equation, the buoyancy force, the Stokes drag, the pressure drag and the added mass are considered. Close to the interface, the hydrodynamic interactions (i. e. lubrication effects) between the inclusion and the free surface may {{be taken into account}} as well as the Van der Waals forces. Numerical simulations were performed with surface Reynolds numbers ranging from 68 to 235. The inclusion diameter varied between 10 - 5 m and 5. 10 - 5 m and the particle to liquid density ratio between 0. 5 and 1. For these sets of parameters, it appears that the inertia effects are very weak. The deposition of buoyant inclusions is controlled by sedimentation whereas for nonbuoyant inclusions, direct interception is the only deposition mechanism. In the latter case, the deposition velocity strongly depends on. It is shown that the deposition velocity made dimensionless by the free surface characteristic velocity scales as the inclusion diameter made dimensionless by the Kolmogorov length scale calculated at the free surface. Lastly, the effect of lubrication is examined: it can significantly reduce the direct interception contribution of the deposition velocity...|$|R

In the study of growth/evaporation of particles due to (water) vapour in the atmosphere, it is usual {{to assume that the}} vapour is diluted and the temperature is uniform enough in the environment. These assumptions cannot be applied to heat exchanger condensers, where the gas mixture is enriched in water vapour (vs. the concentration of an incondensable). An added difficulty is the large value of water latent heat. Therefore, the equations that describe the phenomenon in the atmosphere should be corrected We present a model for vapour condensation in a double pipe best exchanger. The main physical processes in the gas/aerosol atmosphere flowing between coaxial cylinders, being the internal one cooled by a refrigerant, are modellized. The model takes into account: conduction and convection; film vapour condensation; the aerosol particle size distribution (PSD); heterogeneous nucleation in non-diluted conditions; some particle phenomena: gravitational and <b>turbulent</b> <b>deposition,</b> thermophoresis and difussiophoresis; and mass, momentum and energy balances in the heat exchanger. ln the model, the particles (liquid water coming from condensed vapour with a log-normal PSD) are injected in the system at the heat exchanger inlet.

For example, the mean size of the particles grows as the flow runs {{towards the end of the}} exchanger, but some of them disappesr eventually.

The log-normally distributed concentrations of 210 Pb, with a median of 0. 141 mBq m− 3 over the monitoring period, indicated a surface source and dispersion by wind. The concentrations were largest in air with trajectories over terrestrial surfaces, consistent with soil as the source, and smallest in air with marine trajectories and also air masses subject to precipitation, the main removal process for aerosol bound 210 Pb. Concentrations of 7 Be were largest during spring which is consistent with a stratospheric origin and, like 210 Pb, concentrations were smaller in air masses subject to precipitation. Measurements of 210 Pb and 7 Be in tree foliage, precipitation and throughfall water beneath tree canopies were used to investigate the transport pathway of these isotopes from the atmosphere to soil. The measurements showed that the 210 Pb aerosols attach and bind effectively to foliar surfaces, so that deposition to soil relies mainly on leaf fall. In open parkland trees, the distribution of the falling leaves determines the deposition of the 210 Pb. Foliar surfaces effectively filter 7 Be from precipitation as it passes through the woodland canopy. Studies of soil inventories of 210 Pb beneath woodland and grassland, undisturbed for several half-lives of the isotope, were used to deduce annual average fluxes, wet deposition, cloud droplet deposition and dry deposition of aerosols onto these surfaces.

40|$|Abstract [...] During a {{study of}} marine aerosol {{characteristics}} ata coastal site on South Uist in the Outer Hebrides, early in August 1986, an extended period with untypically low wind speeds (below 7 m s- 1) was experienced. Over this period, lasting several days, very low particle concentrations were measured for all observed particle radii from 0. 09 to 23. 5 /~m, and atmospheric visibilities of up to 80 km were noted. Particles larger than about 0. 2 #m in radius howed a decline in concentration throughout this episode, suggesting that these data could yield information on particle loss rates, {{as well as providing}} a true very low wind speed background aerosol distribution for this region of the North Atlantic. Analysis of these data indicates that the decay of aerosol concentration, for all particle radii greater than 0. 25 gm, may be approximated by an exponential function, and is consistent with a simple model of <b>turbulent</b> dry <b>deposition</b> of the aerosol to the ocean surface.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between submarine sediment gravity flows {{and the character}} of their deposits is poorly understood. Annular flume experiments were used to investigate the depositional dynamics and deposits of waning sediment-laden flows. Decelerating fast (> 3 m/s) flows with fixed sand content (10 vol%) and variable mud content (0 – 17 vol%) resulted in only four deposit types. Clean sand with a mud cap that resembled a turbidity current deposit (turbidite) formed if the flow was <b>turbulent</b> when <b>deposition</b> began, or if the muddy fluid had insufficient strength to suspend the sand. The clean sand could contain structures if mud content was low ( 300 s. Ungraded muddy sand with a mud cap that resembled a debris-flow deposit (debrite) formed if the flow became laminar before sand could deposit. Clean sand overlain by ungraded muddy sand and a mud cap formed either from a transitional flow or by late-stage settling of sand from a muddy suspension. These deposits resemble enigmatic submarine flow deposits called linked debrite-turbidites. The experiments {{provide a basis for}} inferring flow type from deposit character for submarine sediment-laden flows. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. – Networks of {{caustics}} {{can occur}} {{in the distribution of}} particles suspended in a randomly moving gas. These can facilitate coagulation of particles by bringing them into close proximity, even in cases where the trajectories do not coalesce. The long-time morphology of these caustic patterns depends upon the Lyapunov exponents λ 1, λ 2 of the suspended particles, as well as the rate J at which particles encounter caustics. We develop a theory determining the quantities J, λ 1, λ 2 from the statistical properties of the gas flow, in the limit of short correlation times. Aerosols are usually unstable systems, in that the suspended particles eventually coagulate. Understanding the process giving rise to this coagulation, and determining the time scale over which it occurs are important questions in describing any aerosol system. If the gas phase does not have macroscopic motion, the coagulation may be effected by diffusion of the suspended particles, or (if the suspended particles are of a volatile substance) by Ostwald ripening. The coagulation process can be greatly accelerated if the aerosol undergoes macroscopic internal motion. Ultrasound, for example, has been used to accelerate coagulation in <b>aerosols</b> [1]. <b>Turbulent</b> flow could also {{play a role in the}} coagulation of suspended particles; this could b...|$|R
40|$|The Generation IV Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) {{is being}} {{considered}} as a promising concept to produce electricity or process heat with high efficiencies and unique safety features. The PBMR is a high-temperature, helium-cooled, graphite moderated reactor. The fuel elements consist of 6 cm diameter spherical graphite “pebbles ” containing each thousands of uranium dioxide microspheres. As the pebbles continually rub against {{one another in the}} core, a significant quantity of graphite dust can be released in the reactor coolant system. These dust particles, which contain some amounts of fission products, are transported and deposited on pebbles as well as primary circuit surfaces. It is therefore of great safety interest to develop and benchmark numerical approaches for predicting deposition of dust particles in the various locations of the PBMR primary circuit. In this investigation, we address <b>turbulent</b> particle <b>deposition</b> on the pebbles using the ANSYS-Fluent CFD code. We simulate particulate flows around linear arrays of spheres and compare deposition rates against experiments. It is found that the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) combined with the Continuous Random Walk (CRW) to supply fluctuating velocity components predicts deposition rates that are generally within the scatter of the data. ...|$|R
