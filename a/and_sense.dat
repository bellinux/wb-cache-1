5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood {{with the group}} of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, {{risk-taking}} men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the frail and sickly vice-President in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Eventually {{many of the young}} men in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence <b>and</b> <b>sense</b> of story.) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.|$|E
30|$|A new {{notion of}} random {{filtering}} structure-based compressive sensing radar was proposed in this paper. To decrease the coherence between the sparse representation <b>and</b> <b>sensing</b> matrices, a computational framework for optimizing the transmit waveform <b>and</b> <b>sensing</b> matrix separately <b>and</b> simultaneously was introduced. We showed that optimized transmit waveform <b>and</b> <b>sensing</b> matrices lead to smaller mutual coherence between different target responses. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to verify whether our optimized results satisfy RIP. Simulation results demonstrate that our optimized results can obey RIP with much higher sparsity than nonoptimized waveform <b>and</b> <b>sensing</b> matrix. As we can see, the reconstruction accuracy was significantly improved by the optimized transmit waveform <b>and</b> <b>sensing</b> matrices {{for a given}} target scene.|$|R

While {{in the previous}} two subsystems, AR had lower requirements than VE, {{which is not the}} case for tracking <b>and</b> <b>sensing.</b> In this area, the requirements for AR are much stricter than those for VE systems. A major reason for this is the registration problem that makes the tracking <b>and</b> <b>sensing</b> requirements higher than the VE requirements.|$|R

5|$|Johansson {{learned some}} Russian {{from a former}} teacher {{on the phone for}} her role of Black Widow in The Avengers (2012), another entry from the MCU. The film {{received}} positive reviews and broke many box office records, becoming the third highest-grossing film both in the United States and worldwide. For her performance, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards and three People's Choice Awards. Later that year, Johansson portrayed the actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert believed that Johansson did not look much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, <b>and</b> <b>sense</b> of humor.|$|E

5|$|The greater noctule bat {{belongs to}} the {{suborder}} Microchiroptera and uses echolocation. Echolocation is a perceptual system where echoes are produced by emitting ultrasonic sounds. Echolocation allows bats to compare the outgoing pulse with returning echoes which produces detailed images of the bat's surroundings. With echolocation, bats are able to detect, localize and classify their prey in complete darkness. The greater noctule bat has been observed as only emerging from its roosts well after dusk when it is completely dark. The greater noctule bat has keen hearing <b>and</b> <b>sense</b> of smell, however its eyes are poorly developed.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte's Way, {{formerly}} known as Hill House, {{is located in a}} prominent setting close to Saint Paul's Church of Ireland church. This house was once the home of Charlotte Brontë's husband, Mr. Nicholls, who returned to Banagher after Charlotte's death. Nicholls remarried and lived at Hill House until his death in 1906. The house was sold to a Major Bell in 1919. He died in 1944 and his wife inherited the property. Florence Bell died in 1959. This connection to Brontë, one of the most renowned writers of the 19th century, is revealed in its present name, giving the house cultural interest. It is a detached three-bay two-storey house, built in 1753, with a gabled central bay to the façade with modern porch and single-bay two-storey wing to the south and two-bay two-storey wing to the north. It is now used as a bed and breakfast and visitors can enjoy its restored appearance <b>and</b> <b>sense</b> the history of a place connected in a curious way with the Brontë family.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force on 26 May 1915, and was posted to the 4th Light Horse Brigade as a private. He {{departed}} for Egypt aboard the transport A29 Suevic on 13 June. Serving as a driver first in the Middle East {{and then on the}} Western Front, his mechanical ability <b>and</b> <b>sense</b> of adventure led him to volunteer for the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in December 1916. After qualifying as a pilot in England, he was commissioned a lieutenant and posted to No.2 Squadron. Commanded by Major Oswald Watt, No.2 Squadron's personnel included many former Lighthorsemen, as well as mechanics from the AFC's first combat formation, the Mesopotamian Half Flight. The force trained extensively in England commencing in January 1917, before deploying to the Western Front that September. Holden was involved in the AFC's first day of combat in France; just after noon on 2 October, in the vicinity of Saint-Quentin, he and his wingman engaged a German two-seater that managed to escape.|$|E

In the meantime, Suddhodana attempted to foil Koṇḍañña's prediction because he wanted his son to succeed him in ruling and expanding the kingdom. Suddhodana made intricate arrangements to shield Siddhartha from all worldly suffering in order to steer his mind away from spiritual matters, pampering him with all the material luxury <b>and</b> <b>sense</b> pleasures that he could find. However, Siddhartha finally persuaded his father to allow him out of the palace to meet his subjects. Suddhodana agreed, but attempted to present a sanitised image of human existence by ordering beggars, old people and sick people to be kept from the streets. Despite this, Siddhartha saw the four sights which prompted him to reevaluate his view of the world.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry has {{a variety}} of causes. Radial {{symmetry}} suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth <b>and</b> <b>sense</b> organs (cephalisation), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be). More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.|$|E
5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds {{almost exclusively on}} carrion. It finds its food using its keen eyes <b>and</b> <b>sense</b> of smell, flying low enough to detect the gases produced by {{the beginnings of the}} process of decay in dead animals. In flight, it uses thermals to move through the air, flapping its wings infrequently. It roosts in large community groups. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It nests in caves, hollow trees, or thickets. Each year it generally raises two chicks, which it feeds by regurgitation. It has very few natural predators. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.|$|E

The emphasis of interactive <b>and</b> cooperative <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> control {{is given to the}} distribution of mutually nonexclusive subtasks to man and machine, the interactive invocation of subtasks under the man/machine symbiotic relationship, and the fusion of information and decision-making between man and machine according to their confidence measures. The proposed interactive <b>and</b> cooperative <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> control system is composed of such major functional blocks as the logical sensor system, the sensor-based local autonomy, the virtual environment formation, and the cooperative decision-making between man and machine.
