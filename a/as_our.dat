5|$|Due to {{budgetary}} constraints, {{the production}} {{was not able}} to shoot the remounted scenes of episode one in the north-east, and they instead had to be filmed in and around Watford. Beach-set scenes were shot at Folkestone rather than Whitley Bay, which was obvious to locals on screen due to the presence of pebbles on the beach, which are not present at Whitley. This led to some critics mockingly referring to the production <b>as</b> <b>Our</b> Friends in the South.|$|E
5|$|GK Persei, {{also known}} as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that {{appeared}} halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost as bright as Capella and Vega. It faded to magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, {{is one of the}} hottest bright stars in the sky, with a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It {{is one of the more}} massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous <b>as</b> <b>our</b> Sun.|$|E

5|$|Located at the {{northern}} edge of the constellation and just southwest of Achernar is Alpha Hydri, a white sub-giant star of magnitude 2.9, situated 72 light-years from Earth. Of spectral type F0IV, it is beginning to cool and enlarge as it uses up its supply of hydrogen. It is twice as massive and 3.3 times as wide <b>as</b> <b>our</b> sun and 26 times more luminous. A line drawn between Alpha Hydri and Beta Centauri is bisected by the south celestial pole.|$|E
5|$|Nu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive <b>as</b> <b>our</b> sun, {{and likely to}} be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 ± 0.01 (2.45 · 108) cm·s−2, or approximately 250,000 of Earth's.|$|E

5|$|The Big Bang {{is not an}} {{explosion}} of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, space itself expands with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not {{an explosion}} in space, but rather an expansion of space. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such <b>as</b> <b>our</b> galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.|$|E
5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main olfactory bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, <b>as</b> <b>our</b> olfactory sense is not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both the squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the granule cell layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E

Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred <b>as</b> <b>our</b> historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
