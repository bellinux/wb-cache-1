He had gradually been led to think of the absent husband with what he believed to be her own feelings--as of some impalpable, fleshless ancestor from whose remote presence she derived power, wealth, and importance, but to whom she owed only respect and certain obligations of honor equal to his own. He had never heard her speak of her husband with love, with sympathy, with fellowship, with regret. She had barely spoken of him at all, and then rather as an <b>attractive</b> <b>factor</b> in her own fascinations than a bar to a free indulgence in them. He was as little in her way as--his children. With what grace she had adapted herself to his--Don Ramon's--life--she who frankly confessed she had no sympathy with her husband's! With what languid enthusiasm she had taken up the customs of HIS country, while deploring the habits of her own! With what goddess-like indifference she had borne this interval of waiting! And yet this woman--who had seemed the embodiment of romance--had received the announcement of his sacrifice--the only revelation he allowed himself to make of his hopeless passion--with the frigidity of a duenna! Had he wounded her in some other unknown way? Was she mortified that he had not first declared his passion--he who had never dared to speak to her of love before? Perhaps she even doubted it! In his ignorance of the world he had, perhaps, committed some grave offense! He should not have let her go! He should have questioned, implored her--thrown himself at her feet!

40|$|Purpose - The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (hereinafter {{referred}} to as Hong Kong) is an international leading commercial hub, particularly in Asia. In order to keep up its reputation a number of large public works projects have been considered. Public-private partnership (PPP) has increasingly been suggested for these projects, but the suitability of using this procurement method in Hong Kong {{is yet to be}} studied empirically. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to specifically consider whether PPPs should be used to procure public works projects in Hong Kong by studying the <b>attractive</b> and negative <b>factors</b> for adopting PPP. Design/methodology/approach - As part of this study a questionnaire survey was conducted with industrial practitioners. The respondents were requested to rank the importance of 15 <b>attractive</b> <b>factors</b> and 13 negative factors for adopting PPP. Findings - The results found that in general the top <b>attractive</b> <b>factors</b> ranked by respondents from Hong Kong were efficiency related: these included "Provide an integrated solution (for public infrastructure/services) ", "Facilitate creative and innovative approaches", and "Solve the problem of public sector budget restraint". It was found that Australian respondents also shared similar findings to those in Hong Kong, but the UK respondents showed a higher priority to those economic driven <b>attractive</b> <b>factors.</b> Also, the ranking of the <b>attractive</b> and negative <b>factors</b> for adopting PPP showed that on average the <b>attractive</b> <b>factors</b> were scored higher than the negative factors. Originality/value - The results of this research have enabled a comparison of the <b>attractive</b> and negative <b>factors</b> for adopting PPP between three administrative systems. These findings have confirmed that PPP is a suitable means to procure large public projects, which are believed to be useful and interesting to PPP researchers and practitioners.

One decisive element {{for the development of}} industry cluster is the human intelligence capital deployed. Then how to attract abundant competent human resources becomes an essential tacit. However, literatures on this theme are few. In this research, firstly,the <b>attractive</b> <b>factors</b> of industry cluster for human capital are distinguished based on the review of previous literatures focusing on the characteristics of industry cluster with the aim to propel its development. Furthermore, case study is adopted here describing a survey conducted in Shunde, a most concentrated area of industry clusters in South China. Three typical clusters, household appliances, furniture and flower clusters in Shunde are visited and Interviews are carried out toward target interviewees and questionnaires are issued to get data for the analysis. Next, the <b>attractive</b> <b>factors</b> are ranked considering the literature and empirical study result.

5000|$|The {{rise in the}} {{affordability}} {{of immigration}} reduced emigrants’ need for external financing {{in the form of}} indentures. David Galenson’s analysis on affordability shows that the cost of immigration from Britain to the United States {{over the course of the}} 18th Century dropped from 50% of per capita income to less than 10%. This is attributable to higher levels of real income in Europe (a result of economic growth in the 18th Century) and to a sharp decline in transportation costs. Innovation had a strong impact on the ease and cost of passenger transportation, reducing the need of indentures. The railroad made non-port cities a much cheaper destination for immigrants. The steamboat was not necessarily cheaper than older sailing technologies, but it made transatlantic travel much easier and comfortable, an <b>attractive</b> <b>factor</b> for high-income classes (that could easily afford immigration without indentures). [...] The British Navy’s efforts against piracy also reduced transportation costs. Safer seas implied smaller crews (for there was no need to man weapons on board) and also reduced insurance costs (ships were at lower risk of being captured). The composition of immigrants also shifted from single males towards entire families. Single males usually left their homes with little if any savings. Instead, families generally liquidated assets in Europe to finance their venture.|$|E

3000|$|Vax 1 or Pax 2 {{knockout}} mice have no optic chiasm formation {{with all}} RGC axons projecting ipsilaterally and coloboma eyes with unsealed retina. Vax 1 is secreted from the ventral hypothalamus and diffuses to the RGC axons, playing {{an essential role}} in the RGC axonal growth at the chiasm (Kim et al., 2014). In Vax 1 −/− mutant mice, the RGC axons do not enter the brain but stall outside the presumptive chiasm (Bertuzzi et al., 1999). One possible mechanism is that the expression of <b>attractive</b> <b>factor</b> Netrin is reduced or lost along the RGC axon pathway to chiasm, producing overwhelming repulsive forces on contralateral projections. By contrast, RGC axons in Pax 2 null knockout mice project ipsilaterally only, due to the loss of activity gene sonic-hedgehog (shh) expression gap along the A-P axis where the contralateral projections go (Torres et al., 1996). Consequently, neither Vax 1 nor Pax 2 is a path-defining gene. Instead, they can prohibit the formation of the optic chiasm.|$|E
