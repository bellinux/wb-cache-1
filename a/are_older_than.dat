As a result, the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain has also been proposed by geoscientists to be a mix of ridge and mantle plume volcanism.|$|E

5|$|Cheetah fossils {{found in}} the lower beds of the Olduvai Gorge site in {{northern}} Tanzania {{date back to the}} Pleistocene. The extinct species of Acinonyx <b>are</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the cheetah, with the oldest known from the late Pliocene; these fossils are about three million years old. These species include Acinonyx pardinensis (Pliocene epoch), notably larger than the modern cheetah, and A.intermedius (mid-Pleistocene period). While the range of A.intermedius stretched from Europe to China, Apardinensis spanned over Eurasia as well as eastern and southern Africa. A variety of larger cheetah believed to have existed in Europe fell to extinction around half a million years ago.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the sixteen}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence <b>are</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they <b>are</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E

25|$|The Wellington/Wairarapa {{wine-growing}} region {{is one of}} New Zealand's smallest, with several sub-regions, which include Gladstone, Martinborough, Masterton, and Opaki.

As a consequence, many of the vineyards established there <b>are</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> their counterparts {{in the rest of the}} Wairarapa. Subtle differences are seen in the wines from the South Wairarapa (which includes Martinborough), which has more maritime influences, to those grown further north.|$|E
