5|$|Although briefly {{a part of}} the Pola Flotilla at commissioning, UB-8 {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her German career patrolling the Black Sea as part of the Constantinople Flotilla. The U-boat sank two ships. One of them, , was disguised by the British Admiralty as a Royal Navy battlecruiser as part of <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> operation. In October, she helped repel a Russian bombardment of Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was rearmed with light weapons and was {{converted}} into a blockship and was then modified into <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> with dummy gun turrets. Centurion {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.|$|E

5|$|Seizing the {{opportunity}} the predicament presented, Eisenhower used Patton as <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> in Operation Fortitude, sending faulty intelligence to German agents that Patton {{was leading the}} Invasion of Europe. While Patton eventually returned to combat command in the European Theater in mid-1944, the slapping incidents were seen by Eisenhower, Marshall, and other leaders to be examples of Patton's brashness and impulsiveness. Patton's career was halted as former subordinates such as Omar Bradley became his superiors.|$|E
5|$|The year of 1967 started {{badly for}} the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). During {{the early years}} of the war, the rules of {{engagement}} prevented U.S. fighter-bombers from hitting North Vietnamese air bases, and that allowed North Vietnamese fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets, thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads before they even reached their target. Then, instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft, North Vietnamese pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases. To preempt further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the North Vietnamese Air Force, the United States Air Force became interested in luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters up against <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> target, and shoot them down in the air using missile-armed fighter aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force had become more aggressive towards U.S. strike formations, and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the right time to launch <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> operation.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts as to what actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E

Heavily wounded, Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, her {{aircraft}} were disembarked {{several times}} in mid to late 1943 and used from land bases {{in a number of}} battles in the South West Pacific. Zuihō participated in the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in mid-1944. In this last battle, Zuihō mainly served as <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> for the main striking forces and she was finally sunk by American aircraft fulfilling her task. In between engagements, the ship served as a ferry carrier and a training ship.|$|E
5|$|Eastbourne has {{numerous}} {{parks and}} gardens, {{although there are}} several smaller open spaces including Upperton Gardens, the Carpet Gardens and the Western Lawns. The first public park in Eastbourne was Hampden Park, originally owned by Lord Willingdon and opened on 12 August 1902. Facilities include: football pitches, rugby club, indoor bowls, a large lake (formerly <b>a</b> <b>Decoy</b> pond), lakeside cafe, children's recreation area, tennis courts, BMX and skate facility, disc golf course (target) and woodland. The largest and newest park is Shinewater Park, located {{on the west side}} of Langney and opened in 2002.

As a result, Tracy buys a life-Japanese sex doll that looks like him to use as <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> to fool them. Eventually, Tracy realizes that he overreacted with his sons but warns his son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), that if he were to die, that he and his brother will face jail time.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|The forces {{defending}} Kucha, {{consisting of}} 50,000 soldiers, were lured and ambushed by Ashina. They chased after {{a group of}} 1,000 horsemen employed by Ashina as <b>a</b> <b>decoy,</b> but encountered additional Tang forces that mounted a surprise attack. The Kuchean forces were defeated and retreated to Aksu, a nearby kingdom in the Tarim Basin. Ashina captured the king following a forty-day siege, ending with the surrender of the Kucha forces on 19 January 649. One of Ashina's officers, acting as a diplomat, persuaded the chieftains of the region to surrender instead of fighting back.|$|E

While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> body. He uses the distraction this offers to infiltrate The Pentagon to find a cure for Scully's cancer, while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus recounts that, {{according}} to the Athenians, as the battle began the Corinthians hoisted their sails and began sailing away from the battle, northwards up the straits. However, {{he also says that}} other Greeks denied this story. If this did in fact occur, one possible interpretation is that these ships had been <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> sent to reconnoitre the northern exit from the straits, in case the arrival of the encircling Egyptian detachment was imminent (if indeed this also occurred). Another possibility (not exclusive of the former) is that the departure of the Corinthians triggered the final approach of the Persians, suggesting as it did that the Allied fleet was disintegrating. At any rate, if they indeed ever left, the Corinthians soon returned to the battle.|$|E
5|$|In a 16 December statement, three Stabæk Fotball {{officials}} said that they suspected that Ulrichen's plan all along was to convert the venue to a pure convention center, and that the use as a football venue was <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> to get a free lot worth up to NOK200 million plus grants worth NOK50 million. The book value of the venue was NOK303 million {{at the end of}} 2010, although a statement from the district court stated that the value of the venue was significantly lower than that. The bank DnB NOR held at the time a mortgage with security in the property worth NOK260 million, while Ulrichsen through his investment company held a mortgage worth NOK60.1 million.|$|E

When Mulder confronts Deep Throat, he admits his deception and confirms that the earlier transmission was genuine.

She transforms Yubaba's baby son Boh into a mouse, creates <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> baby and turns Yubaba's bird creature into a tiny bird. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. After Haku dives to the boiler room with Sen and Boh on his back, she feeds him part of the dumpling, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.|$|E

At the beginning of August, the ship participated in Operation Stab, <b>a</b> <b>decoy</b> invasion of the Andaman Islands to distract the Japanese when the Americans were invading the island of Guadalcanal in the South Pacific. Captain Robert Cunliffe relieved Talbott on 22 August.
