5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It is particularly hard for adopted children to get <b>adopted</b> <b>from</b> foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E
5|$|Fortune was a {{ceremonial}} magician. The magical principles on which her Fraternity was based were <b>adopted</b> <b>from</b> {{the late nineteenth}} century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with other influences coming from Theosophy and Christian Science. The magical ceremonies performed by Fortune's Fraternity were placed into two categories: initiations, in which the candidate was introduced to magical forces, and evocation, in which these forces were manipulated for a given purpose.|$|E
5|$|He {{also studied}} other vessels from the period, {{such as the}} Le Soleil Royal, La Couronne, La Royale and Le Reale de France, to better {{understand}} 17th-century ship design. It was from the Le Reale de France that he gained a basis for his design of the Unicorn jolly boat. No ship named the Unicorn was listed {{in the annals of}} the French Navy, but Hergé instead took the name from a British frigate which had been active in the mid-18th century; the fictional ship's unicorn figurehead was also <b>adopted</b> <b>from</b> the frigate.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Australian swimmer and {{performer}} Annette Kellerman {{was arrested}} on a Boston beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she <b>adopted</b> <b>from</b> England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. In 1913, designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired {{by the introduction of}} females into Olympic swimming he designed a close-fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013, Governor John Hickenlooper {{signed a}} bill started by school children, {{designating}} dogs and cats <b>adopted</b> <b>from</b> a Colorado shelter or rescue as the official Colorado state pet. The bill was passed via the state's education committee, both recognizing its role in educating children about the legislative process {{and the importance of}} educating the general population regarding the benefits and responsibilities of pet ownership.|$|E

Jean-Paul became a jazz musician, performing with artists such as Josephine Baker and Mistinguett. His second marriage produced a daughter, Denise, later known as a sculptress, and a son, Claude, a flautist.

50|$|Adoption {{policies}} for each country vary widely. Information {{such as the}} age of the adoptive parents, financial status, educational level, marital status and history, number of dependent children in the house, sexual orientation, weight, psychological health, and ancestry are used by countries to determine what parents are eligible to <b>adopt</b> <b>from</b> that country.|$|R
5|$|There are a {{small number}} of Heathens in Poland, where they have {{established}} a presence on social media. The majority of these Polish Heathens belong to the non-racist wing of the movement. There are also a few Heathens in the Slovenian Pagan scene, where they are outnumbered by practitioners of Slavic Native Faith. Exponents of Heathenry are also found on websites in Serbia. In Russia, several far-right groups merge elements from Heathenry with aspects <b>adopted</b> <b>from</b> Slavic Native Faith and Russian Orthodox Christianity. There are also several Heathens in the Israeli Pagan scene.|$|E
5|$|Through {{contact with}} {{neighboring}} civilizations, the Egyptians also adopted foreign deities. Dedun, who is first {{mentioned in the}} Old Kingdom, {{may have come from}} Nubia, and Baal, Anat, and Astarte, among others, were <b>adopted</b> <b>from</b> Canaanite religion during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC). In Greek and Roman times, from 332 BC to the early centuries AD, deities from across the Mediterranean world were revered in Egypt, but the native gods remained, and they often absorbed the cults of these newcomers into their own worship.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{religions}} in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents {{to renounce}} all other gods, a practice <b>adopted</b> <b>from</b> Judaism (see Idolatry). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant {{they were unable}} to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century.|$|E
5000|$|Beside the {{traditional}} desire for male children {{to carry on}} the family name, this allowance partially resolves a dilemma created by the emperor himself. He had recently banned all non-patrilineal forms of inheritance, while wanting to preserve the proper order in the Chinese kinship. Therefore, a couple without son cannot <b>adopt</b> one <b>from</b> within the extended family. They either have to <b>adopt</b> <b>from</b> outside (which was regarded by many as passing the family wealth to unrelated [...] "outsiders"), or become heirless. The multiple inheritance marriages provided a way out when the husband's brother has a son.|$|R
500|$|She {{decided to}} <b>adopt</b> <b>from</b> Malawi. The country's High Court {{initially}} approved {{the adoption of}} Chifundo [...] "Mercy" [...] James; however, the application was rejected because Madonna was not {{a resident of the}} country. Madonna appealed, and on June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi granted Madonna the right to adopt Mercy James.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} number of {{foreign-born}} adopted children with Special Needs. Despite this increase little is known about these adopted children and their needs. It is important to find answers to the following questions: 1. Are there differences between <b>adopted</b> children <b>from</b> Taiwan with Special Needs and <b>adopted</b> children <b>from</b> Taiwan without Special Needs, concerning problem behavior? 2. Are there differences between <b>adopted</b> children <b>from</b> Taiwan and <b>adopted</b> children <b>from</b> China, concerning problem behavior? 3. Are there differences between <b>adopted</b> children <b>from</b> Taiwan with Special Needs and <b>adopted</b> children <b>from</b> China with Special Needs, concerning problem behavior? Through sending adoptive parents questionnaires, data was obtained <b>from</b> 310 <b>adopted</b> children <b>from</b> Taiwan. These data were compared with data from a comparison group consisting of <b>adopted</b> children <b>from</b> China (N = 1233). Problem behavior was studied with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). There were differences between girls with Special Needs from Taiwan and girls without Special Needs from Taiwan: the girls with Special Needs tended to have more problems with peers (SDQ), to have more internalizing problems (CBCL) and more total problem behavior (CBCL) than the girls without Special Needs. Boys with Special Needs from Taiwan also showed more internalizing problems (CBCL) than boys without Special Needs from Taiwan. Although „Special Needs‟ is considered to be something purely physical, both boys and girls with Special Needs showed more internalizing problems than children without Special Needs. It may be a pitfall to focus help only on the physical problems when helping adopted children with Special Needs. Besides that, girls from Taiwan (with and without Special Needs) showed more problem behavior on several problem scales than the girls from China. Similarly, girls with Special Needs from Taiwan showed more problems (according to the SDQ) than girls with Special Needs from China. This means that extra attention should be given to problem behavior from girls from Taiwan...|$|R
