5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union.

To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico <b>and</b> <b>California</b> to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
