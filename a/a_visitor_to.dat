5|$|Paris {{continued}} to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with William Gear (1916–97) and Stephen Gilbert (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde COBRA group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution. Also <b>a</b> <b>visitor</b> <b>to</b> Paris was Alan Davie (b. 1920-2014), who was influenced by jazz and Zen Buddhism, and moved further into abstract expressionism. Ian Hamilton Finlay's (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially concrete poetry) and landscape architecture. His most ambitious work, the garden of Little Sparta opened in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In February 1930, a Towle TA-2 {{amphibian}} was <b>a</b> <b>visitor</b> <b>to</b> Lympne. In July 1930, it {{was notified}} that aircraft fitted with radio may report their position by radio when crossing the Channel. For non-radio aircraft the earlier arrangements remained in effect, although some {{changes were made}} to the methods of acknowledgement of arrival. Search and rescue arrangements now included motorboats permanently available at Boulogne, Calais, Dover and Dunquerque. Lifeboats were also on standby at the French ports and air patrols were in operation during working hours, operated by Air Union. In August 1930, the arrangements for non-radio aircraft flying between Croydon and Lympne in bad weather were amended. Pilots had to notify which route they intended to take and the destination airfield was to be notified of this by telephone once the aircraft had departed. That month 601 (County of London) Squadron held its annual camp a Lympne.|$|E
5|$|In The Greek Myths (1955), Robert Graves views Oenopion as his {{perennial}} Year-King, at {{the stage}} where the king pretends to die {{at the end of}} his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the Cyclops, mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of Aqhat and Yatpan from Ras Shamra, as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed <b>a</b> <b>visitor</b> <b>to</b> their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.|$|E

5|$|The line of Abrahams {{came to an}} end in 1842 when Sir Charles Abraham Elton, 6th Baronet, succeeded his father. Sir Charles was a writer, {{and contributed}} to several {{periodicals}} including The Gentleman's Magazine. Sir Charles' sister Julia was married to the historian Henry Hallam, and his nephew Arthur Hallam is buried in the Elton family vault at St Andrew's church. Arthur Hallam is the subject of Alfred Tennyson's poem In Memoriam A.H.H.. Tennyson visited Clevedon Court in 1850, the year in which the poem was published, and also in which he was created Poet Laureate. William Makepeace Thackeray was <b>a</b> <b>visitor</b> <b>to</b> the court during Sir Charles's time and it was the inspiration for the house Castlewood which featured in his novel The History of Henry Esmond although, contrary to common belief, it is improbable that he wrote any of it at Clevedon Court. Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived in Clevedon briefly during this period and may have visited the Court.|$|E

25|$|During {{most of the}} Weimar Republic era, Ribbentrop was apolitical and {{displayed}} no anti-Semitic prejudices. <b>A</b> <b>visitor</b> <b>to</b> a party Ribbentrop threw in 1928 recorded that Ribbentrop had no political views beyond a vague admiration for Gustav Stresemann, fear of Communism, and a wish to restore the monarchy. Several Berlin Jewish businessmen who did business with Ribbentrop in the 1920s and knew him well later expressed astonishment at the vicious anti-Semitism he later displayed in the Third Reich, saying {{that they did not}} see any indications he had held such views. As a partner in his father-in-law's champagne firm, Ribbentrop did business with Jewish bankers and organised the Impegroma Importing Company ("Import und Export großer Marken") with Jewish financing.|$|E
25|$|Sir Leslie Stephen's {{eminence}} as an editor, critic, and biographer, and {{his connection}} to William Thackeray, meant that his children {{were raised in}} an environment filled with the influences of Victorian literary society. Henry James, George Henry Lewes, and Virginia's honorary godfather, James Russell Lowell, were among the visitors to the house. Julia Stephen was equally well connected. Her aunt was a pioneering early photographer Julia Margaret Cameron who was also <b>a</b> <b>visitor</b> <b>to</b> the Stephen household. Supplementing these influences was the immense library at the Stephens' house, from which Virginia and Vanessa were taught the classics and English literature. As was all-too common in this era, their brothers Adrian and Julian (Thoby) were formally educated and sent to Cambridge, a disparity that Virginia noted and condemned in her writing. The sisters did, however, benefit indirectly from their brothers' Cambridge contacts, as the boys brought their new intellectual friends home to the Stephens' drawing room.|$|E
25|$|The Mozart {{family had}} removed from No. 180 Ebury Street, {{probably}} directly to No. 15 Thrift Street, on 25 September 1764. The young Mozart gave daily afternoon public recitals, and published his Opus 3 (Violin Sonatas, KV 10–15) from that address. His father had the music engraved, {{and sold the}} music at the lodgings. Mozart dedicated the set to Queen Charlotte, whose music teacher was Johann Christian Bach. Bach befriended the young Mozart, whose sonatas shows Bach's influence. It seems likely that he was <b>a</b> <b>visitor</b> <b>to</b> the house. It is possible that Mozart also wrote the Symphony No. 4 in D major, K. 19, here, {{as well as the}} concert aria for tenor Va, dal furor portata, K. 21/19c, and the short motet for chorus, God is our Refuge, K. 20. The London Sketchbook, K.15 also dates from this period. The Mozart family was still in Frith Street on 30 May, leaving London in July.|$|E
