5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington.

5|$|Diệm {{left the}} {{mainland}} on May 19, and his final stop was in Hawaii, {{where he was}} a guest of Admiral Felix Stump, the commander of United States Pacific Fleet. The reason for the visit was to discuss Diệm's concerns over America's reaction if South Vietnam came under communist attack. Stump reiterated Washington's opinions that nuclear weapons would be used to defend any anti-communist country that was attacked by communists, in accordance with public statements made by Eisenhower and Dulles. He said the <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> do so by dropping nuclear weapons on communist China.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville Christian Leadership Council (or NCLC), {{was founded}} by the Reverend Kelly Miller Smith, pastor of First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill. This {{organization}} was an affiliate of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was established to promote civil rights for African Americans through nonviolent civil disobedience. Smith believed that White <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> be more sympathetic to desegregation if African Americans obtained their rights through peaceful demonstration rather than through the judicial system or violent confrontation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{inflammatory}} rumour {{was that}} Washington would launch an attack {{to liberate the}} north when all anti-communists had fled south.

Lansdale's team disseminated pamphlets that depicted Hanoi with three circles of nuclear destruction superimposed on it. Lansdale's saboteurs also poured sugar into the petrol tanks of Viet Minh vehicles. Soothsayers were bribed to predict disaster under communism, and prosperity for those who went south.|$|E

5|$|Washington's {{victories}} wrecked the British carrot-and-stick {{strategy of}} showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms. The <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> not negotiate for {{anything short of}} independence. These victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate Patriot victory, however, since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter. Washington and Congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion, which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|General Amherst, the British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, was {{in overall}} charge of administering policy towards Native Americans, which involved both military matters and {{regulation of the}} fur trade. Amherst believed that with France out of the picture, the Native <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> have no other choice than to accept British rule. He also {{believed that they were}} incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army; therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin, commander at Fort Detroit, made little effort to conceal their contempt for the Native Americans. Native Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, Cooper again won {{re-election}} over John Y. Brown, Sr., by 217,000 votes, {{breaking his}} own record of largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate, and carrying {{the vote of}} 110 of Kentucky's 120 counties. In the lead-up to the 1968 Republican presidential primary, he endorsed New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, saying that <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam. Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war, while other Republican candidates tried to remain non-specific about how they would handle it. As Rockefeller's candidacy faded, Cooper encouraged his colleague, Kentucky Senator Thruston B. Morton, to seek the presidency, but Morton declined. The nomination– and eventually, the presidency– went to Republican Richard Nixon.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, the Kennedy {{administration}} sent Cable 243 to Lodge at {{the embassy}} in Saigon, marking a change in American policy. The message advised Lodge to seek {{the removal of the}} Nhus from power, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diệm refused to heed American pressure for reform. As the probability of Diệm sidelining the Nhus was seen as virtually nil, the message effectively meant the fomenting of a coup. The Voice of America broadcast a statement blaming Nhu for the raids and absolving the army of responsibility. Aware that the <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> neither oppose a coup nor respond with aid cuts or sanctions, the generals deposed the Ngô brothers, who were arrested and assassinated the next day, 2 November 1963.|$|E

If the American forces penetrated his lines, Luna determined that he would wage a series of delaying battles and prepare a fortress in northern Luzon, particularly the Cordillera. This, however, was turned down by the High Command, who still believed that the <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> grant full independence.|$|E

5|$|By 1875, France {{was enjoying}} {{improved}} political stability and a recovering postwar economy. Growing {{interest in the}} upcoming Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide {{it was time to}} seek public support. In September 1875, he announced the project and the formation of the Franco-American Union as its fundraising arm. With the announcement, the statue was given a name, Liberty Enlightening the World. The French would finance the statue; <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> be expected to pay for the pedestal. The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France, though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia. French monarchists opposed the statue, {{if for no other reason}} than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a senator for life. Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful, including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25, 1876, that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod. The piece was titled La Liberté éclairant le monde, the French version of the statue's announced name.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months of 1967, the Viet Cong absorbed heavy losses as a result of {{large-scale}} search and destroy missions conducted by the United States Army, and it prompted North Vietnamese leaders to review their war strategy in South Vietnam. In light of the setbacks which North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces had experienced early in 1967, North Vietnamese General Trần Văn Trà suggested that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces could still be victorious if they inflicted as many casualties as possible on U.S. military units, hoping that the <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> conclude that the war was too costly and withdraw from Vietnam. Thus, towards mid-1967, the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Divisions returned to the battlefield again, with the objective of inflicting casualties on U.S. military formations in III Corps Tactical Zone. On June 12, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division launched Operation Billings to destroy elements of the Viet Cong 9th Division, which had built-up strength around northern Phuoc Vinh.|$|E
5|$|General Atkinson, {{who learned}} in early July that Scott {{would be taking}} command, hoped to bring the war to a {{successful}} conclusion before Scott's arrival. The Americans had difficulty locating the British Band, however, {{thanks in part to}} false intelligence given to them by area Native Americans. Potawatomis and Ho-Chunks in Illinois, many of whom had sought to remain neutral in the war, decided to cooperate with the Americans. Tribal leaders knew that some of their warriors had aided the British Band, and so they hoped that a highly visible show of support for the <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> dissuade U.S. officials from punishing the tribes after the conflict was over. Wearing white headbands to distinguish themselves from hostile Natives, Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis served as guides for Atkinson's army. Ho-Chunks sympathetic to the plight of Black Hawk's people misled Atkinson into thinking that the British Band was still at Lake Koshkonong. While Atkinson's men were trudging through the swamps and running low on provisions, the British Band had in fact relocated miles to the north. Potawatomis under Billy Caldwell also managed to demonstrate support for the Americans while avoiding battle.|$|E

5|$|In August 1943, the Quebec Agreement subsumed the British Tube Alloys project {{into the}} Manhattan Project, and {{established}} the Combined Policy Committee {{to control the}} Manhattan Project. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May 1944. Under it, the <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> assist {{with the construction of}} a heavy water-moderated nuclear reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the effects of radiation on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium chemistry or metallurgy, although irradiated uranium slugs were made available for the British to work it out for themselves. A sticking point was the director of the Montreal Laboratory, Hans von Halban, who was a poor administrator, did not work well with the Canadians, and was regarded as a security risk by the Americans. In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Montreal Laboratory scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft would become the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|King Charles IV of Spain ordered data {{compiled}} {{to determine}} the true boundary. Before the border was settled, both sides led armed excursions into the disputed areas, and Spain began {{increasing the number of}} troops stationed in Texas. By 1806, the number had doubled, with over 883 stationed in and around Nacogdoches. At the end of 1806, local commanders negotiated a temporary agreement in which neither the Spanish nor the <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> venture into the area between the Sabine River and Arroyo Hondo. This neutral ground quickly became a haven for lawlessness and it did not stop individuals from crossing the boundary. While on a mission for the United States Army to explore some of the disputed areas of the Louisiana Purchase Zebulon Pike was arrested by the Spanish while camping on the Rio Grande and escorted back to Natchitoches. Although his maps and notes were confiscated, Pike was able to recreate most of it from memory. His glowing comments about Texas lands and animals made many Americans yearn to control the territory.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{announced}} a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958, if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom {{also agreed to}} suspend testing. Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible {{to allow them to}} design production nuclear weapons. Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that {{the quality and quantity of}} what the <b>Americans</b> <b>would</b> share would depend on what they had to offer. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride permitted a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. It would be the biggest and most complex British test series.|$|E
