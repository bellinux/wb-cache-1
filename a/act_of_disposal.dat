Earthworms are the bioindicators of the ecosystem. One can consider compost earthworms as bioindicators under laboratory research. Acceptances as feeding- dwelling (habit and habitat) under microlevel studies and thereafter in macro level conversions to procurable vermicompost in bulk is the wider indications of the nontoxicity range and/or acceptable limit of the inorganic components of flyash. There may be possibilities of chelating and mordanting of these components into the organic matter of the vermicompost by the enzymatic actions. Equal proportions (v/v) of partially-aerobically decomposed organic wastes with flyash are cost oriented in terms of easier procurability, sizeable collection of vermicomposts in less time and utilization for cultivable lands for the balance of depleted plant nutrients on one hand and in the reduction <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> problems of the flyash on the other with an added advantage of no hassles from the Central and State Pollution Control Boards are the perfect possibilities.

40|$|A {{third of}} total global food {{production}} never reaches a human stomach (Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 2013). This {{is the highest}} level of food wastage in human history (Blenckner, 2008), and is understood to be an unwarranted economic and environmental burden on the planet which must be combatted to avert environmental and food security crises such as climate change. In order to make food waste a more visible problem, the European Parliament (2012) proclaimed 2014 to be the European Year against Food Waste. Food wastage itself is typically a hidden practice (Hawkins, 2006), and a symptomatic result of a “throwaway society” (Lucas, 2002) with a stable food supply creating a new paradigm of food consumption where food is ever present, undervalued, and disposable (Jones, 2006; Thompson, 1979). At a straightforward technical level, food waste can be defined as a waste type produced {{as a result of the}} lack of consumption of food. This waste is composed of food (both edible and inedible organic matter) in the form of uneaten food such as scraps, food lost via preparation, and food that is no longer fit to be consumed and is regarded as inedible. Yet the term “food waste” is a living concept, with varied conceptualizations occurring in academic and professional literature, the most widely used being “solid waste” (Rathje and Murphy 1992), “biodegradable waste” (Chandon and Wansink, 2002), and “organic waste” (McDonough, 2002). These conceptualizations conceal the scale of wastage via their homogenization of food with other types of waste while concurrently not acknowledging that food is a part of this waste type. There are also nontechnical terms for food waste that provide emotional baggage while highlighting the inedible nature of food waste. Mary Douglas (1966) and Gay Hawkins (2006) both note this emotive separation of food and food waste, with Douglas describing waste as “matter out of place. ” This use of emotional terms is common in participant interviews, with discussions around food waste and disposal practices having the potential to become emotionally charged (Metcalfe et al., 2013; Mavrakis, 2012 a, 2012 b). The ability to recognize and define objects as food waste is culturally and socially constructed; there are numerous societal complexities that pertain to how consumers view waste and what they understand it to be (Evans, 2011). In short, understanding waste is a subjective practice (Hawkins, 2006) best summed up by the old idiom “One man's trash is another man's treasure” (Thompson, 1979). A longstanding theory regarding the transformation process from food to waste is found in Thompson's Rubbish Theory (1979), which posits that objects becomes waste when their perceived durability or utility has been exhausted and is no longer valued by its owner. This transformation into waste occurs over no set time period and can be evidenced by a change of form and the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> of the object. Physical investigation (auditing) of the food that is physically thrown away is a useful avenue of archaeological (social) research, with the presence (or absence) of food in the waste stream providing unspoken information to the intrepid researcher. Rathje and Murphy's (1992) pioneered this methodology, which can be summarized by modifying Brillat-Savarin's (2009) aphorism “Tell me what you throw away, and I will tell you what you are. ” Finally, the current state of the world food supply is leading to a reclassification of food waste. The global population has access to a greater abundance and variety of food and cuisines than ever before, yet food prices are rising and there are international food shortages. One in eight people now suffer from hunger or malnutrition while, at the same time, one in eight are also obese or overweight (Millstone and Lang, 2003; FAO, 2009). As a result of this paradoxical situation, there is currently debate about expanding the definition of food waste to account for food that is consumed above and beyond what is required to stay healthy, that is approximately 2, 000 – 3, 000 calories per day (Michaelowa and Dransfeld, 2008; FAO, 2013). This potential conceptualization of gluttony and overabundance as new forms of food wastage is moving food waste from an environmental and economic predicament to a discourse on food access equality. It remains to be seen if this will become a new area of food waste research...|$|E

One of his current areas of interest is the hygiene implications of death and the mythology pertaining to the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the human corpse. For the show Hygiene he has produced a sequential set of one hundred and sixty two slides and a photographic print dealing with the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the body and the different ways in which it is prepared for burial. In the work 'Disperse' he asks "What happens to the body on death. How do we treat it? What elements of hygiene come into the <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the corpse? If the death has been caused by disease what may be needed to stop the body being 'contagious'? What happens if the body has been contaminated by radioactivity? What myths have grown over the ages in different cultures as to the processing of the body and its internment to avoid health hazards?" Prior to this work for Hygiene, he has recently been working on a project for the exhibition 'Head on' at the new Wellcome Temporary Exhibition Space at the Science Museum London. This work, titled 'Magic forest' consists of a 35 mm slide dissolve work on multiple layered screens on the theme of the brain, memory and neuron interconnectivity, neuron development and migration. He has been working with Neuroscientists at the MRC Centre for Developmental Neurology, at Kings College, London. The go ahead has just been given for him to continue with this work on a follow up project over the next year. Carnie also works with the group 'No Limits' and he has recently made a large video installation, with a 50 by 4. 5 meter video screen in collaboration with 'Theatre Venture', a theatre and arts based group in Stratford, London. The resulting work on the theme of journeys was exhibited outside the EXCEL exhibition centre on the Victoria Dock, in April 2002.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to review and {{document}} the capability of potential products of depleted UF{sub 6 } conversion to meet the current waste acceptance criteria and other regulatory requirements for disposal at the facility in Clive, Utah, owned by Envirocare of Utah, Inc. The investigation was conducted by identifying issues potentially related to <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> depleted uranium (DU) products at Envirocare and conducting an initial analysis of them. Discussions were then held with representatives of Envirocare, the state of Utah (which is a NRC Agreement State and, thus, is the cognizant regulatory authority for Envirocare), and DOE Oak Ridge Operations. Provisional issue resolution was then established based on the analysis and discussions and documented in a draft report. The draft report was then reviewed by those providing information and revisions were made, which resulted in this document. Issues that were examined for resolution were (1) license receipt limits for U isotopes; (2) DU product classification as Class A waste; (3) use <b>of</b> non-DOE <b>disposal</b> sites for <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> DOE material; (4) historical NRC views; (5) definition of chemical reactivity; (6) presence of mobile radionuclides; and (7) National Environmental Policy <b>Act</b> coverage <b>of</b> <b>disposal.</b> The conclusion <b>of</b> this analysis is that {{an amendment to the}} Envirocare license issued on October 5, 2000, has reduced the uncertainties regarding <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the DU product at Envirocare {{to the point that they}} are now comparable with uncertainties associated with the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the DU product at the Nevada Test Site that were discussed in an earlier report...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{investigates the}} {{character}} <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> wealth from Quranic perspective with constructive reference towards the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> wealth {{for the cause}} of Allah. We do believe that the discussion <b>of</b> the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> wealth is clearly general and involves various variables, yet this paper particularly focuses on the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> infaq since it is the most fundamental keyword within consumption decision. This can be observed once Al Quran presents the idea <b>of</b> the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> wealth {{for the cause of}} Allah which includes sadaqah, zakat, hibah, nafqah and waqaf. Disposing wealth in general is much broader than to consume, save, invest and pay tax, the way like we understood in conventional economics. It is a matter on how the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> wealth could get us closer to our God. Therefore, the connotation of disposing of wealth for the cause of Allah is explicitly being mentioned as frequent as it is a significant attribute of a true believer. In general, Al Quran highlights two main types <b>of</b> the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> wealth namely to spend for the family and to spend for the sake of Him. In which the latter takes place on a thoughtful-yet-voluntary approach. It would be necessary to denote since then that this paper will not go into deeper the obliged-way of disposing wealth like zakat and inheritance...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{interest}} in long-term underground corrosion has greatly increased {{because of the}} ongoing need to dispose of nuclear waste. Additionally, the Nuclear Waste Policy <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1982 requires <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> high-level nuclear waste in an underground repository. Current contaminant release and transport models use limited available short-term underground corrosion rates when considering container and waste form degradation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} issue <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> in Finnish art museums. It {{is a research}} in the field of museology, in which museography plays a significant role. The field of museology functions as a science bridging theory and practice. In the research, museum collection management is divided into seven areas: acquisition, inventory, condition assessment, value assessment, conservation, upkeep and disposal. It is essential that collection management be viewed as a unified chain of operations, starting from acquisition and ending in disposal. This creates a bridge from the start of collection management to its end procedures, at which point the total <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> an item is a possibility. <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> acquisition and <b>disposal</b> include deeply philosophical aspects, which are nonetheless very practical in nature; decisions involving the two ultimately have very definite outcomes. In 2012 a questionnaire regarding disposals was sent to Finnish art museums, which included 50 questions about collection content, disposals and collection management values. The response rate was 66 %, giving grounds for generalized, legitimate conclusions. The aim was to seek information about overall attitudes toward disposals and to ascertain any possible hindrances in the disposal process. The theoretical starting point of the research was to establish legitimacy of art museums in making collection management decisions. For this, George Dickie’s institutional art theory was chosen. It was also seen as meaningful to put collection management into the greater context of a long museographical tradition, dating back to cabinets of curiosities and their caretakers. With this connection it was possible to see the long lasting impact that museum collections have had, century after century. The objective was to ultimately start a neutral and collection-oriented disposal discussion in art museums, one that needs a museological value assessment in order to succeed. In addition, it needs to be supported by the impact value of museum objects. It is clear that any disposal process is a time-intensive endeavor, which consumes resources before any calculable benefits become evident. When seeking solutions, museums should retain their autonomy as they determine the limits of their own collections or terms of preservation...|$|R
