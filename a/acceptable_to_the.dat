5|$|Galeazzo Marescotti, {{a member}} of the zelanti, was the first serious {{candidate}} proposed two weeks in to the conclave. He was <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spanish, but was opposed by the French because they wanted the new pope who was not strong. Bandino Panciatici was suggested by Pietro Ottoboni, but he was not supported by secular monarchs because he had supported giving benefices to nominees who were independent of the secular authorities. Giacomo Antonio Morigia was <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> secular rulers, but was opposed by the zelanti for lacking governing experience in addition to not being firm or having the energy required. Following the proposal of these candidates, others came up as well, but were quickly rejected.|$|E
5|$|Although Suzuki might {{indeed have}} seen peace as a distant goal, {{he had no}} design to achieve it within any {{immediate}} time span or on terms <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allies.

She departs to find shelter for the night, after which a fishermen's chorus compares her eyes with the stars of heaven. Theseus, alone with his counsellor, discusses his abandonment of Ariadne, and is advised that this decision is justified, as {{she will not be}} <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people of Athens as their ruler's consort.|$|E
5|$|Daud Khan, who {{launched}} his invasion starting from Patna on 3 April 1660, attacked south of Gaya district and finally {{arrived at the}} Palamu Forts on 9 December 1660. The terms of surrender and payment of tribute were not <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chiros'; Daud Khan wanted complete conversion of all Hindus under the Chiro rule to Islam. Following this, Khan mounted a series of attacks on the forts. Chiros defended the forts but ultimately both forts were occupied by Daud Khan, and the Chiros fled to the jungles. Hindus were driven out, the temples were destroyed, and Islamic rule imposed.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started {{to believe in the}} merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made {{excessive}} sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the end result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.|$|E

5|$|Robert rewarded Ranulf for {{his advice}} during the {{invasion}} by entrusting {{him with the}} administration of the see of Lisieux. After Robert's defeat by Henry at Tinchebray in 1106, the bishop {{was among the first to}} make his peace with Henry, and returned to Durham. He retired from political life. Henry had already replaced him with Roger of Salisbury an able financier who was infinitely more <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation. Although some historians have theorised that Ranulf's time in Normandy was as an agent of Henry, it appears that Ranulf was mainly looking out for his own interests and those of his family.|$|E
5|$|The new Form of Government {{was much}} more <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. They passed it on 10February 1645, {{contingent}} on some particularities of presbyterian government which {{were expected to be}} worked out in a forthcoming Directory for Church Government. At the same time they announced their desire to formally unite the two churches. Following the rise of Cromwell and the secret Engagement of some Scots with Charles this hope was abandoned, and the documents were never formally adopted. The General Assembly ceased to function under Cromwell and the kings who succeeded him from 1649 to 1690.|$|E
5|$|The papal {{conclave}} of 1724 {{was called}} upon {{the death of}} Pope Innocent XIII. It began on 20 March 1724 and ended on 28 May that year {{with the election of}} Vincenzo Maria Orsini, a Dominican friar, as Pope Benedict XIII. The conclave was made of largely the same electors that had elected Innocent in 1721 and the same factions dominated it. Multiple attempts were made to elect candidates that would be <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> various Catholic monarchies at the time, but none were successful until May. Benedict resisted his own election for two days before being convinced to accept it.|$|E

5|$|At {{a series}} of {{high-level}} meetings in May, the Big Six first seriously discussed ending the war—but none of them on terms {{that would have been}} <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allies. Because anyone openly supporting Japanese surrender risked assassination by zealous army officers, the meetings were closed to anyone except the Big Six, the Emperor, and the Privy Seal—no second- or third-echelon officers could attend. At these meetings, despite the dispatches from Japanese ambassador Satō in Moscow, only Foreign minister Tōgō realized that Roosevelt and Churchill might have already made concessions to Stalin to bring the Soviets into the war against Japan. As a result of these meetings, Tōgō was authorized to approach the Soviet Union, seeking to maintain its neutrality, or (despite the very remote probability) to form an alliance.|$|E
5|$|Jænberht was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on 2 February 765, at {{the court}} of King Offa of Mercia; this {{location}} implies that his election was <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king. In 766, he received a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority given by the papacy. At this time, Kent had been subjected by Offa; in 776, perhaps {{at the urging of}} Jænberht, Kent rebelled and secured its freedom. In 780 and 781, Jænberht attended church councils at Brentford that were led by King Offa. Although initially on good terms with Offa, Jænberht's ties to Egbert were also strong: after the Battle of Otford, Egbert granted a number of estates to Christ Church. When Offa reasserted control over Kent, which occurred by 785 at the latest, he confiscated these lands and regranted to some of his thegns.|$|E
5|$|Like in Texas, a {{mosquito}} outbreak occurred in Louisiana. Only pesticides <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Fish and Wildlife Service {{were allowed to}} be used. FEMA officials warned homeowners {{of the dangers of}} floodwaters, including mold, mildew, and bacteria. By three months after the storm, just under 100,000 Louisiana citizens applied for federal aid, totaling to over $110million (2001USD, $143million 2012USD). $25million (2001USD, $32million 2012USD) of the total was for business loans, while an additional $8million was for public assistance for communities and state agencies. More than 750 flood victims in Florida applied for governmental aid, totaling to $1.29million (2001USD, $1.5million 2007USD). In Pennsylvania, 1,670 flood victims applied for federal aid, totaling to $11.5million (2001USD, $14.3million 2012USD). $3.4million (2001USD, $4.4million 2012USD) of the total was to replace a SEPTA rail bridge over Sandy Run in Fort Washington.|$|E

50|$|The anarcho-socialist Zapatista revolutionaries in {{the book}} find it <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> tools of the capitalists against them, such as by riding in Coca-Cola trucks for transportation; however, they are content to steal drinks when they desire, thus harming the corporation. The capitalists’ {{ultimate}} tool, Alice Irene, the artificially intelligent being created for {{the supervision of the}} Martian population program, was also the deus ex machina that allowed Starrchilde {{to take control of the}} ship. Thus, the novel implies that it is <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> capitalists’ own tools against them for the sake of their own political end.|$|R
5|$|On 14 March 1772, amid various {{political}} machinations, Count Hieronymus von Colloredo {{was elected to}} the archbishopric as a compromise candidate <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> imperial court in Vienna. Although unpopular among Salzburgers, this appointment appeared at first to be to the Mozarts' advantage: Leopold's withheld salary was paid, and on 31 August Colloredo authorised the payment of Wolfgang's Konzertmeister salary. However, the new archbishop began to look for someone outside the Salzburg court to be his new Kapellmeister. Eventually, he chose the Italian Domenico Fischietti, who was several years younger than Leopold. Realising that his chances of promotion had probably been irrevocably lost, Leopold turned his hopes for a comfortable old age towards Wolfgang, giving new urgency to the third Italian journey which began in October 1772.|$|E
5|$|Before the 12th century, Jain writers had {{dominated}} Kannada literature {{with their}} champu (verses mixed with prose) style of writings popular in court literature. In the later medieval period, {{they had to}} contend with the Veerashaivas who challenged the very notion of royal literature with their vachana poetry, a stylised form of spoken language, more popular in folk genres. The popular growth of Veerashaiva (devotees of the Hindu god Shiva) literature began in the 12th century, while Vaishnava (devotees of the Hindu god Vishnu) writers began to exert their influence from the 15th century. Jain writers had to reinvent their art, moving away from the traditional themes of renunciation and tenets to focus on contemporary topics. Andayya's 13th century classic Kabbigara Kava ("Poets defender") was an early example of the change in literary style, and also reflected the hostility toward the Veerashaivas; the Jain author found it ideal to narrate the story of Manmatha, the God of Love, who turned Shiva into a half woman. The Veerashaivas had initiated an important change, casting aside the concept of formal literature and making way for shorter local genres. The Vaishnava haridasas later popularised musical forms that were more <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> common man. Written classics eulogising kings and commanders were a thing of the past. Kannada literature had moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with singability being its hallmark, and devotion to God its goal.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{education}} system underwent radical change and {{expansion in the}} 20th century. In 1918 Roman Catholic schools were brought into the system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Church. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, and although plans to raise it to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area {{of growth in the}} inter-war period, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. The centre of the {{education system}} also became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. After devolution, in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and an Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, which together took over its functions. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.|$|E

5|$|The {{next few}} years were filled with travel and writing. There were further cruises with the {{training}} squadron, and extended visits to the Baltic and the Mediterranean. In 1893, {{during the course of}} one of these journeys, Markham was elected in absentia President of the RGS. This unexpected elevation {{was the result of a}} dispute within the Society over the question of women members, about which Markham had kept silent. When in July 1893 the issue was put to a special general meeting, the proposal to admit women was narrowly defeated despite an overwhelming postal ballot in favour. In these circumstances the Society's President, Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, resigned his office. The 22 existing women members were allowed to remain, but no more were admitted until January 1913 when the RGS changed its policy. Although Markham was not the first choice as a replacement for Grant Duff—other notable figures were approached—he had kept out of the women members controversy and was broadly <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> membership. Shortly after his accession to the presidency, in recognition of his services to geography Markham was raised in the Order of the Bath to the rank of Knight Commander (KCB), and became Sir Clements Markham.|$|E
5|$|On {{account of}} the rivalry between the chiefs of Bobbili and Vizianagaram, in 1756 there was a {{rebellion}} among the local chieftains which necessitated strong military measures. General Bussy attacked the rebel forces with a contingent of European forces, supported by 11,000 troops of the Raja of Vizianagaram as a token of his loyalty. The Raja of Vizianagaram instigated General Bussy by a canard stating that the Raja of Bobbili was behind the rebellion. It is {{also said that the}} Raja bribed his interpreters to persuade General Bussy to direct Ranga Rao, the Raja of Bobbili to vacate the Bobbili Fort and shift southward. General Bussy cautiously made an offer to the Chief of Bobbili that he would be pardoned if he moved away from Bobbili, and in return given a compensatory package of equivalent land elsewhere. But this was not <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chief of Bobbili. Then, General Bussy attacked the fort several times, breached the mud fort with cannons, and took control of the ramparts of the fort. Although the Raja of Bobbili and his defenders realized their precarious condition, they fought fiercely but eventually lost the battle. When General Bussy entered the fort with his depleted strength of soldiers he found dead bodies scattered in the fort area. At that time an old man approached General Bussy and handed him a child who he said was the son of the dead Raja of Bobbili. The Raja of Vizianagaram, happy with his victory in the hard fought battle, rejoiced by entering the Bobbili city and hoisted the Flag of France. But his jubilation was short lived. Three days after this event, the Raja of Vizianagaram's camp was attacked in the night by three people of Bobbili, including Tandra Paparayudu who had rushed to the demolished Bobbili Fort to help his sister's family. He killed the Raja of Vizianagaram and then committed suicide along with his accomplices.|$|E
