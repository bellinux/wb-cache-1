6000|$|CALWAY. I seem to {{have heard}} that before, Sir Thomas. <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> at once that your hitty-missy cart-load of bricks regime---- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} man of our days whose {{writings}} exemplify most thoroughly what I am going to say is the justly revered Mr. Thomas Carlyle.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{remember}} before I'm done," [...] Del sneered; [...] "so {{hold your}} hush <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> my little say. I {{come into the}} country with him way back in '84." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> finally, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> this. You have reproduced, in {{a journalistic}} form, the comedy of Much Ado about Nothing and have, of course, spoilt {{it in your}} reproduction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] {{said the}} page, [...] "list {{to me in}} all serious truth. <b>And,</b> first, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> that the gear last night had been smoother, had you taken me into your counsels." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mary will {{probably}} pass {{a day or}} two in Louisville in October. My kindest regards to Mrs. Speed. On the leading subject of this letter I have more of her sympathy than I have of yours; <b>and</b> yet <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> I am, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This isn't right!" [...] cried Larry. [...] "Dick is my friend, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> {{he never}} asks any cadet to knuckle under to him, unless the cadet did {{something}} that wasn't on the level." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am much obliged, Mrs Null," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "but I don't think I {{care for}} any books. <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> that I am {{very sorry for}} the way I spoke to you, just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will do so, and I {{will show}} you the steps by which I reached it. <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> to you, first, that which it is hardest {{for me to say}} and for you to hear: there has been an {{understanding}} between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not {{see that}} the {{correction}} changes things much; <b>and</b> you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> I am grieved, sadly grieved, to learn so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's {{coming to}} be very VERY kind to you, <b>and</b> you must <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> that I greatly hope you'll not be less so to herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I in declining. With {{all good}} feeling <b>and</b> all kindness, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> that I am quite {{opposed to the}} idea of marrying a second time.' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the first}} time I had a human target, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> here and now, that I am {{convinced}} I am immune to buck fever. There he was before me, less than a hundred feet distant, in the gangway between the door to Davis' room and the starboard-rail, manoeuvring for another shot at Mr. Pike.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will comply," [...] responded his {{dragoman}} reproachfully, [...] "if {{you will}} permit me first to draw your third cork. <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> in passing that even your present happiness is comparative, or possibly superlative, {{as you will}} know when you have finished this last bottle. It {{may or may not}} be greater; we shall see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Dempster,' said Malcolmson gravely, {{making her}} a polite bow, 'you {{know more than}} a Senior Wrangler! <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> that, as a mark of esteem for your indubitable {{soundness}} of head and heart, I shall, when I go, give you possession of this house, and let you stay here by yourself {{for the last two}} months of my tenancy, for four weeks will serve my purpose.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> here <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> {{a word of}} Fra Gervasio. He was, as I {{have already}} written, my father's foster-brother. That is to say, he was {{the child of a}} sturdy peasant-woman of the Val di Taro, from whose lusty, healthy breast my father had suckled the first of that fine {{strength}} that had been his own.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and this}} Silas Merrick {{was an older}} brother to Sid Merrick, the rascal who stole the bonds, and whom you heard {{mentioned}} by Cuffer <b>and</b> Shelley. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> here that Silas Merrick is dead, and when he died he left all his property to his brother Sidney and his sister. The sister is dead, too, and her property, so I understand, went to her son Tad Sobber." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> yet, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> that, {{in my own}} discretion, I do {{not know}} whether I would have ordered the arrest of Mr. Vallandigham. While I cannot shift the {{responsibility}} from myself, I hold that, as a general rule, the commander in the field is the better judge of the necessity in any particular case. Of course I must practice a general directory and revisory power in the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "It really {{resembles the}} boy," [...] he admitted, {{with a frown}} of perplexity, [...] "yet {{at the same time}} I {{realized}} the whole thing was absurd. Neither Patsy nor I can believe that Jones is the man who robbed an Austrian countess. It's preposterous! <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> right now, Arthur, that I'm going to stand by this young fellow, with all my influence, in case those hounds try to make him trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Sanderson, I {{have done}} what I could for you," [...] he said, coming at once to the point; [...] "and now I want {{to say a word}} or two about poor Songbird. He feels awfully bad over this matter, and he thinks that you are doing him an injustice. <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> I think so too," [...] and Tom looked the farmer {{squarely}} in the eyes as he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Mr. Wilks, {{now that}} I have heard your story, I trust {{that you will}} forgive my past suspicions of you, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> how much I honour and esteem you for your conduct. No words {{can tell you how}} I thank you, for your {{goodness}} and kindness to my little granddaughter; our little granddaughter, I should say. You have the better right, a thousand-fold, to her than I have; and, had I been in your place, I could never have made such a sacrifice.|$|E
60|$|When you {{relieved}} General Hamilton of {{his command}} the other day, you thereby lost {{the confidence of}} at least one of your best friends in the Senate. <b>And</b> here <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> not as applicable to you personally, that Senators and Representatives speak of me in their places without question, and that officers of the army must cease addressing insulting letters to them for taking no greater liberty with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I told you," [...] said Allan, simply, [...] "when I thought I {{was sweet}} on her myself. Come! come! it's a little hard, I think, {{even if you}} are in love with her, to believe {{everything}} she tells you, <b>and</b> not to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> a word. Is that the way you decide between us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} not to know wants than not to know want!" [...] I tell you, [...] boy, {{that is a great}} truth, and I hope you will {{remember}} it for [...] yourself as well {{as a part of the}} wisdom of your mother. <b>And</b> here [...] <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> something else which is a sort of corollary of that wise [...] utterance: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are mistaken," [...] {{said the}} young man coldly. [...] "I came to you for human aid, {{and thank you for}} what you have granted me: I have not been presumptuous enough to ask more, nor to believe myself a fitting subject for conversion. I am weak, but not weak enough to take {{advantage}} of the mistaken kindness of either the temporal Council of Todos Santos or its spiritual head." [...] He opened the door leading into the garden. [...] "Forget and forgive me, Father Esteban, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> farewell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! well, so {{much the}} better. <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> once for all, that you need not fear any closer {{intercourse}} with us. My poor Duke has {{made up his mind}} that such things are not for him, and wishes all to be arranged for Cecil as his heir. Not that he is any worse. With care he may survive us all, the doctors say; but he has made up his mind, and will never ask Babie again. He says it would be cruel; but he does long for a sight of her bright face!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> here {{in passing}} that I venture to address young men on this subject, not because I {{conceive}} {{myself to be}} gifted with superior wisdom, but because, being an old man, I stand on the heights and vantage ground of Experience, and looking back, can see the rocks and shoals and quicksands in life's ocean, which have damaged and well-nigh wrecked myself. I would not only try my hand as a pilot to guide, but as, in some sense, a buoy or beacon to warn from dangers that are not only unseen but unsuspected.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> here <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> that, since {{of all the}} bullies, and braggarts, and bravoes, and free-booters, and Hectors, and fish-at-arms, and knight-errants, and moss-troopers, and assassins, and foot-pads, and gallant soldiers, and immortal heroes that swim the seas, the Indian Sword fish is by far {{the most}} remarkable, I propose to {{dedicate}} this chapter to a special description of the warrior. In doing which, I but follow the example of all chroniclers and historians, my Peloponnesian friend Thucydides and others, who are ever mindful of devoting much space to accounts of eminent destroyers; for the purpose, no doubt, of holding them up as ensamples to the world.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> my dear boy, {{that your}} letter {{has given me}} the [...] most intense pleasure. It is an unspeakable delight to me to find in [...] the son of your father--a man whom I loved, and a boy whom I [...] love--the same {{generosity}} of spirit which endeared your father to all [...] his comrades, old as well as young. Come what may, I shall always be [...] proud of you; and if the sword of an old soldier--it is all I [...] have--can ever serve you in any way, it and its master's life are, [...] and shall be, whilst life remains to him, yours.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And,</b> lastly, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> that I reprint {{the review}} of [...] "The Origin of Species" [...] simply {{because it has been}} cited as mine by a late President of the Geological Society. If you find its phraseology, in some places, to be more {{vigorous}} than seems needful, recollect that it was written in the heat of our first battles over the Novum Organon of biology; that we were all ten years younger in those days; and last, but not least, that it was not published until it had been submitted to the revision of a friend for whose judgment I had then, as I have now, the greatest respect.|$|R
6000|$|Arthur {{held out}} his hand, and took the old man's warmly. [...] "Call me what you will," [...] he said. [...] "I hope I may always have {{the title of a}} friend. <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> that I am {{at a loss for words}} to thank you for your {{goodness}} to my poor dear." [...] He paused a moment, and went on, [...] "I know that she understood your goodness even better than I do. And if I was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so, you remember"--the Professor nodded--"you must forgive me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right. I {{did not trust}} you because I did not know you. But I know you now, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> that I should have known you long ago. I know that Lucy told you of me. She told me of you too. May I make the only atonement in my power? Take the {{cylinders}} and hear them. The first half-dozen of them are personal to me, {{and they will not}} horrify you. Then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better able to understand certain things." ...|$|E
6000|$|I hope Mrs. Fordyce and the {{two young}} ladies are well. Do let me forget that they are nieces of yours, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> that I never saw a more interesting, sweeter pair of sisters in my life. I am the fool of my {{feelings}} and attachments. I often take up a volume of my Spenser to realise you to my imagination, [109a] and think over the social scenes we have had together. God grant {{that there may be}} another world more congenial for honest fellows beyond this; a world where these rubs and plagues of absence, distance, misfortunes, ill-health, etc., shall no more damp hilarity and divide friendship. This I know is your throng season, but half a page will much oblige, my dear Sir, yours sincerely, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What ears {{the girl}} must have!" [...] whispered Zenobia, {{with a look}} of vexation, partly comic and partly real. [...] "I will confess to you that I cannot quite make her out. However, I am {{positively}} not an ill-natured person, unless when very grievously provoked,--and as you, and especially Mr. Hollingsworth, take so much interest in this odd creature, and as she knocks with a very slight tap against my own heart likewise,--why, I mean to let her in. From this moment I will be reasonably kind to her. There is no pleasure in tormenting a person of one's own sex, even if she do favor one with a little more love than one can conveniently dispose of; <b>and</b> that, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> Mr. Coverdale, is the most troublesome offence you can offer to a woman." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> a {{few words}} in regard to Douglas's great hobby of negro equality. He thinks--he says at least--that the Republican party {{is in favor of}} {{allowing}} whites and blacks to intermarry, and that a man can't be a good Republican unless he is willing to elevate black men to office and to associate with them on terms of perfect equality. He knows that we advocate no such doctrines as these, but he cares not how much he misrepresents us if he can gain a few votes by so doing. To show you what my opinion of negro equality was in times past, and to prove to you that I stand on that question where I always stood, I will read you a few extracts from a speech that was made by me in Peoria in 1854. It was made in reply to one of Judge Douglas's speeches.|$|R
2500|$|In a September 2010 {{speech before}} the Council on Foreign Relations, Clinton {{emphasized}} the continuing primacy of American power {{and involvement in}} the world, declaring a [...] "new American moment". Making reference to actions from reviving the Middle East talks to U.S. aid following the 2010 Pakistan floods, Clinton said that [...] "The world is counting on us" [...] and that [...] "After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home <b>and</b> abroad. So <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century." ...|$|R
