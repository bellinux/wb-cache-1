5|$|A further, albeit rare, {{complication}} of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia {{due to a}} sudden <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine. An extremely rare {{complication of}} SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where {{the ability to move}} one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing number}} of African {{immigrants}} have made their homes in Omaha in the last twenty years. There are approximately 8,500 Sudanese living in Omaha, comprising the largest population of Sudanese refugees in the United States. Most have immigrated since 1995 because of warfare in their nation. Ten different tribes are represented, including the Nuer, Dinka, Equatorians, Maubans and Nubians. Most Sudanese people in Omaha speak the Nuer language. Other Africans have immigrated to Omaha as well, with one-third from Nigeria, <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> populations from Kenya, Togo, Cameroon and Ghana.|$|E

5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, {{the remnants of the}} depression brought moderate rainfall to parts of Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. High winds accompanied the rainfall and left about 50,000 residences without power. Several trees were downed and some structures sustained damage from fresh water flooding. Landslides occurred along major highways <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> structural damage was reported around Mazatlán. However, there was no loss of life or reports of injuries.|$|E

Hawker test pilot Hugh Merewether went to the U.S. at NASA's request to fly the Bell X-14. In March 1959, the company's board of directors (Hawker Siddeley then) decided to privately fund two P.1127 prototypes.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1747, Fownes Luttrell made {{numerous}} <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> alterations to Dunster Castle, redecorating and redesigning {{it in the}} Rococo style. He renovated the Great Parlour, converted {{a bedroom}} over it into a Drawing Room in 1758, created a Breakfast Room over the Hall in 1772, remodelled {{the southern part of}} the castle, and altered the Great Staircase in 1773. His changes to the décor of the castle are also noteworthy, particularly for his use of newly-fashionable wallpaper.|$|E

Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the {{peppered}} maskray is a bottom-dwelling predator consuming mainly crustaceans (particularly caridean shrimp) and polychaete worms. It is viviparous, with litter {{sizes of}} one to three. The females supply their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk") during gestation. Although the peppered maskray is a frequent bycatch of bottom trawl fisheries, it is still common <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> portions of its population appear to lie within unfished waters. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
