25|$|The {{first two}} years of the García {{government}} gave new hope to the people of Peru, with rising employment, production, and wages suggesting a clear turn for the better <b>after</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> of increasing difficulties. It was hence doubly tragic to see the whole process unravel so quickly, once things started going wrong again. The first sign of trouble came, as it often had, from the balance of payments. The economic boom naturally raised imports swiftly, by 76 percent between 1985 and 1987. But the real exchange rate was allowed to fall by 10 percent in 1986 and by a further 9 percent in 1987. The boom pulled potential export supply into the domestic market, and the fall in the real exchange rate reduced incentives to earn foreign exchange. Exports fell slightly in 1985 and remained below that level through 1987. The external current account went from a surplus of US$127 million in 1985 to deficits of nearly US$1.1 billion in 1986 and nearly US$1.5 billion in 1987.|$|E

25|$|It {{was quickly}} decided that The Wild Bunch, which had several {{similarities}} to Goldman's work, would {{be produced in}} order to beat Butch Cassidy to the theaters. By the fall of 1967, Peckinpah was rewriting the screenplay into what became The Wild Bunch. Filmed on location in Mexico, Peckinpah's epic work {{was inspired by a}} number of things—his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde, America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War, and what he perceived to be the utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but the crude men attempting to survive the era. Starring William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ben Johnson, Warren Oates, Strother Martin, Jaime Sánchez, and Edmond O'Brien, the film detailed a gang of veteran outlaws on the Texas/Mexico border in 1913 trying to survive within a rapidly approaching modern world. The Wild Bunch is framed by two ferocious and infamous gunfights, beginning with a failed robbery of the railway company office and concluding with the outlaws battling the Mexican army in suicidal vengeance prompted by the brutal torture and murder of one of their members. Irreverent and unprecedented in its explicit detail, the 1969 film was an instant success. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences, characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, were perfected in The Wild Bunch. Many critics denounced its violence as sadistic and exploitative. Other critics and filmmakers hailed the originality of its unique rapid editing style, created {{for the first time in}} this film and ultimately becoming a Peckinpah trademark, and praised the reworking of traditional Western themes. It was the beginning of Peckinpah's international fame, and he and his work remained controversial for the rest of his life. The film was ranked No. 80 on the American Film Institute's top 100 list of the greatest American films ever made and No. 69 as the most thrilling, but the controversy has not diminished. When The Wild Bunch was re-released for its 25th anniversary, even though it received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, the depiction of violence, especially in the opening robbery sequence, had been significantly edited to soften its impact. Nonetheless, the film continues to be powerful even <b>after</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>years.</b> Peckinpah received his only Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay for this film.|$|E

40|$|In today's world, so much {{knowledge}} is developed through {{a steady stream}} of short research projects that longer ones are becoming more unusual. That is why we decided to pause and look back over the seven-year-long joint endeavor between The Pictorium and Certec. This was also seen as a short-term project from the beginning.

Such a meeting is part of what our culture and society often advocate in comprehensive terms. Conscious efforts of a similar nature are at times carried out from within the worlds of art and science. But in this case the convergence was not at all part of the original intention, and we who have participated in the work have not actually considered it in those terms from within the project's framework. <b>After</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>year</b> of not seeing what was staring us in the face, it is thus exciting to raise the question about what is holding it all together, what the linchpin can be.
