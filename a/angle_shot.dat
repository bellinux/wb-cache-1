500|$|The {{music video}} {{was greeted with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim. Music journalist Mark Pytlik wrote the visual [...] "marked an unquestionable creative apex for Björk's visual work, a perfect synthesis of form and content". IGN gave the video a score of 9/10, writing it is an [...] "utterly gorgeous sight to behold" [...] and [...] "just about perfect". Times Craig Duff called it a milestone in computer animation and stated that [...] "no robot had expressed the sensuality that director Chris Cunningham imbues in a Björk-bot in the video". MusicRadar considered the music video to be [...] "one of the most visually striking promos of Björk's career." [...] NME also praised the [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] clip as one of Björk's best, and particularly commended the wide <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> of the cyborgs kissing as the chorus kicks in. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine dubbed it [...] "the perfect pre-millennial precursor to our current gadget-assisted culture of self-love" [...] and also wrote, [...] "When it was released, I thought it looked cool and {{stressed the importance of}} loving yourself. Now I think it's a terrifying and sealed-off nightmare wherein you find out that you are the only person who will ever love you." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Scott Plagenhoef considered that [...] "the strongest single images from any video of the 1990s come from [...] ", also calling it [...] "strange and moving". CMJ New Music Monthlys Douglas Wolk called the video [...] "magnificent" [...] and praised it for [...] " [...] out the beauty of the song".|$|E
500|$|Despite the New York City setting, {{additional}} skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois provided {{inspiration for}} the opening sequence of the skyline, such as the Merchandise Mart and Aon Center. Skyscrapers from New York City included the Chanin Building, the Fred F. French Building and One Wall Street, Manhattan. [...] "We took all our favorite buildings in New York from where they actually stood and sort of put them into one neighborhood," [...] Gassner continued, [...] "a fantasy vision which adds to the atmosphere and flavor." [...] First of all, a model had to be created based on the fantasy 1950's New York for the opening shot. So a miniature city was created, as McAlister mentioned that the Coens did not want a realistic reproduction of [...] 1950's New York skyline, instead they wanted a more stylized version of it. [...] So Gassner used the book New York in The Forties as a reference to create the look for the cityscape. It took three months and 27 crew member to create the miniature city at the scale of 24:1. As for the Hudsucker building, they made it at the scale of 6:1 for closer shots including the long-zoom in of Norville at the beginning. For that scene to be created, it started off with a wide <b>angle</b> <b>shot,</b> moving closer towards Tim Robbins, who was standing in a full sized set, which they inserted inside the shot of the model clock. ‘Marrying a live-action image with a painted or miniature element was, of course, nothing new, however, {{in the case of}} the zoom-in on Robbins from such a distance, keeping the full-size set locked in with the model building, ‘that was state-of-the-art and the only way to do it was with computers.’ says McAlister. Most of the buildings were created with two sides only, as they will only be seen from the front and the side, and some only needed one side as they were only going to be seen from the front, while the Hudsucker building was made completely three-dimensional. The work of The Computer Film Company (supervised by Janek Sirrs) included manipulations of the zoom-in shot of Norville at the beginning, as well as CGI snow and composites of the falling sequences.|$|E
2500|$|Lyle Ashton Harris and Renee Valerie Cox {{worked in}} {{collaboration}} {{to produce the}} photographic piece Hottentot Venus 2000. [...] In this piece, Harris photographs Victoria Cox who presents herself as Baartman while wearing large, sculptural, gold, metal breasts and buttocks attached to her body. According to Deborah Willis, the paraphernalia attached to Cox's body are markers for {{the way in which}} Baartman's sexual body parts were essential for her constructed role or function as the 'Hottentot Venus.' Willis also explains that Cox's side <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> makes reference to the 'scientific' traditional propaganda used by Cuvier and Julian-Joseph Virey who sourced Baartman's traditional illustrations and iconography to publish their 'scientific' findings.|$|E

2500|$|Film {{critics have}} often noted De Palma's penchant for unusual camera angles and {{compositions}} throughout his career. He often frames characters {{against the background}} using a canted <b>angle</b> <b>shot.</b> Split-screen techniques {{have been used to}} show two separate events happening simultaneously. To emphasize the dramatic impact of a certain scene De Palma has employed a 360-degree camera pan. Slow sweeping, panning and tracking shots are often used throughout his films, often through precisely-choreographed long takes lasting for minutes without cutting. Split focus shots, often referred to as [...] "di-opt", are used by De Palma to emphasize the foreground person/object while simultaneously keeping a background person/object in focus. Slow-motion is frequently used in his films to increase suspense.|$|E

50|$|Angled shotAs {{compared}} to the fast return that uses speed to catch the opponent off-guard, <b>angled</b> <b>shots</b> {{are meant to be}} more subtle but are harder to pull off. However, if executed correctly, it is probably the most efficient way of hitting a passing shot. It involves hitting the ball at as acute an angle as possible, usually cross-court such that the ball falls {{right in front of the}} net, but bounces towards the side, making it impossible for the opponent to return the ball. To hit at such an angle, a lot of top-spin on the ball is usually required as well as a soft touch. Thus, players who can execute <b>angled</b> <b>shots</b> well are usually players who are familiar with using a lot of top-spin in their play, such as Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, who is famous for hitting Half-volley <b>angled</b> passing <b>shots.</b> Chris Evert is usually considered to have had one of the best directed passing shots in the history of the game, hitting her shots with pinpoint precision against serve and volley players.|$|R

50|$|The 1949 film The Third Man makes {{extensive}} use of Dutch <b>angle</b> <b>shots,</b> to emphasize the main character's alienation in a foreign environment. An anecdote of cinema lore alleges that once filming was completed, the crew presented director Carol Reed with a spirit level, to sardonically encourage him to use more traditional shooting angles.|$|R

50|$|Fast low <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (FLASH MRI) is a basic measuring principle for rapid MRI invented in 1985 by Jens Frahm, Axel Haase, W Hänicke, KD Merboldt, and D Matthaei (German Patent Application P 35 04 734.8, February 12, 1985) at the Max-Planck-Institut für biophysikalische Chemie in Göttingen, Germany. The technique is revolutionary in shortening MRI measuring times by up to two orders of magnitude.|$|E
50|$|The Dark Knight (directed by Christopher Nolan): Nolan uses {{extremely}} low angle shots {{to give the}} Joker a more powerful image in The Dark Knight, especially during the scene where the truck he was driving is flipped over and he gets out and starts shooting at Batman. In this scene, the angle actually goes from a normal medium close up and slowly moves into a low <b>angle</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of the film’s {{aesthetic}} and storytelling “innovations” {{was to try}} and tell much of the story from the cane toads’ point of view. This was achieved {{by a number of}} extremely low <b>angle</b> <b>shots.</b> Lewis’ goal was to give a voice to the toads who were at the center of so much controversy, and “create some sympathy for this animal that was so widely reviled”.|$|R
50|$|J. Cain (based on Jimmy Connors) - Cain has a {{very weak}} serve (only capable of {{reaching}} just over 100 mph), but his groundshots are powerful and {{he is able to}} easily hit winners.

5000|$|A Dutch {{angle is}} a camera shot {{in which the}} camera has been rotated {{relative}} to the horizon or vertical lines in the shot. The primary use of such angles is to cause a sense of unease or disorientation for the viewer. Many Dutch angles are static shots, but in a moving Dutch <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> the camera can pivot, pan or track along the established diagonal axis for the shot.|$|E

In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first; this can cause lip sync errors in the Japanese version.|$|R
50|$|Two {{weeks into}} the 2013-14 season, Doughty joined League One side Stevenage on loan until January 2014. He made his debut a day after signing, on 17 August, playing the whole game in a 1-0 home defeat to Leyton Orient. On 26 October 2013, Doughty scored a 90th-minute goal, his first goal in {{professional}} football, a left footed <b>angled</b> <b>shot</b> from the left flank into the far corner, during Stevenage's home match against Crawley Town.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this is {{understanding}} how the simple combination of shots can create an additional idea: the blank expression on a person's face, an appetizing meal, and then back to the person's face. While nothing in this sequence literally expresses hunger—or desire—the juxtaposition of the images convey that meaning to the audience. Unraveling this additional meaning can become quite complex. Lighting, <b>angle,</b> <b>shot</b> duration, juxtaposition, cultural context, and a wide array of other elements can actively reinforce or undermine a sequence's meaning. This is known as the Kuleshov Effect.|$|E
