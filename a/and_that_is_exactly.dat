Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion.

2500|$|Torquay’s {{play-off}} semi-final opponents {{turned out}} to be Shrewsbury who missed out on automatic promotion by just one point. [...] With the first leg at Plainmoor in front of the Sky Sports cameras, the Shrews were no doubt mindful of the 5-0 thrashing they had received at the Gulls’ home ground just two months previously. [...] The fact that two of those goals came from Jake Robinson (on loan from Shrewsbury) added extra spice to the tie, particularly as there was no clause preventing Robinson from playing against his parent club in the play-offs. [...] Despite Robinson not getting on the score sheet, Torquay produced an assured performance which saw them comfortably win the first leg 2-0 thanks to goals from Chris Zebroski and Eunan O’Kane.

60|$|What is it {{that has}} made the British peoples thus defer not only their {{artificial}} parade of party politics but their real social and moral complaints and demands? What {{is it that}} has united all of us against the Prussian, as against a mad dog? It is the presence of a certain spirit, as unmistakable as a pungent smell, which we feel is capable of withering all the good things in this world. The burglary of Belgium, the bribe to betray France, these are not excuses; they are facts. But they are only the facts by which we came to know of the presence of the spirit. They do not suffice to define the whole spirit itself. A good rough summary is {{to say that it is}} the spirit of barbarism; but indeed it is something worse. It is the spirit of second-rate civilisation; and the distinction involves the most important differences. Granted that it could exist, pure barbarism could not last long; as pure babyhood cannot last long. Of his own nature the baby is interested in the ticking of a watch; and the time will come when you will have to tell him, if you only tell him the wrong time. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> what the second-rate civilisation does.|$|E
60|$|From {{this simple}} origin, then, the whole vast {{difference}} {{of right and}} left in civilised life takes its beginning. At first, no doubt, {{the superiority of the}} right hand was only felt in the matter of fighting. But that alone gave it a distinct pull, and paved the way, at last, for its supremacy elsewhere. For when weapons came into use, the habitual employment of the right hand to grasp the spear, sword, or knife made the nerves and muscles of the right side far more obedient to the control of the will than those of the left. The dexterity thus acquired by the right--see how the very word 'dexterity' implies this fact--made it more natural for the early hunter and artificer to employ the same hand preferentially in the manufacture of flint hatchets, bows and arrows, and in all the other manifold activities of savage life. It was the hand with which he grasped his weapon; it was therefore the hand with which he chipped it. To the very end, however, the right hand remains especially 'the hand in which you hold your knife;' <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> how our own children to this day decide the question which is which, when they begin to know their right hand from their left for practical purposes.|$|E

60|$|America {{is always}} spoken of {{as a young}} nation; and whether or no this be a {{valuable}} and suggestive metaphor, very few people notice {{that it is a}} metaphor at all. If somebody said that a certain deserving charity had just gone into trousers, we should recognise that it was a figure of speech, and perhaps a rather surprising figure of speech. If somebody said that a daily paper had recently put its hair up, we should know it could only be a metaphor, and possibly a rather strained metaphor. Yet these phrases would mean {{the only thing that can}} possibly be meant by calling a corporate association of all sorts of people 'young'; that is, that a certain institution has only existed for a certain time. I am not now denying that such a corporate nationality may happen to have a psychology comparatively analogous to the psychology of youth. I am not even denying that America has it. I am only pointing out, to begin with, that we must free ourselves from the talismanic tyranny of a metaphor which we do not recognise as a metaphor. Men realised that the old mystical doctrines were mystical; they do not realise that the new metaphors are metaphorical. They have some sort of hazy notion that American society must be growing, must be promising, must have the virtues of hope or the faults of ignorance, merely because it has only had a separate existence since the eighteenth century. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> like saying that a new chapel must be growing taller, or that a limited liability company will soon have its second teeth.|$|E
6000|$|But {{there is}} another way in which common sense {{can be brought to}} the {{criticism}} of some prodigious racial theories. To employ the same figure, suppose the scientific historians explain the historic centuries in terms of a prehistoric division between short-sighted and long-sighted men. They could cite their instances and illustrations. They would certainly explain the curiosity of language I mentioned first, as showing that the short-sighted were the conquered race, and their name therefore a term of contempt. They could give us very graphic pictures of the rude tribal war. They could show how the long-sighted people were always cut to pieces in hand-to-hand struggles with axe and knife; until, with the invention of bows and arrows, the advantage veered to the long-sighted, and their enemies were shot down in droves. I could easily write a ruthless romance about it, and still more easily a ruthless anthropological theory. According to that thesis which refers all moral to material changes, they could explain the tradition that old people grow conservative in politics by the well-known fact that old people grow more long-sighted. But I think there might be one thing about this theory which would stump us, and might even, if it be possible, stump them. Suppose it were pointed out that through all the three thousand years of recorded history, abounding in literature of every conceivable kind, there was {{not so much as a}} mention of the oculist question for which all had been dared and done. Suppose not one of the living or dead languages of mankind had so much as a word for [...] "long-sighted" [...] or [...] "short-sighted." [...] Suppose, in short, the question that had torn the whole world in two was never even asked at all, until some spectacle-maker suggested it somewhere about 1750. In that case I think we should find it hard to believe that this physical difference had really played so fundamental a part in human history. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> the case with the physical difference between the Celts, the Teutons and the Latins.|$|E
