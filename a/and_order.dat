30|$|Initially, Porteus (1986) {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} capital investment in reducing ordering cost on the classical Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model for the first time. Ouyang et al. (1999) discussed lead time <b>and</b> <b>ordering</b> cost reductions in continuous review inventory systems with partial backorders. Later, Chang et al. (2006) presented lead time <b>and</b> <b>ordering</b> cost reduction problem in the single-vendor single-buyer integrated inventory model. They considered that buyer lead time can be shortened at an extra crashing cost which depends on the lead time length to be reduced <b>and</b> the <b>ordering</b> lot size, as well buyer ordering cost can be reduced through further investment. The main important single factor which influences the decision on re-order quantity is the total of carrying cost <b>and</b> <b>ordering</b> cost. Carrying cost increase with increase in re-order quantity while ordering cost decreases with increase order quantity. Thus, carrying cost <b>and</b> <b>ordering</b> cost move in opposite directions. Material manager, in deciding the re-order quantity, endeavours to keep the total of carrying cost <b>and</b> <b>ordering</b> cost at the minimum.|$|R
