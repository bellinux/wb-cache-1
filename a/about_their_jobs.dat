For the older members of the staff (e.g. Yvonne, Barry and Mr Partridge), the camp was a step down from past glories. Caught in the middle were staff members close to middle age (e.g. Ted Bovis and Fred Quilley) who still believed they could achieve fame and fortune, and were reluctant to accept that working at a holiday camp was the best they would ever do.|$|E

After reading Lifeless during his time filming The Water Horse in New Zealand, Morrissey searched the Internet for more information.

40|$|In this {{longitudinal}} study, we {{test whether}} {{varying degrees of}} indecision about future career choices at age 16 have long-term economic consequences in adulthood, taking into account potential gender differences.

This association was significant even after controlling for family socioeconomic status, parental expectations and academic ability at age 16.
