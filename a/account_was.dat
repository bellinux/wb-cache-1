Personal <b>accounts</b> <b>are</b> <b>accounts</b> relating to persons or organisations with whom the business has transactions and will mainly consist of accounts of debtors and creditors.

5|$|One of {{the stated}} {{purposes}} for writing the <b>account</b> <b>was</b> Las Casas's fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and {{his concern for}} {{the souls of the}} native peoples. The <b>account</b> <b>was</b> one of the first attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict the unfair treatment that the indigenous people endured during {{the early stages of the}} Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola. Las Casas's point of view can be described as being heavily against some of the Spanish methods of colonization, which, as he described them, inflicted great losses on the indigenous occupants of the islands. His <b>account</b> <b>was</b> largely responsible for the adoption of the New Laws of 1542, which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history and led to the Valladolid debate.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{wrote that}} Peshkin's <b>account</b> <b>was</b> fair, and praised his {{decision}} to let the participants speak for themselves through quotations.

5|$|A {{fighter pilot}} based at Andrews Air Force Base, Billy Hutchison, claims that {{while in the}} air he spotted Flight 93 on his scope and planned to first fire his {{training}} rounds into the engine and cockpit, and then ram the airplane with his own jet. His <b>account</b> <b>was</b> published in Lynn Spencer's book Touching History. John Farmer, Senior Counsel to the 9/11 commission, pointed out that this account would have been impossible, as Hutchison's Air Andrews Squadron {{was not in the}} air until 10:38, almost 30 minutes after Flight 93 had crashed. When the 9/11 commission asked Hutchison why he gave this false claim he stormed {{out of the room and}} refused to give an answer.|$|E

5|$|After an {{erroneous}} scouting {{report of}} approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin {{to the ground}} on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's <b>account</b> <b>was</b> that the residents burned their own property {{to keep it out}} of the hands of the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.|$|E
5|$|Coffelt's <b>account</b> <b>was</b> {{reviewed}} by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in significant details from information {{that had not been}} made public, and was therefore a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, considered and rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale although it had been discredited 36 years before.|$|E
5|$|During {{the march}} to Kediri, the Mataram–VOC army purposefully split {{itself and the}} columns took different, {{indirect}} routes to Kediri, as suggested by Amangkurat. This enabled the army to meet more factions and to win over those with wavering allegiance. The army marched through areas previously unexplored by the Dutch. The Dutch <b>account</b> <b>was</b> recorded in a journal by Hurdt's secretary Johan Jurgen Briel. Accounts of the campaign also appear in babads (Javanese chronicles).|$|E

In 1824, their <b>account</b> <b>was</b> published as part of Voyage autour du monde...sur les corvettes de S.M. l'Uranie et la Physicienne, Louis de Freycinet's 13 volume report on the voyage.

5|$|In February 2012, President Obama froze {{all assets}} of the Iranian {{government}} in the U.S., which included the Citibank account alleged {{to be controlled by}} Bank Markazi.

Bank Markazi claimed that the <b>account</b> <b>was</b> not an asset of Bank Markazi, but its intermediary, Clearstream, in relation to both TRIA and New York state property law.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{publicly}} about Biko's death, the country's police minister Jimmy Kruger initially implied {{that it had}} been the result of a hunger strike, a statement he later denied. His <b>account</b> <b>was</b> challenged by some of Biko's friends, including Woods, who said that Biko had told them that he would never kill himself in prison. Publicly, he stated that Biko had been plotting violence, a claim repeated in the pro-government press. South Africa's attorney general initially stated that no one would be prosecuted for Biko's death. Two weeks after the funeral, the government banned all Black Consciousness organisations, including the BCP, which had its assets seized.|$|E

(2) CFROI <b>accounting</b> <b>is</b> the ratio in nature, there fore the increase in CFROI is not necessarily the corporate value increase in itself...|$|R

5|$|The Rodrigues rail is {{believed}} to have become extinct in the mid-18th century because of predation by introduced cats and destruction of its habitat by tortoise hunters. Apart from information gathered from subfossil bones, the bird is poorly known and was only documented from life by two contemporaneous accounts, but no such illustrations. The bird was first mentioned by François Leguat, a French Huguenot refugee marooned on Rodrigues in 1691, and was named E. leguati in his honour in 1874. The second <b>account</b> <b>was</b> by Julien Tafforet, also marooned on the island in 1726. Subfossil remains were later discovered and connected with the old accounts.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle between}} Sydney and Kormoran {{is seen as}} controversial: the disbelief that a {{modified}} merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined {{with the lack of}} Australian survivors led some to believe that the German <b>account</b> <b>was</b> false. Rumours that the battle was not what it seemed had been around since Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book Who Sank The Sydney? with igniting the controversy.|$|E
