40|$|Abstract—Participation {{in global}} trade means that China’s {{vegetables}} <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> industry faces international food safety standards and increased scrutiny worldwide. The objectives {{of this paper}} were to investigate how existing food safety standards and regulations in the importing countries impact the export of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> from China. This paper discussed the current and historical situations of China’s vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> export from 1996 to 2010, analyzed the Maximum Residual Limit (MRL) standards of pesticides imposed by importing countries, quantitatively estimated the impacts of food safety standards on China’s vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> export based on a gravity model. The results showed that although transportation distance between trade partners and tariff rates on vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> were still the importantly resistant factors for China export, vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> export was sensitive {{to the number of}} regulated pesticides, the strictness, and the level of food safety standards imposed by importing countries, which showed a significant trade flow effect, stricter food safety standards, increased number of regulated pesticides significantly inhibit China export of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits.</b> Moreover, China’s food safety standards also showed a significantly effect on vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> export, which inhibited export to some extent...|$|R

40|$|A {{dissertation}} on Vegetables <b>and</b> <b>Fruits</b> Consumption Campaign <b>and</b> Sales for Sustainable Economic Development of Vendors in Chamazi Market {{is a result}} of the Community Needs Assessments (CNA) conducted in Chamazi Market to vendors and consumers of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits.</b> The CNA revealed that vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> consumption is very low to majority of residents in Chamazi. This situation has affected vendors of the products since they cannot generate high income to suffice their livelihood. There are a number of factors that contribute for low intake of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> among Chamazi residents including; lack of nutrition education on the importance of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits,</b> low income that affects purchasing power and unavailability of different varieties of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> in Chamazi market. Consequently a number of factors that contribute to low sales among vendors are such as lack of entrepreneurial skills, poor marketing skill, poor working environment (market space) l lack of capital, unreliable market for some varieties which are not common in Chamazi market and poor technology i. e. lacks of preservative facilities (cold rooms) since vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> are more perishable products. However, Vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> selling is a very good and reliable business if it is done with expertise following the potential nutrients found for human health. Every individual and household requires to consume vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> whether they like or not for their better health. Vendors should cultivate on this positive point of nutrition benefits of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> plus marketing skills to ensure high income through high sales. To achieve the project objectives, a participatory approach are necessary to be able to increase awareness to communities about the project equally nutrition education and consumption campaigns are continuously inevitable. In this view, stakeholders and policy makers are to be involved for project sustainability and up-scaling. The expected outcome is increased vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> consumption resulting to increased sales for sustainable income generation to vendors in general...|$|R
