Hence, the use of expensive refractories, such as yttria, represents an unnecessary cost when combined with a silica binder. It was also found that the alloyed titanium castings had a thinner <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> than those produced from CP-Ti, which suggests that the thickness of the <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> depends on the crystal structure of the alloy during cooling from high temperatures.

The aerospace industry has a requirement to remove <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> (formed during heat treatment) from titanium alloys. as <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> is detrimental to the fatigue life of the components. The existing process for <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> removal is chemical etching which is costly and environmentally unfriendly. Thus, this research seeks to evaluate the PWJ process as. an innovative method to remove <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> from a titanium alloy- Ti - 6 AI- 4 V. An additional benefit of removing <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> using PWJ technology is that PWJ can introduce compressive residual stress in the remaining surface. As an essential step towards a comprehensive understanding of the PW J <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> removal process and the surface after <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> removal, {{the response of the}} substrate Ti- 6 A I- 4 V under PWJ erosion has to be investigated. Hence, the scope of this research covers material damage mechanisms under PWJ erosion both in plain Ti- 6 AJ- 4 V and in Ti- 6 AI- 4 V with an alpha case; the effect of major process parameters on the process performance measures, process modelling. and residual stress introduced by the proposed <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> removal process are all investigated. The current study has provided a comprehensive view of the development of material damage on Ti- 6 AI- 4 V under PWJ impingement. Damage and material removal along alpha grain boundaries are found to be the dominant initial damage modes. A detailed experimental investigation is then presented which examines the role of a number of process parameters on the removal depth, material removal rate, and surface finish in the PWJ erosion of Ti- 6 AI- 4 V. The independent effects (as well as coupled effects) on all the identified process outcomes in both PWJ linear and area erosion have been demonstrated. A numerical model is established to predict the depth of PWJ machined tracks based upon impinged energy density. It is also shown that an increase in depth of material removed is associated with increasing surface roughness, irrespective of process parameter settings. The study of residual stress on PWJ-treated Abstract Ti- 6 AI- 4 V surfaces shows that the development of high levels of compressive stress on Ti- 6 AI- 4 V is associated with initial damage while the maximum compressive stress is reached when a proportion of the original surface has been removed. Based on the knowledge established through processing of Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V, a detailed experimental investigation on <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> removal was then carried out. It has been found that the process parameters affect the <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> removal process in a similar way to that in PWJ erosion of Ti- 6 AI- 4 V. However. the material damage mechanisms of the <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> contaminated Ti- 6 A I- 4 V are more complex, including brittle fracture as the initial damage mode, which then changes to ductile fracture after the most brittle surface layer has been completely removed. The results also reveal apparent proportional correlation between the removal depth and the resulting surface roughness. The compressive residual stress introduced into the material during PWJ impingement reaches the maximum when only a portion of the <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> has been removed, implying that <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> may be not need to be fully removed for a significant enhancement in the fatigue life to be realized. An artificial neural network (ANN) approach has been proposed to predict the performance measures in the PWJ <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> removal process due to its complexity. The ANN model has verified statistically by assessing the model predictions with respect to the corresponding experimental data. The influence of the amount of model input data on the prediction performance has also been investigated. The results show that the proposed ANN approach can adequately predict the process performance measures in removal of small scale <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> using PW 1. It is also shown {{that it is possible to}} reduce the number of required training data without compromising the prediction performance through using a Proper design of experiments. The knowledge established from this research can be app lied not only to PWJ <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> removal, but also to other potential PWJ surface treatment applications, such as PWJ roughening of surfaces of medical implants or surfaces where further coating will be applied.

This study was aimed at investigating the mechanism and the extent of <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> formation on Ti- 64 components cast using the investment casting method with YFSZ (yttria fully-stabilized zirconia) shell moulds after vacuum induction melting. The extent of the reaction between the mould hot face and the molten metal has been studied by varying parameters such as soaking temperature and mould hot face composition, and examining their effects on the reaction with the mould.

40|$|Abstract. Titanium alloys offer {{excellent}} corrosion resistance, good {{strength to}} weight ratio, is nonmagnetic and biocompatible. This allows them {{to be used in}} demanding applications and specialised industries ranging from aviation to medicine. However, at high temperatures the metal is chemically reactive which requires several manufacturing processes such as melting and welding to be performed either in vacuum or inert gas atmosphere. Some processes such as rolling are impractical to be performed in inert gas atmosphere. Titanium alloys, notably Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, develops a hard oxide layer on the outer surface during hot processing, such as rolling, in atmospheric conditions. This oxide layer, commonly referred to as the <b>alpha</b> <b>case,</b> is both hard and brittle. The increased Young's modulus of the <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> creating an outer layer with increased stiffness where maximum stresses occur, results in localized micro failure. The micro failures in this layer serve as a fatigue crack initiation zone, compromising the integrity of the component and causing it to fail. Traditionally <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> is removed by means of chemical milling in hot acid baths using aggressive acids such as Hydrofluoric acid. The facilities needed for chemical milling require high capital costs as well as stringent and costly safety requirements. Lastly, the disposal of used acids is proving to become increasingly difficult due to the strict South African environmental laws. Removal of this layer by means of light pass machining has therefore become more desirable, however at present it remains economically infeasible.

All rights reserved. Titanium alloys are widely used in the aerospace and medical industries owing to their high strength to weight ratio and outstanding corrosion resistance. A problem for titanium or titanium alloys is {{the existence of a}} hard, brittle and oxygen-enriched layer on the surface (so called <b>alpha</b> <b>case).</b> This is usually formed during hot forming processes or after long-term service at elevated temperatures in an open-air environment. With the development of waterjet systems, high pressure waterjet has shown its capability for the removal of such hard and difficult-to-machine coatings. Waterjet machining is usually associated with a surface roughening, which is unwanted for most of aerospace applications, but is beneficial for medical application where fixation is required (e. g. metal orthopedic implants). A potential benefit of waterjet material removal is that the process may introduce compressive residual stress to the machined surface and subsurface layers. In this study, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V with an <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> layer was subjected to plain waterjet impact over a range of parametric conditions, to fully remove the <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> layer.

We compare the results of a Lyman <b>alpha</b> trapping <b>case</b> inside gas clouds with atomic and molecular hydrogen cooling cases. The principal objective of this research is to follow the collapse of a zero metallicity halo with an effective equation of state (that accounts for the trapping) and to explore the fate of a halo {{in each of the three}} cases, specifically, the impact of thermodynamics on fragmentation of halos. Our results show that in the <b>case</b> of Lyman <b>alpha</b> trapping, fragmentation is halted and a massive object is formed at the center of a halo. The temperature of the gas remains well above $ 10 ^{ 4 }$ K and the halo is not able to fragment to stellar masses. In the atomic cooling case, gas collapses into one or two massive clumps in contrast to the Lyman <b>alpha</b> trapping <b>case.</b> For the molecular hydrogen cooling case, gas cools efficiently and fragments. The formation of massive primordial objects is thus strongly dependent on the thermodynamics of the gas. A salient feature of our results is that for the formation of massive objects, e. g. intermediate mass black holes, feedback effects are not required to suppress $H_{ 2 }$ cooling, as molecular hydrogen is collisionally dissociated at temperatures higher than $ 10 ^{ 4 }$ K as a consequence of Lyman alpha trapping.

The DW motion along the uniaxial wire corresponds to the asymptotical DW oscillation solution under high field/current in the biaxial wire case.

Its effect {{is known to be}} mediated through binding to specific nuclear (RARs and RXRs) or cytoplasmic (CRABP) proteins. ATRA is strikingly effective in acute promyelocytic leukemia (the AML 3 subtype) inducing a high incidence of complete remissions. Paradoxically, most AML 3 cells harbor an abnormal retinoic acid receptor (PML/RAR alpha) resulting from the t(15; 17) translocation. Though few AML 3 patients do not respond to ATRA therapy, individualization of these cases is of practical importance. Recently the RAR alpha gene has been demonstrated to be involved in a novel fusion transcript (PLZF/RAR alpha) through a t(11; 17) translocation. We describe here the second case of such a patient with a t(11; 17) -PLZF/RAR alpha leukemic clone. Southern analysis revealed that the breakpoint in the RAR alpha gene was within the second intron (as for PML/RAR alpha) and the intron separating the second and third zinc finger of the PLZF gene. In vitro, the leukemic cells did not show increased NBT reduction or loss of self-renewal after incubation with ATRA. After therapy with ATRA, only partial remission was obtained.

40|$|Electron beam {{traversing}} in {{vacuum chamber}} can be severely affected by collective instabilities generated from an interaction of beam with its surrounding, geometric wakefield, and the synchrotron radiation emitted, radiation wakefield. The beam dynamics is significantly influenced by such beam-wakefield interactions eventually limiting the maximum stored current. Especially in short bunch consideration {{which is a}} primary criterion for the generation of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR), the beam instability is strongly amplified by an enhanced wakefield. The understanding of beam intensity limitation mechanism has still been underdeveloped. Therefore, the dynamical development of a bunch with a presence of collective instability needs to be scrutinized. A numerical evaluation tool, sbtrack, is developed {{to be able to}} calculate the collective effects due to both radiation and geometric wakefields. The impedance characterization with Haissinski equation is also proposed and evidently shows that a broad-band impedance model is able to reproduce most features of intensity dependent bunch development under particular wakefield. Evaluation of longitudinal beam dynamic verifies that each kind of wakefield contributes characteristic effect to the bunch development and essentially influences resulting CSR bursting behaviour. In positive alpha, the bunch transforms from a confined barred-spiral shape to sawtooth behaviour while in negative alpha, spur-like local fluctuation is induced on the bunch phase space and enhancing the semi-chaotic fluctuation of the entire bunch when the chaotic threshold is exceeded. Beyond the chaotic threshold, bunch profile of both <b>alpha</b> <b>cases</b> are found to evolve with similar systematic development. However, such mechanism in negative alpha seems to be able to consistently occurred at higher current than positive alpha. Unexpectedly, the temporal occurrence of chaotic-harmonic evolution of a bunch is numerically discovered in negative alpha.

Ti 6 Al 4 V {{is one of the}} most widely used titanium alloys in aerospace applications, but its machining remains a challenge. This is partly due to the lack of understanding of the thermal- and mechanical constraints during milling. Extensive research has been done in the past investigating catastrophic tool failure of various tool materials. However, not much research has been done to investigate the cause of work piece failure. The catastrophic effect of overheating the work piece and the resulting <b>alpha</b> <b>case</b> formation in titanium is well known. Current techniques of temperature measurement of the machined surface can be divided into two categories: contact- and optical methods. In this study these temperature measurement techniques were studied and evaluated. The response time of contact methods are found to be to relatively slow. The optical methods have the advantage of immediate response, allowing capture of intermittent heat generation as required in milling. The infrared camera temperature measurement experiments were conducted with a special setup in order to have a good visual of the temperature flow. The results of these experiments were found to correspond with literature.

40|$|The Piper Alpha {{catastrophe}} in 1988 {{revealed the}} potential of operational failures with respect to dramatically destroying an entire offshore installation. When a severe hydrocarbon leak occurred due to operational oversights, other safety barriers collapsed mainly {{due to lack of}} a prudent safety culture. Statistics for the Norwegian offshore industry show that each year there are about 5 - 6 hydrocarbon leaks at least the size of that kicking off the Piper Alpha sequence of events, the majority of these leaks have operational causes. The challenge with operational failures is that when leaks occur in such circumstances, other barriers may also fail due to common cause factors, as in the Piper <b>Alpha</b> <b>case.</b> Accident investigations are often weak when it comes to analysis of root causes and common mode failures. In order to provide improved understanding of the operational failures that cause leaks, a set of incident reports have been analyzed in order to identify the common patterns in hydrocarbon leaks due to operational failures. Other scenarios where failures of operational barriers are dominating contributions are falling objects from cranes, as well as failure of station-keeping by large tankers in attendant mode. The former has been the dominating scenario for fatal accidents on Norwegian offshore installations for several years, whereas the latter is a potential scenario for extreme collision cases, where so far only near-misses have occurred. There are usually a number of redundant barriers against major accidents with technical causes on offshore installations, giving low risk values. Wit...|$|E
40|$|Tensile coupons of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V were {{heat treated}} at varying {{annealing}} temperatures from 1200 °F (648 °C) to 1450 °F (787 °C) at 50 °F (23 °C) increments for 1 hour. The samples were air cooled {{to room temperature}} or furnace cooled to 800 °F (426 °C) followed by air cooling to room temperature. Four tensile coupons were treated at each annealing temperature and cooling rate. <b>Alpha</b> <b>case</b> was observed to form {{on the surface of}} the samples post heat treatment with a maximum depth of 25 µm (. 001 in). Samples were tensile tested for their ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, and percent elongation. Samples across all annealing temperatures averaged an ultimate tensile strength of 920 MPa (133 ksi), a yield strength of 880 MPa (127 ksi), and a percent elongation of 15 %. These values are higher than the given standards for annealed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V by 20 MPa, 50 MPa, and 5 %, respectively. This is an offset of 2 to 5 % for overall stress, and 50 % for elongation. Micrographs of all samples showed equiaxed grains of primary alpha with transformed intergranular beta. The average grain size of primary alpha was 10 µm (4. 0 x 10 - 4 in). These annealing temperatures, which fall under the martensitic starting temperature in the alpha-beta phase field, further relieve residual stresses in the material without compromising the morphology of the alpha-phase. The extent of annealing temperature within this range offers little difference to the strength of the material and microstructure given the hot worked and annealed samples...|$|E
30|$|The co-voting {{agreement}} between organizations in a co-voting cluster {{is computed by}} Krippendorff’s Alpha agreement measure (Krippendorff 2013). Alpha is typically used as a measure to quantify the extent of agreement among human raters. When raters agree perfectly, Alpha= 1, and when the level of agreement equals the agreement by chance, Alpha= 0. Besides its typical applications, Alpha was already used to quantify the {{agreement between}} annotators in machine learning (Mozetič et al. 2016), and co-voting agreements and disagreements in the European Parliament (Cherepnalkoski et al. 2016). In our <b>case,</b> <b>Alpha</b> measures the level of agreement between answers to consultations (see Table  4).|$|R
40|$|In {{the theory}} of {{thermonuclear}} reaction rates, analytical evaluation of thermonuclear functions for non-resonant reactions, including cases with cut-off and depletion of {{the tail of the}} Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function were considered in a series of papers by Mathai and Haubold (1988). In the present paper we study more general classes of thermonuclear functions by introducing a pathway parameter alpha, so that when alpha [...] > 1 the thermonuclear functions in the Maxwell-Boltzmannian case are recovered. We will also give interpretations for the pathway parameter <b>alpha</b> in the <b>case</b> of cut-off and in terms of moments. Comment: 8 pages, Plain Te...|$|R
40|$|The {{rates of}} {{convergence}} of two Bernstein-Bezier type operators B-n((alpha)) and L-n((alpha)) for functions of bounded variation {{have been studied}} for the <b>case</b> <b>alpha</b> {{greater than or equal}} to 1 by the author and A. Piriou (1998. J. Approx. Theory 95, 369 - 387). In this paper the other ease 0 < alpha < 1 is treated and asymptotically optimal estimations of B-n((alpha)) and L-n((alpha)) for functions of bounded variation are obtained. Besides. some interesting behaviors of the operators B-n((alpha)) and L-n((alpha)) for monotone functions and functions of bounded variation are also given. (C) 2000 Academic Press...|$|R
