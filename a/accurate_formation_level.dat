40|$|ABSTRACT – This {{contribution}} {{is concerned with}} the numerical simulation of spacecraft formation dynamics on Halo orbits around the Sun-Earth libration points. The circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP) in rotating coordinates serves as the analytical framework. The primary goal is to identify regions in phase space in which the uncontrolled dynamics induces only very small perturbations on satellite formations and thus allow for an energy-optimal formation keeping strat-egy. This obviously leads to lower cost and mass budgets and longer operation times. The results obtained here indicate {{that it is possible to}} perform an <b>accurate</b> <b>formation</b> keeping around the libration points purely based on low thrust manoeu-vres.

40|$|The {{construction}} of basements {{in urban areas}} {{is often associated with}} the possible damage to existing structures and services. The varying construction processes inevitably lead to different stress unloading patterns and therefore the dissipation of these excess pore-water pressures may lead to non-standard deformation profiles. The three main types of basement construction processes are layered excavation (LE), basin excavation (BE) and island excavation (IE). The effect of the various unloading patterns has been investigated by a three dimensional (3 D) effective stress analysis method using the developed computer program 3 DBCPE 4. 0. An excavation of length 50 m, width 50 m and depth 9 m in a certain homogenous and isotropic saturated soft soil was modelled. This included a diaphragm wall of 800 -mm thickness embedded 18 m deep into the soft soil. The different excavation deformation profiles under different excavation patterns were related to the different unloading process, the exposure time of excavation face and the dissipation of negative excess pore-water pressures. The most favourable process for controlling the horizontal deformation of a retaining wall or the heave deformation of the <b>formation</b> <b>level</b> is suggested.

40|$|The {{research}} {{concerns the}} influence of piles, installed beneath deep excavations, {{as a means of}} reducing movements in the surrounding ground. The work focussed on the use of piles installed as a part of top down basement construction, a technique used in conjunction with deep excavations in urban areas. The investigations sought to explore the effectiveness of bored piles as a means of enhancing the stiffness of the soil beneath the excavation and so reducing the spread of movements to the surrounding ground. Experimental data were obtained from a series of 19 centrifuge model tests undertaken at 100 g. The plane strain models consisted of a pre-formed excavation temporarily supported by fluid pressures acting at <b>formation</b> <b>level</b> and against the retaining wall. The fluid support was removed as the test proceeded and successive levels of props were advanced against the retaining wall using pressurised hydraulic cylinders as jacks. Ground movements were measured using a combination of transducers and analysis of digital images from a camera viewing the front of the model seen through the Perspex side of the model container. These systems gave ground surface, <b>formation</b> <b>level</b> and wall displacement profiles as well as overall patterns of movement. The general model behaviour was characterised in a series of datum tests. These established the magnitude of displacements generated with ground support provided by the retaining wall alone in key positions throughout the model. Following this the overall stiffness of the soil below excavation <b>formation</b> <b>level</b> was enhanced by the introduction of either one or two rows of cast in situ piles installed at distances of 3 and 6 pile diameters from the retaining wall during model making. Direct comparison was then made between the various test results. These procedures were repeated in a small number of additional tests in which the retaining wall embedment depth was reduced. The use of piles was found to reduce both horizontal movements and settlement behind the retaining wall. Maximum reductions in settlement behind the retaining wall were found to be about 55...|$|R

40|$|The <b>accurate</b> <b>formation</b> of cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNAs (aa-tRNAs) is {{essential}} for the fidelity of translation. Most amino acids are esterified onto their cognate tRNA isoacceptors directly by aa-tRNA synthetases. However, in the case of four amino acids (Gln, Asn, Cys and Sec), aminoacyl-tRNAs are made through indirect pathways in many organisms across all three domains of life. The process begins with the charging of noncognate amino acids to tRNAs by a specialized synthetase in the case of Cys-tRNACys formation or by synthetases with relaxed specificity, such as the non-discriminating glutamyl-tRNA, non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA and seryl-tRNA synthetases. The resulting misacylated tRNAs are then converted to cognate pairs through transformation of the amino acids on the tRNA, which is catalyzed by a group of tRNA-dependent modifying enzymes, such as tRNA-dependent amidotransferases, Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase, O-phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase and Sep-tRNA:Sec-tRNA synthase. The majority of these indirect pathways are widely spread in all domains of life and thought {{to be part of the}} evolutionary process...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe <b>accurate</b> <b>formation</b> of {{synaptic}} vesicles (SVs) and {{incorporation of}} their protein cargo during endocytosis {{is critical for}} the maintenance of neurotransmission. During intense neuronal activity, a transient and acute accumulation of SV cargo occurs at the plasma membrane. Activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) is the dominant SV endocytosis mode under these conditions; however, it is currently unknown how ADBE mediates cargo retrieval. We examined the retrieval of different SV cargo molecules during intense stimulation using a series of genetically encoded pH-sensitive reporters in neuronal cultures. The retrieval of only one reporter, VAMP 4 -pHluorin, was perturbed by inhibiting ADBE. This selective recovery was confirmed by the enrichment of endogenous VAMP 4 in purified bulk endosomes formed by ADBE. VAMP 4 was also essential for ADBE, with a cytoplasmic di-leucine motif being critical for this role. Therefore, VAMP 4 is the first identified ADBE cargo and is essential for this endocytosis mode to proceed...|$|R

40|$|Central nerve {{terminals}} {{contain a}} limited number of synaptic vesicles (SVs) which mediate the essential process of neurotransmitter release during their activity-dependent fusion. The rapid and <b>accurate</b> <b>formation</b> of new SVs with the appropriate cargo is essential to maintain neurotransmission in mammalian brain. Generating SVs containing the correct SV cargo with the appropriate stoichiometry is a significant challenge, especially when multiple modes of endocytosis exist in central nerve terminals, which occur at different locations within the nerve terminals. These endocytosis modes include ultrafast endocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) which are triggered by specific patterns of neuronal activity. This review article will assess the evidence for the role of classical adaptor protein complexes in SV retrieval, discuss the role of monomeric adaptors and how interactions between specific SV cargoes can facilitate retrieval. In addition it will consider the evidence for preassembled plasma membrane cargo complexes and their role in facilitating these endocytosis modes.

Several computational schemes based on a supercell approach have been developed to get insights into types and equilibrium concentrations of point defects, which successfully work in bulk materials.
