40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> {{blood on}} {{pulmonary}} host defenses was {{studied in the}} rat. Sham and experimental rats had 0. 2 ml of saline or blood/ 100 g body weight injected into their tracheas. One or 24 hours after aspiration rats were challenged with aerosolized, radiolabeled (32 P), S. aureus. Fourteen hours after bacterial challenge, lungs were removed and intrapulmonary bacterial inactivation was quantified. Significant impairment of bacterial inactivation occurred at both 15 and 38 hours after <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> blood, but not after saline. The pulmonary consolidation after <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> blood was focal in nature. The lung weight increased but fractional water content decreased. Arterial pH, pCO 2, or pO 2 were unaffected by <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> blood. The number and viability of macrophages recovered by lavage were similar in control, sham and experimental groups. If similar impairment in pulmonary host defenses occurred in man following <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> blood, the patient with <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> blood would have an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection...|$|R

Russia relinquished most of Ingria but left Narva and Ivangorod under Swedish control. Originally scheduled to last three years, the Russo-Swedish truce was later extended until 1590.

40|$|Background Primary <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> {{food and}} fluid is {{commonly}} seen {{in children with}} feeding and swallowing difficulties associated {{with a range of}} diseases and complex medical conditions. Respiratory sequelae and pneumonia are known to be associated with primary <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> ingested material, however causality between primary <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> specific food and fluid types and pulmonary effects in children is yet to be established in controlled trials. The relative pulmonary morbidity <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> ingested food and fluid materials versus other causes of respiratory disease such as viral and bacterial causes, secondary <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> gastrointestinal contents and predisposing lung conditions such as chronic neonatal lung disease in a developing immune system is also unclear. Current management decisions for children who aspirate have to optimise oral nutrition and hydration, while reducing the risk <b>of</b> <b>aspiration</b> to preserve pulmonary integrity. This generally includes restricting aspirated food or fluids and providing texture-modified diets and thickened fluids. Young children frequently refuse thickened fluids providing a management dilemma for both families and health professionals...|$|R

50|$|The {{main reason}} for {{preoperative}} fasting is to prevent pulmonary <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> stomach contents while under the effects <b>of</b> general anesthesia. <b>Aspiration</b> <b>of</b> as little as 30-40 mL can be a significant cause of suffering and death during an operation and therefore fasting is performed to reduce the volume of stomach contents as much as possible. Several factors can predispose to <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> stomach contents including inadequate anesthesia, pregnancy, obesity, difficult airways, emergency surgery (since fasting time is reduced), full stomach and altered gastrointestinal mobility. Increased fasting times leads to decreased injury if aspiration occurs.|$|R

5|$|Ecgric's successor, Æthelwold's brother Anna, who was {{renowned for}} his devout Christianity and the saintliness of his children, proved {{ineffective}} in preventing East Anglia from being invaded by the Mercians. Following a Mercian attack in 651 on the monastery at Cnobheresburg, Anna was exiled by Penda, possibly {{to the kingdom}} of the Magonsæte. After his return, East Anglia was attacked again by Penda, Anna's forces were defeated and he was killed. During the reign of his successor, Æthelhere (another brother of Æthelwold), East Anglia was eclipsed by Mercia. In 655, after the Battle of the Winwæd, near Leeds, in which Æthelhere was slain fighting beside Penda, a new political situation arose. Penda's son Peada, who had ruled the Mercian province of the Middle Angles as a Christian king from 653, now succeeded Penda as king of Mercia, but he was murdered a year later. Peada's death dealt a severe blow to Mercian <b>aspirations</b> <b>of</b> dominion over the other kingdoms of England.|$|E

40|$|Pulmonary {{fibrosis}} can be experimentally induced {{in small}} rodents by bleomycin. The antibiotic is usually administered via the intratracheal or intranasal routes. In the present study, we investigated the oropharyngeal <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> bleomycin {{as an alternative}} route for the induction of lung fibrosis in rats and mice. The development of lung injury was followed in vivo by ultrashort echo time magnetic resonance imaging (UTE-MRI) and by post-mortem analyses (histology of collagen, hydroxyproline determination, and qRT-PCR). In C 57 BL/ 6 mice, oropharyngeal <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> bleomycin led to more prominent lung fibrosis as compared to intranasal administration. Consequently, the oropharyngeal aspiration route allowed a dose reduction of bleomycin and, therewith, a model refinement. Moreover, the distribution of collagen after oropharyngeal <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> bleomycin was more homogenous than after intranasal administration: for the oropharyngeal aspiration route, fibrotic areas appeared all over the lung lobes, while for the intranasal route fibrotic lesions appeared mainly around the largest superior airways. Thus, oropharyngeal <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> bleomycin induced morphological changes that were more comparable to the human disease than the intranasal administration route did. Oropharyngeal <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> bleomycin led to a homogeneous fibrotic injury also in rat lungs. The present data suggest oropharyngeal <b>aspiration</b> <b>of</b> bleomycin as a less invasive means to induce homogeneous and sustained fibrosis in the lungs of mice and rats...|$|R
