5|$|Hindman's assassins {{were never}} caught, and many {{theories}} regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the Phillips County jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly {{confessed to the}} crime, saying the murder {{was part of a}} larger plot to seek revenge for the killing of Lee Morrison, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person</b> from Helena who had been hanged on September 27, 1868. Grant's claims did not fit with the facts of the murder, and his statements were dismissed from the investigation. No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named Maple Hill Cemetery) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne.|$|E
25|$|Beavers was one {{of three}} actresses (including Hattie McDaniel and Ethel Waters) to portray {{housekeeper}} Beulah on the Beulah television show.

25|$|Barrett's mother {{married a}} railway worker {{and lived with}} him while still working for the Skinners, but Barrett {{continued}} {{to live with the}} Skinners. Mrs. Skinner wanted to become her legal guardian so that she could send Barrett to a school in the northern U.S.A. where Barrett could live as a white person.

25|$|Once Warner Bros. {{agreed to}} the project, they {{initially}} wanted Academy Award-nominated Canadian film director Norman Jewison to direct the film. Jewison, director of the seminal civil rights film In the Heat of the Night, {{was able to bring}} Denzel Washington into the project to play Malcolm X. Jewison and Washington previously worked together in the 1984 film A Soldier's Story. A protest erupted over the fact that a white director was slated to make the film. Spike Lee {{was one of the main}} voices of criticism; since college, he had considered a film adaption of The Autobiography of Malcolm X to be a dream project. Lee and others felt that it was appropriate that only <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person</b> should direct Malcolm X.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{angered by}} {{incumbent}} Democratic senator Alan Dixon's vote to confirm Clarence Thomas, Moseley Braun challenged {{him in the}} primary election. Candidate Albert Hofeld's campaign ran many anti-Dixon ads, and Moseley Braun won the Democratic primary. On November 3, 1992, {{she became the first}} African-American woman to be elected to the United States Senate, defeating Republican Richard S. Williamson. Her election marked the first time Illinois had elected a woman and the first time <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person</b> was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate. She (along with Republican Edward Brooke) was one of two African Americans to serve in the Senate in the 20th century and was the sole African American in the Senate for her entire term. She was the first woman to serve on the Senate Finance Committee.|$|E

25|$|Bill Oberst, {{the actor}} playing Sherman, {{states in a}} behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that while the general {{will always be a}} controversial figure, he hopes that the documentary will shed light on why the man did what he did. It emphasizes that Sherman was loved by the enslaved blacks whom he freed and that while he did not see himself as fighting to destroy slavery, he nevertheless made a point of treating blacks whom he met with courtesy and respect. (The documentary also shows the reactions of his soldiers as they met blacks along the March. Many had never seen <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person</b> and were surprised to learn that blacks were ordinary people.) The documentary also mentions that Sherman killed far fewer Confederate soldiers and civilians than did Ulysses S. Grant, his friend and fellow general, yet Sherman was the one vilified. The scholars interviewed postulate that the South had need for a scapegoat {{in the wake of the}} Civil War and that Sherman was the easiest target. For his part, Sherman is stated to have seen himself as only doing his duty and that he did not care what people said about him one way or the other.|$|E
500|$|The first {{recorded}} instance of <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person</b> in the Omaha area occurred in 1804.

They reportedly lived at the post and in neighboring farmsteads.|$|E
500|$|Quarrel was Fleming's ideal {{concept of}} <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person,</b> and the {{character}} was based on his genuine liking for Jamaicans, whom he saw as [...] "full of goodwill and cheerfulness and humour".

Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) encourages Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to pursue Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), and intentionally gives him information about her strong dislikes.

500|$|Cosby's first {{advertisement}} was for White Owl cigars. He liked their slogan, [...] "We're {{going to}} get you", so he had his agent Norman Brokaw of William Morris Agency inquire about Cosby becoming their spokesperson. Cosby had appeared several times on the late-night talk program The Tonight Show, a signifier of success in American comedy, although his television series I Spy had yet to debut. Cosby later {{said there were no}} commercials [...] "with <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person</b> holding something, buying a product, so the absence of pictures, in retrospect, said a lot". Despite the stigma among advertisers around using a black spokesperson, sales of the product rose. According to an entry in Ad Age Encyclopedia, the public acceptance of Cosby and Robert Culp appearing as equals on I Spy made it possible for advertisers to show black people and white people together in their commercials.|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{movement}} is periodically criticized for appropriating the massacre {{as a symbol}} of male violence against women. For example, Charles Rackoff, a University of Toronto computer science professor, compared the Ku Klux Klan with those organizing vigils marking the event, writing that [...] "he point is to use the death of these people as an excuse to promote the feminist/extreme left-wing agenda," [...] and adding that it is [...] "no more justified" [...] than the KKK using the [...] "murder of a white person by <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person</b> as an excuse to promote their agenda." [...] Other critics say that Lépine was a [...] "lone gunman" [...] who does not represent men, and that violence against women is neither condoned nor encouraged officially or unofficially in western culture. In this perspective, feminist memorializing is considered socially divisive on the basis of gender and therefore harmful by bestowing guilt on all men, irrespective of individual propensity to violence against women. Some masculinist and anti-feminist commentators state that feminism has provoked violence against women, and without condoning the shootings, view the massacre as an extreme expression of men's frustrations. A few say that Lépine was a hero of masculism, glorifying his actions.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other <b>black</b> people. It's <b>a</b> dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not <b>a</b> good <b>black</b> <b>person.</b> And it's <b>a</b> dirty, dark secret. There are <b>a</b> lot of <b>black</b> people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock <b>a</b> successful <b>black</b> <b>person</b> down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful...

500|$|Following the album's release, Charles quickly {{earned an}} influx of white {{listeners}} and audiences at concert venues, without experiencing any fall-out from his predominantly black audience. Writer Daniel Cooper later said of the album's effect, [...] "It's an idea as corny as any country song you can think of, and one that Charles knew to be true; music unites people. It just really does." [...] Throughout the years following its initial reception, Modern Sounds gained further acknowledgment of {{its impact on the}} music industry and society. Through conceiving and recording the album, Charles {{became one of the first}} African-American musicians to receive and practice artistic control bestowed upon by a mainstream record company. In a 1998 interview, country musician Raul Malo acknowledged the album's influence, calling it [...] "one of the most important records of our time, not only because of its content, but also due to its social and political ramifications." [...] In a July 8, 2004 article for Rolling Stone magazine, music journalist Robert Christgau praised the impact and influence that the Modern Sounds recordings had on music, stating [...] "In the world it created, not only could <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person</b> sing the American songbook Ella Fitzgerald owned by then, but a country black person could take it over. Soon Charles's down-home diction, cotton-field grit, corn-pone humor and overstated shows of emotion were standard operating procedure in American music, black and white." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} the last appearance of actor Harold Perrineau, whose character Michael dies in an explosion, {{as a main}} cast member. The character of Michael was absent for the entire third season of Lost and returned midway through the fourth season in [...] "Ji Yeon." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was {{brought back to the}} show only to be killed and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are all these questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person</b> myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] The fate of Jin, who is also on the freighter when it explodes, is left uncertain. Actor Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, which prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests. This episode also marks Malcolm David Kelley's first appearance on the show since the third season, excepting a computer effects shot of the actor in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". Kelley's character, Walt, was [...] "benched" [...] {{for the majority of the}} second and third seasons because the actor's growth was disproportionate to the amount of time that has passed on the island. The writers got the idea to show him in flashforwards in his older form while writing [...] "Through the Looking Glass".|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Island {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", Michael was {{supposed}} to return in the season three finale, but Perrineau was filming the pilot of Demons, so was unable to return. Instead he returned in the seventh episode of season four, [...] "Ji Yeon". His return {{was meant to be}} announced during Losts slot at the 2007 Comic-Con International, however there were complaints at the Television Critics Association Press Tour when ABC's President of Entertainment Stephen McPherson commented that [...] "some big announcements" [...] would be made at the Lost panel. Some journalists felt that any announcements should be made to them at the press meeting, rather than at a fan convention. After numerous reporters asked about what would be announced, Lost producer Damon Lindelof was contacted, and he gave permission for McPherson to say Harold Perrineau would be returning to Lost. At Comic-Con, Lindelof confirmed Perrineau would be back as a cast member, not just for a flashback. Lost producer Carlton Cuse said [...] "Michael's story is for us one of the most becoming storylines on the show because here's a character who ... undertook some very extreme actions in order to basically get his son off the Island, and then when he sailed off in that boat I think everyone was very curious about what happened to him, what is his fate ... we really feel that Michael's story will be a really compelling part of the season." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed, and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are all these questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>person</b> myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] Cuse responded [...] "We pride ourselves on having a very racially diverse cast. It's painful when any actor's storyline ends on the show. Harold is a fantastic actor whose presence added enormously to Lost". Perrineau later said he should have thought before making a racial comment, and although he felt like that, he never discussed the matter with the producers. Perrineau said that although he would be happy to return to Lost, he would have to know what the storyline would be.|$|E

5000|$|A study {{carried out}} at the University of California found [...] "evidence of a {{significant}} bias {{in the killing of}} unarmed black Americans compared to unarmed white Americans".

50|$|But {{the author}} argues they are {{rational}} {{only because it}} is costly to be wrong.
