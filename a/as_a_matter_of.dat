5|$|I {{am willing}} to hold that, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> law, a statute like § 93(b), which prohibits a union from {{collecting}} dues from its members, impairs the union's ability to represent those members {{to such an extent}} that it infringes on their § 7 right to bargain through the representative of their choice.|$|E
5|$|Indiana put further {{restrictions}} on African Americans, prohibiting them from testifying {{in court in}} a case against a white man. The new constitution of 1851 expanded suffrage for white males, but excluded blacks from suffrage. While the state did not have legal segregation, it excluded black children from public schools <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> custom.|$|E
50|$|Replying to Arnauld, in 1654, 38 French bishops {{condemned}} Arnauld's {{position to}} the pope. Opponents of Jansenism {{in the church}} refused absolution to Roger du Plessis, duc de Liancourt (fr) for his continued protection of the Jansenists. In response to this onslaught, Arnauld articulated <b>a</b> distinction <b>as</b> to how far the Church could bind {{the mind of a}} Catholic. He argued that there is a distinction between de jure and de facto: that a Catholic was obliged to accept the Church's opinion <b>as</b> to <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> law (i.e., <b>as</b> to <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> doctrine) but not <b>as</b> to <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> fact. Arnauld argued that, while he agreed with the doctrine propounded in Cum occasione, he was not bound to accept the pope's determination of fact as to what doctrines were contained in Jansen's work.|$|R

5|$|On a civic level, {{the closure}} of gay bathhouses in San Francisco became a bitter {{political}} fight in the gay community.

5|$|Research in 2014 by Iris Schaeffer {{into the}} underdrawings of the Dombild Altarpiece {{established}} two guiding hands, presumably Lochner and an exceptionally talented pupil, whom she concludes was in probability the principal artist behind the Heisterbach Altarpiece.

5|$|After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took {{on their}} larger scale, which was {{particularly}} suited for public art commissions. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By {{the end of}} the 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the lost wax technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which gives his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.|$|E

5|$|Coghill {{received}} his first drum {{at the age}} of 14, which was a Pearl drum kit given to him by his parents. In 1999, Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit, citing that it had a better sound than a new kit, and was cheaper. Coghill uses Avedis Zildjian cymbals. He says that he has been offered sponsorship, but opted for older drums <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> preference. Despite this assertion, as of 2007 Coghill's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{ammunition}} is {{a source}} of lead exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges and shells, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> law. Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily {{for the benefit of the}} birds and their predators, rather than humans. Non-lead alternatives include steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and tungsten-polymer.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four years Shaw made a {{negligible}} income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E

25|$|Hell is {{not seen}} <b>as</b> {{strictly}} <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> retributive justice even by the more traditionalist churches. For example, the Eastern Orthodox see it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> condition brought about by, and the natural consequence of, free rejection of God's love.|$|R

5|$|Johnson's first fight {{probably}} {{took place}} in June 1783 against Jack Jarvis, after he had unintentionally slighted the wagon driver and professional fighter. Jarvis challenged Johnson to fight him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> honour, and was comprehensively beaten in the resulting match. Johnson's success encouraged him {{to take up the}} sport professionally. By June 1784 he had declared himself to be the champion, although whether of England or the world is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{advances}} in military technology made the new defences became obsolete {{before the end}} of the decade. The introduction of rifled breech-loading guns, capable of firing explosive shells, and the construction of armour-plated warships left Hurst's guns and fortifications inadequate. Fears grew in 1859 that France might invade England, potentially in a surprise attack. A 1859 Royal Commission recommended that Hurst, as one of the key forts protecting Portsmouth, should be upgraded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> priority.|$|E
