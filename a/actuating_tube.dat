40|$|International audienceAn active micro-endoscope {{based on}} {{concentric}} tubes, an emerging class of continuum robots, is presented hereby. It {{is designed to}} reach the digestive tube and the stomach for early cancer detection and intervention. The manipulator is constructed from three flexible, telescopic, and <b>actuated</b> <b>tubes.</b> The actuators are based on Electro-Active Polymer electrodes coated and patterned around the tube. A full multi-section kinematic model is developed; {{it is used to}} compare the existing constant curvature configuration to the proposed micro-endoscope. That comparison is established according to the reachable workspace and the performance indices. The results are used to prove the effectiveness of the embedded actuation method to reach the workspace more dexterously, which is very useful in medical systems, especially in surgical applications...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on the OS 2 U- 2 seaplane with simple circular-arc-type ailerons directly connected to the <b>actuating</b> torque <b>tube.</b> Two aileron test installations were made, differing only in the inclination of the projecting surface with the wing's upper surface. The lateral-control characteristics of the airplane were determined from data obtained in stalls and rudder-fixed aileron rolls. The revised ailerons were deficient in maximum rolling effectiveness, but were capable of controlling the rolling tendencies of the airplane near the stall...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Concentric tube robots are {{continuum}} robots {{that can}} navigate natural pathways to reach locations {{deep inside the}} human body. Their operation is based on rotating and telescopically <b>actuating</b> concentric <b>tubes</b> to achieve robot tip pose control. During tube manipulation, the elastic energy stored in the robot structure may give rise to unstable robot configurations and loss of control. This can occur, in particular, for highly curved and elongated tubes that are required for certain surgical interventions. This paper presents a path plan-ning methodology that allows the utilization of such generally unstable concentric tube robots by ensuring that they operate in their stable configuration regions.

40|$|The {{essential}} construction {{features of}} a piston <b>actuated</b> shock <b>tube</b> are described, and its advantages relative to the conventional use of diaphragm ruptures for shock initiation are listed. Typical operational parameters are presented to illustrate the levels of reproducibility achieved. Tests with He and N 2 drivers into about 99 percent Ar covered shock speeds from 1. 539 +/- 0. 002 - 0. 8143 +/- 0. 002 mm/microsec, corresponding to 2390 - 847 K incident shock temperatures. Application of this tube for recording postshock front density gradients of the endoergic dissociation of ethane and the exoergic condensation of iron atoms via the laser-Schlieren technique is described...|$|R
25|$|The single-seat low-wing {{aircraft}} {{was intended to}} be open cockpit, but was redesigned to have a full canopy. The fuselage is welded steel tubing. The wings use spruce wood spars and ribs with fabric covering. The controls are <b>actuated</b> with push/pull <b>tubes.</b> The stabilizers are covered with mahogany plywood. The Skyhopper I is the plans built version of the prototype introduced in 1958.|$|R
2500|$|The twin unstepped main floats {{were carried}} by a two struts {{attached}} to the front cross-tube and two pairs of struts {{attached to the}} rear cross-tube, both cross-tubes being arched in the middle to accommodate the torpedo crutches. [...] The wooden tail float incorporated a small water-rudder <b>actuated</b> by torque <b>tubes</b> connected to the main rudder, and cylindrical air-bags were fitted beneath the lower wing-tips.|$|R
2500|$|The Skipper wing {{utilizes}} a GA(W)-1 airfoil, specifically {{developed for}} low-speed aviation applications, based on 1970s NASA research. The aircraft was certified for intentional spins. [...] While {{it is an}} all-metal design, the Skipper incorporates a number of innovative construction techniques, including honeycomb bonding, tubular spars, and a hot-bonded wing structure. The flaps and ailerons are <b>actuated</b> by torque <b>tubes,</b> rather than cables. The landing gear is mounted to the fuselage/wing junction, but has a [...] wide wheelbase, giving it a [...] "spraddle-legged" [...] appearance on the ground.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Piezoelectric tubes with {{quartered}} external elec-trodes {{have been}} widely used as scanners in modern scanning probe microscopes. Various feedback control techniques have been developed to improve bandwidth and accuracy of these scanners. Non-contact displacement sensors, e. g. capacitive and inductive sensors, have been used for position feedback. How-ever, their measurements contain a significant noise component if operated over large bandwidths. As an alternative measure of displacement, the piezoelectric voltage induced in a tube nanopositioner has been proposed recently. This technique provides a much improved noise figure, up to three orders of magnitude better than capacitive sensors. In this arrangement, an electrode is used to <b>actuate</b> the <b>tube,</b> while the opposite electrode is used as a sensor. Operating the tube in this mode has two drawbacks: i) the operating range of the tube is reduced to half, and ii) the tube is driven asymmetrically, thus the opposite sides of the tube are no longer stressed antisymmetrically, i. e. the tube cannot be considered as a perfectly collocated system. In this paper, a new electrode pattern for piezoelectric tube scanners is presented. This new approach addresses the aforementioned problems and allows simultaneous sensing and actuation of the tube in an efficient way. I...|$|R

40|$|International audience— This work studies a {{convective}} flow system and presents experimental closed-loop results {{carried out on}} a test-bench representative of several industrial processes. This test bench consists of a horizontal column equipped with a mist actuator located at the inlet and fans generating an air flow circulating along the tube. Following our recent theoretical design, we implemented a prediction-based control strategy aiming at stabilizing the mist at {{the output of the}} <b>tube</b> <b>actuating</b> on the wind speed. Correspondingly, this setup involves a transport input-dependent delay (between the inlet and the output of the tube). We propose a control-oriented model, in which the transport delay satisfies an integral equation, and compared our prediction-based design with a conventional Proportional-Integral controller. Experimental results underline the relevance of the proposed approach...|$|R

Actuation of this piezoelectric tube is hampered {{by the presence of}} a lightly damped low-frequency resonant mode. The resonant mode is identified and damped using a positive velocity and position feedback (PVPF) controller, a control technique proposed in this paper. Input signals are then shaped such that the closed-loop system tracks a raster pattern. Normally, piezoelectric <b>tubes</b> are <b>actuated</b> using voltage amplifiers. Nonlinearity in the form of hysteresis is observed when <b>actuating</b> the piezoelectric <b>tubes</b> at high amplitudes using voltage amplifiers.

40|$|Lanzarote is the easternmost {{island of}} the {{volcanic}} Canary archipielago considered together with Fuerteventura the low relief {{islands of the}} archipielago. These island receive less rain than 300 mm/year. Basaltic lava flows preserves lava tubes formed during cooling and solidification of external parts of lava, while internal parts were still hot and flowing. When lava flow stopped the lava abandoned the tubes, and the tubes preserved empty. These <b>tubes</b> <b>actuate</b> as caves {{and some of them}} develop speleothems. Pardelas/El Covón, and Chifletera lava tubes occur within Middle Pleistocene lava flows which are surrounded by Holocene lavas from the 1730 - 1736 eruption. Pardelas/El Covón main entrance is located very close the western coast sea cliffs while Chifletera is 400 m inland. Although carbonate is abundant in calcretes and in the aeolian sand deposits of the island, the speleothems observed in Pardelas/El Covón, and Chifletera lava tubes are constituted mainly by gypsum and minor halite. The speleothems observed are 1) sugar-like powder accumulation on the walls and floors; 2) claw-like stalactites; 3) desert rose formations on the walls; 4) fracture filling speleothems; 5) cotton-like crystal aggregates and 6) micrometric whisker crystals. The mineralogy of these speleothems varies from 100...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a coupled numerical model built {{to simulate the}} operation of Coriolis flowmeters, which exploit the alteration of the vibration mode shape of the measuring tube for the mass flow rate measurement. The explained measuring effect {{is a consequence of}} the interaction between the motion of thetube, vibrating at its natural frequency, and the fluid flow in it. The numerical model is realized by coupling of a finite volume (FV) code for fluid flow analysis with a finite element (FE) code for structural analysis using the conventional staggered solution procedure, with added inner iterations to achieve strong coupling. The simulation algorithm is divided into two steps. A free vibration of the measuring tube considered in the firststep is complemented in the second step, after the numerical free vibration response is properly stabilized, with the harmonic excitation force <b>actuating</b> the measuring <b>tube</b> at its resonant frequency of several hundreds of Hertz to resemble the operation of actual Coriolis flowmeters. Different scenarios using zero-order or three-point fluid load predictor and soft application of the fluid load in the initial stages of the simulation are compared to yield a simulation strategy, which will minimize the time needed to obtain the stabilized steady-state response of the vibrating measuring tube. The proposed simulation procedure was applied on a straight-tube Coriolis flowmeter and used for the estimation of the velocity profile effect. The results exhibit sufficient stability (low scatter) to be used for the estimation of sensitivity variations of order of magnitude around tenths of a percent...|$|R
