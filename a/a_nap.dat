5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a long day at work and tries to take <b>a</b> <b>nap.</b> Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E
5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take <b>a</b> <b>nap.</b>|$|E
5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took <b>a</b> <b>nap.</b> Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E

5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take <b>a</b> <b>nap,</b> but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: While {{the effects}} of <b>a</b> short <b>nap</b> on {{performance}} and arousal level have been well investigated, less {{attention has been paid}} to its effects on mood status. The aim of the present study was to examine {{the effects of}} <b>a</b> short <b>nap</b> and natural bright light exposure on mood status. Participants were 16 healthy females who were on average 38. 1 (SD = 2. 68) yr old. From 11 : 00 to 12 : 00, the participants carried out a set of tasks twice with baseline lighting ( 2, 000 lux), and <b>a</b> 20 -min <b>nap.</b> From 13 : 10 to 16 : 10, the tasks were repeated six times with the baseline lighting. To measure mood status, multiple visual analogue scales (to measure anxiety, sadness, anger, confusion, apathy, fatigue, and sleepiness) and the Mood Check List 3 (MCL- 3) (to derive “pleasantness”, “satisfaction ” and “relaxation”) were employed. The results showed that brief (30 min) natural bright light exposure improved one dimension of mood status, “pleasantness”. <b>A</b> short <b>nap</b> also improved dimensions of mood status (“pleasantness”, “satisfaction”, and “relaxation”). These results suggest that the proper application of both natural light and <b>a</b> short <b>nap</b> shifts the mood status to the positive/favorable side...|$|R

25|$|On 27 July, Wellington {{joined the}} 17,000 British and Portuguese force at Sorauren. To Clausel's intense frustration, Soult {{decided to wait}} for Reille's tardy corps to arrive and even took <b>a</b> <b>nap.</b> The next day, the Battle of Sorauren was fought when Soult's 36,000 men tried unsuccessfully to defeat the 24,000 allied forces in front of Pamplona. The Allies lost 2,652 {{casualties}} while French losses were probably heavier. Hill's corps, blocking d'Erlon, was pulled back by Wellington toward Sorauren. But d'Erlon {{was never able to}} reach Sorauren to help Soult. Instead, when d'Erlon's cavalry made contact with Soult on the morning of 29 July, the French Marshal decided to move to the north rather than retreat northeast toward Roncesvalles. As 30 July dawned, Soult's men could be seen retreating east to west across the British front. Now reinforced by his 7th Division, Wellington ordered an attack.|$|E
