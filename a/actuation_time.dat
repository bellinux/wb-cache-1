40|$|Abstract—Elastic {{controllers}} autonomically {{adjust the}} allocation of resources in cloud computing systems. Usually such controllers assume that control actions will take immediate effect. In clouds, however, <b>actuation</b> <b>times</b> may be long, and the controllers can hardly guarantee acceptable levels of service if they neglect these actuation delays. Therefore, the ability to correctly estimate the time that control actions take effect on the systems is crucial. However, detecting actuation delays in elastic computing systems is challenging because cloud systems provide only inaccurate and incomplete data about reconfigurations timing. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the delay of control actions in elastic systems. We identify recurring types {{of changes in the}} monitored metrics and requirements to properly carry out the estimation. Based on that, we develop a novel framework for the actuation delays estimation that utilizes change point detection techniques. We conduct several experiments with real-world systems to illustrate the feasibility and applicability of our framework.

40|$|Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to be effective actuator elements {{in a wide range}} of applications, such as robotics, medicine, aerospace and automotive. Enabled by the unique thermo-mechanical properties of SMAs, these actuators offer the advantages of light weight, high power-to-weight ratio and a simple actuation mechanism compared to traditional actuator types. At the same time, the widespread adoption of the SMA actuator remains elusive as its low power efficiency and complex hysteretic behaviour often render it an impractical means of actuation. These actuators also exhibit a slow response speed and their response is highly sensitive to changes in the external environment, namely ambient temperature and mechanical stress, thus complicating their control. Position, force or temperature sensors may be used to facilitate feedback control, but at the cost of increasing the overall size and complexity of the system. The difficulties caused by the hysteretic behaviour can be largely avoided when SMA wires are used as on-off actuators, making SMAs well suited for such applications. However, they may still be subject to a wide range of dynamic operating conditions that would impact their <b>actuation</b> <b>time,</b> and achieving a consistent <b>actuation</b> <b>time</b> is often highly desirable.
