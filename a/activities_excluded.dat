40|$|It is {{difficult}} to define the legal concept of public service. There {{are two ways to}} understand it. The first one is objective and tries to determine which activities and services should be guaranteed to all citizens with the aim of social cohesion. The second one is subjective and is {{based on the idea that}} public services are <b>activities</b> <b>excluded</b> from the market. This second conception emphasizes the problems arising from the relationship between the public and private sectors rather than the right of the citizenship to receive specific services. Within this general conceptual framework, this work shows the current debate which is not centered on which kinds of public services are to be provided but rather on how they have to be provided. The debate has a strong ideological content and defends the return to public management at the expense of private management, which is considered inefficient. This work analyzes the debate and introduces some objections to remunicipalization...|$|E
30|$|At {{the end of}} the 80 s, Castells and Portes (1989) {{focused on}} the {{structure}} of the relations between formal and informal. In contrast with the dualist school, which considered informality a set of marginal <b>activities</b> <b>excluded</b> from the formal economy, and the legalist school, which saw informality as a set of positive forces in a formal context linked with power strategies, the Structuralist approach asserted that informality {{was an integral part of}} a single system. In the Structuralist school the casting off of a dichotomous approach began to be glimpsed, opposed by reality made up of a dense system of relations between formal and informal, which, however, were explored mainly from the economic point of view. The Structuralists started up a series of research studies that, instead of considering official data and statistics, were based on empirical observations. The result of these investigations confirmed the existence of a number of original relations between formal and informal. This approach highlights how informality can no longer be considered a phenomenon found only in the countries in the south of the world (Coletto 2010).|$|E

30|$|As informality was {{described}} {{by a number of}} theoretical and empirical approaches, it gave rise to some schools of thought. The different positions did not follow a linear pattern over time, but overlapped each other depending on the various local contexts. Three phase scan be picked out in which some views of informality were predominant over the others. In the first phase, between the 70 s and 80 s, we find the dualist school, which conceives of informality as a group of marginal <b>activities</b> <b>excluded</b> from the formal economy. The second phase, during the 80 s– 90 s, was characterised by the spread of various interpretations. Among the most important we find the legalist approach, characterised by the view of informality as a set of positive forces in a formal context linked with power strategies, and the Structuralist school which, though considering informality an integral part of a single system, referred solely to the economic field. The 90 s represent a pause in the debate on informality, while in the twenty-first century a phase has begun that is distinguished by renewed interest for this phenomenon (Roy 2005) and in particular for its relations with the globalisation processes that are changing the economic, social and political geography of the world.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHere {{we report}} multisatellite {{observations}} of ionospheric disturbances {{in relation to}} theoccurrence of the M 8. 7 northern Sumatra earthquake of 28 March 2005. The DEMETER (Detection ofElectro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions) and CHAMP (Challenging MinisatellitePayload) satellite data were investigated to find possible precursory and postevent phenomena. It wasfound that EIA (equatorial ionization anomaly) strength expressed in the apex height, derived from theCHAMP plasma density profile, was intensified along the orbits whose longitudes were close to theepicenter within about a week before and after occurrence of the earthquake. Increases in electron and O+density along the orbits close to the epicenter were also observed in the DEMETER measurements. Thenormalized equatorial plasma density derived from the DEMETER measurements showed intensificationabout a week {{before and after the}} earthquake reaching maximum the day after the shock and afterwarddisappearing. In addition, similar behavior of the EIA enhancements related to the M 8. 0 Pisco earthquake of 15 August 2007 was observed. Surveys of space weather and geomagnetic <b>activities</b> <b>excluded</b> thepossibility that these fluctuations were caused by changes in space weather or by a geomagnetic storm. Statistical analyses of the longitudinal variation revealed that the EIA was enhanced in the west of theepicenter and reduced in the east of the epicenter, and this fits the “increased conductivity” model. Basedon these observations, we proposed a revised view of seismo-ionospheric coupling in the region of thegeomagnetic equator, to explain the EIA features observed in this study...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background An {{understanding}} of the contributing factors to be considered when examining how individuals engage in physical activity is important for promoting population-based physical activity. The environment influences long-term effects on population-based health behaviors. Personal variables, such as self-efficacy and social support, can act as mediators of the predictive relationship between the environment and physical activity. The present study examines the direct and indirect effects of environmental, psychological, and social factors on walking, moderate-intensity <b>activity</b> <b>excluding</b> walking, and vigorous-intensity activity among Japanese adults. Methods The participants included 1, 928 Japanese adults aged 20 - 79 years. Seven sociodemographic attributes (e. g., gender, age, education level, employment status), psychological variables (self-efficacy, pros, and cons), social variables (social support), environmental variables (home fitness equipment, access to facilities, neighborhood safety, aesthetic sensibilities, and frequency of observing others exercising), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire were assessed via an Internet-based survey. Structural equation modeling was conducted to determine associations between environmental, psychological, and social factors with physical activity. Results Environmental factors could be seen to have indirect effects on physical activity through their influence on psychological and social variables such as self-efficacy, pros and cons, and social support. The strongest indirect effects could be observed by examining the consequences of environmental factors on physical activity through cons to self-efficacy. The total effects of environmental factors on physical activity were 0. 02 on walking, 0. 02 on moderate-intensity <b>activity</b> <b>excluding</b> walking, and 0. 05 on vigorous-intensity activity. Conclusions The present study indicates that environmental factors had indirect effects on walking, moderate-intensity <b>activity</b> <b>excluding</b> walking and vigorous-intensity activity among Japanese adults, especially through the effects on these factors of self-efficacy, social support, and pros and cons. The findings {{of the present study}} imply that intervention strategies to promote more engagement in physical activity for population-based health promotion may be necessary. </p...|$|R
