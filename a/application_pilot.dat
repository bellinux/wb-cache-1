NASA researchers, {{with support from the}} NASA SSC Applied Science Program Steering Committee, employed multi-temporal Landsat data to assess land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes in the coastal counties of Mobile and Baldwin, AL, between 1974 and 2008. A multi-decadal time-series, coastal LULC product unique to NASA SSC was produced. The geographic extent and nature of change was quantified for the open water, barren, upland herbaceous, non-woody wetland, upland forest, woody wetland, and urban landscapes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Coastal Development Data Center (NCDDC) will assist with the transition of the final product to the operational end user, which primarily is the Mobile Bay National Estuary Program (MBNEP). We found substantial LULC change over the 34 -year study period, much more than is evident when the change occurring in the last years. Between 1974 and 2008, the upland forest landscape lost almost 6 % of the total acreage, while urban land cover increased by slightly more than 3 %. With exception to open water, upland forest is the dominant landscape, accounting for about 25 - 30 % of the total area...|$|E
40|$|Within the WISMUT project, {{dedicated}} to rehabilitate {{the legacy of}} the former East German uranium industry, the flooding of five underground mines is a crucial element. Currently the mines are nearly completely flooded, and some 10 million m 3 of contaminated mine water have to be annually cleaned over the long-term. In order to optimize long-term water treatment and minimize treatment costs a set of alternative approaches directly influencing the mine water body has been investigated at different scales. The paper outlines the development of a special approach for the Königstein site. After implementation of an immobilization technology in local parts of the Königstein mine (immobilization of former leaching blocks) efforts are now focused on approaches which will allow to further influence the water body of the flooded mine from ground surface. The general idea is to inject appropriate chemicals by a water stream using boreholes. Investigations performed on laboratory scale show that sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3) raises pH and lowers redox potentials in acidic flooding waters, whereas heavy metals and uranium concentrations are lowered. To upscale these results for technical application, a pilot test has been running in a reactor of 1. 3 m using characteristic materials (rocks, flooding water) at the Königstein site since March 2007. First results show that the pH-buffering capacity of sodium sulfite is insufficient. In a second step an optimized injection solution, containing additional sodium hydroxide, is being tested. Analysis of the observed geochemical effects and an outlook for upscaling to a technical <b>application</b> (<b>pilot</b> test) will be discussed in the paper. 1...|$|E

40|$|In the European Union, {{there is}} a driver {{for a change in}} the {{electricity}} system. The trend is to make the system more environmental friendly and improve the markets functionality. This driver often refers to the development towards a smart grid. In order to accelerate innovation in smart grid and technology <b>application,</b> <b>pilot</b> projects need to be deployed. This master thesis has been done {{as a part of the}} Stockholm Royal Seaport urban development project that is a pilot project for smart grid on distribution grid level. The aim of this report is to apply market concept and identify regulatory bottlenecks for smart grid. This report has applied market concept and identified several bottlenecks for two aspects of smart grid. The aspects are integration of distributed energy resources in medium and low voltage level and a changing customer behavior. A changing customer behavior contains both demand response and the implementation of electric vehicles. A state-of-art review on feasible solutions that improve the competition and demand side management of electricity market in smart grid and provide incentives to implement smart grid functions has been performed. The emphasis in the market aspect is on how that new actors like aggregators will enter the market and how the dynamic price can reach consumers. The emphasis in the regulatory aspect is on how regulations promote the application of smart grid supporting technologies for both the DSO and the network users. A case study has been performed for EU countries with a deeper look at Sweden. The case study investigates how far that the current regulations have reached on the way to smart grids. A state-of-art review on conclusion papers of pilot projects has been carried out. However, many pilot projects are still ongoing and not included in the review. The result shows there is still a lack of regulatory incentive to promote smart grid development and supporting market structures. Bottlenecks identified for smart grid services in the Swedish electricity market and regulation are related to four areas. These are the metering system, dynamic consumer price, active distributed units with the possibility to provide services to the system and incentives to the DSO to use new smart grid solutions in the work to enable fast and efficient connection of distributed generation.

40|$|The Mobile Bay {{region has}} {{experienced}} noteworthy {{land use and}} land cover (LULC) change {{in the latter half}} of the 20 th century. Accompanying this change has been urban expansion and a reduction of rural land uses. Much of this LULC change has reportedly occurred since the landfall of Hurricane Frederic in 1979. The Mobile Bay region provides great economic and ecologic benefits to the Nation, including important coastal habitat for a broad diversity of fisheries and wildlife. Regional urbanization threatens the estuary s water quality and aquatic-habitat dependent biota, including commercial fisheries and avian wildlife. Coastal conservation and urban land use planners require additional information on historical LULC change to support coastal habitat restoration and resiliency management efforts. This presentation discusses results of a Gulf of Mexico <b>Application</b> <b>Pilot</b> project that was conducted in 2008 to quantify and assess LULC change from 1974 to 2008. This project was led by NASA Stennis Space Center and involved multiple Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA) partners, including the Mobile Bay National Estuary Program (NEP), the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s (NOAA s) National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC), and the NOAA Coastal Services Center. Nine Landsat images were employed to compute LULC products because of their availability and suitability for the application. The project also used Landsat-based national LULC products, including coastal LULC products from NOAA s Coastal Change & Analysis Program (C-CAP), available at 5 -year intervals since 1995. Our study was initiated in part because C-CAP LULC products were not available to assess the region s urbanization prior to 1995 and subsequent to post Hurricane Katrina in 2006. This project assessed LULC change across the 34 -year time frame and at decadal and middecadal scales. The study area included the majority of Mobile and Baldwin counties that encompass Mobile Bay. In doing so, each date of Landsat data was classified using an end-user defined modified Anderson level 1 classification scheme. LULC classifications were refined using a decision rule approach in conjunction with available C-CAP products. Individual dates of LULC classifications were validated by image interpretation of stratified random locations on raw Landsat color composite imagery in combination with higher resolution remote sensing and in-situ reference data. The results indicate that during the 34 -year study period, urban areas increased from 96, 688 to 150, 227 acres, representing a 55. 37 % increase, or 1. 63 % per annum. Most of the identified urban expansion results from conversion of rural forest and agriculture to urban cover types. Final LULC mapping and metadata products were produced for the entire study area as well as watersheds of concern within the study area. Final project products, including LULC trend information, were incorporated into the Mobile Bay NEP State of the Bay report. Products and metadata were transferred to NOAA NCDDC to allow free online accessibility and use by GOMA partners and by the public...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} major {{findings of a}} Gulf of Mexico <b>Application</b> <b>Pilot</b> project led by NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC) {{in conjunction with a}} regional collaboration network of the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA). NASA researchers processed and analyzed multi-temporal Landsat data to assess land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes in the coastal counties of Mobile and Baldwin, AL between 1974 and 2008. Our goal was to create satellite-based LULC data products using methods that could be transferable to other coastal areas of concern within the Gulf of Mexico. The Mobile Bay National Estuary Program (MBNEP) is the primary end-user, however, several other state and local groups may benefit from the project s data products that will be available through NOAA-NCDDC s Regional Ecosystem Data Management program. Mobile Bay is a critical ecologic and economic region in the Gulf of Mexico and to the entire country. Mobile Bay was designated as an estuary of national significance in 1996. This estuary receives the fourth largest freshwater inflow in the United States. It provides vital nursery habitat for commercially and recreationally important fish species. It has exceptional aquatic and terrestrial bio-diversity, however, its estuary health is influenced by changing LULC patterns, such as urbanization. Mobile and Baldwin counties have experienced a population growth of 1. 1 % and 20. 5 % from 2000 - 2006. Urban expansion and population growth are likely to accelerate with the construction and operation of the ThyssenKrupp steel mill in the northeast portion of Mobile County. Land-use and land-cover change can negatively impact Gulf coast water quality and ecological resources. The conversion of forest to urban cover types impacts the carbon cycle and increases the freshwater and sediment in coastal waters. Increased freshwater runoff decreases salinity and increases the turbidity of coastal waters, thus impacting the growth potential of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), which is critical nursing ground for many Gulf fish species. A survey of Mobile Bay SAV showed widespread decreases since the 1940 s. Prior to our project, coastal environmental managers in Baldwin and Mobile counties needed more understanding of the historical LULC for properly assessing the impacts of urbanization. In particular, more information on the location and extent of changing urbanization LULC patterns was needed to aid LULC planning and to assess predictions of future LULC patterns. Our products will assist the coastal environmental managers and land-use planners in making better community growth planning decisions. Our project also will help to establish a historical baseline of LULC distributions, which is a fundamental need in any stewardship plan. The primary research objective of our project was to produce historic and current geospatial LULC change products across a 34 -year time frame. A multi-decadal coastal LULC change product was the major project deliverable. The geographic extent and nature of change was quantified and assessed for the upland herbaceous, barren, open water, urban, upland forest, woody wetland, and non-woody wetlanddominated land cover types. We focused on regional analyses of decadal-scale urban expansion and watershed-scaled analyses of LULC change for multiple areas of concern to the Mobile Bay NEP (Figure A). We used the following dates to derive LULC classification products from Landsat data: 1974, 1979, 1984, 1988, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2005, and 2008. We assessed the accuracy of our products using randomly sampled locations and digital geospatial reference data including field survey data, high resolution orthorectified aerial photography, high resolution multispectral and panchromatic satellite data displays (from QuickBird and Corona sensors), digital elevation model data, and National Wetlands Inventory wetland cover type data. NOAA s Coastal Change Assessment Program s (C-CAP) and National Land Cover Database (NLCD) procts were used for qualitative comparison in assessing map accuracy. We calculated an average overall classification accuracy of 87 % with similar overall accuracies for the older (MSS) and newer (TM and ETM) Landsat LULC products...|$|E

Appropriate pre-stretching of the mesh can minimize prestress losses due to relaxation. The low bond strength requires special measures for both stressing and anchoring of the mesh.
