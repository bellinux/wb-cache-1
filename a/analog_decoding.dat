40|$|IN THIS THESIS, {{the concept}} of <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> as a power-saving {{implementation}} alternative to the traditional digital decoding is introduced. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> in compare to digital decoding are discussed. An early-stopping scheme and its potential implementation for analog decoders are proposed to further reduce power. Hardware issues on analog decoder design are discussed in details. A complete system at the circuit level of an analog continuous-time min-sum iterative decoder for an (8, 4) extended Hamming Code is proposed, designed, implemented, and fabricated. The decoder system consists of three main blocks: the input interface, the processor, and the output interface. The input interface transforms serial-input voltages into currents, performs current-mode sample-and-hold, and performs serial-to-parallel conversion. The processor receives input currents and performs iterative min-sum decoding. The output interface implements the early-stopping scheme and prepares the digital and analog output signals for the next stage, which is usually a digital signal processing unit. Dedicated circuit building blocks include a high-speed transconductance amplifier, a high-speed current-mode sample-and-hold, a peaking current source, a sign-and-magnitude conversion circuit, and an early-stopping circuit. Simulation results demonstrate the power-saving ability of the decoder. A brief conclusion is drawn and future prospects of <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> are discussed...|$|E

However, this construction {{lends itself to}} <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> with performance close to ML decoding as was recently demonstrated. A digital decoding method close to <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> is stochastic decoding. This paper brings the two together to design a Cortex stochastic architecture with good decoding performance. Moreover, the proposed stochastic decoder architecture is simplified {{when compared to the}} customary one. Instead of edge or tracking forecast memories the proposed architecture uses multiple streams to represent the same probability and deterministic shufflers. This results in a more efficient architecture in terms of ratio between data throughput and hardware complexity.

Despite several successful implementations of small analog error control decoders, little is currently known about how this methodology scales to smaller process technologies and copes with the non-idealities of nano-scale transistor sizing. A comprehensive analysis of the potential of sub-threshold <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> is examined in this paper. It is shown that mismatch eects dominated by threshold mismatch impose firm lower limits on the sizes of transistors. The eect of various forms of leakage currents is also investigated and minimal leakage current to normalizing currents are found using densityevolution and control simulations. Finally, the convergence speed of analog decoders is examined via a density evolution approach.

40|$|Introduction In 1998, Hagenauer [6, 7] and Loeliger et al. [9] {{independently}} {{proposed to}} decode error correcting codes by analog electronic networks. In contrast to previous work on analog Viterbi decoders (e. g. Shakiba et al. [15] {{and several others}} before, see [10]), the work both by Hagenauer and by Loeliger et al. was inspired by "turbo"-style decoding of codes described by graphs [5, 16, 17]. Large gains, in terms of speed or power consumption, over digital implementations were envisaged. More complete accounts on these new analog decoders were given in [8] and [10, 11]. Since 1998, much e#ort has been spent towards turning these ideas into working chips. While only decoders of "toy" codes have so far been successfully manufactured, extensive simulations of such circuits have not revealed any fundamental problems.

ML decoding exhibits a very low complexity, but it presents a poor performance at low SNRs. This drawback is addressed in[10], where {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) <b>analog</b> JSCC <b>decoding</b> is proposed as an alternative to ML. When MMSE decoding is employed, the analog system attains a performance close to the optimal distortion-cost tradeoff in the whole SNR region. Unfortunately, it leads to a significant increase on the overall complexity at the receiver, since MMSE estimates are obtained after solving an integral that can be only calculated numerically.|$|R

Since directly recovering the analog source {{information from the}} MIMO channel output is not possible, we proposed the utilization of two-stage receivers that separately perform detection and <b>analog</b> JSCC <b>decoding.</b> We considered <b>analog</b> JSCC MIMO receivers that utilize either linear MMSE or DF MIMO detection. Different computer experiments were carried out to illustrate {{the ability of the}} different analog JSCC MIMO receivers to approach the optimal distortion-cost tradeoff. Both synthetic computer-generated Rayleigh fading channels and real indoor wireless measured channels were considered. Particularly remarkable is the performance of analog JSCC DF MIMO receivers, which attain distortion values within 3 dB from the OPTA over all considered channels for both Gaussian and Laplacian sources.|$|R
40|$|A wide {{spread of}} {{existing}} and emerging battery driven wireless devices {{do not necessarily}} demand high data rates. Rather, ultra low power, portability and low cost are the most desired characteristics. Examples of such applications are wireless sensor networks (WSN), body area networks (BAN), {{and a variety of}} medical implants and health-care aids. Being small, cheap and low power for the individual transceiver nodes, let those to be used in abundance in remote places, where access for maintenance or recharging the battery is limited. In such scenarios, the lifetime of the battery, in most cases, determines the lifetime of the individual nodes. Therefore, energy consumption has to be so low that the nodes remain operational {{for an extended period of}} time, even up to a few years. It is known that using error correcting codes (ECC) in a wireless link can potentially help to reduce the transmit power considerably. However, the power consumption of the coding-decoding hardware itself is critical in an ultra low power transceiver node. Power and silicon area overhead of coding-decoding circuitry needs to be kept at a minimum in the total energy and cost budget of the transceiver node. In this thesis, low power approaches in decoding circuits in the framework of the mentioned applications and use cases are investigated. The presented work is based on the 65 nm CMOS technology and is structured in four parts as follows: In the first part, goals and objectives, background theory and fundamentals of the presented work is introduced. Also, the ECC block in coordination with its surrounding environment, a low power receiver chain, is presented. Designing and implementing an ultra low power and low cost wireless transceiver node introduces challenges that requires special considerations at various levels of abstraction. Similarly, a competitive solution often occurs after a conclusive design space exploration. The proposed decoder circuits in the following parts are designed to be embedded in the low power receiver chain, that is introduced in the first part. Second part, explores <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> method and its capabilities to be embedded in a compact and low power transceiver node. Analog decod- ing method has been theoretically introduced over a decade ago that followed with early proof of concept circuits that promised it to be a feasible low power solution. Still, with the increased popularity of low power sensor networks, it has not been clear how an <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> approach performs in terms of power, silicon area, data rate and integrity of calculations in recent technologies and for low data rates. Ultra low power budget, small size requirement and more relaxed demands on data rates suggests a decoding circuit with limited complexity. Therefore, the four-state (7, 5) codes are considered for hardware implementation. Simulations to chose the critical design factors are presented. Consequently, to evaluate critical specifications of the decoding circuit, three versions of <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> circuit with different transistor dimensions fabricated. The measurements results reveal different trade-off possibilities as well as the potentials and limitations of the <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> approach for the target applications. Measurements seem to be crucial, since the available computer-aided design (CAD) tools provide limited assistance and precision, given the amount of calculations and parameters that has to be included in the simulations. The largest <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> core (AD 1) takes 0. 104 mm 2 on silicon and the other two (AD 2 and AD 3) take 0. 035 mm 2 and 0. 015 mm 2, respectively. Consequently, coding gain in trade-off with silicon area and throughput is presented. The analog decoders operate with 0. 8 V supply. The achieved coding gain is 2. 3 dB at bit error rates (BER) = 0. 001 and 10 pico-Joules per bit (pJ/b) energy efficiency is reached at 2 Mbps. Third part of this thesis, proposes an alternative low power digital decoding approach for the same codes. The desired compact and low power goal has been pursued by designing an equivalent digital decoding circuit that is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology and operates in low voltage (near-threshold) region. The architecture of the design is optimized in system and circuit levels to propose a competitive digital alternative. Similarly, critical specifications of the decoder in terms of power, area, data rate (speed) and integrity are reported according to the measurements. The digital implementation with 0. 11 mm 2 area, consumes minimum energy at 0. 32 V supply which gives 9 pJ/b energy efficiency at 125 kb/s and 2. 9 dB coding gain at BER= 0. 001. The forth and last part, compares the proposed design alternatives based on the fabricated chips and the results attained from the measurements to conclude the most suitable solution for the considered target applications. Advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are discussed. Possible extensions of this work is introduced as future work...|$|E
40|$|Many {{optimization}} {{models of}} neural networks need constraints {{to restrict the}} space of outputs to a subspace which satisfies external criteria. Optimizations using energy methods yield "forces" which act upon {{the state of the}} neural network. The penalty method, in which quadratic energy constraints are added to an existing optimization energy, has become popular recently, but is not guaranteed to satisfy the constraint conditions when there are other forces on the neural model or when there are multiple constraints. In this paper, we present the basic differential multiplier method (BDMM), which satisfies constraints exactly; we create forces which gradually apply the constraints over time, using "neurons" that estimate Lagrange multipliers. The basic differential multiplier method is a differential version of the method of multipliers from Numerical Analysis. We prove that the differential equations locally converge to a constrained minimum.

We prove that, given an input of N real numbers, such a network will converge to a vector of K positive one components and (N-K) negative one components, with the positive positions indicating the K largest input components. In addition, we show that the [(N K) ] such vectors are the only stable states of the system. One application of the KWTA network is the <b>analog</b> <b>decoding</b> of error-correcting codes. We prove that the KWTA network performs optimal decoding. We consider decoders that are networks with nodes in overlapping, randomly placed KWTA constraints and discuss characteristics of the resulting codes. We present two families of decoders constructed by overlapping KWTA constraints in a structured fashion on the nodes of a neural network. We analyze the performance of these decoders in terms of error rate, and discuss code minimum distance and information rate. We observe that these decoders perform near-optimal, soft-decision decoding on a class of nonlinear codes. We present a gain schedule that results in improved decoder performance in terms of error rate. We present a general algorithm for determining the minimum distance of codes defined by the stable states of neural networks with nodes in overlapping KWTA constraints. We consider the feasibility of embedding these neural network decoders in VLSI technologies and show that decoders of reasonable size could be implemented on a single integrated circuit. We also analyze the scaling of such implementations with decoder size and complexity.

40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} {{a class of}} structured regular LDPC codes, called Turbo-Structured LDPC (TS-LDPC). TS-LDPC codes outperform random LDPC codes and have much lower error floor at high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). In this thesis, Min-Sum (MS) algorithms are adopted in the decoding of TS-LDPC codes due to their low complexity in the implementation. We show that the error performance of the MS-based TS-LDPC decoder is comparable with the Sum-Product (SP) based decoder and the error floor property of TS-LDPC codes is preserved. The TS-LDPC decoding algorithms can be performed by analog or digital circuitry. Analog decoders are preferred in many communication systems due to their potential for higher speed, lower power dissipation and smaller chip area compared to their digital counterparts. In this work, implementation of the (120, 75) MS-based TS-LDPC analog decoder is considered. The decoder chip consists of an analog decoder heart, digital input and digital output blocks. These digital blocks are required to deliver the received signal to the analog decoder heart and transfer the estimated codewords to the off-chip module. The analog decoder heart is an analog processor performing decoding on the Tanner graph of the code. Variable and check nodes are the main building blocks of analog decoder which are designed and evaluated. The check node is the most complicated unit in MS-based decoders. The minimizer circuit, the fundamental block of a check node, is designed {{to have a good}} trade-off between speed and accuracy. In addition, the structure of a high degree minimizer is proposed considering the accuracy, speed, power consumption and robustness against mismatch of the check node unit. The measurement results demonstrate that the error performance of the chip is comparable with theory. The SNR loss at Bit-Error-Rate of 10 − 5 is only 0. 2 dB compared to the theory while information throughput is 750 Mb/s and the energy efficiency of the decoder chip is 17 pJ/b. It is shown that the proposed decoder outperforms the analog decoders that have been fabricated to date in the sense of error performance, throughput and energy efficiency. This decoder is the first analog decoder that has ever been implemented in a sub 100 -nm technology and it improves the throughput of analog decoders by a factor of 56.
