40|$|Kirchman, David L. Ammonia oxidation, {{the first}} step in nitrification, is {{performed}} by certain Betaand Gammaproteobacteria and mesophilic Crenarchaea to generate metabolic energy. Ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes from both Bacteria and Crenarchaea have been found in a variety of marine ecosystems, but the relative importance of Bacteria versus Crenarchaea in ammonia oxidation is unresolved, and seasonal comparisons are rare. In this study, we compare the abundance of betaproteobacterial and crenarchaeal amoA genes in the coastal <b>Artic</b> <b>Ocean</b> during <b>summer</b> and winter seasons over two years. Betaproteobacterial and crenarchaeal amoA genes were present in both seasons, but were more abundant during the winter. Archaeal amoA genes were more abundant than betaproteobacterial amoA genes in the first year, but betaproteobacterial amoA was more abundant than archaeal amoA the following year. Summer and winter betaproteobacterial amoA clone libraries were significantly different. Gene sequences of amoA were similar to those found in temperate and polar environments. The ratio of archaeal amoA gene copies to Marine Group I crenarchaeal 16 S rRNA genes averaged 2. 9 over both seasons, implying that ammonia oxidation was common in Crenarchaea at this location. Nitrification rates were highest in the winter when ammonia oxidizer abundance was greatest, suggesting that ammonia oxidation {{plays an important role in}} coastal arctic waters during the winter when the ocean is ice covered and photosynthesis is at a minimum.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{study of the}} seasonal cycle of sea-ice cover and ocean circulation in the Arctic Ocean is presented. The investigation is carried out in four parts using the coupled sea ice-ocean model of Oberhuber (1993 a). The Oberhuber model is the first global ocean general circulation model to use Lagrangian isopycnal coordinates. First, a sensitivity study is given of the sea-ice model, which is both dynamic and thermodynamic. The robustness of the sea-ice component in an uncoupled mode is demonstrated. Secondly, {{the addition of a}} snow model to the coupled sea ice-ocean model of Oberhuber (1993 a) is described. The inclusion of snow is shown to be important for obtaining a good simulation of ice thickness in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Thirdly, the coupled ice-ocean model is used to investigate the general circulation of the <b>Artic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and its connection with the North Atlantic. The cyclonic motion of the Atlantic layer within the Arctic is correctly simulated. Fourthly, a sensitivity study of the Arctic mixed-layer circulation is presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of the Arctic Ocean {{is marked}} by extreme pronounced seasonality and spatial heterogeneity associated with light conditions, ice cover, water masses and nutrient availability. Here we report the marine planktonic metabolic rates (Net Community Production, Gross Primary Production and Community Respiration) along three different seasons {{of the year for}} a total of eight cruises along the western sector of the European Arctic (Fram Strait – Svalbard region) in the Arctic Ocean margin: one at the end of 2006 (fall/winter), two in 2007 (early spring and summer), two in 2008 (early spring and summer), one in 2009 (late spring–early summer) and one in 2010 (spring). The results show that metabolisms of the western sector of the European Arctic varies throughout the year, depending mostly on the stage of bloom, which is mainly determined by availability of light and nutrients.

The filters have been analyzed for ^(210) Pb (22. 3 y) and ^ 7 Be (53 d) by semiconductor gamma spectrometry. The median concentration values were 70 μBq m^(- 3) STP (8 - 264 μBq m^(- 3) STP) for ^(210) Pb, and 404 μBq m^(- 3) STP (35 - 824 μBq m^(- 3) STP) for ^ 7 Be respectively.

40|$|Submarine {{groundwater}} discharge to oceans is an ever-increasing topic {{of study in}} theearth sciences due to the dynamic geochemical and biological effects it imposes onaquatic systems both by the chemical reactions it induces and the constituents ittransports. Studies indicate {{groundwater discharge}} can represent a major source ofnutrients, fecal indicator bacteria, caffeine, trace metals, and mercury to aquaticsystems. In some systems, groundwater discharge can rival rivers and upwelling, as asource of nutrients. The implications of groundwater discharge include harmful algalblooms caused by nutrient loading and poor water quality caused by pollutantstransported through groundwater discharge. Much research has been directed atquantifying the flux of groundwater and associated constituents through groundwaterdischarge using radium isotopes as geochemical tracers. Radium isotopes representsome {{of the most common}} geochemical proxies used to calculate groundwaterdischarge rates to lakes, oceans, and other water bodies. However well-establishedthese tracers are in the scientific community, they are often used as a single proxy forgroundwater discharge resulting in large errors due to natural variability anddependence on residence time, and these errors compound through the calculations. Large errors in the estimates of the volume flux of groundwater discharge lead to large errors in constituent fluxes through groundwater discharge, which diminishesthe usefulness of such efforts. Additionally most SGD-focused studies stop atcalculating the SGD and associated constituent fluxes, and pondering the impacts ofthe constituents on the marine ecosystem, with out directly measuring the impact onthe system through other methods. The focus of my thesis is to integrate methods ofcalculating SGD fluxes based on multi-radium isotope measurements with mixingmodels, bioassay incubation experiments, and water isotopes to better understand theimpacts of SGD on marine systems. First (Chapter 1) I will integrate a multi-radiumisotope method to calculate SGD fluxes with water isotopes to better understand thehydrology of the systems to understand the governing processes and importance ofSGD as a conduit of methane to the North Pacific and <b>Artic</b> <b>Oceans.</b> Then (Chapter 2) I will combine a single radium isotope SGD flux model with a bioassay incubationexperiment to determine the ability of SGD to impact phytoplankton ecology inMonterey Bay, California.

40|$|Mercury (Hg) is emitted in the {{atmosphere}} by anthropogenic and natural sources, these last accounting for {{one third of the}} total emissions. Since the pre-industrial age, the atmospheric deposition of mercury have increased notably, while ocean emissions have doubled owing to the re-emission of anthropogenic mercury. Exchange between {{the atmosphere}} and ocean {{plays an important role in}} cycling and transport of mercury. We present the preliminary results from a study on the distribution and evasion flux of mercury at the atmosphere/sea interface in the Augusta basin (SE Sicily, southern Italy), a semi-enclosed marine area affected by a high degree of contamination (heavy metals and PHA) due to the oil refineries placed inside its commercial harbor. It seems that the intense industrial activity of the past have lead to an high Hg pollution in the bottom sediments of the basin, whose concentrations are far from the background mercury value found in most of the Sicily Strait sediments. The release of mercury into the harbor seawater and its dispersion by diffusion from sediments to the surface, make the Augusta basin a potential supplier of mercury both to the Mediterranean Sea and the atmosphere. Based on these considerations, mercury concentration and flux at the air-sea interface of the Bay have been estimated using a real-time atomic adsorption spectrometer (LUMEX-RA 915 +) and an home-made accumulation chamber, respectively. Estimated Total Atmospheric Mercury ($TGM$) concentrations during the cruise on the bay were in the range of 1 - 3 ng∙m- 3, with a mean value of about 1. 4 ng∙m- 3. This data well fit with the background Hgatm concentration values detected on the land (1 - 2 ng∙m- 3, this work), and, more in general, with the background atmospheric TGM levels found in the North Hemisphere (1. 5 – 1. 7 ng∙m- 3) [a]. Besides, our measurements are in the range of those reported for other important polluted marine areas. The mercury evasion flux at the air-sea interface measured during the first cruise ranges from 110 to 1500 ng m- 2 day- 1.
