500|$|Finding it {{difficult}} for hardcore gamers to fully enjoy Phantom Hourglass, Nintendo World Report claimed that the game's lack of <b>alternative</b> <b>control</b> schemes was a telling sign that Nintendo did not have The Legend of Zelda fans in mind when creating the game. They still described the game as [...] "decent", but felt that [...] "it’s also a game {{apart from the rest}} of the series. It just feels different, and I think it demonstrates that Nintendo is reluctant to sail into the murky waters beyond Wind Waker." [...] The American newspaper The New York Times enjoyed Phantom Hourglass for the most part, but complained about the timer in the Temple of the Ocean King as unnecessary and gimmicky, remarking that the game's dungeons are only [...] "fun to go through once, but none of them are fun enough to go through 20 times". They noted that the time spent traveling through dungeons [...] "removed all thoughts of it being perfect".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{disliked the}} game's control scheme, many {{stating that the}} use of the Wii remote was awkward and {{difficult}} to master. Bozon condemned the lack of refined flight control and noted that it was easier to use either the Classic Controller or the GameCube controller. Similarly, Scullion said that out of the three control schemes, the Wii remote was the least accurate option. VanOrd also criticized the poorly implemented use of the Wii remote, and Rosenberg thought its controls were overly responsive and unpolished; both reviewers recommended using the Classic Controller's analogue stick as an alternative. Dickens recognised that the original Nights into Dreams {{was one of the first}} games to benefit from an analogue stick, and was therefore surprised at how the sequel had a [...] "control scheme crisis": multiple control schemes might add confusion for new players. Govan suggested that the reason why the game featured <b>alternative</b> <b>control</b> schemes was that Sonic Team wanted to emulate the original Saturn controls. In contrast, the reviewer from Jeuxvideo.com found little fault with any of the game's control schemes, and Bedigan labelled them as [...] "excellent". Both reviewers, however, agreed that the Wii remote's motion controls did not work well with the game.|$|E

40|$|If you {{use this}} guide, then you {{most likely will}} use a {{chemical}} control. Most of the control recommendations in this guide are chemical {{because they have been}} shown through agricultural research to work in a safe, effective, and efficient manner. This is changing and is evident {{in some parts of the}} recommendations where <b>alternative</b> <b>controls</b> have been added as agricultural research shows that they can work under Virginia conditions. The authors will continue to add <b>alternative</b> <b>controls</b> to this guide as this information becomes available from research results produced by Virginia Tech, Virginia State and other nearby test sites. The biggest advantage of using a pesticide is the speed at which the control works. In addition, pesticides are often the only controls available to the average consumer. Very often, home pest control products are purchased from local department and hardware stores. For indoor home pest controls, the grocery store is one of the biggest outlets for these products. The mainstream market is not yet fully open to <b>alternative</b> non-chemical <b>controls.</b> This is mostly because alternatives are not as easily packaged and marketed, may be more expensive, are not as quickly accepted by the public, and can have a short shelf life. There are outlets, mostly through mail order, to <b>alternative</b> <b>controls.</b> Some local garden centers are now stocking “organic” and other alternatives to “man-made ” chemical pest controls.

The main motivation of this study was the need of operating JET in future campaigns with the new ITER-like wall, which is expected to significantly shield some magnetic diagnostics. This study was also aimed at improving the VS capabilities by reducing the effect of edge-localized modes on the vertical position estimator. The <b>alternative</b> <b>controlled</b> variable was also planned {{to play the role of}} backup solution in case of trouble with the standard one after the modifications of the radial field circuit.

30|$|The {{effects of}} deficit and {{supplemental}} irrigation are diverse at different crop growth stages {{and in different}} soil moisture conditions. So, it is indispensable to supply enough water for crops at the stages; that they are most sensitive to water stress, and thereafter, irrigation water volume could be reduced in other stages. It is then important to monitor soil moisture and supply water based on the soil condition.

5000|$|Hermetic {{storage is}} the process of storing grain or seeds inside sealed {{compartments}} to avoid gas changes with the environment in order to deplete the oxygen and accumulation of dioxide carbon gas. This combination is lethal to insects and molds, creating an <b>alternative</b> <b>control</b> instead of using any other substance nocive to these pests and maintaining the product quality.This storage method is an important aspect for enhancing and elongating grain life at the same time maintaining the grain integrity. Hermetic storage {{has been around for a}} long times and it has been received well and largely in developing countries since the inception of the method. The method can exercised using different materials such as sealed clay pots, sealed plastic bags, sealed metals etc. These materials are effective in their own right and cost are variable therefore caution need to be practiced to preclude insects infestation during storage time. The process is of utmost importance. Ideally a successful hermetic storage would mean grains are able to retain all their nutrient quality and crushable commodities are well kept for the entire process of storage. Hypothetically, if ninety five percent (95%) of the grain retains their natural characteristic and quality, therefore, statistically hermetic grain storage would mean its efficient and effective method. Nonetheless, the method is used worldwide in Africa, Asia and majority parts of America. The scale of acceptance of this method assure its quality in preserving small and large scale farmer’s crops. Developing countries are relentless and do not want to be left behind, there are enthusiastically adopting the method in large scales as they have seen the benefits of using this storage process.Benefits of using the hermetic storage method include (i) enhances grain life in a much safer and it is rodent-free, weevils-free, pesticides-free and prevents infestation of insects, (ii) the storage process is defiant and resistant to harsh conditions (with the exception of extremely harsh conditions i.e. temperature 0 to -20 degrees Celsius, being unfavorable for oil palm seeds storage [...] such as hot and humid climates, (iii) the mortality of living organisms is kept at 100 percent rate, (iv) precludes mold from developing and (v) mycotoxins which have a high likelihood to cause cancer are totally annihilated. Prior to hermetic storage, grain need to be properly dried to moisture content range of approximately 12 - 14 percent to avoid germination and viability losses. Germination and viability are crucial for crop productions and if losses are encountered then it would mean a loss in profits.|$|E
