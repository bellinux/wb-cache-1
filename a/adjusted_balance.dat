"The {{efficiency}} {{as compared}} with the cost of almost every class of labour, is thus continually being weighed in the balance in one or more branches of production against some other classes of labour: and each of these in its turn against others. This competition is primarily [...] "vertical": it is a struggle for the field of employment between groups of labour belonging to different grades, but engaged in the same branch of production, and inclosed, as it were, between the same vertical walls. But meanwhile [...] "horizontal" [...] competition is always at work, and by simpler methods: for, firstly, there is great freedom of movement of adults from one business to another within each trade; and secondly, parents can generally introduce their children into almost any other trade of the same grade with their own in their neighbourhood. By means of this combined vertical and horizontal competition there is an effective and closely <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> of payments to services as between labour in different grades; {{in spite of the fact}} that the labour in any one grade is mostly recruited even now from the children of those in the same grade.The working of the principle of substitution is thus chiefly indirect.

And similarly the principle of substitution is constantly tending by indirect routes to apportion earnings to efficiency between trades, and even between grades, which are not directly in contact with one another, and which appear at first sight to have no way of competing with one another."

40|$|In {{the recent}} years {{there has been}} an intense {{discussion}} whether the actual behaviour of fiscal authorities is consistent with cyclical stabilization objectives. The question of the appropriate fiscal policy is gaining recognition especially for the countries of the euro area after entering the European Monetary Union (EMU). Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the activity of the fiscal policy before and after the entrance to the euro zone for each individual EMU country in 1995 – 2010 period. For this purpose we will use the cyclical <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance,</b> which is the common tool used to estimate fiscal policy stance. The analysis of the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> gives an additional insight into the former activity arrangements of the fiscal policy, which contributes to gauge the ex-post estimation of the fiscal policy. On this base we can determine the causes of general government budgets imbalance in the past. Despite this fact, we should be aware of some caveats in the assessment of cyclical <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance,</b> which appear due the inconsistency in measurement of output gap and potential GDP growth. To evaluate pro-cyclical or countercyclical fiscal policy stance we compare the dynamic evaluation of the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> and output gap. Namely, changes of the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> in consecutive years indicate the orientation of fiscal policy, i. e. the fiscal impulse. By comparing the change in the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> and output gap between individual years, which indicates fluctuations in the economic cycle, it is possible to assess the orientation of fiscal policy, i. e. the fiscal position. The fiscal policy can be considered as countercyclical if it is expansive in the situation of negative output gap and restrictive in the situation, when the actual growth of GDP is above its potential rate. On the other hand, fiscal policy is characterized to be pro-cyclical if in the situation of negative output gap the government uses restrictive fiscal instruments and when the fiscal policy reacts expansionary in the situation of positive output gap, where the actual output exceeds the estimated potential GDP. In the empirical analysis we evaluate the fiscal policy stance for each country of the euro area. In the assessment of government behaviour we cover 14 countries in the 1995 – 2010 period. The results of the analysis generally confirm that the fiscal policy in most euro-area member states became more expansionary in the period after entering the EMU. Moreover, these preliminary findings were partly confirmed by a statistical analysis which shows statistically significant differences in expansionary fiscal policy between the aforementioned sub-periods. In addition, we might also conclude the average fiscal stance is expansionary when actual output is above its potential level, which implies a pro-cyclical bias in times of prosperity, and that the fiscal stance tends to be predominantly counter-cyclical when actual output is below its potential level. These conclusions can be associated with asymmetric fiscal behaviour after entering the euro area because the response of fiscal authorities to cyclical conditions in the economy depends on whether good or bad times are prevailing. These assertions reflect some conclusions made in other similar studies. ...|$|E

Importantly, a fiscal impulse has to originate from a sufficiently large economy and there needs to be a tight trade linkage between examined countries. In most cases, cross-border effects have also been found of lesser magnitude than direct impacts of fiscal policies on the domestic country. Finally, as demonstrated on the German-Czech case, even a single fiscal measure can trigger substantial cross-border spillovers.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the cyclical position on discretionary fiscal policy in twenty Western countries in the time period 1960 - 2004. The first chapter discusses economic theories related to the concept. A traditional Keynesian view of economic fluctuations is presented, saying that economic fluctuations should be avoided and that counter-cyclical fiscal policy is one way of dealing with the problem. This is then contrasted with several objections. Real business cycle theory doubts the adversity of fluctuations; from this point of view, there is nothing to gain from active stabilisation. The possible efficiency of fiscal policy can be doubted, for example, the Monetarist school claimed that a fiscal-monetary policy mix was a better option, and that active policy was more likely to fail than not. Finally, the intentions and abilities of policy-makers can be questioned; the optimal way to conduct policy may be unrealistic, and governments may have motives that conflict with the general interest. Four hypotheses are presented. The primary question is whether fiscal policy is conducted in a counter-cyclical manner. I also look for changes in fiscal policy over time. In addition, I test for the influence of public debt and the effects of the political ideology of governments. The second chapter deals with measuring fiscal policy. Four different approaches are considered, leading to six different numerical indicators of discretionary fiscal policy. The cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance,</b> advocated by the OECD, uses country-specific production functions to calculate potential output, and estimates induced responses of economic variables to fluctuations in GDP. Blanchard’s Fiscal Impulse uses unemployment data to adjust for cyclical variation. The indicator developed by Braconier and Holden adjusts using a combination of decomposed GDP data and unemployment. The discretionary budget balance, developed by myself, calculates trend values of parts of the budget not related to social security. The variations among these indicators are in some cases large, and are shown to influence the results of the econometric estimations. The third chapter concerns the econometric analysis. The hypotheses are formulated as linear equations, and are tested using the fixed effects estimator. Fiscal policy is shown to have a pro-cyclical tendency across all countries. When estimating the equations for countries separately, they are shown to have different characteristics, with pro-cyclical policy still being the dominant trend. The cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> is shown to give results that deviate from the other indicators, generally indicating a more countercyclical policy. Public debt is found to lead to significantly tighter fiscal policy. For the remaining two hypotheses, no clear results are found. There are, however, indications suggesting a more pro-cyclical policy in the 1990 s than in preceding decades. Conservative parties show a slight tendency to lead a less countercyclical policy, and strong governments appear to have more countercyclical tendencies than governments with weaker parliamentary support...|$|E
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy with respect to output gap fluctuations in the Republic of Macedonia during the period 1991 - 2009. We use two different fiscal policy measures: 1) the cyclically unadjusted primary budget balance and 2) the cyclically adjusted primary budget balance as a proxy indicator of the fiscal policy stance. This analysis also aims to explore whether there was a substantial change in the fiscal policy behavior prior to 1996 due to the turbulent initial period of transition and the switch in monetary policy strategy. We additionally control for other factors that also seem to have had a significant impact over the fiscal policy behavior, such as the armed conflict in 2001 and the impact of public debt as a proxy indicator of budget financing constraints. The estimated results with respect to both measures, the cyclically unadjusted and cyclically adjusted budget balance, indicate differences in the fiscal policy behavior prior to and after 1996. More precisely, the results imply that the fiscal policy behavior prior to 1996 was procyclical, whereas afterwards the fiscal policy became countercyclical. These results are robust to different measures of the output gap and different frequency of the data sets. fiscal policy, cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance,</b> output gap, monetary policy change...|$|E

40|$|The three {{chapters}} of this dissertation investigate how micro level phenomena affect aggregate outcomes and challenge basic fiscal and monetary principles. In particular, I analyze how these phenomena affect the transmission mechanisms and outcomes of specific fiscal and monetary policies in emerging markets. In Chapter 1, I investigate {{the transmission of}} monetary policy to retail interest rates using a novel transaction-level data set that includes all corporate loans of every commercial bank in Mexico from 2005 to 2010. In particular, I analyze the speed and completeness of the pass-through of the monetary policy rate to bank lending rates, and provide evidence {{on the importance of}} bank competition to explain heterogeneity in the way banks react to monetary policy impulses along the business cycle. For this purpose, I develop a simple model of the banking firm and test its implications using dynamic panel data methods. I find that: (1) interest rate pass-through is sluggish and incomplete; (2) the degree of bank competition is positively correlated with the completeness of the interest rate pass-through; and (3) interest rate pass-through is asymmetric: lending rates adjust less in the case of monetary policy easing than in the case of tightening. Chapter 2 draws from a district-level database to investigate the local impact on socioeconomic outcomes of mining-related revenue windfalls in Peru, which have grown almost twentyfold in the last two decades. I find evidence that improvements in average living standards are related to the mining activity but independent from fiscal revenue windfalls at the district level, where inefficiencies in the use of public funds may be accounting for the disconnect between fiscal revenues and socioeconomic outcomes. In Chapter 3, I investigate how the fiscal institutional framework has given rise to deficit and procyclical biases in the case of Mexico, and evaluate how the use of alternative fiscal rules may affect these biases. For the latter, I conduct a series of simulations using an unrestricted VAR model that allows me to evaluate the effect on fiscal outcomes of a constellation of shocks calibrated to match Mexican historical macro-data. I find that Mexico´s fiscal framework allows the conduct of a countercyclical fiscal policy during economic recessions; however, it does not contemplate a mechanism to generate buffers during economic expansions. Thus, fiscal policy is oftentimes procyclical and has a built-in deficit bias. Moreover, I find that a budget balance rule with an expenditure cap is able to mimic the results of a rule based on a cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> in terms of reducing the procyclical and deficit biases, with the advantage of not having to rely on an autonomous fiscal agency, which is usually absent under weak institutional frameworks...|$|E
