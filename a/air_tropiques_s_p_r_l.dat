40|$|Shapes of post-synaptic {{potentials}} (<b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s)</b> in cat motoneurones {{were compared}} with {{the time course of}} correlated changes in firing probability during repetitive firing. Excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> and i. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s)</b> were evoked by brief triangular stretches of the triceps surae-plantaris muscles. Depolarizing current was injected through the recording micro-electrode to evoke repetitive firing and the post-stimulus time histogram of motoneurone spikes was obtained. E. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> (n = 80) of different sizes (30 - 1040 microV) and rise times (1. 1 - 8. 2 ms) were investigated in fifty-nine motoneurones. The majority of the e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> were recorded in triceps surae-plantaris motoneurones with high levels of synaptic noise (estimated peak-to-peak fluctuations of 1. 5 - 3. 5 mV). This noise was generated by keeping the triceps surae-plantaris muscles stretched to a near maximal degree. The remaining e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> were recorded in motoneurones to other hind-limb muscles with a low level of synaptic noise. The height of the primary peak of the correlogram with respect to base-line firing rate increased in proportion to both amplitude and rising slope of the e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> Using normalization procedures or using e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> of constant amplitude but different slopes and vice versa, the relative peak height increased with e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> peak derivative with a slope of around 6 /mV per millisecond and with e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p</b> peak amplitude with a slope of about 1 /mV. The shape of the correlogram (peak and trough) seemed well described by a linear combination of the shape of the e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> derivative and that of the e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> itself. The relative e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> contribution (e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> :e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> derivative ratio) varied with e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> amplitude and noise level, being largest (mostly 0. 25 - 1. 0) for small e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> (100 - 300 microV) in high levels of synaptic noise and smaller (0 - 0. 25) for larger e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> and for e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> in a low noise background. In conformity with the above finding, a leaky integration of the correlograms gave time courses that in most cases closely resembled the shape of the e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> The time constant of the leaky circuit (= inverse value of e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> :e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> derivative ratio) varied with e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> amplitude and noise level {{in the same manner as}} obtained by direct fitting of e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> and e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> derivative shape to correlogram shape.
