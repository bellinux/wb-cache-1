5|$|In the Tirreno-Adriatico, four {{different}} jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses in intermediate sprints and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in mass-start stages, the leader received a blue jersey. This classification {{was considered the}} most important of the Tirreno-Adriatico, and the winner was considered the winner of the race itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{final stage}} of the race was a flat stage that {{finished}} in Madrid. It was won in a sprint by Degenkolb. During the stage, Valverde took advantage of a puncture for Rodríguez and won the intermediate sprint {{to give him the}} points jersey. Although Aru lost a little time in a split in the peloton <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line, the rest of the standings were unchanged. Aru therefore won the race, his first Grand Tour victory.|$|E
5|$|The recent {{editions of}} Paris–Roubaix had been won in various ways. Seven of the {{previous}} ten editions had been won by riders who had made solo breakaways; the most recent of these was Niki Terpstra in 2014. Other editions had been won in small group sprints: there were three riders together <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in 2008 Paris–Roubaix, two riders in 2013 and six in 2015.|$|E

5|$|The second {{competition}} is the points classification. This is calculated by awarding {{points for the}} top 10 riders <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> of each stage (15 points to the winner down to 1 point for the rider in tenth place) and to the top three at intermediate sprints (3 points, 2 points and 1 point). The rider with the highest points total {{is the leader of}} the classification and wears a green jersey.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} splits in the peloton <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> Fourteen riders – {{including}} Chris Froome, Tom Dumoulin, Samuel Sánchez and Rafał Majka – finished two seconds behind Ewan, {{with most of}} the other general classification riders – including Chaves, Valverde, Rodríguez and Aru – a further six seconds back. Dumoulin therefore took over the race lead from Chaves by one second; Chaves retained his lead of the combination classification.|$|E
5|$|Cousin took ninth at the Polynormande, {{in fourth}} {{position}} from the peloton behind five breakaway riders. Haddou took fifth {{in a field}} sprint at the Châteauroux Classic, behind 's Anthony Ravard. Voeckler took a podium finish at the GP Ouest-France. 's Grega Bole broke away in the final kilometer to win the race, and Simon Gerrans and Voeckler tried to bridge up to him. Though everyone in the peloton had the same time <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish,</b> Bole, Gerrans, and Voeckler finished {{just ahead of the}} main field, in that order to round out the podium. Voeckler also turned in the team's best ride at the Tour de la Somme, finishing ninth in the field sprint. At the Tour de Vendée, which took place not far from the team's headquarters, they had two riders take top-ten placings, Charteau in sixth and Quemeneur in seventh.|$|E

5|$|Kenya {{competed in}} the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. The country's {{participation}} at the Games marked its Winter Olympics debut, although it had {{competed in the}} Summer Olympics since 1956. The delegation consisted of a single cross-country skier, Philip Boit. He had been trained {{as part of a}} scheme created by American sportswear company Nike, Inc. Although Boit did not win a medal, his efforts received worldwide attention after gold medallist Bjorn Daehlie of Norway waited for him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line as Boit completed the race in difficult conditions in last place.|$|E
5|$|The peloton rode hard on {{the flat}} roads {{approaching}} the incline <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> Astana, Tinkoff-Saxo, Sky and Katusha all contributed {{at the front of}} the group before the sprinters' teams took over. MTN-Qhubeka was the first of these, while Cofidis were unable to position Bouhanni correctly. , who had not been involved in the chase for most of the stage, came to the front for the final section, with its several tight corners. Degenkolb was the first to open the sprint with Sagan on his wheel, but 's Caleb Ewan was able to come past both of them to take the stage victory. Degenkolb was second and Sagan third. The stage was Ewan's first Grand Tour stage victory: the Vuelta was his first Grand Tour and came in the first year of his professional career.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{presence}} at other single-day {{races in the}} spring season was paltry. Only two other races featured top-ten finishes from the team. Txurruka took seventh at the Klasika Primavera, finishing staunchly {{in the middle of}} a 15-man sprint <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> Antón similarly made all the day's selections and finished 11th in this group, as he built his form for the Giro d'Italia. Later in April at the Gran Premio de Llodio, Nieve rode to eighth place finishing with the first chase group behind a solo winner.|$|E

5|$|At the Great City Games in Manchester, England in May, he set {{his sights}} on {{breaking}} Tommie Smith's 44-year-old world best mark over a 200m straight. He beat Smith's time of 19.5 by finishing in 19.41seconds – including a first 100m of 9.88 and a first 150m of 14.41seconds. He suffered from hamstring difficulty after the run but returned to compete at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon in July – his first meeting of the 2010 IAAF Diamond League. Running over 200m, he finished in 19.76seconds but was beaten to the line by Walter Dix, who returned from a year-long hiatus. A week later he attended the British Grand Prix and, in spite of poor conditions, he gained a victory over his rival Asafa Powell with a 9.93-second run. He set a meet record of 19.72seconds at the Herculis meeting in Monaco later that month, but expressed disappointment with his race execution as Yohan Blake came close to overhauling him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|E
5|$|Danilo Di Luca made {{it clear}} that he was aiming for the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E
5|$|Duque took a high placing at the Gran Premio dell'Insubria-Lugano, {{finishing}} {{just off}} the podium in fourth place, coming home in a group that trailed two leading riders. At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, a race which included most of the sport's top teams, Petit finished ninth in a field sprint finish {{at the front of}} the race. Ista narrowly missed out on a victory at Le Samyn in early March. The race's top finishers came across the finish line scattered, in groups of eight or fewer. Ista finished second, alone, 8 seconds back of solo winner Dominic Klemme. Two weeks later, Keukeilere finished fourth in a sprint at Nokere Koerse. Gallopin finished on the podium at Cholet-Pays de Loire. 's Thomas Voeckler won the race with a late attack, with the peloton coming so close to catching him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line that there was no time gap. Gallopin was first from the peloton for second overall. Vogondy rode to fourth place at the Route Adélie de Vitré, just missing the podium after figuring into a winning breakaway.|$|E

5|$|In 2013 Webber {{announced}} {{his return to}} sportscar racing, racing for Porsche {{as one of their}} drivers for the 2014 FIA World Endurance Championship as the marque returned to the top category of sportscar racing after a 16-year absence. Driving the Porsche 919 Hybrid Webber finished his first World Endurance Championship race in third at the 2014 6 Hours of Silverstone two laps behind the winning Toyota. At Le Mans, although still running <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish,</b> the team were thirty three laps down and were therefore listed as Not Classified. Two more third-place finishes followed at Fuji and Bahrain. At the 6 Hours of São Paulo, Webber's Porsche took pole position, but was involved in a heavy crash {{towards the end of the}} race whilst passing the Ferrari of the 8 Star Motorsports team. Webber's car split in two, but he avoided serious injury. Webber therefore finished his first season in 9th place.|$|E
5|$|Later in April, {{the team}} took two wins at two {{concurrent}} events. In stage 2 at the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, Valentin {{took his first}} win {{of the season in}} a field sprint, besting Alessandro Petacchi <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> The victory made the younger Iglinsky the race leader for a day before he ceded it to 's Manuel Belletti, winner of stage 3. Later in the race, Zeits made a fortunate breakaway which took nearly 12 minutes over the rest of the peloton. The result put him fourth in the overall standings, 20 seconds clear of the man in fifth, but 10 minutes ahead of the man in sixth. The next day, the Astana squad worked hard to get another breakaway containing Zeits to the finish line first, which resulted him in moving up to second overall. He retained this position to the conclusion of the race. At the Tour de Romandie, Vinokourov won stage 3. He, Mickaël Cherel, and Tony Martin had slipped off the front of the field when the day's principal breakaway was caught, and stayed away to allow a three-up sprint decide the winner, though they had no appreciable time gap over the fast-charging peloton <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> Cherel protested the results, feeling that Vinokourov's sprint had illegally impeded him, but race officials upheld the order of finish on the road. Vinokourov felt after this result that he was a strong contender for the overall crown, sitting 32 seconds back with an individual time trial, where pending race leader Pavel Brutt struggles, still to race. He finished the race third, losing time to race champion Cadel Evans in that time trial. He later said he was satisfied with this performance. However, at this race, Kiserlovski was revealed to have worse injuries from his Paris–Nice crash than first thought. An MRI taken after the Romandie prologue, due to the Croatian suffering from severe shoulder pain, revealed that he had a cracked vertebra. He abandoned the race with hopes of recovering in time for the Giro d'Italia. Vinokourov had a successful Critérium du Dauphiné. He finished second in the prologue time trial and assumed the race lead the next day on the first road race stage. He held the jersey for a second day before losing it in the stage 3 time trial, a considerably longer course than the prologue. He finished a distant 14th, having difficulty on the technical descents on the course, and slipped to fourth overall. When Janez Brajkovič faltered in stage 6, Vinokourov re-assumed a podium position, third, and kept it to the race's conclusion the next day.|$|E
5|$|Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose {{to second}} before stage 12, the {{very long and}} hilly {{individual}} time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages {{to make up the}} time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.|$|E

5|$|Other notable {{performances}} {{came from}} Berger, {{who took the}} final podium position despite being delayed {{during one of his}} routine pit stops due to a problem with a loose wheel nut; Mika Häkkinen, who finished fourth for the McLaren team despite its new car proving to be uncompetitive in pre-season testing; and Mika Salo, who drove strongly {{in the first half of}} the race to run third in his first Grand Prix for the Tyrrell team, only to suffer from a cramp and drop back to seventh place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell was standing in for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team could produce a wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car's initial cockpit design had proved to be too narrow for him to drive comfortably.|$|E
5|$|Stage 11 into L'Aquila {{provided}} for major {{changes to the}} overall standings. More than 50 riders formed the day's escape group, and they quickly took 20 minutes advantage. Among them were Sastre, Wiggins, and 's Richie Porte, who was holding the white jersey as best young rider and, at sixth overall, was the best-placed man in the group. Sastre, Wiggins, and Porte all had multiple support riders {{with them in the}} breakaway who set strenuous paces to keep the group away. The main field, containing the Giro's top favorites, pulled back a little time but was still nearly 13 minutes behind stage winner Evgeni Petrov <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> The day's result massively shuffled the overall classification. Porte was the only rider {{who had been in the}} top ten before the stage who remained there afterward, and took the pink jersey. Sastre and Wiggins, who entered the Giro as contenders but had fallen well back in the overall standings before this stage, both moved back into the top ten.|$|E
5|$|The ninth day {{of racing}} {{resulted}} in a bunch sprint that was won by Sørensen. The next stage of the race was a forty-two kilometer individual time trial. Race leader Rominger won the leg by one minute and twenty-four seconds and increased his overall lead to three minutes over Casagrande, who was in second place overall. Enrico Zaina and Nelson Rodríguez Serna were the first two riders to reach the stage's final climb of Il Cioccio and the two stayed out in front until the finish which saw Zaina win the race to the line. With four kilometers left in the stage, Ugrumov and Berzin attempted to crack Rominger by attacking him repeatedly. After several attacks where the riders moves were marked, the riders agreed to ride to the finish together. The twelfth stage of the race saw the peloton arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> together ready for a bunch sprint. Cipollini originally won the stage but was relegated to last place on the stage after having {{been found to have}} leaned on Mario Manzoni during the dash to the line. Ján Svorada, who had come in second, was then made the stage winner.|$|E

50|$|The {{race was}} also notable for Gabriela Andersen-Schiess from Switzerland, {{who entered the}} stadium for the final lap {{in a state of}} almost total exhaustion, barely able to walk but {{eventually}} completing <b>the</b> race, collapsing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> line and being immediately treated by medical personnel.
