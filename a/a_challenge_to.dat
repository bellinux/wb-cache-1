Ferguson issued <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the rebel militias {{to lay down their}} arms or suffer the consequences. In response, the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland, James Johnston, William Campbell, John Sevier, Joseph McDowell and Isaac Shelby rallied for an attack on Ferguson.|$|E

In 2009–2010, the theater introduced a pair of discounted ticket programs: a five dollar lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances, and a discounted ten dollar ticket program was initiated for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90 minutes before performances.|$|E

Rosebery issued <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Isinglass's owner, Harry McCalmont, for a match race between Ladas and Isinglass to take place at Newmarket in May. McCalmont declined as {{he did not want}} to disrupt his horse's preparation for the Ascot Gold Cup.|$|E

Lightsaber combat was <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid.

5|$|Scientists {{are unsure}} {{of the purpose of}} whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E
5|$|Work by {{engineer}} Mieczysław G. Bekker {{implies that}} the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log-normal; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> wheeled locomotion in natural terrains at all size scales. The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> all {{of these}} {{alternative}} scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, Mahakala, which they {{found to be the}} most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae, more primitive than Microraptor. Mahakala had short arms and no ability to glide. Turner et al. also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, and these two points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, Mahakala suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent Dromaeosaurid finds recovered the Archaeopteryx-like Xiaotingia as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.|$|E

5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhrás Ó Murchú, sought nominations to run as an independent candidate. This was widely seen as <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the authority of Micheál Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna Fáil members.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E
5|$|Although Strauss was {{the most}} sought-after {{composer}} of dance music {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century, stiff competition was present in the form of Karl Michael Ziehrer and Émile Waldteufel; the latter held a commanding position in Paris. Phillip Fahrbach also denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the KK Hofballmusikdirektor when the latter first applied for the post. The German operetta composer Jacques Offenbach, who made his name in Paris, also posed <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Strauss in the operetta field.|$|E

5|$|By the 1970s Atheis {{had become}} part of the Indonesian junior and senior high school curriculum. In 1974 Sjumandjaja adapted the novel into a film with the same title. The film, shot on a Rp. 80 million (US$193,771) budget, mimicked the novel's {{non-linear}} plot. Intended as <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Indonesia's religious communities, upon its release faced with controversy. Ultimately, the Indonesian censorship bureau passed the film after several cuts. Though it was a commercial failure, Sjumandjaja's Atheis was well received by critics.|$|E
5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Cantor, a devout Lutheran, believed the theory had been communicated {{to him by}} God. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work as <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> {{the uniqueness of the}} absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E
5|$|Cook County Commissioner Forrest Claypool filed nominating {{petitions}} {{to run as}} {{an independent}} candidate for assessor. Berrios dropped <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Claypool's nominating petitions after Berrios' lawyers examined Claypool's 90,000 signatures, 65,000 more than required. Berrios prevailed in the November 2010 general election with 46 {{percent of the vote}} in a field that also included Republican Sharon Strobeck-Eckersall. Claypool attributed his defeat to his failure to get enough suburban support to offset Berrios' organization in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Costume {{designer}} Anthony Powell {{found it}} <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> create Connery's costume because the script required the character {{to wear the}} same clothes throughout. Powell thought about his own grandfather and incorporated tweed suits and fishing hats. Powell felt it necessary for Henry to wear glasses, but {{did not want to}} hide Connery's eyes, so chose rimless ones. He could not find any suitable, so he had them specially made. The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in Eastern Europe by Powell's co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave research pictures and drawings for reference.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} on the bill, New York's Francis B. Cutting demanded that Breckinridge retract or explain a {{statement}} he had made, which Breckinridge understood as <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> duel. Under the code duello, the challenged party selected the weapons and the distance between combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces and suggested the duel be held in Silver Spring, Maryland, on his friend, Francis Preston Blair's estate. Cutting had not meant his remark as a challenge, but insisted that he was now challenged and selected pistols at 10 paces. While their representatives tried to clarify matters, Breckinridge and Cutting made amends, averting the duel. Had it taken place, Breckinridge could have been removed from the House; the 1850 Kentucky Constitution prevented duelists from holding office.|$|E
