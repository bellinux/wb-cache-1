25|$|Active {{systems are}} {{designed}} for three-dimensional noise cancellation. To implement an <b>active</b> <b>system,</b> low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted {{at the center of}} each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a DC amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system are shaking and degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability, while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces. Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a noise floor of around 2–3fT/Hz0.5 above 1Hz.|$|E

50|$|Solar {{thermal energy}} is {{harnessed}} by collecting direct {{heat from the}} sun. One {{of the most common}} ways that this method is used by households is through solar water heating. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or <b>active</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>active</b> <b>systems</b> have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in <b>active</b> <b>systems,</b> involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than <b>active</b> <b>systems</b> since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).|$|R

500|$|The automaker {{conducted}} a test {{with a group}} of the visually challenged at Milford Proving Grounds in order to evaluate the audible warning systems on the Volt when a pedestrian is in the car's proximity.

According to GM engineers, the biggest challenge is [...] "developing an <b>active</b> <b>system</b> that can distinguish a pedestrian from another vehicle"; otherwise, the sound will go off frequently, producing noise pollution instead.|$|E

50|$|An <b>active</b> <b>system</b> can be {{deployed}} in large buildings and/or within a campus of buildings by converting and transporting the radio frequency over optical fiber. Many active {{systems have been}} deployed covering areas of 1000000 sq ft and larger. Active systems are best suited {{when there is a}} need to support multiple MNOs or large single buildings or campuses with multiple buildings. Expansion of an <b>active</b> <b>system</b> is usually in the form of adding more active equipment to increase the number of coverage antennas within the building, to increase the number of MNOs, or to increase the service offerings of an MNO such as adding 3G or 4G services. In a properly designed <b>active</b> <b>system,</b> no reengineering or rebalancing of the original system is required when the system is expanded. Optical fiber systems can provide coverage in areas up to 2 km from the signal source making them ideal for campus environments. An <b>active</b> <b>system</b> will always be more expensive than a passive system.|$|E

40|$|In physics, several {{attempts}} have been made to apply the concepts and tools of physics to the life sciences. In this context, a thermostatistic framework for <b>active</b> Nambu <b>systems</b> is proposed. The so-called free energy Fokker–Planck equation approach is used to describe stochastic aspects of <b>active</b> Nambu <b>systems.</b> Different thermostatistic settings are considered that are characterized by appropriately-defined entropy measures, such as the Boltzmann–Gibbs–Shannon entropy and the Tsallis entropy. In general, the free energy Fokker–Planck equations associated with these generalized entropy measures correspond to nonlinear partial differential equations. Irrespective of the entropy-related nonlinearities occurring in these nonlinear partial differential equations, it is shown that semi-analytical solutions for the stationary probability densities of the <b>active</b> Nambu <b>systems</b> can be obtained provided that the pumping mechanisms of the <b>active</b> <b>systems</b> assume the so-called canonical-dissipative form and depend explicitly only on Nambu invariants. Applications are presented both for purely-dissipative and for <b>active</b> <b>systems</b> illustrating that the proposed framework includes as a special case stochastic equilibrium systems...|$|R
