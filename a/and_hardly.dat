5|$|August 6, 2015: Hurricane Guillermo {{interacted with}} a longwave trough in the {{subtropical}} jet to its northeast to spawn a rare dry-season atmospheric river, which {{went on to}} send moisture toward the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing a rare lightning storm to that area that night. Since the storm was dry <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> brought any rain, the NWS issued a Red Flag Warning for that area.|$|E
5|$|It {{is perhaps}} no {{accident}} that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> ever by historians of Art.|$|E
5|$|The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' {{applies to}} animals and all life forms. This precept isn't {{found in the}} oldest verses of Vedas, but {{increasingly}} becomes {{one of the central}} ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD. In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.|$|E
6000|$|... "’No,’ ses Ginger Dick, very sad. ’When I was wrecked the fust time I {{was in a}} open {{boat for}} three weeks, and, wot with the {{exposure}} <b>and</b> <b>’ardly</b> any food, I got brain-fever and lost my memory.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peter Smith {{opened his}} mouth to speak, <b>and</b> <b>’ardly</b> knowing wot ’e was doing took a pull at ’is beer at the same time, and if Sam Jones ’adn’t been by to thump ’im on the back I b’lieve he’d ha’ died there and then.|$|R
50|$|Her prose {{works have}} been {{translated}} into Russian, Polish <b>and</b> English (...<b>Hardly</b> Ever Otherwise).|$|R
5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E
25|$|They go by {{the word}} <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> need the rein.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of close/open rimes is nearly {{unique to the}} Fuzhou dialect and this feature makes it especially intricate <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> intelligible even to speakers of other Min varieties.|$|E

60|$|The {{children}} all clung round the Captain, <b>and</b> could <b>hardly</b> {{be persuaded to}} let him go.|$|R
25|$|Majority of {{the trains}} {{run on the}} U2, while some of them ran on the U1 {{if there is an}} {{emergency}} situation like trackworks or pullover <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> any ran on the U3 and U4.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, around 80 {{people have died}} {{attempting}} to climb the mountain, making it New Zealand's deadliest peak. The climbing season traditionally runs from November to February, <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> a season goes by without at least one fatality.|$|E
25|$|The Lancaster House Agreement and {{the forming}} of Zimbabwe, also didn't have much {{effect on the}} Theatre, apart from the easing of sanctions, etc. The only notable {{incident}} was when the independence celebrations were held, many visiting diplomats booked tickets for the Reps Theatre <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> any showed up.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{stepped to}} the door and went up the companion-ladder, and the next moment I ’eard a sliding noise and a key turn in a lock. I jumped {{to the foot of the}} ladder <b>and,</b> <b>’ardly</b> able to believe my senses, saw that the hatch was closed. When I found that it was locked too, you might ha’ knocked me down with a feather.|$|R

5000|$|Revansiddha Temple {{was built}} in the 16th century <b>and</b> lies <b>hardly</b> three furlongs away from the village Renavi.|$|R
25|$|The sneakers {{are also}} {{referred}} to as pseudo-females, since they are small <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> distinguishable from females. This small body size makes cheating easier. The paired males most of the time think that the sneakers are females, thus the paired males do not chase the sneakers away. The paired males are called “bourgeois” males, because they are larger, stronger, and most importantly, paired.|$|E
25|$|At {{the height}} of the Empire, its power reached as far as Great Britain; when the empire fell, its {{literary}} influence remained. The Semi-uncial generated the Irish Semi-uncial, the small Anglo-Saxon. Each region developed its own standards following the main monastery of the region (i.e. Merovingian script, Laon script, Luxeuil script, Visigothic script, Beneventan script), which are mostly cursive <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> readable.|$|E

50|$|Elves: Elves are lithe {{creatures of}} the woods, who glow with light, <b>and</b> {{therefore}} <b>hardly</b> can hide from others.|$|R
50|$|Men's hanbok {{saw little}} change {{compared}} to women's hanbok. The form {{and design of}} jeogori <b>and</b> baji <b>hardly</b> changed.|$|R

25|$|Brothel prostitutes, {{also known}} as Courtesans, work as {{independent}} contractors and thus do not receive any unemployment, retirement or health benefits from the house they work for. They are responsible for paying Federal income tax and their earnings are reported to the IRS via form 1099-MISC. Nevada {{does not have a}} state income tax. The women typically work for a period of several weeks, during which time they live in the brothel <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> ever leave it. They then take some time off.|$|E
25|$|Soon de Leyva {{realized}} {{the attack was}} producing far more harm to his galleys and frigates <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> any on the English. Even de Leyva's flag galley had sustained heavy damage and soon it warped from the fight, {{and after a few}} hours more fighting the rest of the Spanish ships had repeated the same feat. Most of them had sustained some form of damage and some were fighting to stay afloat, while the English edging away from the coast still in convoy formation, headed West.|$|E
25|$|Rubber was {{introduced}} to Europe and America and created a shift in shoes from the pattens and clogs to the galosh. The galosh was soft and gummy in warm weather and hard and stiff in the cold. The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy looking, {{as though they were}} held on by suction cups, for the leather barely covered the toes <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> gripped the heel.|$|E
60|$|Kit stated {{his plans}} {{and the captain}} signed approval. He was tightly bandaged <b>and</b> could <b>hardly</b> move his head.|$|R

50|$|Although {{previously}} widely used, {{they have}} largely been superseded by safer diuretics such as thiazides, <b>and</b> are <b>hardly</b> used anymore.|$|R
25|$|In January 1949, Chifley {{appointed}} Coombs {{as governor}} of the Commonwealth Bank, the most important post in the regulation of the Australian economy. When the Liberal Party {{came to power in}} December of that year, however, Coombs's demise seemed likely, but the new prime minister, Robert Menzies, kept him on and soon came to trust his judgement. Menzies was a moderate Keynesian, and there were few policy differences between the two men, especially since Australia soon embarked on a long postwar boom, <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> any tough economic decisions needed to be made.|$|E
25|$|Eliminating the murderer's {{attempt at}} {{stealing}} the jewels from Jennifer Sutcliffe by {{posing as a}} stranger with a new tennis racquet from her Aunt Gina; subsequently Jennifer is not the unobservant and uninterested character as in the novel. Another small fact related {{to the theme of}} concealed identity – a pregnant <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> recognisable Miss Rich being in Ramat {{at the time of the}} revolution – is also left out of the adaptation, although Miss Rich was still pregnant and delivered a stillborn child during a leave of absence in the adaptation.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} dextral, decollate, rather large, {{more or less}} fusiform, solid, dark brown, not translucent. Apical whorls are not known. The decollated shell {{consists}} of five somewhat flattened whorls, separated by a slightly indented suture and increasing gradually in width. It is sculptured with distinct, regularly arranged ribs (5-8 per mm on the whorl above the aperture), somewhat fading above the aperture <b>and</b> <b>hardly</b> coarser in the cervical region. Neck is without a crest. Aperture is detached, obliquely pear-shaped, whitish inside. Peristome is continuous, whitish, thickened and broadly reflexed; basal side more or less semicircular.|$|E
50|$|Adults are fawn-colour, {{with the}} abdomen <b>and</b> hindwings <b>hardly</b> paler than the forewings. All wings are very broad and rather short.|$|R
5000|$|... The abdomen <b>and</b> thorax <b>hardly</b> {{ever have}} large glossy areas formed by exposed cuticle (hoverflies often have glossy cuticular body surfaces).|$|R
60|$|The actor {{appeared}} to be slightly bewildered, <b>and</b> seemed <b>hardly</b> {{to take in the}} full meaning of the old gentleman's words.|$|R
