5|$|One unusual {{defensive}} weapon was in use at Kenley on 18 August; the parachute-and-cable. Located {{on the north}} side of the airfield at 18 metre (60 foot) intervals, these were fired vertically by a rocket in salvoes of nine or more. As enemy aircraft came in at low-altitude, the parachute deployed and held a 145-metre (480 foot) long steel cable from an altitude of 180 metres (600 feet). If struck by an aircraft, a second parachute deployed and tangled the device around the victim. If the cable was picked up on the wing, there was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the aircraft would go down out of control. This device had not been used before 18 August 1940. Also available were barrage balloons with cutting cables capable of tearing off bombers' wings.|$|E

Both are unable to act, however, until the Oracle (a shriveled mummy) somehow leaves the attic where it was kept and delivers the Huntress a prophecy. Chiron and Zoë organize a quest, but Percy is forbidden from going because the Hunters refuse to travel with a boy. He successfully sneaks away from camp on Blackjack, though he is almost stopped by Mr. D (Dionysus) who agrees {{to let him go}} because there is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> Percy will get killed while on the quest.|$|E

5|$|The {{necessary}} use of heuristics {{for multiple}} alignment means that for an arbitrary set of proteins, {{there is always}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> an alignment will contain errors. For example, an evaluation of several leading alignment programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24% of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned. These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences, or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone. As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made {{simply because of the}} heuristic nature of MSA algorithms. Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed, often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences. Many also enable the alignment to be edited to correct these (usually minor) errors, in order to obtain an optimal 'curated' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling.|$|E

500|$|LocoRoco has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. The game was consistently praised for its bright and bold graphics. [...] Charles Herold of the New York Times compared the graphics to Katamari Damacy, calling them [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "pretty" [...] while Sam Kennedy of 1UP considered it akin to [...] "playing out an adorable cartoon". The unique environments of each level were also credited {{to help the}} game's charm, with Kristan Reed of Eurogamer believing that the game presents a [...] "look and feel unlike anything we've seen before" [...] and that shows [...] "a truly brilliant realisation of how to take 2D gaming into uncharted territory."

The game, at times, was compared to a [...] "slow-motion version of Sonic the Hedgehog" [...] with the player controlling the LocoRoco as they move up and down hills and through loop-de-loops in the level. This gameplay allows the game to be easily accessible to players, with IGN's Juan Castro noting that the controls are [...] "not simplistic so much as it's refreshingly elegant", and Kennedy commenting that while LocoRoco is not perfect, it was [...] "perfect for the PSP". As noted by Neil McGreevy of the BBC, LocoRoco [...] "is the best game Nintendo never made." ...|$|E

500|$|Saw 3D {{was shot}} entirely in RealD 3D using the SI-3D digital camera system; rather than filming on set {{traditionally}} and later transferring the footage to 3D. Before choosing 3D, Burg and others viewed {{a minute of}} the original Saw film rendered in 3D and were pleased, which led to them choosing 3D for the seventh film. [...] The sets and traps were designed {{to take advantage of}} 3D. To continue the fast pace of the previous films, the SI-3D cameras' light weight allowed three-quarters of film to be shot handheld. Saw 3D was Greutert's first time directing a 3D film. He {{said in an interview with}} Popular Mechanics that composing a shot in 3D was tricky compared to 2D; he explained, [...] "If you've got both cameras looking at a subject and there's a very bright sheen on the side of the person's arm that only one camera can see, there's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> when you look at a composite of the two images that sheen will not register in 3D space. It looks like a mistake. These things aren't an issue at all in 2D but in 3D are obsessively problematic". Given the cost of filming in 3D, Greutert said the budget was $17 million, the most expensive of the series. Principal photography began on February 8, 2010, in Toronto, Ontario, and wrapped on April 12, 2010. Filming took place mostly at Toronto's Cinespace Film Studios.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Mere Gook Rule" [...] (MGR) was a {{controversial}} name that some U.S. soldiers in Vietnam had {{for what they}} claim {{to have been an}} unofficial policy in which soldiers would not be prosecuted (or very leniently punished if prosecuted) for killing or harming Vietnamese civilians, even if the victims turned out to have no connection to the Viet Cong or to the North Vietnamese Army. The supposed rationale for the MGR was that U.S. soldiers had a very difficult time determining which Vietnamese people were civilians and which were enemies. To the extent that soldiers believed the MGR existed, it effectively gave them permission {{to err on the side}} of killing suspected Vietnamese enemies even if there was <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> they were civilians.

60|$|Mr. B.D. Walsh, a {{distinguished}} entomologist of the United States, has described {{what he calls}} Phytophagic varieties and Phytophagic species. Most vegetable-feeding insects live on one kind of plant or on one group of plants; some feed indiscriminately on many kinds, but do not in consequence vary. In several cases, however, insects found living on different plants, have been observed by Mr. Walsh to present in their larval or mature state, or in both states, slight, though constant differences in colour, size, or {{in the nature of}} their secretions. In some instances the males alone, in other instances, both males and females, have been observed thus to differ in a slight degree. When the differences are rather more strongly marked, and when both sexes and all ages are affected, the forms are ranked by all entomologists as good species. But no observer can determine for another, even if he can do so for himself, which of these Phytophagic forms ought to be called species and which varieties. Mr. Walsh ranks the forms which it may be supposed would freely intercross, as varieties; and those which appear to have lost this power, as species. As the differences depend on the insects having long fed on distinct plants, it cannot be expected that intermediate links connecting the several forms should now be found. The naturalist thus loses his best guide in determining whether to rank doubtful forms as varieties or species. This likewise necessarily occurs with closely allied organisms, which inhabit distinct continents or islands. When, on the other hand, an animal or plant ranges over the same continent, or inhabits many islands in the same archipelago, and presents different forms in the different areas, there is always <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> intermediate forms will be discovered which will link together the extreme states; and these are then degraded to the rank of varieties.|$|E
