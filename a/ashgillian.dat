40|$|Although {{available}} paleobiological {{data indicate}} that the geographic ranges of marine species are maintained throughout their entire observable durations, other evidence suggests, by contrast, that the ranges of higher taxa expand as they age, perhaps in association with increased species richness. Here, I utilize a database of Ordovician genus occurrences collected from the literature for several paleocontinents to demonstrate that a significant aging of the global biota during the Ordovician Radiation {{was accompanied by a}} geographic and environmental expansion of genus ranges. The proportion of genera occurring in two or more paleocontinents in the database, and two or more environmental zones within a six-zone onshore-offshore framework, increased significantly in the Caradocian and <b>Ashgillian.</b> Moreover, widespread genera tended to be significantly older than their endemic counterparts, suggesting a direct link between their ages and their environmental and geographic extents. Expansion in association with aging was corroborated further by demonstrating this pattern directly among genera that ranged from the Tremadocian through the <b>Ashgillian.</b> Taken together, these results are significant not only for what they reveal about the kinetics of a major, global-scale diversification, but also for what they suggest about the interpretation of relationships between diversity trends at the alpha (within-community) and beta (between-community) levels...|$|E

40|$|Simpson {{coefficients}} of similarity between Laurentia and Avalonian euconodont shelf faunas show a progressive decrease in endemism through the Late Ordovician to Early Silurian, {{consistent with the}} northward drift of Avalonia toward Laurentia.

40|$|The Silurian of Australia, {{illustrated}} herein by 33 stratigraphic columns, {{is correlated}} by conodonts and graptolotes. The {{consequences of such}} correlations in understanding transgression-regression patterns and changes in paleogeography are synthesized. Biostratigraphic correlations allow a dozen new conclusions on the Australia Silurian. 1) The Silurian of eastern Victoria (earlier regarded as Late Silurian) includes {{almost all of the}} upper Llandovery (Pterospathodus celloni Zone) -Pridoli. 2) The Sardine Conglomerate of eastern Victoria probably reflects earliest Devonian synorogenic sedimentation. 3) The Yass sequence seems to extend down into the upper Wenlock. 4) The Canberra succession is likely mainly Ludlow, rather than Wenlock. 5) The Silurian of the northern Capertee High extends well down into the Wenlock. 6) The two major units of the northern Molong Arch (Nandillyan and Narragal Limestones) are appreciably different in age (early Wenlock and late Ludlow, respectively). 7) late Ludlow-Pridoli siliciclastics {{at the base of the}} Winduck Formation extend west into the Darling Basin and Bancannia Trough, western New South Wales. 8) Silurian clasts appear at six localities in the Tamworth Belt, northern New South Wales; this implies substantial platform carbonates to the west. 9) The Pridoli-Lochkovian is absent in the Calliope Arc of east-central Queensland except at Craiglee. 10) Sequences from the Camel Creek Province of northern Queensland yield mixed <b>Ashgillian</b> and Llandovery-earliest Wenlock conodonts that show cannibalization of shelf platform carbonates to the west and/or southwest, a region where autochthonous pre-Pterospathodus amorphognathoides Zone (Llandovery) carobontes are unknown in the Broken River and Camel Creek Provinces. 11) An apparently unbroken sequence exists from the Pterospathodus celloni Zone (and possibly older horizons) through the Lower Devonian in the Hodgkinson Province of northeast Queensland. 12) Improved biostratigraphic control is possible on evaporates in the Carnarvon (Llandovery-Pridoli) and Canning basins (middle Llandovery and older). Improved biostratigraphic precision, particularly for the latter two areas have resulted in revised timing of the transgression-regression pattern.

40|$|SUMMARY: Rb-Sr {{isochron}} ages {{recorded by}} the <b>Ashgillian</b> ignimbrites from Deerlijk and Harelbeke and the Caradocian quartz diorites from Quenast and Bierghes significantly post-date their emplacement. At Quenast, two mineral isochrons (biotite-WR-plagioclase: 372 f 13 Ma; K-feldspar-WR-epidote: 375 f 14 Ma) reveal that the Brabantian branch of the Caledonian belts was affected by a post-Siegenian, pre-Tournaisian event. This overprint {{turns out to be}} contemporaneous with the development of the Oudenaarde-Bierghes fault zone which is dated to 373 f 11 Ma and 379 f 13 Ma on foliated rocks from Bierghes, Deerlijk and Harelbeke. This c. 375 Ma cluster of events is interpreted as representing late Givetian stresses developed along the Oudenaarde-Bierghes fault zone for which the balance of geological data favours strike-slip movements. Since this compressive phase of deformation is posterior to the Givetian opening of the Borain trough, the Brabant Massif appears to have been affected by successive crustal extension and shortening events in the Middle Devonian. Petrological evidence demonstrates the very low-grade character of the metamorphism in the metasediments {{on both sides of the}} Oudenaarde-Bierghes fault zone.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that trends in global marine biodiversity calibrated for the Phanerozoic may be affected by sampling problems. However, this possibility has not been evaluated definitively, and raw diversity trends are generally accepted at face value in macroevolutionary investigations. Here, we analyze a global-scale sample of fossil occurrences {{that allows us to}} determine directly the effects of sample size on the calibration of what is generally thought to be among the most significant global biodiversity increases in the history of life: the Ordovician Radiation. Utilizing a composite database that includes trilobites, brachiopods, and three classes of molluscs, we conduct rarefaction analyses to demonstrate that the diversification trajectory for the Radiation was considerably different than suggested by raw diversity time-series. Our analyses suggest that {{a substantial portion of the}} increase recognized in raw diversity depictions for the last three Ordovician epochs (the Llandeilian, Caradocian, and <b>Ashgillian)</b> is a consequence of increased sample size of the preserved and catalogued fossil record. We also use biometric data for a global sample of Ordovician trilobites, along with methods of measuring morphological diversity that are not biased by sample size, to show that morphological diversification in this major clade had leveled off by the Llanvirnian. The discordance between raw diversity depictions and more robust taxonomic and morphological diversity metrics suggests that sampling effects may strongly influence our perception of biodiversity trends throughout the Phanerozoic...|$|E

40|$|North Osteroy {{comprises}} autochthonous and para-autochthonous basement {{which has}} been reworked during the orogenic development of the adjacent Bergsdalen and Bergen Arc nappes. The divisions of the basement, the Southern and Northern Gneiss Units, are composed of acid gneisses, paragneisses, migmatites, orthoamphibolites and granites. Three sedimentary complexes are identified, the first (circa 1500 Ma.) resembles the Fjordane complex. The second is correlated with sediments in the Bergsdalen Nappes (older than 1000 Ma.), and with the Samnanger complex in the Bergen Arcs. The third sedimentary sequence is the <b>Ashgillian,</b> Holdhus sequence of the Bergen Arcs. The rocks of the Southern Gneiss Unit are derived from, and emplaced over, the Northern Gneisses during four deformations, {{each of which is}} separated by a sedimentary interval. The deformation involves 'mylonitic' processes acting at high temperatures and high strain rates. The first deformation forms part of the Svecofennian orogenic cycle. The second and third form part of the Sveconorwegian cycle and produce folds with north-easterly trending axial traces. The third is responsible for the emplacement of the primary Bergsdalen Nappes and contrary to current opinion these Nappes are thought to root in the south east. The final deformation is part of the Caledonian orogenic cycle and involves the development of the Bergen Arcs and their emplacement over the Bergsdalen Nappes. In the early stages of this cycle, structures formed on an east-north-east Bergsdalen trend, but later, non-cyclindrical folds with north-westerly trending axial traces developed, giving rise to the Bergen Arc trend. Of the two deformations which produce the Bergen Arc and Bergsdalen Nappes, the Sveconorwegian event is the more important. The interpretation of the geology of N.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the taxonomical descriptions of Upper Caradocian to <b>Ashgillian</b> bryozoans recovered from different localities from SW Sardinia and from one locality (Mulargia lake) from SE Sardinia. The investigated fauna belongs to 4 bryozoan orders: the Trepostomata, the Cystoporata, the Cryptostomata and the extant order Tubuliporata. These orders {{are represented by}} 39 species belonging to 28 genera. Twenty species and one cryptostome genus (Stereodictya) are new. The Trepostomata are the main constituents of the fauna; nevertheless in some localities (Mulargia lake, Portixeddu cove) the Cryptostomata become prevalent. The following new trepostome species are described: Batostoma phragmorarum, Bythopora crenulata, Dekayia minima, Dianulites cupuliformis, Diplotrypa sardoa, Eridotrypa constans, Eridotrypa obliqua, Hallopora cystoidalis, Hemiphragma curvilineum, Hemiphragma subtile, Panderpora gemmata, Panderpora moniliformis and Stigmatella sinuosa. The following new cystoporate species are described: Ceramoporella discoidalis, Crassaluna cystata and Papillalunaria magnum. The following new cryptostome species are described: Graptodictya vinassae, Nematopora hispida, Stereodictya crassum and Ulricostylus radiatus. Sardinian fauna shows similarities with both fauna of the Carnic Alps and southern France (Montaigne Noire), but this comparison needs further study. In SW Sardinia, the lithostratigraphic unit c (Upper Caradoc-Lower Ashgill) is dominated, in order of abundance, by Hallopora elegantula, Chasmatopora corniculata, Graptodictya meneghinii, Anaphragma meneghinii, Ceramopora discoidalis, Anaphragma regulare and Trematopora sardoa.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} the Upper Ordovician sedimentary succession which crops {{out in the}} Sulcis-Iglesiente area autochthon and in the: Sarrabus-Arburese allochthonous units, {{with the aim of}} contributing {{to a better understanding of}} the pre-Hercynian palaeogeography. This study is based on the typology of zircon and trace-element geochemistry of zircon and titaniferous minerals. The Upper Ordovician rocks cropping out in the Sarrabus-Arburese area (allochthon belt) mainly result from the erosion of pre-Caradocian volcanics (the so-called 'Porfidi grigi'), which were emplaced in a magmatic arc setting. The lateral and vertical homogeneity of the terrigenous supply during the Caradoc and early Ashgill, and the argillaceouscarbonate sediments,with shallow shelf faunas during <b>Ashgillian</b> times, suggest that stable geodynamic conditions persisted throughout this time,;pan. In the Sulcis-Iglesiente area (autochthon belt), the nature of the terrigenous influx and the source-rocks remained the same from the Late Cambrian to the early Ashgill. The constant nature of the detrital zircon grains rules out any possibility that the 'Porfidi grigi' might have contributed to the sedimentary supply; the source-rocks were probably located within an internal cratonic area, distinct from the magmatic arc of the Sarrabus area. In the early Hirnantian, new source-rocks contributed to the terrigenous supply. They were volcanics with a strong mantle component. This new material was later progressively diluted by terrigenous supply of cratonic origin. The significant differences in the composition and origin of the terrigenous material deposited in the autochthonous and the allochthonous units may reflect distinct source-areas with different geodynamic histories. It is therefore possible that the two depositional areas were geographically separated. Location of the Sulcis-Iglesiente area within the North Gondwanan shelf is plausible scenario. But the occurrence of Baltic taxa in the Sarrabus area suggests that this area was originally located in an intermediate position between North Gondwana and Baltica...|$|E
40|$|The New World Island Complex {{consists}} of chaotically mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks in a 1 km wide belt that extends 30 km southwestward from Cobbs Arm, on eastern New World Island, centrally {{located in the}} Dunnage Zone of the Newfoundland Appalachians. The complex comprises four lithic units, locally preserved in partial stratigraphic sections: Squid Cove Volcanics - basalts (non-orogenic tholeiites), autoclastic breccias, red shale, limestone, pyroclastic breccias and tuffs (Arenigian to Llandeilian); Cobbs Arm Limestone (Llandeilian); Rodgers Cove Shale - interbedded black shale and chert (Caradocian); and Muddy Cove Clastics - quartzitic greywackes, shales, polymictic conglomerates, and shaly conglomeratic breccias (<b>Ashgillian</b> to Llandoverian). [...] Imbricated slices of competent volcanic rocks over 3 km long are separated by mylonitic and clastic shear zones. Intervening sedimentary slices contain boudinaged interbeds (1 cm to 100 m across) and tight fold hinges. These pass laterally into melange with discrete blocks of volcanic rocks, sandstones, and locally black shale in a sedimentary matrix. The blocks have sheared margins in places, and one large slab of Ordovician limestone is deeply penetrated by Silurian shale. Angular fragments in shaly conglomeratic breccias include black shale and limestone derived from the local stratigraphic section in adjacent fault blocks; one limestone clast is inhomogeneously deformed. [...] The New World Island Complex is followed to the northwest by sandstones and conglomerates (Crow Head Formation) of Upper Ordovician to Silurian age. These are locally continuous with Caradocian black shale and older rocks in the complex. Farther northwest, pre-Caradocian volcanic rocks {{like those in the}} New World Island Complex (Clarkes Cove Volcanics) are unconformably overlain by coarse Silurian conglomerates (Indian Cove Formation) in another structural slice.

40|$|The 1 / 50, 000 Taghazout sheet {{includes}} formations {{belonging to}} two distinct structural domains: the Anti-Atlas precambrian basement to the South, and its paleozoic cover, which outcrops {{in the northern}} and eastern parts of the sheet. The middle proterozoic basement (Cryogenian, NP 2 -PII) outcrops in the nearby sheets of Boumalne and Imtir: metamorphosed and folded during the panafrican orogeny, it is unconformably covered by thick volcanic and volcano-clastic formations (Ouarzazate Group), and truncated by intrusive bodies, which, neither metamorphosed nor folded, are referable to the upper Neoproterozoic or Ediacaran (NP 3 -PIII). In the Taghazout sheet outcrop only the Ouarzazate Group and the upper neoproterozoic magmatic bodies of Oussilkane, Arharrhitz, Bou Gafer and Tanout Addou. They correspond to a post-collisional sequence from calc-alkaline with high K to shoshonitic. The basement of the Taghazout sheet is characterized by faulting tectonics with normal and transcurrent faults of uppermost neoproterozoic age, associated with an intense fluids activity. These structures has been strongly reactivated during the Paleozoic (hercynian orogeny) and afterward. The Paleozoic consists of sedimentary sequences ranging in Age from Lower Cambrian to Carboniferous (Visean). Its basis unconformably rests on a rough paleomorphology developed on the precambrian basement of the Jbel Saghro. The series, several thousands meters thick, is characterized by clastics with some carbonate local deposits. The Cambrian {{is represented by the}} Tata group and the Feijas internes group. The first constitutes the lower part of a cycle, including a continental lower unit (Formation d’Igoudine), that fills the upper precambrian paleotopography, and a cover of marine tidal limy siltstones (Formation d’Amouslek). These two formations onlap the precambrian basement of the northern Saghro. The upper part of the cycle corresponds to the sandstones of the Formation d’Asrir that disappears northwards. The second cycle, more generalized, includes the classical platform sequence of the Middle Cambrian: the Niveau de la Brèche à Micmacca, the Formation du Jbel Wawrmast (or Schistes à Paradoxides) and the Formation du Jbel Afraou (or Grès du Tabanit). Following the upper cambrian-tremadocian general hiatus, the Ordovician corresponds to series deposited in a marine platform affected by frequent eustatic changes and subsidence stacking patterns. It finishes by the major event of the upper <b>Ashgillian</b> sea level fall related to the north-west African glaciation. On the other hand, the Silurian and devonian outcrops are very localized to the North and North West and present incomplete sequences because of a complex tectonic context. They are represented by the lower Silurian black shales and by some middle/upper Devonian fossiliferous limestones. The Carboniferous series is extensively developed {{in the northern part of}} the map, forming the group of the Flysch du Jbel Tisdafine (Visean). This group consists of a lower unit, with olistostrome characters, (Formation d’Ait Yalla) that fills a fault controlled paleo-topography, and of a thick flyschoid upper unit (Formation de Tinerhir) probably of deltaic character. The entire paleozoic sequence is affected by deformations related mainly to the hercynian orogeny, with intensity decreasing southwards and south-eastwards. The more deformed zones are characterized by southward thrusts involving Silurian and carboniferous formations. These are part of the deformed Tinerhir block that extends westwards, in the Imtir area. In the rest of the sheet, the deformations correspond to fold systems, with NE-SW to N-S and E-W directions, and to faulted zones affecting the cambrian-ordovician sequences. These faults strike essentially NE-SW and ENE-WSW and are characterized by steeply dipping planes and a polyphase kinematics. They form the north Saghro system, being the Isk n'Izekelli and Tizi n'Boujou-Bou Tiouit faults the major regional structures. The only rocks referable to the Meso-Cenozoic are represented by some liassic dolerites, intruded into the cambro-Ordovician sequence, and by some flows of olivine nephelinite of mio-pliocene age...|$|E
40|$|The Taroucht sheet {{covers the}} extreme southwestern {{part of the}} Ougnat massif, in the western Anti-Atlas, {{which is part of}} the {{deformed}} northern margin of the western African craton. Here outcrop formations of upper to uppermost neoproterozoic, paleozoic and quaternary age. The substratum is composed of volcanic formations of upper neoproterozoic age (middle and upper NP 3) in which two different complexes have been distinguished: the Ougnat rhyolitic complex, belonging to the middle NP 3 and which has by far the largest one, and the Ougnat pyroclastic complex (upper NP 3), much more limited. The first complex has been subdivided into three sequences : - The Bou Ibhla-Bou Tikidine sequence composed of rhyolites in flows and domes, some volcano-clastics and rhyolitic ignimbrites with local interbeds of andesitic lavas. - The Azlou sequence entirely constituted by andesitic flows and dykes. - The Bou Blouh charachterized by alternation of rhyodacitic and dacitic flows, of breccias, tuffs and levels of volcano-sedimentary rocks. The first and the last sequences, in particular, are made up by volcanic products with acidic predominance and associated pyroclastic products, with very few sedimentary rocks. They are the expression of predominant explosive rhyolitic volcanism. From the chemical point of view, the rocks forming the different complexes and sequences of the Taroucht Neoproterozoic are of the high potassic to shoshonitic calc-alkaline type. They were emplaced in a rifting context evolving after the continental collision between the west African craton and an undefined northern block, which took place in the Anti-Atlas at about 685 Ma (main phase of the panafrican orogeny) and ended at about 615 Ma. The volcanic activity is accompanied by important plutonic events, represented in the sheet by the intrusions of Imelouane and of Tilmlaline, that were intruded towards the end of the magmatic cycle. The Paleozoic is represented by a complete lower Cambrian to Carboniferous (Visean) sequence. The lowermost formation of the paleozoic cover (Igoudine Formation, or basal sandstones and conglomerates) indicates a clear disconformity over a rough paleomorphology made of the Proterozoic substratum of the Ougnat massif and locally of the Assif Toulla formation, which represents the top unit of a volcano-clastic sequence, inturn unconformable overlaying the basement units. The paleozoic sequence is several hundreds of meters thick and it is composed by terrigenous clastic deposits with subordinate carbonates, in an environment of deposition from continental to shallow marine. The Taroucht sheet is characterized by an important tectonic lineament (Tizi n'Boujou-Bou Tiouit shear zone), represented by a system of high angle faults which locally juxtapose the Proterozoic basement to the paleozoic sequence, and shows a complex polyphase kinematics. This shear zone is almost E-W striking and cuts the sheet into two nearly equal parts; in the southern sector are developed predominantly the two sedimentary cycles of the Cambrian, made up, respectively of the Groupe de Tata formations of lower Cambrian, and by the formations of the Groupe des Feijas internesof middle Cambrian age. To the North of the Tizi n'Boujou-Bou Tiouit shear zone outcrop the sequences of the Ordovician and Carboniferous. In particular, the sequence of the Ordovician, made of monotonous deposits of sandstones, petites and mudstones, cut by levels of oolitic iron, is very complex and has been subdivided into four groups: Groupe des Feijas externes (Arenigian-Llanvimian); Groupe du 1 er Bani (Llandeilian); Groupe du Ktaoua (Caradocian-upper Ashgillian); Groupe du 2 ème Bani (upper <b>Ashgillian).</b> The formations of the Silurian and Devonian are very limited, whereas the carboniferous sequence, composed by the sediments of the Groupe du Flysch du Jbel Tisdajine (Visean), prevails in the north-western sector of the Taroucht sheet (Jbel Tisdafine and Jbel Asdaf). From the tectonic point of view, the paleozoic sequence essentially records the traces of the hercynian orogeny. The deformational structures can be related to a fold and fault sys- tem. High angle faults show a complex polyphased kinematic evolution, whereas gentle folds develops along two main directions (N-S and E-W) and display sub-vertical axial planes. Systems of thrusts, associated with large scale folds, deform the carboniferous sequence of the jbels Tisdafine and Asdaf...|$|E
40|$|The 1 / 50, 000 Imtir sheet {{includes}} two different structural domains: the Anti-Atlas to the South, with the precambrian basement and its paleozoic cover outcropping in the Saghro Massif, and the mesozoic-Cenozoic domain (alpine) of the High Atlas to the North. The oldest Saghro basement outcrops {{in the window}} of Imiter and is characterized by twocomplexes of the middle Neoproterozoic or Cryogenian (NP 2 -PII) : i) the sandy-pelitic metasediments, metamorphosed and folded at a regional scale during the panafrican orogeny, ii) the calc-alkaline intrusive bodies at low metamorphism of Igoudrane (677 ± 19 Ma). This basement is unconformably covered by thick volcanic and volcano-elastic formations (Group of Ouarzazate) and cut by the unmetamorphosed and unfolded subvolcanic and intrusive bodies of Oussilkane, Bou Teglimt, Touazzakt, Arharrhitz and Bou Gafer, that can be related to the upper Neoproterozoic or Ediacaran (NP 3 -PIII). The upper neoproterozoic magmatism forms a post collisional sequence characterized by high K calc-alkaline content. The Saghro Precambrian is cut by a system of faults, frequently mineralized, and by dykes of basalt, andesite and ryolite. Among these, a certain importance has the large doleritic dyke, of uncertain age, which cuts the NP 2 metasediments and the overlying volcanic sequences. Though with petrography and geochemistry similar to the Jurassic dolerite dyke (Foum Zguid type) that cuts the Ordovician of Arg n'Ouchne, this dolerite appears to be in turn cut by the precambrian caldera of Tizi n'Tasettift. The large underground and open air mine of Imiter is located in the northwestern part of the Precambrian basement: it is a hydrothermal deposit at Ag-Hg related to an East-West fault zone and to the emplacement of rhyolitic bodies of uppermost neoproterozoic age (553 Ma). The paleozoic sequence of Imtir unconforrnably rests on the Proterozoic. It includes formations of ages ranging from the Cambrian to the Carboniferous. The sedimentary and tectonic analysis indicates a sedimentary context of a silico-clastic passive margin, controlled predominantly by eustatic (and glacial eustatic) changes, and by local tectonic movements (extensional). This double control is at the origin of several local stratigraphic hiatuses (lower Cambrian, Siluro- Devonian, upper Carboniferous), or regional (upper Cambrian/Tremadocian, upper <b>Ashgillian),</b> and of a sequential stacking, often of the third order. The tectonic control is due to a system of faults, probably inherited from the Proterozoic, organized in a main network trending ENE-WSW to E-W, a secondary system with a NE-SW to NNE-SSW direction, and a minor NW-SE one. From the upper Devonian, the extensional block tectonics caused a strong displacement of this northern margin of the paleozoic platform. In the NE part of the sheet is located a very unstable depocenter, limited to the South by the Saghro high and to the West by the margins of the Imider threshold. After the upper Visean, the stratigraphic sequence is involved in a regime of polyphasic hercynian tectonics, in which the major phase causes the inversion of the pre-existing paleozoic faults and some South verging thrusts, but without large displacement. During this shortening, the network of secondary faults trending ESE-WNW and NE-SW, are sometimes reactivated with minor offset, respectively dextral and sinistral. Subsequently, the region has been involved into two late fracturing episodes, one originating ESE-WNW structures and the other ENE-WSW to E-W elements. The first episode is related to the dextral late hercynian transcurrent phase, well known in Morocco, the second one probably reflects the ougartian shortening. After the Hercynian the Anti-Atlas has been emerged until the Cretaceous. But the Paleozoic of Imitir is cut by a pre cretaceous NE-SW dyke (of Arg n'Ouchene or of Foum Zguid), injected of microgranite (late or post hercynian) and later by liassic dolerites. It has also been affected by normal faults, parallel to the dyke or trending ENE-WSW, and by a sinistral reactivation. These movements can be related to the atlasic mesozoic transtensional phases. Later, the Imtir paleozoic domain remained stable, up to the Quaternary, when some neo-tectonic movements can be detected in the directional changes of the major hydrographic network. The meso-Cenozoic sequence is made up by continental and marine sediments which outcrop in a vast area, covering one fourth of the sheet. The lower part of the sequence, liassic, outcrops in limited extension in the northwestern corner of the sheet. It is represented by the filling of basins developed during the atlasic rifting phase. The upper part of the sequence, Cretaceous to Pliocene, represents the filling of the Ouarzazate basin. A hiatus separates the jurassic from the cretaceous deposition, which starts in the Cenomanian with a continental sequence and continues in the turonian sea. In the upper Cretaceous the sequence shows a syntectonic character and is made up continental formations alternated with platform marine deposits of variable bathymetry. The upper paleocene and middle eocene rocks, unconformable overlapping the continental-marine sequence of the middle-upper Cretaceous, are predominantly made of coastal marine sediments. In the upper Eocene the rocks are predominantly continental. At present, due to the alpine orogeny, the Ouarzazate basin is {{at the front of the}} High Atlas, which limits it to the North and partially overthrusts it. Towards the South, the cretaceous to quaternary formations that fill it, unconformably rest on the Anti-Atlas paleozoic and precambrian rocks...|$|E
