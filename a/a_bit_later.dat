25|$|Earlier {{libraries}} in the Thirteen Colonies {{belonged to}} gentlemen, {{members of the}} clergy, and colleges. Members of the Library Company soon opened their own book presses to make donations: A Collection of Several Pieces, by John Locke; Logic: or, the Art of Thinking, by the Port Royalists Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, which Franklin in his autobiography said he had read {{at the age of}} 16; Plutarch's Moralia translated by Philemon Holland; Lewis Roberts' Merchants Mappe of Commerce, and others. <b>A</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> William Rawle added a set of Spenser's Works to the collection and Francis Richardson gave several volumes, among them Francis Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum, but on the whole books in Latin were few.|$|E

25|$|He was {{influenced}} by club professional Stewart Maiden, a native of Carnoustie, Scotland. Maiden was the professional at the Atlanta Athletic Club's East Lake Golf Club, who also trained Alexa Stirling, five years older than Jones but also a prodigy, at East Lake around the same time. Jones also received golf lessons from Willie Ogg {{when he was in}} his teenage years. Jones played frequently with his father, a skilled player himself. The younger Jones sometimes battled his own temper on the course, but later controlled his emotions as he became more experienced. Jones toured the U.S. during World War I from 1917–18, playing exhibition matches before large crowds, often with Alexa Stirling and Perry Adair, to generate income for war relief. Playing in front of such crowds in these matches helped him, as he moved into national competition <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> on.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} match timings for Day/Night Games {{in both the}} Sunday/National League and the Twenty20 Cup has changed. In July 1997 {{in the very first}} day/night match at Edgbaston play did not start on that night until 6.10pm with play not {{finishing}} until 11.38pm which brought about complaints from locals. These days matches apart from the Twenty20 Cup start in the mid-to-late Afternoon at either 2.30pm for Friends Provident Trophy and One Day International matches with Pro40 matches starting <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> at 4.40pm with matches finishing at around 10.15pm to 10.20pm.

In 2006 timings were brought forward with the matches starting at 7pm with the match finishing at 9.45pm.|$|E
25|$|When it restarted, Berger {{took the}} lead on track but Schumacher (who {{collided}} with Damon Hill, forcing the Briton in the Williams to stop for a new front wing) was still leading in the aggregate standings, with Berger, Häkkinen, Larini, Wendlinger and Katayama following. On the 12th Lap in total, Schumacher did take the lead on the circuit from Berger, but pitted immediately afterwards. When Berger stopped on lap 15, Häkkinen {{took the lead}} for McLaren. Berger retired on lap 17 with a suspension failure, whilst Häkkinen pitted <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later,</b> rejoining fourth. On Lap 21, Schumacher led (although driving behind Larini) on aggregate ahead of the Italian with Fittipaldi (who pitted on lap 23) in third, Häkkinen, Frentzen (who pitted a bit shorter as well) and Wendlinger making up the top six. From about lap 45 until lap 55, Damon Hill, Ukyo Katayama and Christian Fittipaldi battled for 5th, 6th and 7th, with first Fittipaldi and then Hill passing the Japanese in the Tyrrell on aggregate, Hill himself passed Fittipaldi on lap 49, only to lose the position two laps later. Fittipaldi did not finish the race; he retired with brake problems on lap 55. Damon Hill gained fifth, but lost it again to Katayama with two laps to go, and only kept a one-second lead over Heinz-Harald Frentzen to score the last point in the San Marino Grand Prix.|$|E

25|$|The Australian captain Ricky Ponting {{brought on}} {{part-time}} spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the 11th over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden {{on the fifth}} ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after 11 overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the 15th over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole 17 runs off the 17th over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries {{towards the end of}} the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki was out in the next over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England would be pleased with 179 for 8, the highest score on the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Nurnberg, Littell's {{literary}} agent, {{said that}} a possible one-line description of the novel would be: [...] "The intimate memoirs of an ex-Nazi mass murderer." [...] When asked why he wrote such a book, Littell invokes a photo he discovered in 1989 of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a female Soviet partisan hanged by the Nazis in 1941. He adds that <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later,</b> in 1992, he watched the movie Shoah by Claude Lanzmann, which left an impression on him, especially the discussion by Raul Hilberg about the bureaucratic aspect of genocide.|$|E
500|$|English theologian Richard Holt Hutton {{summarized}} the poem as Tennyson's [...] "friendly {{picture of the}} insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when {{under the control of}} a luminous reason and a self-controlled will." [...] The contemporary poet Matthew Arnold was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem: he found Ulysses' speech [...] "the least plain, the most un-Homeric, which can possibly be conceived. Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind: Mr. Tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it. Hence comes ... a heightened and elaborate air." [...] <b>A</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later,</b> journalist and apologist Gilbert Keith Chesterton saw Ulysses as a [...] "tribute to Christianity" [...] as getting {{to the heart of the}} remarkable difference between the outlook of Antiquity and the Christian-shaped modern one, remarking: [...] "The poet reads into the story of Ulysses the conception of an incurable desire to wander. But the real Ulysses does not desire to wander at all. He desires to get home." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{destruction}} of Novi Zrin, together with <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> (on 10 August 1664) signed unfavourable and shameful Peace of Vasvár, made Nikola Zrinski and other leading Croatian and Hungarian magnates angry and initiated the Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy. Later {{in the same}} year Zrinski died, allegedly killed by the wild boar, but the rest of magnates continued the conspiracy, which ended tragically in 1671.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "At 21, Murray already had {{remarkable}} technique and these explorations with bassist Fred Hopkins and drummer Phillip Wilson are quite adventurous... None of the compositions themselves are that memorable and some listeners may find Murray's screams and screeches (which he would modify <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> in <b>later</b> years) to be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too emotional, {{but this was}} a strong first effort.".|$|R
50|$|Born in Moscow, Lukyanuk started {{rallying}} in 2005. His {{first car}} was Zhiguli VAZ 2105 at Club Rally round in Staraya Shuya. Then he started occasionally 2-3 times a year.

500|$|The {{producers}} {{learned from}} an ex-MI5 officer {{that it is}} common for intelligence gatherers who spend most of their work listening in to other people {{to fall in love with}} civilians through just their voices. This story was the basis of Ruth wanting to go out with John in [...] "Love and Death". Khoury based [...] "Outsiders" [...] on Internet security. He already became intoned with the area, as he once worked with an internet company. Although the story is dramatised, Khoury did research on what was feasible, such as if one man and a laptop could theoretically bring Britain to its knees. Also in the episode, the G algorithm is based on an actual computer programme. [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] deals with interrogation and torture. Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects can say anything the interrogators want to hear, but rationalises that Adam is an expert in that field. To get the interrogation as true as possible, the producers consulted with ex-Army advisors who were trained in questioning terror suspects. As the episode was first broadcast, a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news. In response to this, Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated [...] "Spooks is really well researched and sometimes we look like we're ahead of the game. It's just we know stuff that's happening, and it'll come out in the news <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> on." [...] In the same episode, the weapons caches came from a true story that the Russians hid weapons in Britain during the Cold War, according to Collins.|$|E

5000|$|The second track, [...] "Conciliation", uses more {{electronic}} instruments. It {{starts with}} a rhythmic electronic pad and a delicate piano <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>later.</b> Slow tempo percussion enters the instrumentation as the music develops into spacious (although slightly dark) sequences that eventually lead to the build into the main refrain. In contrast with the instrumental verses, the also instrumental chorus brings light to the melodies and the rhythm.|$|R
50|$|The {{technical}} mechanisms {{needed to}} produce hollow bodied workpieces using the blowing technique were established very early on. Because glass is very breakable, after the introduction of plastic, plastic was being used to replace glass in some cases. The first mass production of plastic bottles was done in America in 1939. Germany started using this technology <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>later,</b> but is currently {{one of the leading}} manufacturers of blow molding machines.|$|R
2500|$|The use of {{graphite}} as a {{refractory material}} began before 1900 with the graphite crucible {{used to hold}} molten metal; this is now a minor part of refractories. In the mid-1980s, the carbon-magnesite brick became important, and <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> the alumina-graphite shape. [...] the order of importance is: alumina-graphite shapes, carbon-magnesite brick, monolithics (gunning and ramming mixes), and then crucibles.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{increasing}} case mergers, nominative and accusative forms seem to {{have remained}} distinct for much longer, since they are rarely confused in inscriptions. Even though Gaulish texts from the 7th century rarely confuse both forms, {{it is believed that}} both cases began to merge in Africa {{by the end of the}} empire, and <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> in parts of Italy and Iberia.
