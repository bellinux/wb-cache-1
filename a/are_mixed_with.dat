5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
5|$|Hummus is {{a staple}} in Palestinian side dishes, in {{particular}} in hummus bi tahini, in which boiled, ground beans <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> tahini (sesame paste) and sometimes lemon juice. Hummus is often slathered in olive oil and sometimes sprinkled with paprika, oregano and pine nuts; the latter are especially popular in the West Bank. Chick peas are also mixed with ful (fava beans), resulting {{in an entirely different}} dish, mukhluta, with a distinct flavor and brownish color.|$|E

5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} {{on the outcome of}} the battle <b>are</b> <b>mixed,</b> <b>with</b> some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite the lifting of the blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action. Jylland is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.|$|E

Since 2004 three different types of biomass fuel been in use at Lynemouth; Sawdust and Wood pellets from FSC certified forests and Olive residues. These fuels <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> the coal on the conveyor belt into the power station. In 2004 11,000 tonnes of biomass fuel {{were used in the}} station. Biomass conversion ambitions have increased, with the site currently aiming to be 100% biomass fired from 2015.|$|E

5|$|The early name, Bolton le Moors, {{described}} {{the position of}} the town amid the low hills {{on the edge of the}} West Pennine Moors southeast of Rivington Pike (456 m). Bolton lies on relatively flat land on both sides of the clough or steep-banked valley through which the River Croal flows in a southeasterly direction towards the River Irwell. The geological formation around Bolton consists of sandstones of the Carboniferous series and Coal Measures; in the northern part of Bolton the lower Coal Measures <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> underlying Millstone Grit.|$|E
5|$|The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and {{scapular}} {{area are}} a neutral grey colour. There is a brown {{spot on the}} nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and {{the bottom of their}} breasts <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold {{and there are}} very few rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.|$|E

5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
5|$|Xeromphalina setulipes {{shows some}} {{similarities}} to X.cauticinalis. They share the amber-coloured hair towards {{the base of}} the stem and both grow on soil, as opposed to directly onto wood. Further, X.cauticinalis can display caulocystidia of the same distinctive shape as those of X.setulipes (though these <b>are</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> the other shapes more typical of the genus). X.cauticinalis mushrooms are typically of a different colour; for instance, the area {{at the top of the}} stem is paler than the rest, compared to the entirely dark stem of X.setulipes. Furthermore, X.cauticinalis has a very bitter taste. X.setulipes shares with X.brunneola its dark colouration and some microscopic traits. However, the two clearly differ in the shape of both the cheilocystidia and the pileocystidia, the width of the spores (the spores of X.brunneola measure between 2 and 3μm in width) and the fact it is found specifically in softwood woodland. Furthermore, the two do not appear to be closely related.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} {{spermicidal}} effects {{of lemon juice}} and juices from other natural products consisting of pineapple juice, apple juice and aloe vera juice, was carried out to develop methods of contraception using natural products. Semen was donated by 20 men from infertile couples who came to an infertility clinic at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand from 1 November 2007 to 31 March 2010. Spermicidal effects were measured by observing changes in sperm viability, morphology and motility after the semen <b>was</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> lemon juice and the juices from the other natural products (pineapple juice, apple juice and aloe vera juice). Changes in sperm characteristics were compared with pure semen left at room temperature. After the semen <b>was</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> lemon juice, sperm were instantaneously immobilized and irreversibly deformed. A reduced spermicidal effect was observed when the semen <b>was</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> the other juices. A second, profound spermicidal effect was observed when semen <b>was</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> pineapple juice. The least effects were observed when the semen <b>was</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> aloe vera juice. This information {{can be used for}} the further development of natural barrier methods of contraception...|$|R
