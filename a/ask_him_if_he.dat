5|$|Bavaro {{struggled}} with a degenerative knee condition throughout the 1990 season and was rarely able to practice. The Giants cut him in July 1991 {{because of the}} injury. After some initial dispute, the Giants signed him to a one-year US$310,000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list. He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston, Massachusetts. He took the position after the team's coach took a chance and wrote Bavaro a letter to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would consider coaching.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{brought forward}} bank statements {{that showed that}} Cisneros withdrew US$5,000 from a US$100,000 family safety deposit box on July 7, 1992 and March 3, 1993, the morning Fischer was killed. The defense stated {{that there was nothing}} illegal about visiting the safety deposit box or making the withdrawal. They stated that the US$5,000 was for a family trip to Mexico. The prosecution suggested that the money was to pay off the murderers, but they were unable to provide evidence linking the two actions. On May 11, the defense introduced two witnesses to rest their case after six days of prosecution arguments. Most of the testimonies from the prosecution that day were done by Garza, who stated that Martínez never mentioned Cisneros's name as the person of who she was working with to have Fischer killed. Garza stated that he consulted Martínez on his marriage, but that she would interrupt to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had found anyone who was willing to carry out her client's request and hurt Fischer. Garza claimed that he had at least four calls from phone booths in San Fernando and Matamoros, two Mexican cities. The defense stated that Garza told the FBI that he made collect calls, but Garza said they were mistaken. He said that making collect calls from Mexico was difficult, though he did not discard the possibility of having made one to Martínez. The prosecution did not enter evidence showing that Garza made calls from Mexico to the U.S., and one of the defense witness showed that Martínez's phone bill did not have any collect calls from Matamoros. The defense stated that Garza made the claim of the phone calls from Mexico to get a reduced sentence, while Garza responded that he was testifying to make sure everyone involved in the murder gets punished. The defense responded by showing the jury letters from Garza's jail stating {{that he was willing to}} cooperate with the FBI in the trial for a reduced sentence. Garza responded by saying that those letters were written by one of his English-literate inmates on his behalf. The other defense witness was a restaurateur who saw Cisneros a few hours after the murder and recalled seeing her behaving normally.|$|E

25|$|During {{a public}} meeting at Zion United Methodist Church in Marion on February 28 after Jackson's death, {{emotions}} were running high. James Bevel, {{as director of}} the Selma voting rights movement for SCLC, called for a march from Selma to Montgomery to talk to Governor George Wallace directly about Jackson's death, and to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had ordered the State Troopers to turn off the lights and attack the marchers. Bevel strategized that this would focus the anger and pain of the people of Marion and Selma toward a nonviolent goal, as many were so outraged they wanted to retaliate with violence.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also an}} Indian {{version of}} the story, which appears in the Līlāvatīsāra by Jinaratna (1283), a summary of a now-lost {{anthology}} of fables, the Nirvāṇalīlāvatī by Jineśvara (1052). The dishonest merchant Dhana from Hastināpura swindles the King of Śrāvastī by offering to weave a supernatural garment that cannot be seen or touched by any person of illegitimate birth. When the king is supposedly wearing the garment, his whole court pretends to admire it. The king is then paraded about his city {{to show off the}} garment; when the common folk <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has become a naked ascetic, he realizes the deception, but the swindler has already fled.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh {{conceived}} the series Phineas and Ferb, {{based on their}} similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. [...] Povenmire spent 14–16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing [...] "It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on." [...] Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: [...] "Usually that means they {{throw it in the}} trash later," [...] Povenmire recalled. [...] Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, on the condition that he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States.|$|E

500|$|During {{a moment}} of anger, Bayliss nearly presses Tucker's face against a hot pipe on the wall, but Pembleton stops him. Tucker still angrily insists he did not kill her, and he agrees to submit to a {{polygraph}} test. When Bayliss leaves, Pembleton speaks to Tucker in a soft and comforting tone, trying to get Tucker to trust him. Pembleton suggests Tucker had a drink and blacked out the night he killed Adena, and he seems close to getting a confession before Tucker once again insists he is innocent. With four hours left before the deadline, Bayliss returns and says Tucker failed the polygraph test. Bayliss and Pembleton then aggressively team up on Tucker, talking quickly and intimidating him with repeated questions. They bring up a previously dropped statutory rape charge against Tucker involving a 14-year-old girl, then suggest he attempted {{to have sex with}} Adena and killed her because she resisted. They confront Tucker with gruesome crime scene photos of Adena and <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is sure he didn't kill her, to which a frightened and confused Tucker replies, [...] "Not right now, I'm not." ...|$|E
500|$|During October and November 2005, Wenger became {{embroiled in}} a war of words with Chelsea manager José Mourinho. Mourinho accused Wenger of having an [...] "unprofessional obsession" [...] with Chelsea and {{labelled}} him a [...] "voyeur." [...] Mourinho was quoted as saying, [...] "He's worried about us, he's always talking about us – it's [...] Chelsea". Wenger responded by pointing out he was only answering journalists' questions about Chelsea, and described Mourinho's attitude as [...] "disrespectful". Mourinho later apologised and clarified that he regretted his [...] "voyeur" [...] comment; Wenger accepted the apology. In 2014, Mourinho reopened his feud with Wenger by calling him a [...] "specialist in failure". This {{was in response to}} Wenger's comments that Chelsea were favourites for the Premier League and managers did not want to take responsibility if they failed to win the title. Wenger said Mourinho's comments were [...] "silly and disrespectful" [...] and had embarrassed Chelsea. When asked if he regretted his remark, Mourinho replied: [...] "You have to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> regrets the comments he made". In October 2014, during a Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea, Wenger was involved in a touchline spat with Mourinho. Wenger later apologised for his behaviour.|$|E

The first to add their verses to the track was Lil Wayne. Kesha and Wayne both {{happened to be in the}} studio on the same day as each other and she took the opportunity to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would participate in the remixing of the song. Following this Wiz Khalifa and T.I. were then asked to collaborate on the track. All three rappers agreed to write and appear on the song and with this the remix was completed. According to Kesha, the four rappers on the remix, titled [...] "Sleazy Remix 2.0: Get Sleazier", are included because they are four of her favorite rappers. On December 7, 2011, she posted the following message on the internet, revealing that the song would be released exclusively to iTunes on December 13, 2011: [...] "Get ready to get even $leazier with this sick collaboration I did with 4 of my favorite MCs of all time: Weezy, André 3000, Wiz Khalifa, and T.I., I opened the ‘Get $leazy’ tour with this song every night and it always got the party started ...

2500|$|In the Bombay High Court, {{the defence}} put forth {{their version of}} the incident, for which there were no {{witnesses}} other than the two men, and no evidence. Hearing Sylvia's confession, an enraged Nanavati wanted to shoot himself, but was calmed down by Sylvia, who {{told him that he}} was not to be blamed and there was no reason that he should shoot himself. Since Sylvia did not tell him whether Prem intended to marry her, Nanavati sought to find it out for himself. When Nanavati met Prem at the latter's bedroom, Prem had just come out of the bath dressed only in a white towel; an angry Nanavati swore at Prem and proceeded to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> intended to marry Sylvia and look after his children. Prem replied, [...] "Will I marry every woman I sleep with?", which further enraged Nanavati. Seeing Nanavati go for the gun, enclosed in a brown packet, Prem too went for it and in the ensuing scuffle, Prem's hand caused the gun to go off and instantly kill him.|$|E
