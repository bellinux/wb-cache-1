500|$|On February 12, 2012, Lil' Wayne {{said that}} Christina Milian had joined Young Money, and will release her fourth album through Young Money Entertainment. The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all I have to do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I could see he was getting a bit paranoid <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gomez, one of {{the main}} inspirations behind the track was the body-shaming she dealt with from tabloids and social media, after photos {{surfaced}} online of the singer in a bikini during a trip to Mexico in April 2015. [...] Many claimed she gained weight, with some news outlets going as far as to label her a [...] "mess", and suggested Gomez was [...] "going off the deep end". She commented: [...] "I was getting a lot of hate for my body and ‘you’re gaining weight,’ <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in Mexico and I was just feeling all of this stuff and I would be lying to you if I said it didn’t kind of hurt my feelings, but I kind of channeled that into my music." [...] Gomez called the experience [...] "degrading", explaining that she had never been through intense bullying before.|$|E
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. Ah! it is heresy to {{say that}} in this house, Lady Markby. Robert is a great {{champion}} of the Higher Education of Women, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid, <b>am</b> <b>I.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Emmet Mullins (Chelsea Harbour, fell at 2nd): [...] "He got {{his back}} up {{too high and}} came down too steeply. But he <b>is</b> grand <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> looking forward to next time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably not. Poor Lord Fordham's health {{does not}} improve, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very thankful {{that he does}} not fulfil Babie's ideal." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1939, aged 12, he {{enrolled}} in a minor seminary in Traunstein. This period lasted until the seminary was closed for military use in 1942, and the students were all sent home. Ratzinger returned to the Gymnasium in Traunstein. During this period in the seminary, following his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was enrolled in the Hitler Youth, as membership was legally required in effect beginning 25 March 1939. Following the seminary closure he continued required attendance with the Hitler Youth to avoid financial penalties in the Gymnasium tuition fees. The financial penalty (which theoretically required documentation of attendance at Hitler Youth activities) was overlooked when a sympathetic mathematics professor allowed him not to attend any meetings. In Ratzinger's book Salt of the Earth, Ratzinger says the following [...] "... Thank goodness, {{there was a very}} understanding mathematics teacher. He himself was a Nazi but an honest man, who said to me, 'Just go once and get the document so [...] that we have it' ... When he saw that I simply didn't want to, he said, 'I understand, I'll take care of it', <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to stay free of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Kelis {{achieved}} a second top ten {{hit in the}} UK as a featured artist on Richard X's [...] "Finest Dreams", a reworking of the S.O.S. Band's 1986 single [...] "The Finest". She found mainstream success in the U.S. later that year, with her Hot Dance Club Play number-one, Billboard Hot 100 top three single, [...] "Milkshake"; this helped to propel her third album, Tasty, to gold status in the U.S., where it peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200 and has sold 533,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. [...] "Milkshake" [...] also went gold, selling over 500,000 copies, and earned Kelis a Grammy Award nomination in 2004 for Best Urban/Alternative Performance. Although the Neptunes contributed several tracks to Tastythe album was released by their label Star Trak Entertainment, {{a joint venture with}} Arista RecordsKelis began collaborating with other producers, such as Dallas Austin, André 3000, Rockwilder, and Raphael Saadiq. She stated in an interview: [...] "I felt like I had a lot to prove with this album. People had started messing with me along the lines of 'Is she REALLY any good without The Neptunes?which I knew was ridiculous. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like 'I'll take that challenge'." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is not for}} {{a soldier}} to ask {{the reason for his}} orders, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about to hurry from the room, but the Marshal laid his hand upon my {{shoulder}} and held me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He thinks her decidedly better, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{sure she}} is. She has more appetite. She really ate the breast of a {{partridge}} to-day!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'"It is {{in a hole}} you are, at present, wid {{your hands}} full; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{going to take the}} {{opportunity}} of pitching into you." ...|$|R
6000|$|PURDIE. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now. (He sees he is not.) Where did I change? The wood! Let me think. The wood ... {{the wood}}, certainly. But the wood wasn't the wood.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just the}} rationale, as the French say, of the matter; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> telling Mabel, {{when she ran}} away and left me. You noticed {{the manner in which}} she skipped off as you approached?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} find her there. Quite worn out and broken up. I was the last man who {{commanded}} her. Hardly fit for service then. Reported fit for home service {{for a year or}} two, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sent off to the West Indies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Hamel,--Isadore Hamel. I am a sculptor, {{and used}} {{to be acquainted with}} her father. I have had great {{kindness}} from the whole family, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to call upon her. If you do not object, I will go on to the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, ma'am. I'll {{promise for}} my own part, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure, will Spring. But if <b>I</b> may <b>be</b> <b>so</b> bold, <b>I</b> can't help my drawers and potmen talking with your servants." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then he answered: 'When I saw {{how many}} people sought you, and could not find you, and {{lost their lives in}} <b>so</b> doing, <b>I</b> invented this trick, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> come safely to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|O {{beauty of}} the vales of Har, we live not for ourselves, [...] Thou seest me the meanest thing, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> indeed: [...] My bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark, ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Ellmother {{shook her}} head. [...] "I didn't get to sleep," [...] she said, [...] "till morning, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{too heavy to}} be up in time. But air has {{got nothing to do}} with it. Gentlefolks may have their whims and fancies. All air is the same to people like me." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{guards in}} whose hands I now found myself, upon hearing that I had {{returned}} {{of my own}} volition to Phutra evidently felt {{that it would be}} safe to give me liberty within the building as had been the custom before I had escaped, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told to return to whatever duty had been mine formerly.|$|E
60|$|Albeit I sought {{that day}} another {{interview}} with Yvonne, I did not gain it, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> forced to sun myself in solitude upon the terrace. But I cherished for my consolation that broken sentence of hers, whereby I {{read that the}} coldness which she had evinced for me before I left Canaples had only been assumed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I might stay longer, {{and forget}} how late it is, which would chagrin Mrs. Pryor. We keep early and regular hours at Fieldhead, Mr. Moore; <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure, does your sister at the cottage." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> But <b>I</b> wish it hadn't come so {{soon after}} Jack's visit, because I feel rather upset yet. Of course I like Gus Sinclair very much, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> very fond of him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed <b>I</b> do; <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> convinced, {{would most}} men. You need not murder me, man. You {{want me to}} make up to Linda, and surely it will <b>be</b> better that <b>I</b> should admire my own wife than yours.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> led to {{perceive}} that I {{was not to}} be the only aggressor in the struggle that was to come. That his Grace did me the honour to look upon me as an obstacle. And that he intended to seize the first opportunity to make way with me, by fair means or foul.|$|E
60|$|It {{is the way}} upon Barsoom {{to recite}} a man's virtues with his sins when he is come to trial, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not {{surprised}} that all that was to my credit should be read there to my judges--who knew it all by heart--even down to the present moment. When the reading had ceased Tardos Mors arose.|$|E
60|$|It {{is true that}} he had no wife, that is to say, she was as no wife to him, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in {{no danger}} that way, but the just {{reflections}} of conscience oftentimes snatch a man, especially a man of sense, from the arms of a mistress, as it did him at last, though on another occasion.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} {{the lessons of the}} poll, Schwarzenegger has responded [...] "People make {{mistakes}} sometimes, and I think that we learn. ... These are very clear messages that we must work together, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> looking forward to that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not fret, little one," [...] Julian {{replied in}} the same language. [...] "I am a friend, and {{will take care of}} you. Your {{carriage}} broke down, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> carrying you until we can get you another. Are you warm?" ...|$|R
60|$|PEW. Right you <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> But what is looks? It's the 'art {{that does}} it: the 'art is the seaman's star; and here's old David Pew's {{a matter of}} fifty years at sea, but tough and sound as the British Constitootion.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the great}} size of the thing alone that saved me. Its {{enormous}} bulk rendered it too slow upon its feet {{to cope with the}} agility of my young muscles, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> enabled to dodge out of its way and run completely behind it before its slow wits could direct it in pursuit.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Six weeks then--and {{afterwards}} one fortnight at Dieppe. He was not free. He {{had an old}} uncle, General Egremont, who {{was sick}} and hot-tempered, and he was obliged to keep everything secret from him, and therefore from everybody else. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to live at Dieppe, while {{he went out to}} take care of his uncle, and you know--you know--' ...|$|E
60|$|During the day I {{continued}} to pace the streets. Occasionally some little job like raking up a yard would present itself, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{able to buy}} a few rolls, and sometimes I indulged in milk and meat. I lived along from noon to noon in presentable condition, but I was always hungry. For four days I subsisted on five cents worth of buns.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Blood, and Lord Julian marvelled at {{the sudden}} haggardness of a countenance {{that had been}} so devil-may-care but a few moments since. [...] "I am a damned pirate, myself; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> merciful with my kind. Don Miguel goes free." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't want {{to neglect}} my studies," [...] said Gus Plum. [...] "But I {{have done some}} hard work this winter <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> pretty well ahead. I didn't lose time going to Cave Island, you know," [...] he added, with a smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} skill {{to write the}} words so small as you do and my pen moves slow. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> straitened, <b>and</b> say but little of what is in my mind. Greet your mother for me with a kiss. She asked me to kiss her twice when we parted." ...|$|R
