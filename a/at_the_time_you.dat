500|$|Sinden {{considered}} {{the first period}} of the first Swedish game the team's worst since the team was put together, but the team improved and started to take command. Henderson, Clarke, Cashman and Parise scored. Sinden criticized the German referees: [...] "...they were absolutely terrible. They couldn't even skate. They were miles behind the play all night and don't know the damn rules. Their incompetence helped the game become very bitter." [...] The players were also introduced to the style of play of the Swedes, who were well used to using stick work to throw off their opponents. [...] "They were spearing, holding, interfering, and most of all, backstabbing." [...] The Canadian players would retaliate and be penalized for their retribution. As {{an example of the}} referees' incompetence, Sinden pointed out that Esposito had been penalized for cross-checking, and given a misconduct for it. Sinden, who had played international ice hockey, knew that under international rules <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> could not give a misconduct for cross-checking.|$|E

Sometime around World War I, Lead Belly and Blind Lemon Jefferson got together and began composing folk tunes, with Dallas often in the lyrics.

"You {{intentionally}} {{killed a}} harmless, defenceless woman who, like all your other victims, had no prospect of protecting herself against you. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> committed that offence, you had, over almost three decades, terrorised {{women in this}} State. You have repeatedly violated a central norm of a decent civilised society. Your conduct {{in the present case}} is without mitigation or palliation. There has been no recognition by you of your wrongdoing. Rather, you repeated the same offence, with even more brutality, 18 months after murdering Margaret Maher.|$|E

2500|$|Ashfield Park on Parramatta Road {{is one of}} {{the finest}} urban landscapes in Sydney. It {{features}} big phoenix palms, a war memorial, a children's playground with a statue of Mary Poppins, a monument to International Mother Language Day built by former artist-in-residence Ian Marr and the Bangladeshi community, a statue of Philippines national hero Jose Rizal, a sporting field and one of Sydney's oldest bowling clubs. The park, which is just over 6 hectares in area, [...] was proclaimed in 1885 when it was claimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> could 'see all the way to Martin Place'.|$|E

The media never had a more {{prolific}} and intrepid source [...] If you weren't around here <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> could hardly credit what a threat Duke posed, although he was {{best known as a}} former Grand Wizard in the Klan who had at various times spoken warmly of Adolf Hitler. Duke's meteoric rise obviously signified that plenty of voters shared, or were at least prepared to overlook, his racist views. But he had been at great pains to create a more moderate persona, appearing in natty suits, and adopting the pose of a mainstream conservative politician who happened to have been a 'rascal"'in his long-ago youth. He was glib and, thanks to his plastic surgeon, quite photogenic.|$|E
