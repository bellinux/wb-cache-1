40|$|The {{sol-gel process}} opens the {{possibility}} of combining inorganic and organic units on a molecular or nanosized level. The flexible chemical approach of tailoring inorganic structures as well as organic polymeric structures {{in combination with the}} new concept of incorporation of nanoscaled metal oxide particles (in general boehmite) opens {{the possibility of}} achieving new multifunctional materials like extremely high scratch resistance, <b>antisoiling</b> <b>properties,</b> antifogging properties and corrosion-inhibitant coatings on metals...|$|E
40|$|The {{sol-gel process}} allows the {{fabrication}} of ceramic colloidal {{particles in the}} presence of organo alkoxy silanes carrying various functions and the synthesis of multi-functional transparent inorganic-organic composites if the particle size can be kept in the lower nano range. In addition to this, these composites can be used as controlled release systems or designed as gradient systems. Using this approach, a coating with a very low surface free energy (<b>antisoiling</b> <b>properties)</b> and temperature stability up to 350 °C, a controlled release system for permanent wettability (anti-fogging) and systems containing metal colloids for optical effects have been developed...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{study how}} the {{impregnation}} with sulfur-containing compounds changes the concrete pore structure {{and how it}} influences on the water absorption and watertightness. The results of this research indicate that impregnation of cement concrete with water-based solution of polysulphide modifies pore structure of cement concrete {{in such a way}} that it decreases total and effective porosity, reduces water absorption and increases watertightness. The proposed impregnation based on mineral helps to protect for a long time the most vulnerable parts of buildings – basements, foundations, as well as places on the facades of buildings exposed to rain, snow and groundwater. Application of the new product in the construction industry can increase the durability of materials, preventing the destruction processes caused by weathering, remove excess moisture in damp basements. The surfaces treated by protective compounds acquire <b>antisoiling</b> <b>properties</b> for a long time, and due to reduced thermal conductivity the cost of heating buildings is decreased. The effectiveness of the actions and the relatively low cost of proposed hydrophobizator makes it possible to spread widely the proposed protection method for building structures. ...|$|E
