25|$|Red Books: Our Search for Ellen White is a play <b>about</b> <b>White,</b> {{a co-founder}} of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the various {{perceptions}} of her {{throughout the history of}} the church. It was produced by the Dramatic Arts Society of Pacific Union College in California. It was based on interviews collected from over 200 individuals. The title derives from White's books, which were traditionally bound with a red cover.|$|E

Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute informational video titled America is a Changing Country, and forming an anti-globalization group – the Anti-Globalization Action Network – to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002.|$|E
25|$|The press {{deserved}} the attacks and criticisms of Will Irwin (1910) and Upton Sinclair (1920) and the muckrakers who followed, {{and it needs}} today the watchdog and gadfly activities of the new critical weeklies, but {{all in all it}} is now a better medium of mass information.... The 1972 Watergate disclosures, it is true, were made by only a score {{of the members of the}} mass media, but I remember Teapot Dome when only one of our 1,750 dailies (the Albuquerque Morning Journal) dared to tell the truth <b>about</b> <b>White</b> House corruption. We have come a long way since.|$|E
500|$|After researching {{black history}} in California, Thurman wrote eight {{articles}} for the San Francisco Sun Reporter {{as part of}} a series entitled [...] "Pioneers of Negro Origin in California". Using the same title, she published the articles in book form in 1952. It was the second history of black Californians published—the first being The Negro Trail Blazers of California by Delilah L. Beasley in 1919—and filled a gap caused by a lack of academic interest. History in America, at the time, was written about men and almost exclusively <b>about</b> <b>white</b> men. Neither of the women who wrote about the history of blacks in California was a native Californian.|$|E
50|$|The film {{starts out}} with Black (Samuel L. Jackson) and White (Tommy Lee Jones) conversing <b>about</b> <b>White's</b> {{attempted}} suicide. White {{feels as though}} everything ends up in death, and that his life is minuscule {{in the throes of}} time.|$|R

500|$|Gordimer remarked that, {{more than}} just a story <b>about</b> <b>white</b> communists in South Africa, Burger's Daughter is about [...] "commitment" [...] and what she as a writer does to [...] "make sense of life". After Mandela and Fischer were sentenced in the mid-1960s, Gordimer {{considered}} going into exile, but she changed her mind and later recalled [...] "I wouldn't be accepted as I was here, even in the worst times and even though I'm white". Just as Rosa struggles to find her place as a white in the anti-apartheid liberation movement, so did Gordimer. In an interview in 1980, she said that [...] "when we have got beyond the apartheid situation—there's a tremendous problem for whites, unless whites are allowed in by blacks, and unless we can make out a case for our being accepted and we can forge a common culture together, whites are going to be marginal".|$|E
500|$|When Ben {{fails to}} {{understand}} the appeal of Li'l Sebastian, Ron explains the miniature horse has an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame, a school in Indiana, the state where Parks and Recreation series is set. In a later scene, Ben compares Leslie to a Jedi, a type of warrior in the science fiction franchise Star Wars, prompting Leslie and Tom to mock him as a nerd. During one scene, Ken Hotate says, [...] "I know two things <b>about</b> <b>white</b> people: they love Matchbox Twenty, and they are terrified of curses." [...] The former refers to an American rock band, which is later also featured on the marquee of an exterior shot of a Wamapoke casino. (The extended cut replaces Matchbox Twenty with Rachael Ray in both instances.) Ann claims that, while distraught from her breakup with Chris, she bought $700-worth of candles from Anthropologie, a retail store that sells women's apparel and home accessories.|$|E
500|$|With the Harvest Festival days away, Leslie (Amy Poehler) surprises {{everyone}} by booking Li'l Sebastian, a miniature horse and legendary Pawnee celebrity. Everyone is thrilled except Ben (Adam Scott), who doesn't understand the fascination. The {{chief of the}} local Wamapoke tribe, Ken Hotate (Jonathan Joss), visits the parks department and requests the harvest festival be moved, as it is built upon {{the site of a}} Wamapoke massacre. When Leslie explains it is too late, Ken warns them the festival may become cursed, although he privately tells the documentary crew that [...] "there are two things [...] know <b>about</b> <b>white</b> people: they love Rachael Ray, and they are terrified of curses." [...] Ann (Rashida Jones) works the harvest festival first aid tent, where she confides in Donna (Retta) that she has not taken the break-up with Chris (Rob Lowe) well.

500|$|Fiasco {{is noted}} for his anti-establishment views. In an {{interview}} with Stephen Colbert on the satirical news show The Colbert Report, Fiasco stated his credo on political philosophy: [...] "You should criticize power even if you agree with it." [...] In another interview in June 2011 on the CBS program What's Trending, Fiasco discussed the political content of his music, stating, [...] "My fight against terrorism, to me, the biggest terrorist is Obama and the United States of America. I'm trying to fight the terrorism that's actually causing the other forms of terrorism. You know, {{the root cause of}} terrorism is the stuff the U.S. government allows to happen. The foreign policies that we have in place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists." [...] He additionally criticized Obama for his stance on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. [...] In keeping with his anti-establishment views, Fiasco does not vote in U.S. elections. On January 20, 2013, he was removed from the stage by the security for refusing to move onto the next song after performing a 30-minute version of [...] "Words I Never Said", which contains anti-Obama lyrics, in Washington D.C., during Obama's second presidential inauguration. In June 2015, Lupe Fiasco wrote an open letter <b>about</b> <b>white</b> supremacy.|$|E
500|$|While in prison, Cox mailed several {{letters to}} the St. Petersburg Times in 2008 in which he accused {{politician}} Kevin White of taking bribes from him during Cox's criminal career. He claims he made payoffs to White, an ultimately successful candidate for the Tampa City Council, in 2002 and 2003. Cox said White {{told him he could}} not receive the money directly, and suggested that Cox have friends donate $500 each, and then reimburse them. Records and statements from those who donated show that Cox did in fact make numerous contributions to White's campaign, and reimbursed others who did so as well. White, he claims, agreed to vote to rezone vacant properties in Tampa and Ybor City. When Cox was first arrested, the FBI talked to him <b>about</b> <b>White,</b> whom they were also investigating, and he told them the same information. He claimed to have paid him $7,000 in cash in addition to the recorded contributions he arranged. When White and a fellow City Council member were told Cox's contributions might have been illegal in 2004, his colleague told the police, while White kept silent. White has denied that he knew these contributions were reimbursed, and called Cox's accusations [...] "the jailhouse ramblings of a reputed con man." [...] White said he befriended Cox when he came to believe the con man was interested in revitalizing Tampa Heights. Cox had fled the Tampa area before White cast any rezoning votes, so there is no voting record which could help confirm the validity of his accusations. In 2012, White, who had gone on to serve as Hillsborough County Commissioner, was convicted of unrelated federal bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to three years in federal prison.|$|E

2500|$|Anthony Smith {{notes that}} the instrumentalist account [...] "came to {{prominence}} in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, in the debate <b>about</b> (<b>white)</b> ethnic persistence in {{what was supposed to}} have been an effective melting pot". This new theory sought explained persistence as the result of the actions of community leaders, [...] "who used their cultural groups as sites of mass mobilization and as constituencies in their competition for power and resources, because they found them more effective than social classes". In this account of ethnic identification, ethnicity and race are viewed as instrumental means to achieve particular ends.|$|E
