5|$|Ryan White was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after being expelled from school because of his infection. A hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment and, when diagnosed in 1984, was given six months to live. Though doctors said he posed no risk to other students, AIDS was poorly understood at the time, and when White tried to return to school, many parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> Kokomo rallied against his attendance. A lengthy legal battle with the school system ensued, and {{media coverage of the}} struggle made White into a national celebrity and spokesman for AIDS research and public education.|$|E
5|$|With the Ottoman {{annexation}} of 1517, despite the mayhem their fight {{to control the}} city engendered, the Turks showed great deference to the mosque and its college, though direct royal patronage ceased. Sultan Selim I, the first Ottoman ruler of Egypt, attended al-Azhar for the congregational Friday prayer during his last week in Egypt, but did not donate anything to the upkeep of the mosque. Later Ottoman amirs likewise regularly attended Friday prayers at al-Azhar, but rarely provided subsidies {{for the maintenance of}} the mosque, though they did on occasion provide stipends for students <b>and</b> <b>teachers.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to the expansions and additions undertaken during the Mamluk Sultanate, only two Ottoman walīs (governors) restored al-Azhar in the early Ottoman period.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis. As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation.|$|E

25|$|The {{library of}} the Royal Academy {{is the oldest}} {{institutional}} fine art library in Britain.

The library contains some 65,000 books, including an historic book collection of approximately 12,000 volumes, acquired before 1920, reflecting the early teaching philosophy of the Academy Schools. The archive forms one of the world's most significant resources for the historical study of British art since 1768.|$|E

25|$|The School of Oriental Studies {{was founded}} by the British state as an {{instrument}} to strengthen Britain's political, commercial and military presence in Asia and Africa.

25|$|The Great Schism of 1378 made it {{possible}} for Heidelberg, a relatively small city and capital of the Electorate of the Palatinate, to gain its own university. The Great Schism was initiated by the election of two popes after the death of Pope Gregory XI in the same year. One successor resided in Avignon (elected by the French) and the other in Rome (elected by the Italian cardinals). The German secular and spiritual leaders voiced their support for the successor in Rome, which had far-reaching consequences for the German students <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> Paris: they lost their stipends and had to leave.|$|E

25|$|In a 2005 {{survey in}} Pakistan, pupils {{in private schools}} of Pakistan {{expressed}} their opinions on religious tolerance in the country.

In the same study, the teachers in these elite schools showed an even lower amount of tolerance towards Ahmadis than their pupils. Ahmadis are harassed by certain schools, universities <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> Pakistan's Punjab province. The harassment includes social boycott, expulsions, threats and violence against Ahmadi students by extremist students, teachers and principals of the majority sect.|$|E
25|$|A {{literacy}} {{class was}} noted in 1987 {{along with a}} rural school recognized by national government {{as well as a}} rural clinic.

Another local school in Kareeba was noted in 1989. Additional local, regional, national and international activities were held in 1989 - some in Western Province, another series of events were along the Ramu River, another health training institute was recorded and played on a radio station in Rabual, and a music festival was promoted by several women's groups.|$|E
25|$|The temple {{also started}} to {{organize}} huge alms giving events around the country, including at important sites in Bangkok, such as shopping centers Siam Paragon and Central World, {{as well as}} in the area of Pratunam, some of which were joined by numbers of over twenty thousand monks. The alms giving events were held to help bring monks and lay people together, to revive the custom of alms giving, and as a dedication of merit to the victims of the insurgency in the Southern provinces. The profits from the alms giving events were used to support the temples <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> the South with aid and supplies. The events were the first mass gatherings which the junta had allowed since the 2006 coup d'état. In 2012, the alms events became more prominent when then Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra joined an event in person, as well as comedian Udom Taepanich.|$|E

25|$|Cory gained St Ives {{from the}} Liberal Unionists at the Liberal {{landslide}} victory of 1906. He held the seat as a Liberal {{in the elections}} of January and December 1910. This was {{in the face of}} a strong Tory resurgence in English agricultural seats in January 1910, the effect of which was not as marked in Cornwall. The Cornish results may be attributable to the significant nonconformist electorate there and their concerns about education against the background of the Tory preference for education to be promoted through Church of England schools. The issue of education was likely to have been a factor in Cory’s initial victory in 1906 too. There was a high nonconformist turnout in 1906 in the wake of the controversy over the 1902 Education Act which replaced School Boards elected by ratepayers in their district, which had been popular with radicals, with Local Education Authorities under the control of County or Borough Councils. Nonconformist electors objected that rate aid was being used to support the teaching of religious views to which they were opposed, 'Rome on the Rates'; Anglican and Roman Catholic Church schools, supported by public funds, were not under public control <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> these sectarian schools were subject to religious tests. More nonconformist MPs were elected to Parliament in 1906 than Conservatives MPs.|$|E
500|$|During {{their time}} in Rome, Fermi and his group made {{important}} contributions to many practical and theoretical aspects of physics. In 1928, he published his Introduction to Atomic Physics (...) , which provided Italian university students with an up-to-date and accessible text. Fermi also conducted public lectures and wrote popular articles for scientists <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> order to spread knowledge of the new physics as widely as possible. Part of his teaching method was to gather his colleagues and graduate students together {{at the end of}} the day and go over a problem, often from his own research. A sign of success was that foreign students now began to come to Italy. The most notable of these was the German physicist Hans Bethe, who came to Rome as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow, and collaborated with Fermi on a 1932 paper [...] "On the Interaction between Two Electrons" [...] (...)
