50|$|In 1994, Lil-lets <b>applicator</b> <b>tampons</b> were launched.|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} {{differences}} {{are in the}} way the tampon expands when in use; <b>applicator</b> <b>tampons</b> generally expand axially (increase in length), while digital tampons will expand radially (increase in diameter). Most tampons have a cord or string for removal. The majority of tampons sold are made of rayon, or a blend of rayon and cotton. Organic cotton tampons are made from only 100% cotton.|$|R
50|$|<b>Applicator</b> <b>tampons</b> - {{inserted}} into the vaginal cavity with a plastic or cardboard applicator tube - were invented in the United States by Earle Haas in the late 1940s. Applicators {{make it easier for}} some women to inject the tampon into position in the vagina. But by creating a <b>tampon</b> without an <b>applicator</b> Esser-Mittag created a more environmentally friendly product. 90% of raw materials used for o.b. tampons come from renewable resources. So not only are the tampons are environmentally friendly because they lack the applicator, but they are also made of environmentally friendly materials.|$|R
5|$|Playtex-branded tampons were {{introduced}} in the 1960s and became the primary competition to incumbent Tampax. Playtex invented the plastic <b>tampon</b> <b>applicator</b> in 1973. It {{was one of the}} tampon manufacturers that were sued for aggressively advertising over-absorbent tampons, which led to toxic shock syndrome.|$|R
50|$|Since {{they are}} reusable, menstrual cups help to reduce solid waste. Some {{disposable}} sanitary napkins and plastic <b>tampon</b> <b>applicators</b> can take 25 years {{to break down}} in the ocean and can cause a significant environmental impact. Biodegradable sanitary options are also available, and these decompose {{in a short period}} of time, but they must be composted, and not disposed of in a landfill.|$|R
5000|$|Tampon design varies between {{companies}} and across product lines {{in order to}} {{offer a variety of}} applicators, materials and absorbencies. <b>Tampon</b> <b>applicators</b> may be made of plastic or cardboard, and are similar in design to a syringe. The applicator consists of two tubes, an [...] "outer", or barrel, and [...] "inner", or plunger. The outer tube has a smooth surface to aid insertion and sometimes comes with a rounded end that is petaled.|$|R
5000|$|The {{initials}} o.b. {{come from}} the German words [...] "ohne binde", translating to without sanitary pad. The alteration to the tampon included that the tampon could be placed {{without the use of}} an <b>applicator.</b> A <b>tampon</b> without an <b>applicator</b> is beneficial to the user by means that it is easy to use, comfortable, and ultimately provided excellent protection for the user. Dr. Esser-Mittag's idea was to create a product that worked with a woman's body to offer the best protection. As an active swimmer she was dissatisfied with the options available for menstrual hygiene; and as a gynecologist she {{was in a position to}} take the initiative to find a better option for menstruating women. She was not satisfied with pads because they could not be worn in water, and she thought that applicator-tampons were uncomfortable and did not conform to the woman's body. The o.b. tampon is much smaller than an applicator-tampon, and it is easy to insert, comfortable, and provides great protection.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm {{carried out}} a life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) comparison of {{the environmental impact of}} tampons and sanitary pads. Their “cradle to grave” assessment of the raw material extraction, transportation, production, use and waste management stages took three main impact categories into consideration: human health, ecosystem quality and resource use. They found that the main environmental impact of the products was in fact caused by the processing of raw materials, particularly LDPE (low density polyethelene) - or the plastics used in the backing of pads and <b>tampon</b> <b>applicators,</b> and cellulose production. As production of these plastics requires a lot of energy and creates long-lasting waste, the main impact from the life cycle of these products is fossil fuel use, though the waste produced is significant in its own right.|$|R
500|$|Playtex {{created a}} {{consumer}} products subsidiary, Playtex Products Inc., in 1960, which produced baby products, tampons and other consumer goods. It introduced and patented the first plastic <b>tampon</b> <b>applicator</b> in 1973. By 1975, the five largest tampon manufacturers began competing with multimillion-dollar advertising budgets and Playtex became the primary competitor to market-leader Tampax. Playtex introduced a scented tampon that was advertised with the slogan, [...] "When you're wearing a tampon you don't worry about odor. But should you?" [...] It added a warning label saying {{that some women}} may experience irritation from the chemicals after complaints were raised by Planned Parenthood. Tampon manufacturers, including Playtex, were sued for aggressively advertising and competing over absorbency, when some studies found that excessive absorbency leads to toxic shock syndrome. In 1985, a judge offered to reduce an $11 million verdict against Playtex, if they admitted their super-plus tampons were killing women and recalled them.|$|R
5000|$|Rolled up banknotes, hollowed-out pens, cut straws, pointed ends of keys, {{specialized}} spoons, long fingernails, and (clean) <b>tampon</b> <b>applicators</b> {{are often}} used to insufflate cocaine. Such devices are often called [...] "tooters" [...] by users. The cocaine typically is poured onto a flat, hard surface (such as a mirror, CD case or book) and divided into [...] "bumps", [...] "lines" [...] or [...] "rails", and then insufflated. The amount of cocaine in a line varies widely {{from person to person}} and occasion to occasion (the purity of the cocaine is also a factor), but one line is generally considered to be a single dose and is typically 35 mg (a [...] "bump") to 100 mg (a [...] "rail"). As tolerance builds rapidly in the short-term (hours), many lines are often snorted to produce greater effects. A 2001 study reported that the sharing of straws used to [...] "snort" [...] cocaine can spread blood diseases such as hepatitis C.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} monthly accumulation {{rates and}} types of marine debris washed ashore at a recreational beach in Point Pleasant Park, Halifax Harbour, between April and September 2005. Black Rock Beach is 70 m long {{and a total of}} 2129 marine debris items were collected and sorted, representing a mean accumulation rate of 355 (± 68 SE) items month- 1. The total weight of debris items was only 10. 8 kg (mean 2 kg ± 0. 4 SE), however eighty-six percent of this debris was plastic material. The types of litter found included: <b>tampon</b> <b>applicators,</b> condoms (i. e., sewage-related debris [SRD]); plastic fast food packaging, confectionary wrappers, Styrofoam fragments, plastic bottles and caps, items of clothing, soft drink cans, cigarettes and cigarette holders (i. e., recreational or land-based debris); packing bands, nylon rope and nets (i. e., shipping- or fishing-related debris). These items were generated by recreational use of the park (52 %), sewage disposal (14 %) and from shipping and fishing activities (7 %). It is suggested that a significant reduction in marine debris at recreational beaches may arise by improving public awareness of the environmental and aesthetic impacts of marine litter and future improvements to the municipal sewage disposal system...|$|R
