At the Kremlin the {{situation}} of the Poles had been worsening despite occasional reinforcements, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> national and religious uprising was spreading all over Russia. Prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin effectively led the Russians, a new rescue operation attempted by Hetman Chodkiewicz had failed and a capitulation of the Polish and Lithuanian forces at the Kremlin terminated in 1612 their involvement there. Mikhail Romanov, son of the imprisoned in Poland (since his rejection of Sigismund III's demand for the Russian throne) Patriarch Filaret, became the new tsar in 1613.|$|E

25|$|Kaliningrad was the East Prussian {{provincial capital}} Königsberg. Founded in 1255 by the Teutonic Knights, {{the city was}} {{named in honor of}} the Bohemian King Ottokar II.

25|$|In 644, Umar {{was assassinated}} by a Persian slave named Abu Lulu by later accounts. His {{motivation}} for the assassination is not clear.

25|$|Balaguer {{remained}} in power as president for 12 years. His tenure {{was a period}} of repression of human rights and civil liberties, ostensibly to keep pro-Castro or pro-communist parties out of power; 11,000 persons were killed. His rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> Columbus Lighthouse, completed in 1992 during a later tenure.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao's populist {{policies}} {{have resulted in}} the elimination of agricultural taxes for farmers, more flexible policies towards migrant workers living in cities, more balanced development between the coastal regions and the hinterlands, enforcing minimum wage in cities and the promotion of sustainable and affordable housing developments. The response to the SARS public health crisis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> expansion of health insurance coverage for middle- to low-income citizens earned Hu accolades domestically.

Her exact date of birth is uncertain; she was baptized on 1 August 1837. Mary Harris and her family were victims of the Great Famine, as were many other Irish families. This famine drove more than a million families, including the Harrises, to emigrate to North America.

25|$|The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province (MLIP) {{is a major}} Mesoproterozoic large igneous {{province}} of the southwestern, western and northwestern Canadian Shield in Canada.

The large igneous province extends from the Arctic in Nunavut to near the Great Lakes in Northwestern Ontario where it meets with the smaller Matachewan dike swarm.

25|$|Following Stalin's {{death in}} March 1953 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> {{increase}} in emigration the new Soviet government decided {{to ease the}} policies Stalin had demanded. On 4 June 1953, the Soviet government, alarmed at reports of unrest, summoned East German leaders to Moscow. Georgy Malenkov warned them that if policy direction were not corrected immediately, {{there would be a}} catastrophe. After intense discussion the East German party eased policies and publicly admitted that mistakes had been made. However, according to the historian of East Germany, Manfred Wilke, that admission may have had the unintended effect of inflaming public opinion rather than easing tensions.|$|E

25|$|Romania's {{participation}} in the war came with the generalization of antisemitic measures <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> deportations of the Jews to occupied Transnistria, a process initiated by her husband, and marked by events in which she herself was implicated (see Holocaust in Romania). In October 1941, Wilhelm Filderman, head of the Jewish Communities' Federation, sent {{her and her husband}} letters of protest, stressing that the deportations were tantamount to death—messages which went unanswered. In November, after the ghetto in Chișinău was sacked and its population deported to Transnistria, the authorities set aside confiscated property for the Patronage Council, for the Red Cross, for Romanian hospitals and the Romanian Army.|$|E
25|$|The 1981 Springbok tour of New Zealand {{went ahead}} in {{defiance}} of the Gleneagles Agreement. South Africa lost the series 2–1. The tour <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> civil disruption in New Zealand had ramifications far beyond rugby. In 1981, Errol Tobias became the first non-white South African to represent his country when he took the field against Ireland. South Africa sought to counteract its sporting isolation by inviting the South American Jaguars to tour. The team contained mainly Argentinian players. Eight matches were played between the two teams in the early 1980s—all awarded Test status. In 1984, England toured losing both test matches; of the players selected, only Ralph Knibbs of Bristol refused to tour for political reasons.|$|E
25|$|In 1574, the Spanish army under Luis de Requeséns was repulsed {{from the}} Siege of Leiden after the Dutch {{destroyed}} the dykes that held back the North Sea from the low-lying provinces.

The army in the Netherlands mutinied not long after, seizing Antwerp and looting the southern Netherlands, prompting several cities in the previously peaceful southern provinces to join the rebellion.
