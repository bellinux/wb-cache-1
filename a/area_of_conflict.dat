5|$|The Red Turban Rebellion saw the {{application}} of early, arrow-firing cannon to both siege and naval warfare in the Southern <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict.</b> Following the ascendancy of the Ming Dynasty, cannon were restricted at first to operations pacifying the southern border, including a resounding victory over a band of war-elephants in the 1380s.

5|$|Since the {{day after}} the fall of the town, Faya-Largeau was {{subjected}} to a sustained air bombardment, using Su-22 and Mirage F-1s from the Aouzou air base, along with Tu-22 bombers from Sabha. Within ten days, a large ground force had been assembled east and west of Faya-Largeau by first ferrying men, armor, and artillery by air to Sabha, Kufra and the Aouzou airfield, and then by shorter-range transport planes to the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict.</b> The fresh Libyan forces amounted to 11,000 mostly regular troops, and eighty combat aircraft participated in the offensive; however, the Libyans maintained their traditional role of providing fire support, and occasional tank charges, for the assaults of the GUNT, which could count on 3,000–4,000 men on this occasion.|$|E

25|$|An {{especially}} thorny issue {{concerned the}} interpretation of the secrecy which the CIA had previously enjoyed. According to its agents, the CIA's mandate included not only access to state secrets, but also the commission of clandestine acts in furtherance of USG policy, as ordered from time to time by the President. Consequently, the CIA had a primary duty to protect such secrets and to refrain from public discussion of any covert activity. An <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> arose when this CIA duty of confidentiality to the President came into direct conflict with the Agency's duty to respond honestly to legislative investigations of the executive branch authorized by the Constitution. Up until then, such potential conflict had been negotiated by quiet understandings between Congress and the CIA.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, China {{closed the}} border between Nubra and Xinjiang, {{blocking}} old trade routes. In 1955 China began to build roads connecting Xinjiang and Tibet through this area. It also built the Karakoram highway jointly with Pakistan. India built the Srinagar-Leh Highway during this period, cutting the journey time between Srinagar and Leh from 16 days to two. The route, however, remains closed {{during the winter months}} due to heavy snowfall. Construction of a 6.5km tunnel across Zoji La pass is under consideration to make the route functional throughout the year.

25|$|In {{the antebellum}} years before West Virginia {{separated}} from Virginia, development of adequate roads {{was a major}} <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> between the western regions and the east. Through the Board of Public Works, the Virginia state government helped finance turnpikes among its programs to encourage internal improvements, with tolls collected to defray operating costs and retire debt. Principal among these was the east-west Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike, completed from Staunton to the Ohio River at Parkersburg immediately prior to the American Civil War (1861–1865). However, many of the internal transportation improvements were destroyed during that conflict, although bonded debt remained to be paid, even as additional progress had ended. After resolution by the U.S. Supreme Court, which assigned 1/3 of the amount due to the new state early in the 20th century, West Virginia was faced with retiring its share of Virginia's pre-civil war debt for the earlier turnpikes (and canals and railroads) even as the citizens needed and sought better roads.|$|E

2500|$|Malacca City ( [...] Bandaraya Melaka, Jawi: , , Tamil: மலாக்கா மாநகரம்), is {{the capital}} city of the Malaysian state of Malacca. As of 2010 it has a {{population}} of 484,885. It is the oldest Malaysian city in the Straits of Malacca, having become a successful entrepôt in the era of the Malacca Sultanate. The present-day city was founded by Parameswara, a Sumatran prince who escaped to the Malay Peninsula when Srivijaya fell to the Majapahit. Following the establishment of the Malacca Sultanate, the city drew the attention of traders from the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, as well as the Portuguese, who intended to dominate the trade route in Asia. After Malacca was conquered by Portugal, the city became an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> when the sultanates of Aceh and Johor attempted to take control from the Portuguese.|$|E
2500|$|With Candido Nocedal {{political}} leader and Ramón his closest collaborator, Carlism firmly adjusted all its activities to religious goals. In 1881 they planned another pilgrimage to Rome; Ramón became secretario general of junta organizadora, though the initiative eventually came to naught. When managing and writing to El Siglo Futuro {{he focused on}} Catholic and Spanish values, with regionalist and monarchist themes – let alone dynastical ones – reduced to secondary role. Though relentless towards those seeking rapprochement with the regime, the Nocedals were also implacable towards Carlists showing signs of dissent. The conflict between nocedalistas and cerralbistas resurfaced and triggered bitter guerra periodistica, with complaints about [...] "la dictadura nocedalista" [...] opening a new <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict.</b> Many Carlist bigwigs grumbled against heavy Nocedals' hand and some conspired against them; the claimant, though irritated, refrained from bold action until Candido Nocedal died in 1885.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{incidents}} {{in the summer and}} fall of 1862 led to the battle between Bear Hunter and Col. Connor. [...] These were related to broad struggles between indigenous peoples and European-American settlers over almost the entire United States west of the Mississippi River. [...] The attention of most of the nation's population was focused on the Civil War in the eastern states. [...] Modern historians have overlooked these incidents because they occurred near the ill-defined boundary of two different territories: those of Washington and Utah.

2500|$|The River Raisin Battlefield Site {{was listed}} as a Michigan Historic Site on February 18, 1956, {{although}} the exact date at which the park was first organized is unknown. The location of the site is bounded by North Dixie Highway, the River Raisin, Detroit Avenue, and Mason Run Creek. The Battle of Frenchtown is so named because it took place in and surrounding the Frenchtown Settlement (1784), on the River Raisin's north bank and within the present-day city limits of Monroe. The <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> extended during the three days of battle several {{miles to the north}} and south of the current park site.

[...] The current park area encompasses some 40 acres (16 ha) of undeveloped land on Monroe’s east side approximately one-quarter mile (0.4km) east of Interstate 75. The area contains houses on the outer fringe along East Elm Avenue, and much of the area is occupied by urban development.

60|$|As the {{proceedings}} {{in the cabinet}} dragged on through the winter, new projects were mooted. The ground was shifted to what Lord Stratford had called a comprehensive war upon Russia. Some of the cabinet began to aim at a transformation of the policy. It was suggested that the moment should be seized to obtain not merely the observance by Russia of her treaty obligations to Turkey, but a revision and modification of the treaties in Turkish interests. This is the well-known way in which, ever since the world called civilised began, the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> is widened. If one plea is eluded or is satisfied, another is found; and so the peacemakers are at each step checkmated by the warmakers. The Powers of central Europe were immovable, with motives, interests, designs, each of their own. Austria had reasons of irresistible force for keeping peace with Russia. A single victory of Russia in Austrian Poland would enable her to march direct upon Vienna. Austria had no secure alliance with Prussia; on the contrary, her German rival opposed her on this question, and was incessantly canvassing the smaller states against her in respect to it. The French Emperor {{was said to be}} revolving a plan for bribing Austria out of Northern Italy by the gift of Moldavia and Wallachia. All was intricate and tortuous. The view in Downing Street soon expanded to this, {{that it would be a}} shame to England and to France unless the Czar were made not only to abandon his demands, and to evacuate the Principalities, but also to renounce some of the stipulations in former treaties on which his present arrogant pretensions had been formed. In the future, the guarantees for the Christian races should be sought in a treaty not between Sultan and Czar, but between the Sultan and the five Powers.|$|E
