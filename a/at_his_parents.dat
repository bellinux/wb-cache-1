25|$|After {{two years}} at Alma College, Hull moved to Hibbing, Minnesota to work as an {{apprentice}} mining engineer. However, after two months he was afflicted by polio, which left him paralyzed with one leg, causing him to recover <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> home {{for a year and}} forcing him to reconsider his life path. He considered becoming a minister of Unitarianism, because he found their philosophy focused sermons appealing. His love of philosophy eventually led to his interest in Psychology, which he studied during his recovery. He began his journey by reading William James’ book Principles of Psychology. He also took a particular interest in the works of Watson and Pavlov. A little after he started reading, his eyes would become weak and his mother would read to him until his eyes became strong enough for him to read on his own. A year later, he decided to teach back home in the one room school, which had expanded to two-rooms. After his two years teaching, he married Bertha Iutzi with very little money.|$|E
500|$|... "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons {{directed}} by Dominic Polcino. Polcino had worked as an assistant director {{on the show and}} had left the show but was offered a chance to be a director. He describes the episode as a [...] "tough one to start with", especially the scenes with the Wright Flyer. An early version of the script featured a longer scene at the air show that featured Hans Moleman flying an early flying machine. The scene where Milhouse is in a jet pretending to fire missiles <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> because he's upset with them, would later inspire the episode [...] "A Milhouse Divided". In that episode, Milhouse's parents become divorced.|$|E

500|$|... "A Milhouse Divided" [...] is {{the only}} episode for which Steve Tompkins has sole writing credit, {{although}} {{he had been a}} part of the writing staff for several years. The writers wanted to do an episode that involved a couple getting divorced. They had wanted to break the sitcom convention that characters who look like they will divorce get back together and have two characters remain divorced even after the episode. The Van Houtens were chosen because the writers felt that they were the most developed couple next to Marge and Homer and the Lovejoys. The scene in the episode [...] "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming" [...] where Milhouse is in a jet pretending to fire missiles <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> is where they got the idea to have his parents' marriage be in trouble.|$|E

2500|$|Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia {{was born}} on [...] in Tsarskoye Selo, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> country residence, the Vladimir Villa. He was the {{youngest}} of the four Vladimirovich sons; a sister followed him a few years later, and the eldest of his brothers died in early childhood. His father, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, a brother of Tsar Alexander III of Russia, was a renowned patron of the arts.

2500|$|The Tom Green Show {{was then}} picked up by MTV in January 1999, where he gained {{popularity}} in the United States and worldwide. The format of the MTV version of the show was similar to his original show; it was hosted by Green and co-hosted by two of his long-time friends, Glenn Humplik, who occupied the couch, and Phil Giroux, who sat behind a window {{at the back of}} the set and became known as [...] "the guy in the window" [...] usually drinking cups of coffee. Derek Harvie, who co-wrote the show with Green, occasionally appeared in the segments. Many of the sketches were targeted <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents,</b> both of whom appear to be unimpressed and embarrassed by their son's antics.|$|E
2500|$|In certain {{versions}} of the manuscript, {{the latter part of}} line 62 reads cui non risere parentes, meaning [...] " [...] at whom parents have not smiled". Some Virgilian scholars argue that the text should read, qui non risere parenti, meaning [...] " [...] have not smiled at their parent". This is largely because Roman rhetorician Quintilian noted in his writings that Virgil's text did in fact alternate between plural and singular forms, although he did not elaborate on which word was plural, and which was singular; some Virgilian scholars suggest that the emended word parentes is the plural form Quintilian was referring to, whereas the word hunc in line 63 is the singular form. However, Quintilian's text {{is the same as the}} supposedly [...] "corrupt" [...] Virgilian version, containing both cui and parentes. Certain scholars argue that Quintilian's original text was at one point changed to rectify it with Virgil's text, which had at that time also become corrupt. Edwin Floyd, however, rejects this hypothesis, reasoning that the argument is far too convoluted to be reasonable. He posits that the qui non risere parenti emendation strains the syntax and feebly renders the sense of the poem, as it merely speaks of a baby that is not smiling. The cui non risere parentes variation, according to Floyd, is to be preferred because it questions [...] "what sort of 'unnatural' parents these might be who would not smile on their child." [...] Other commentators disagree with Floyd. Nisbet, for instance, writes, [...] "It is clear from the structure and sense of the passage that the baby is doing the laughing and not the parents (that is to say, the cui of Virgil's manuscripts is impossible against the qui implied by Quintilian 9.3.8)." [...] He instead contends that the baby not laughing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>parents</b> is a hint to the reader that [...] "the infant is out of the ordinary." ...|$|E
