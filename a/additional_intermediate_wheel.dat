5000|$|Pdof. Dr. von Freytag-Löringhoff, a {{professor}} of philosophy specialized in logic at the University of Tübingen built the first replica of Schickard's machine in 1960 {{but he had to}} improve on the design of the carry mechanism: [...] This simple-looking device actually presents a host of problems to anyone attempting to construct an adding machine based on this principle. The major problem is caused {{by the fact that the}} single tooth must enter into the teeth of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheel,</b> rotate it 36 degrees (one tenth of a revolution), and exit from the teeth, all while only rotating 36 degrees itself. The most elementary solution to this problem consists of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheel</b> being, in effect, two different gears, one with long and one with short teeth together with a spring-loaded detente (much like the pointer used on the big wheel of the gambling game generally known as Crown and Anchor) which would allow the gears to stop only in specific locations. It is not known if Schickard used this mechanism, but it certainly works well on the reproductions constructed by von Freytag Loringhoff. Michael R. Williams ...|$|R

40|$|Fourfold {{magnetic}} nanoparticles, {{created from}} nanowires {{or in the}} form of an open square, offer the possibility of creating quaternary memory devices with four unambiguously distinguishable stable states at remanence.

The paper investigates exemplarily nanoparticles of two shapes which were found to be optimum to gain four states at remanence. For clusters of these particles, the probability of reaching the <b>additional</b> <b>intermediate</b> states in all particles in the same field region is strongly reduced with decreased interparticle distance.

40|$|According to the "elastic bonding" concept, a thick {{intermediate}} layer of flexible resin {{has been suggested}} to absorb part of the polymerization shrinkage stress and to absorb shocks during function. In this study, the effect of an <b>additional</b> <b>intermediate</b> layer of a low-viscosity resin on the microrotary fatigue resistance (microRFR) of a hybrid composite bonded to dentin was evaluated. The hypotheses tested were that an {{intermediate layer}} of a low-viscosity resin (i) increases the microRFR to dentin, but (ii) {{has no effect on}} the static bond strength. Microtensile bond strength (microTBS) samples were loaded until failure or inserted in a microrotary fatigue testing device. Specimens were tested at 4 Hz until failure or until 10 (5) cycles were reached. An <b>additional</b> <b>intermediate</b> elastic layer had no effect on the static microTBS, but significantly lowered the median microRFR from 28. 4 MPa to 21. 6 MPa. However, the application of an intermediate flexible layer had, no effect on the static microTBS. In conclusion, an <b>additional</b> elastic <b>intermediate</b> layer did decrease significantly the microRFR (rejection of hypothesis i), but did not alter the microTBS (acceptance of hypothesis ii). The decrease in microRFR most likely may be explained by the lower mechanical properties of the intermediary layer. status: publishe...|$|R
