5|$|The DLM {{appeals for}} <b>administrative</b> <b>reform</b> {{in the public}} sector through a decentralization, modernization, and {{mechanization}} plan. It defends human rights and calls for the respect of public freedoms and rule of law. Listed within its platform is support for the marginalized and the abandonment of divisive particularism. The movement supports prohibiting the discrimination of the disabled.|$|E
5|$|In the Byzantine state, {{the emperor}} {{was the sole}} and {{absolute}} ruler, and his power was regarded as having divine origin. The Senate had ceased to have real political and legislative authority but remained as an honorary council with titular members. By {{the end of the}} 8th century, a civil administration focused on the court was formed as part of a large-scale consolidation of power in the capital (the rise to pre-eminence of the position of sakellarios is related to this change). The most important <b>administrative</b> <b>reform,</b> which probably started in the mid-7th century, was the creation of themes, where civil and military administration was exercised by one person, the strategos.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} year he became Home Secretary in India {{in the administration of}} Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, and in 1909 was temporarily a member of the governing council. His experience of administrative matters, including with regard to policing, proved to be useful to Curzon during the government's 1905 partition of Bengal along communal lines. So useful was his knowledge and ability that his term in India was extended for two years beyond the usual retirement age. This was to enable him to provide the summarisation, negotiation and drafting skills necessary to ensure success in <b>administrative</b> <b>reform</b> of the Provincial Councils by Curzon's successor as Viceroy, Lord Minto.|$|E

5|$|From 1514 to 1529, Thomas Wolsey (1473–1530), a {{cardinal}} {{of the established}} Church, oversaw {{domestic and foreign policy}} for the young king from his position as Lord Chancellor. Wolsey centralised the national government and extended the jurisdiction of the conciliar courts, particularly the Star Chamber. The Star Chamber's overall structure remained unchanged, but Wolsey used it to provide for much-needed reform of the criminal law. The power of the court itself did not outlive Wolsey, however, since no serious <b>administrative</b> <b>reform</b> was undertaken and its role was eventually devolved to the localities. Wolsey helped fill the gap left by Henry's declining participation in government (particularly in comparison to his father) but did so mostly by imposing himself in the King's place. His use of these courts to pursue personal grievances, and particularly to treat delinquents as if mere examples of a whole class worthy of punishment, angered the rich, who were annoyed as well by his enormous wealth and ostentatious living. Following Wolsey's downfall, Henry took full control of his government, although at court numerous complex factions continued to try to ruin and destroy each other.|$|E

25|$|Utilitarianism {{provided}} the political justification for implementation of economic liberalism by British governments, {{which was to}} dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and <b>administrative</b> <b>reform,</b> and John Stuart Mill's later writings on the subject foreshadowed the welfare state, it was mainly used as a justification for laissez faire.|$|E
25|$|Although {{relatively}} stable compared to southern Somalia, sporadic targeted assassination attempts by Al-Shabaab militants against Puntland public officials led in 2010-2011 {{to a police}} crackdown and comprehensive <b>administrative</b> <b>reform.</b> The Puntland and Galmudug administrations subsequently signed an accord in Garowe in February 2011, officially agreeing to cooperate on security, economic and social matters so as to strengthen inter-regional relations.|$|E

25|$|Municipalities {{range in}} size from Tallinn with 400,000 {{inhabitants}} to Ruhnu with as few as sixty. As over two-thirds of the municipalities have a population of under 3,000, many of them have found it advantageous to co-operate in providing services and carrying out administrative functions. There have also been calls for an <b>administrative</b> <b>reform</b> to merge smaller municipalities together.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century Spain {{undertook}} an <b>administrative</b> <b>reform</b> to increase revenues {{of the crown}} and to eliminate a number of abuses.

In 1784 Spain established four intendancy districts in Upper Peru, covering the present-day departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, Potosí, and Chuquisaca.|$|E

The town expanded and new quarters appeared (such as the current Rue Maréchal-Foch).

In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and the whole area was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed to Tver Governorate. Tver was the center of Tverskoy Uyezd.|$|E

The real growth rate in the non-oil sector rose by 5.6% from 1995 to 1997.|$|E

The Liberal party had high hopes of “the giver of constitutions,” but he {{disappointed}} his admirers by steadily rejecting every Liberal project. <b>Administrative</b> <b>reform</b> {{was the only}} reform he would promise. In his attitude to the growing national unrest in the twin duchies of Schleswig and Holstein he often seemed hesitated and half-hearted, which damaged his position there. It was not until 1846 that he clearly supported the idea of Schleswig being a Danish area.|$|E
