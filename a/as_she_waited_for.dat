5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E

60|$|Mrs Pipchin hovered {{behind the}} victim, with her sable plumage and her hooked beak, {{like a bird}} of ill-omen.

60|$|She {{loved him}} very much indeed, and he waited near her. She was a precious, remote thing to him at this time, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> her child. Her soul was glad with an ecstasy because of the coming infant. She wanted a boy: oh, very much she wanted a boy.|$|E
5000|$|The song/poem [...] "She wore {{a yellow}} ribbon" [...] has {{appeared}} in various forms {{for at least four}} centuries. It is based upon the same general theme: A woman of destiny is under some sort of test or trial <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> her beloved to return. Will she be true to him? This seems to be the lingering question and the basis for a great unfolding drama.|$|R

[...] His blankness showed for a little that he felt the chill of her cold logic; but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> his {{rejoinder}} she knew to which of them it cost most.

6000|$|... 'It is {{very well}} for us to talk in that way, father,' she answered. 'It is not your picture that hangs in the hall, or your {{coat-of-arms}} that I see upon the wall.

Her dark scornful eyes were fixed upon me <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> my reply, but her father hastened to intervene.|$|E
60|$|Princess Caremfil swept away, and the Amazonian queen {{climbed to}} her perch among the painted mountains, where her troop already sat like {{a flock of}} pigeons shining in the sun. The gilded breast-plate rose and fell with the quick beating of her heart, the spear shook with the {{trembling}} of her hand, her lips were dry, her head dizzy, and more than once, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> her cue, she was sorely tempted to run away and take the consequences.|$|E

5000|$|After the overture, {{the opera}} begins with rousing battle music {{featuring}} trumpet and drums. Handel is {{very careful to}} give both leading ladies equal opportunities; they make their entrances simultaneously and they have {{an equal number of}} arias and one duet together. Handel differentiates between the two princesses through his music; Lisaura is given melancholy and expressive music with a pensive and brooding quality, whereas the music for Rossana portrays her as scheming and spirited with some vocal writing of enormous virtuoso demands. For Paul Henry Lang, Rossana's love music in act two <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> Alessandro is [...] "Handel at his idylllic- pastoral best".|$|R
60|$|She ceased {{speaking}} and gazed heavenwards with a rapt look <b>as</b> though <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> some inspiration to fall upon her, and never, never--not {{even in the}} fires of Kor had Ayesha seemed so divine <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did now in this moment of the ripe harvest of her love.|$|R
60|$|She felt low-spirited <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> {{the food}} to arrive. The nursing of Mr. Faucitt had left her tired, and she had not slept well on the train. But the real cause of her {{depression}} {{was the fact that}} there had been a lack of enthusiasm in Gerald's greeting over the telephone just now. He had spoken listlessly, as though the fact of her returning after all these weeks was a matter of no account, and she felt hurt and perplexed.|$|E
60|$|Thus musing, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> {{his return}} in the evening, her eyes fell on her left hand. The contemplation of her own left fourth finger by symbol-loving girlhood of this age is, it seems, very frequently, if not always, {{followed}} by a peculiar train of romantic ideas. Cytherea's thoughts, still playing about her future, became directed into this romantic groove. She leant back in her chair, and taking hold of the fourth finger, which had attracted her attention, she lifted it with {{the tips of the}} others, and looked at the smooth and tapering member for a long time.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the general}} {{disposition}} of chambers Stephen ordered {{to be set}} apart for the rescued swimmer the Royal Chamber where Queen Elizabeth had lain; and for Mr. Hepburn that which had been occupied by the Second George. She {{had a sort of}} idea that the stranger was God's guest who was coming to her house; and that nothing could be too good for him. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> his coming, even though she swept to and fro in her ministrations to others, she felt as though she trod on air. Some great weight seemed to have been removed from her. Her soul was free again! ...|$|E
5000|$|When Marsden {{returned}} in December 2002, Ian Hyland of The Mirror said he disliked the [...] "smouldering" [...] sexual tension between Phil and Marsden. Jo Atkison of the Western Mail discussed the Marsden-Kate-Phil storyline, saying, [...] "Betrayal {{with a capital}} B is {{the order of the}} day in the Square this week.

To shop or not to shop is a dilemma that Kate finds hard to cope with <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> the confession that will nail Phil for good".

Before leaving for the assignment he writes a letter to his beloved, but his publisher rips it up, so she thinks he has gotten cold feet and she gets angry at him for deserting her. Meanwhile, he exposes corrupt activity inside the jail. Will his beloved ever find out the truth of why he never showed up to marry her? ...|$|R
