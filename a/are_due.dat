5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either directly or indirectly. Some epilepsies <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to a single gene defect (1–2%); most <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to trauma. In 85 {{percent of cases}} of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E

A summary of research in 2014 suggested that 11.5% of variance in therapy outcome <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to the common factor of goal consensus/collaboration, 9% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to empathy, 7.5% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to therapeutic alliance, 6.3% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to positive regard/affirmation, 5.7% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to congruence/genuineness, and 5% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to therapist factors; in contrast, treatment method accounted for roughly 1% of outcome variance.|$|R

5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) <b>are</b> <b>due</b> {{in part to}} {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different {{sequence of a gene}} (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E

The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to hypercoagulability.|$|E
