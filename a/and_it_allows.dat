5|$|State {{law allows}} for the {{incorporation}} of a community as either a city or a town; the only additional requirement to incorporate as a city is a minimum population of 3,000. Cities and towns in Arizona function largely in an identical manner, but cities are provided with additional powers that a town charter does not provide, limited primarily to certain powers regarding the regulation of utilities and construction within the city limits. State law allows adjoining towns to merge <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> a city to annex a town, {{but it does not}} allow cities to merge. Additionally, a town may change its form of government to a city upon reaching the minimum population of 3,000. There are, however, large communities that have remained incorporated as a town in spite of attaining a large population; Gilbert, with more than 200,000 residents, remains incorporated as a town.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even {{more useful to}} humans. It {{makes it possible to}} store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E
5|$|While no new locales were {{introduced}} in Episode One, large alterations {{were made to the}} appearance of both City 17 where the game takes place and the Citadel from the end of Half-Life 2 to reflect the changing shape of the world and remind the player that their actions have major effects on the story line. The Citadel has degenerated from the cold, alien, and imposing fortress of the previous game into an extremely unstable state. This provides a visual cue to the player of the catastrophic damage they inflicted, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> for the introduction of new gameplay elements that accentuate the dangers which come with the Citadel's imminent collapse. In addition, it serves a thematic purpose by highlighting the weakening of the Combine's dominance in City 17. Likewise, City 17 has been altered to reflect the aftermath of the resistance's open rebellion, with vast swathes of destroyed buildings, and the introduction of foes previously kept outside its confines in Half-Life 2 to emphasize the scale of the uprising.|$|E

25|$|The {{internet}} has influenced sexual orientation in two ways: it {{is a common}} mode of discourse on the subject of sexual orientation and sexual identity, and therefore shapes popular conceptions; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> anonymous attainment of sexual partners, as well as facilitates communication and connection between greater numbers of people.|$|E
5000|$|The use of [...] "rings" [...] had two advantages: <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> {{the larger}} bullet to {{confidently}} remain subcritical (the hollow column served {{to keep the}} material from having too much contact with other material), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> sub-critical assemblies to be tested using the same bullet but with just one ring.|$|R
5000|$|Swordsman: The crews {{skill in}} mêlée {{measured}} with a number (+1, +3 etc.). It translates as extra damage in boardings, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> the crew to attach swordsman school attachment cards. All captains had some level of Swordsmanship.|$|R

The IQAF also acts as a support force for the Iraqi Navy and the Iraqi Army <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> Iraq to rapidly deploy its developing Army.|$|E
25|$|Josh {{connects with}} his half-sister, Bianca Montgomery, whom he loves, {{but is not}} above using {{to get what he}} wants; however this {{characteristic}} does not faze Bianca, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> her to share with her older half-brother that her girlfriend, Maggie Stone, cheated on her while they were in Paris. Like most everyone else in the Kane-Montgomery family, Josh proves to be extremely protective of Bianca, especially where her happiness is concerned and is acrimonious towards Zarf/Zoe, whom he thinks would hurt Bianca.|$|E
25|$|Green Day: Rock Band is a 2010 {{music video}} game {{developed}} by Harmonix, published by MTV Games and distributed by Electronic Arts. It {{is the fifth}} major console release in the Rock Band music video game series <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> players to simulate the playing of rock music by using controllers shaped like musical instruments.

25|$|LNG {{facilities}} provide {{delivery capacity}} during peak periods when market demand exceeds pipeline deliverability. LNG storage tanks possess {{a number of}} advantages over underground storage. As a liquid at approximately −163°C (−260°F), it occupies about 600 times less space than gas stored underground, and it provides high deliverability at very short notice because LNG storage facilities are generally located close to market and can be trucked to some customers avoiding pipeline tolls. There is no requirement for cushion gas <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> access to a global supply. LNG facilities are, however, more expensive to build and maintain than developing new underground storage facilities.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is {{a highly}} {{selective}} semipermeable membrane barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). The blood–brain barrier is formed by brain endothelial cells <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function. Furthermore, it prevents the entry of lipophilic potential neurotoxins by way of an active transport mechanism mediated by P-glycoprotein. Astrocytes have been claimed to be necessary to create the blood–brain barrier. A few regions in the brain, including the circumventricular organs, do not have a blood–brain barrier.|$|E
25|$|A {{person who}} is troubled by {{experiencing}} situational anorgasmia {{should be encouraged to}} explore alone and with his or her partner those factors that may affect whether or not he or she is orgasmic, such as fatigue, emotional concerns, feeling pressured to have sex when he or she is not interested, or a partner's sexual dysfunction. In the relatively common case of female situational anorgasmia during penile-vaginal intercourse, some sex therapists recommend that couples incorporate manual or vibrator stimulation during intercourse, or using the female-above position as it may allow for greater stimulation of the clitoris by the penis or pubic symphysis or both, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the woman better control of movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{sponsorship}} of Masterpiece Theatre in 1971 {{was a major}} public relations success for Mobil, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> Schmertz, as an underwriter for the show, to build relations with various artists and media executives, even those opposed to Mobil's views.|$|R

25|$|The {{catheter}} {{is itself}} {{designed to be}} radiodense for visibility <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> a clear, watery, blood compatible radiocontrast agent, commonly called an X-ray dye, to be selectively injected and mixed with the blood flowing within the artery. Typically 3–8 cc of the radiocontrast agent is injected for each image to make the blood flow visible for about 3–5 seconds as the radiocontrast agent is rapidly washed away into the coronary capillaries and then coronary veins. Without the X-ray dye injection, the blood and surrounding heart tissues appear, on X-ray, as only a mildly-shape-changing, otherwise uniform water density mass; no details of the blood and internal organ structure are discernible. The radiocontrast within the blood allows visualization of the blood flow within the arteries or heart chambers, depending on where it is injected.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

500|$|Positive {{pressure}} ventilation, {{in which}} air is {{forced into the}} lungs, is needed when oxygenation is significantly impaired. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), {{may be used to}} improve oxygenation and treat atelectasis: air is blown into the airways at a prescribed pressure via a face mask. Noninvasive ventilation has advantages over invasive methods because it does not carry the risk of infection that intubation does, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> normal coughing, swallowing, and speech. However, the technique may cause complications; [...] it may force air into the stomach or cause aspiration of stomach contents, especially when level of consciousness is decreased.|$|E
500|$|She {{just sort}} of sits there with her {{cigarette}} and her hair, and she would pull stuff— these very disparate elements— and put them together into this ensemble, and you'd go, [...] "Come on, Pat, you can't wear that with that."

[...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, but it works on so many different levels— <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> you to figure out who the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You look at it and you go, [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E
500|$|Jamey Giddens of {{the soap}} opera website Daytime Confidential {{characterized}} Steffy as [...] "bitch-nasty", while Wood has described her as strong-willed and a vixen. The program's website said that Steffy is a [...] "stunning fashionista" [...] and a [...] "provocative trendsetter", and added that [...] "when it comes to Steffy Forrester, things are never as they seem. On the surface she’s sexy, stylish, clever, and together but below the surface, Ridge and Taylor's only surviving daughter is emotionally starved and slowly learning how to love and be loved". By 2011, Wood described Steffy as a [...] "rich bitch" [...] and stated, [...] "I love playing her and developing her character. She is so different from me. It's rather cathartic, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> my alter ego {{to come out on}} The Bold and The Beautiful set five days a week."
