40|$|Most {{designers}} of object-based languages adopt a reference model of variables without explicit justification, despite its wide ranging consequences. This paper {{argues that the}} traditional container model of variables is more efficient than the reference model, nearly as flexible, and more appropriate to parallel and distributed systems. The topics addressed are object lifetime <b>and</b> its <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> storage management, dynamic typing <b>and</b> its <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> object representation, aliasing <b>and</b> its <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> interference between operations, parameter passing <b>and</b> its <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> communication, <b>and</b> sharing <b>and</b> its <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> contention. We present our experience with the container model in a prototype parallel language. Neither model is always better than the other, and the choice of model should not be left to default.

25|$|The study Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions <b>and</b> <b>Implications</b> <b>for</b> Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude (2014) {{identified}} neural correlations {{to specific}} social emotions (e.g. envy and embarrassment) {{as a measure}} of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for the emotion of Envy (the feeling of displeasure at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person’s self-concept was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class snobbery. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and Schadenfreude (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the insular lobe, and with increased activity in the striate nucleus; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of empathy (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).|$|E

25|$|Subtitle E {{concerns}} jumbo rules concerning escrow {{and settlement}} procedures {{for people who}} are in trouble repaying their mortgages, and also makes amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974. In general, in connection with a residential mortgage there should be an established escrow or impound account for the payment of taxes, hazard insurance, and (if applicable) flood insurance, mortgage insurance, ground rents, and any other required periodic payments. Lender shall disclose to borrower at least three business days before closing the specifics of the amount required to be in the escrow account and the subsequent uses of the funds. If an escrow, impound, or trust account is not established, or the consumer chooses to close the account, the servicer shall provide a timely and clearly written disclosure to the consumer that advises the consumer of the responsibilities of the consumer <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> the consumer {{in the absence of any}} such account. The amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (or RESPA) change how a Mortgage servicer (those who administer loans held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) should interact with consumers.|$|E

500|$|Weisman's thought {{experiment}} pursues two themes: how nature {{would react}} to the disappearance of humans and what legacy humans would leave behind. To foresee how other life could continue without humans, Weisman reports from areas where the natural environment exists with little human intervention, like the Białowieża Forest, the Kingman Reef, and the Palmyra Atoll. He interviews biologist E. O. Wilson and visits {{with members of the}} Korean Federation for Environmental Movement at the Korean Demilitarized Zone where few humans have penetrated since 1953. He tries to conceive how life may evolve by describing the past evolution of pre-historic plants and animals, but notes Douglas Erwin's warning that [...] "we can't predict what the world will be 5 million years later by looking at the survivors". Several chapters are dedicated to megafauna, which Weisman predicts would proliferate. He profiles soil samples from the past 200 years and extrapolates concentrations of heavy metals and foreign substances into a future without industrial inputs. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere <b>and</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> climatic change are likewise examined.|$|E
