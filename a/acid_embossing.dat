40|$|This {{research}} {{is situated in}} a space between the broad fields of art-glass design, art, science and the technology of alternative photographic printing processes. It is an experimental project with a core research question. ‘Can photosensitive glass be made more accessible to artists working in art-glass, design or art practice’?The focus of this {{research is}} located in the almost forgotten niche of ‘photosensitive’ glass. ‘Photo-sensitive and photo-chromic glasses contain ultraviolet light-sensitive metals, gold, silver or copper. The selective development of color can be controlled by placing a mask or photographic film in contact with the glass. When exposed to ultraviolet radiation, then heated, the glass changes from clear to opal, reproducing the pattern on the glass. The image developed is permanent and will not fade as would a similar image in photo-chromic glass. ’ (Kohler 1998, 23 - 24). Glass: An Artist’s Medium. Section 2. Properties of Glass. Iola, WI 54990 - 001. USA: Krause Publications. Through systematic experimentation, the methods indicating how photosensitive glass can be incorporated into selected traditional glass-making techniques have been identified. Traditional glass making techniques include: o Pulling of molten glass from a glass furnace to make stringers, canes, rods, murrine and/or mosaics a hot glass technique. o Crushing and recycling, making chunk de verre and pate de verre, a warm glass technique. o Bead-making, button-making and core-forming, all hot glass techniques. o Kiln work in the form of kiln casting/slumping and simple open-face Pate de Verre, a warm glass technique. o The casting of molten glass from the glass furnace into sand for sandcasting and the forcing of hot molten glass into moulds are hot glass techniques. o Free-blowing and mould blowing, hot glass techniques. o Acid etching and <b>acid</b> <b>embossing,</b> particularly hazardous cold glass techniques are only discussed not attempted. These selected techniques are presented as case studies that have been analysed and the experiments documented to identify methods and processes that demonstrate the potential of photosensitive glass as an art medium. The details of successful experimentation are fully documented according to a laboratory processes, formulae and colour analysis. This extensive research material will hopefully enable designers and glass artists to extend their creative practices and when using the outcomes to develop hybrid and innovative processes {{in a wide range of}} contemporary studio based and commercial applications. The research outcomes of this enquiry into the use of photosensitive glass in creative glass processes represent an extensive and original contribution to knowledge that I hope will be shared by studio artists and commercial glass professionals in art and design...|$|E
40|$|From its beginnings, up to a {{few years}} ago, {{additive}} manufacturing technology was able to produce models or prototypes which have limited use, because of materials mechanical properties. With advancement and invention of new materials, this is changing. Now, {{it is possible to}} create 3 D prints that can be used as final products or functional tools, using technology and materials with low environmental impact. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine opportunities for production of paper embossing tools by fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3 D printing. This study emphasises the use of environmentally friendly poly-lactic acid (PLA) materials in FDM technology, contrary to the conventional method using metal alloys and <b>acids.</b> <b>Embossing</b> of line elements and letters using 3 D printed embossing tools was done on six different types of paper. Embossing force was applied using SHIMADZU EZ-LX Compact Tabletop Testing Machine. Each type of paper was repeatedly embossed using different values of embossing force (in 250 N increments, starting at 1000 N) to determine the optimal embossing force for each specific paper type. When determined, the optimal embossing force was used on ten samples for each paper type. Results of embossing were analysed and evaluated. The analysis consisted of investigating the effects of the applied embossing force and characteristics such as paper basis weight, paper structure, surface characteristic and fibre direction of the paper. Results show that paper characteristics determine the embossing force required for achieving a good embossing result. This means that with the right amount of embossing force, letters and borderlines can be equally well formed by the embossing process regardless of paper weight, surface characteristics, etc. Embossing tools produced in this manner can be used in case of the embossing elements that are not complex. The reason for this is the limitation of FDM technology and lack of precision needed for fine details. However, if the form is simple enough, results of pleasing quality can easily be achieved...|$|R
