5|$|Al-Biruni (973–1048) {{measured}} the {{radius of the}} earth using a new method. It involved observing {{the height of a}} mountain at Nandana (now in Pakistan). Al-Idrisi (1100–1166) created <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world for Roger, the Norman King of Sicily. He also wrote the Book of Roger, a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time. The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis (c. 1470–1553) made <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use of maps from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and perhaps one made by Christopher Columbus. He was part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.|$|E

5|$|By 1948, Croatia and Serbia {{agreed on}} two {{modifications}} of the border—the village of Bapska {{was transferred to}} Croatia, while Jamena {{was turned over to}} Vojvodina. No further changes to the border were agreed upon. <b>A</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area issued by the Yugoslav People's Army Military-Geographic Institute in 1967 depicts the border along the cadastre-based boundary, corresponding to the Croatian claim in the dispute.|$|E

5|$|The {{architect}} Jean-Nicolas Huyot gave {{very precise}} instructions to this section. Of wide-ranging experience formed in Asia Minor and Egypt {{and under the}} influence of engineers, he asked them to keep an authentic diary of their excavations where precision measurements read off watches and compasses should be written down, to draw <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region they travelled, and to describe the layout of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|Working {{alongside}} Gemma whilst {{they were}} producing the globes, Mercator would {{have witnessed the}} process of progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and collating their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and seamen. He put his newly learned talents {{to work in a}} burst of productivity. In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.|$|E
5|$|Yuan Hsieh (d. +1220) was Director-General of {{governmental}} grain stores. In pursuance of his schemes for {{the relief of}} famines he issued orders that each pao (village) should prepare a map which would show the fields and mountains, the rivers and the roads in fullest detail. The maps of all the pao were joined together to make <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tu (larger district), and these in turn were joined with others to make <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hsiang and the hsien (still larger districts).

5|$|A British touring {{production}} of South Pacific {{opened at the}} Blackpool Grand Theatre on August 28, 2007. The tour ended at the Cardiff New Theatre on July 19, 2008. It starred Helena Blackman as Nellie and Dave Willetts as Emile. Julian Woolford directed, with choreography by Chris Hocking. This production was most noted for its staging of the overture, which charted Nellie's journey from Little Rock, Arkansas, to the South Pacific. On entering the theatre, the audience first saw <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S., not the theater of war.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} artwork is {{displayed}} on {{the exterior of the}} building. Sculptor Leo Friedlander used Vermont marble for the large relief sculptures {{on both sides of the}} main entrance. One sculpture depicts Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and Sacagawea, with a map of their expedition's route on the reverse (Lewis and Clark); the other (Covered Wagon) shows pioneers and a covered wagon, with <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Trail on the reverse. Additionally, Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior, and a metal sculpture by Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance. Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building's main entrance, three on the inside and three on the outside.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the bicentennial}} celebration of the battle, in 2015 Belgium minted a 2 Euro coin {{depicting}} the Lion monument over <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field of battle. France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros. A 10 Euro coin, showing Wellington, Blücher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 Euros.|$|E

5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, shows it {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This {{is confirmed by}} <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and disconnected from the water at its northeastern terminus by {{the construction of the}} former City Electric Power Plant on new land.|$|E
5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, {{in the case}} of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth. The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E
5|$|In 1786 {{he married}} his wife, Mary, the second {{daughter}} of William Smith {{with whom he}} had four sons. In the year following his marriage, Williams bought his father's house near the Potomac River and dedicated himself to improving the farm and laying out the town of Williamsport, Maryland, which was named in his honor. Williams wanted the capital of the United States to be located in Williamsport and wrote a letter to Washington to that effect on November 1, 1790 enclosing <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century Pedro Montañés {{passed through}} the site and left {{graffiti}} with his name and the year 1752. Archives have revealed {{that he was a}} Spanish captain who visited the site on 14 August of that year. La Blanca was first documented {{in the early years of}} the 20th century. In 1905 explorer Teoberto Maler identified visible architecture at the site and marked it as El Castillito on <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region. Raymond E. Merwin visited La Blanca in 1913 on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. He photographed the site and renamed it as Chac-Ha. At this time the site appears to have been covered in dense vegetation, making exploration of the ruins difficult and resulting in only a brief description of the acropolis.|$|E
5|$|Like most shooter games, first-person {{shooters}} involve an avatar, {{one or more}} ranged weapons, and a varying {{number of}} enemies. Because they {{take place in a}} 3D environment, these games tend to be somewhat more realistic than 2D shooter games, and have more accurate representations of gravity, lighting, sound and collisions. First-person shooters played on personal computers are most often controlled with a combination of a keyboard and mouse. This system has been claimed as superior to that found in console games, which frequently use two analog sticks: one used for running and sidestepping, the other for looking and aiming. It is common to display the character's hands and weaponry in the main view, with a head-up display showing health, ammunition and location details. Often, it is possible to overlay <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area.|$|E
