Msi 1 binds to the 3 ′-UTR of its target mRNAs in NS/PCs, prevents their translation, and interferes with NS/PC differentiation. We previously showed that Msi 1 competes with eIF 4 G to bind poly(A) -binding protein and inhibits assembly of the 80 S ribosome. Here we show that Msi 1 works in concert with Lin 28 to regulate post-transcriptional microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis in the cropping step, which occurs in the nucleus. Lin 28 and its binding partner terminal uridylyltransferase 4 (TUT 4) are known to maintain embryonic stem cell pluripotency by blocking let- 7 miRNA biogenesis at the dicing step. Interestingly, we found that during early neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells, Msi 1 enhanced the localization of Lin 28 to the nucleus and also inhibited the nuclear cropping step of another let- 7 family miRNA, miR 98. These results suggest that Msi 1 can influence stem cell maintenance and differentiation by controlling the subcellular localization of proteins involved <b>in</b> miRNA biogenesis, <b>as</b> well as by regulating the translation of its target mRNA...|$|R

40|$|SummaryTo {{meet the}} extreme oxygen demand of insect flight muscle, {{tracheal}} (respiratory) tubes ramify {{not only on}} its surface, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>tissues,</b> but also within T-tubules and ultimately surrounding every mitochondrion. Although this remarkable physiological specialization has long been recognized, its cellular and molecular basis is unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila tracheoles invade flight muscle T-tubules through transient surface openings. Like other tracheal branching events, invasion requires the Branchless FGF pathway. However, localization of the FGF chemoattractant changes from all muscle membranes to T-tubules as invasion begins. Core regulators of epithelial basolateral membrane identity localize to T-tubules, and knockdown of AP- 1 γ, required for basolateral trafficking, redirects FGF from T-tubules to surface, increasing tracheal surface ramification and preventing invasion. We propose that tracheal invasion is controlled by an AP- 1 -dependent switch in FGF trafficking. Thus, subcellular targeting of a chemoattractant can direct outgrowth to specific domains, including inside the cell...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Inflammation is an stereotypical {{response}} to tissue damage {{and has been}} extensively documented in experimental and clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), including children. DISCUSSION: The initiation and orchestration of inflammation in TBI, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>tissues,</b> is complex and multifactorial encompassing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, complement factors, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and other undefined factors. It is evident that inflammation can have both beneficial and detrimental effects in TBI, but the mechanisms underlying this dichotomy are mostly unknown. Modification of the inflammatory response may be neuroprotective. Monitoring inflammation is now possible with techniques such as microdialysis; however, the prognostic value of measuring inflammatory mediators in TBI is still unclear with conflicting reports. Except for corticosteroids, no anti-inflammatory agents have been tested in TBI, and the negative results with these may have been flawed by their multiple side effects. Clinical trials with anti-inflammatory agents that target multiple or central and downstream pathways are warranted in adult and pediatric TBI.

The leech Helobdella robusta is an experimentally tractable annelid representative, which makes segments in anteroposterior progression from a posterior growth zone consisting of 10 identified stem cells. In vertebrates and some arthropods, Notch signaling is required for normal segmentation and functions via regulation of hes-class genes. We have previously characterized the expression of an hes-class gene (Hro-hes) during segmentation in Helobdella, and here, we characterize the expression of an H. robusta notch homolog (Hro-notch) during this process.
