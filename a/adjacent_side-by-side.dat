40|$|Acute {{transmural}} &hernia {{is expressed}} {{on the surface}} ECG as ST segment elevation. Underlying electrophysio-logical changes include depolarization of the resting mem-brane potential and shortening of the action potential in the ischemic area [l]. The differences between ischemic and non-ischemic cells create extracellular current which causes the potential differences in the extracellular space leading {{to changes in the}} electrocardiogram on the epicardial surface (Fig. 1). In the (isolated) pig heart {{it has been suggested that}} particularly current flow parallel to the epicardial surface (i. e. between <b>adjacent</b> <b>side-by-side</b> is-chemic and non-ischemic areas) accounts for the observed ECG changes [I]. On the other hand, it is also well known that electrophysiological changes evoked by ischemia (or ischemic components) are more pronounced in epicardia...|$|E
40|$|Introducing a {{new method}} to {{visualize}} large stretches of genomic DNA (see Appendix S 1) the article reports that most GA-sequences [1] shared chains of tetra-GA-motifs and contained upstream poly(A) -segments. Although not integral parts of them, Alu-elements were found immediately upstream {{of all human}} and chimpanzee GA-sequences with an upstream poly(A) -segment. The article hypothesizes that genome navigation uses these properties of GA-sequences in the following way. (1) Poly(A) binding proteins interact with the upstream poly(A) -segments and arrange <b>adjacent</b> GA-sequences <b>side-by-side</b> (‘GA-ribbon’), while folding the intervening DNA sequences between them into loops (‘associated DNA-loops’). (2) Genome navigation uses the GA-ribbon as a search path for specific target genes that is up to 730 -fold shorter than the full-length chromosome. (3) As to the specificity of the search, each molecule of a target protein is assumed to catalyze the formation of specific oligomers from a set of transcription factors that recognize tetra-GA-motifs. Their specific combinations of tetra-GA motifs {{are assumed to be}} present in the particular GA-sequence whose associated loop contains the gene for the target protein. As long as the target protein is abundant in the cell it produces sufficient numbers of such oligomers which bind to their specific GA-sequences and, thereby, inhibit locally the transcription of the target protein in the associated loop. However, if the amount of target protein drops below a certain threshold, the resultant reduction of specific oligomers leaves the corresponding GA-sequence ‘denuded’. In response, the associated DNA-loop releases it...|$|R
40|$|Understanding and {{controlling}} carrier transport and recombination dynamics in colloidal quantum dot (QD) films {{is key to}} their application in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Towards this end, we have conducted transient photocurrent measurements (10 - 50 ps time resolution) to monitor charge-transport dynamics in lead selenide QD films {{as a function of}} pump fluence, temperature, electrical bias, and surface treatment [1, 2]. Room temperature dynamics reveal two distinct timescales: one sub-nanosecond and the other, tens-to-hundreds of nanoseconds. The first of these processes is assigned to relaxation of one type of carriers (presumably, electrons) into low-mobility intra-gap states, which pins the corresponding quasi-Fermi level at below band-edge energies [3]. This effect is likely responsible for a considerable photovoltage deficit typical of QD PVs. A longer-time transient photocurrent exhibits memory-less decay due to nongeminate recombination of the remaining mobile charges with the trapped carriers of the opposite sign (pre-existing and photogenerated). In addition to potentially modifying the chemical nature and/or abundance of trapping sites, application of different QD surface treatments also alters the initial (“dark”) occupancy of intra-gap states, which has a profound effect on mobile-carrier lifetimes. The peak photoconductance observed immediately after short-pulse excitation is temperature-independent suggesting a tunnelling mechanism of early time phototransport. Further, low temperature measurements reveal an important role of the excitonic fine structure and, specifically, the electron-hole exchange interaction (exchange blockade) in early time photocurrent dynamics. This effect is likely universal as it necessarily arises following photoexcitation when an electron and a hole are generated in the same QD and hence are strongly coupled by the exchange interaction, which creates a barrier to their separation between <b>adjacent</b> QDs. Finally, <b>side-by-side</b> comparison of photocurrent transients using excitation with low- and high-photon energies (1. 5 vs. 3. 0 eV) reveals clear signatures of carrier multiplication (CM), that is, generation of multiple excitons by single photons [2]. Based on photocurrent measurements of QD solids and optical measurements of solution based samples, we conclude that the CM efficiency is unaffected by inter-dot coupling, and therefore, the results of previous numerous spectroscopic CM studies conducted on dilute QD suspensions should, in principle, be reproducible in electronically coupled QD films used in devices. 1.
