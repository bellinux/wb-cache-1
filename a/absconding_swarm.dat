40|$|Red-throated Caracaras are enigmatic {{but seldom}} studied raptors of {{tropical}} American forests. They {{are known to}} prey on social wasps and exhibit cooperative breeding, but little quantitative data have been published. We investigated Red-throated Caracara nesting, predation and social behaviour {{in the field in}} French Guiana from 2008 to 2013. We closely studied two nests with automated camera systems and found a high level of cooperative behaviour among adults tending nests. Seven individuals were involved in bring prey to and guarding a nest in 2009. Our observations of caracaras nesting in bromeliads confirmed that the majority of their diet was comprised of the brood of social wasps, although they also brought millipedes and fruits to the nest. The social behaviour of the caracaras included intense territorial behaviour, including specific vocalizations and displays in response to conspecifics or playback of caracara calls. Caracaras also attacked conspecific decoys, and we observed them attacking members of other groups on two occasions in 2011. The caracaras provided their chicks with nests of a diverse assortment of wasp genera, including Polybia, Pseudopolybia, Leipomeles, Apoica and Parachartergus, and the proportional abundance of these taxa is not congruent with published studies on generic abundances. In addition, while army ants had previously been considered top predators of social wasps, we calculated that the caracaras, as specialist predators, could rival or exceed army ants as a mortality factor for social wasps. It had been hypothesized that these caracaras rely on a powerful chemical repellent to protect themselves from the stings of their defensive prey, but we found no evidence of such a repellent. We used a video recording arena to observe caracara predation behaviour on nests of various species of Polybia. We observed that the caracaras are indeed stung by some species of wasps, but the caracaras mount high-speed aerial strikes against such nests, knocking them to the ground or striking them repeatedly until the adult wasps depart in an <b>absconding</b> <b>swarm.</b> The caracaras exploit this absconding response when attacking highly defensive wasp species in order to minimize stings while obtaining the wasp brood...|$|E
2500|$|The genus Ropalidia {{is unique}} because it {{contains}} both independent and swarm-founding species. R. romandi is a swarm founding species, meaning that new nests are founded by {{a large group of}} workers with a smaller number of inseminated females (egg-laying queens). There are two different types of swarms: reproductive and <b>absconding.</b> A reproductive <b>swarm</b> is made up of some females of an already established colony, who depart to form a new colony with a group of workers. On the other hand, <b>absconding</b> <b>swarms,</b> a continuation of the existing colony, are made up of all the members of a colony. R. romandi is thought to utilize both forms of swarming, however, not much is known about reproductive swarming in Ropalidia [...] and most research on R. romandi has been on <b>absconding</b> <b>swarms.</b> It has been found that R. romandi will abscond if their nest is destroyed, damaged, or continually disturbed.|$|R
40|$|The {{tropical}} paper wasp, Ropalidia (Icariola) fasciata (F.), nests on {{leaves of}} gramineous plants (Miscanthus sinensis Andus. and sugarcane) in Okinawa, {{where there are}} frequent, strong typhoons. In Taiwan and Java, where the effects of typhoons are less severe, most nests are on tree twigs. A similar difference is seen in nests of Ropalidia (I.) marginata (Lepeletier) in the Northern Mariana Islands and in India. Okinawan R. fasciata also exhibits quite flexible social behavior, low frequency of intranidal dominance behavior, construction of satellite and multiple-comb nests, <b>absconding</b> <b>swarming,</b> and initiation and development of nests in late autumn. Study of the divergence of social habits in eusocial wasps on Pacific Islands will enhance our understanding of social evolution in insects...|$|R
40|$|Cape {{honeybee}} workers show important pre-adaptations {{for social}} parasitism {{and can cause}} the dwindling colony syndrome of host colonies. Parasitic workers may drift or actively disperse into host colonies. They may also join <b>absconding</b> <b>swarms,</b> which can merge with host colonies. After transmission, parasitic workers have to establish themselves in the host, which is probably promoted by their spatial distribution, their readiness to gain trophallactic dominance {{and their ability to}} survive worker-worker aggression. Established parasitic workers have to evade egg removal by other workers in host colonies. The resulting offspring is preferentially fed, can be expected to be highly virulent and may show different behaviour in the course of infestation. It is unknownwhy and how the host queen is lost. High numbers of parasitic workers are reared until the host colony dies or absconds. This offspring can infest new host colonies, thereby completing the social parasitic life cycle...|$|R
30|$|The P. larvae {{positive}} {{sample in}} this study was from a colony in a protected area suggesting that this pathogen could be present in feral honeybee colonies. Since beekeepers in Uganda rely on natural honeybee colonies to colonize their beehives (Chemurot 2011), P. larvae could spread from feral to managed colonies. On the other hand, <b>absconding</b> and <b>swarming</b> which are common among African honeybee races (Hansen and Brodsgaard 1997) could also spread this pathogen from managed to feral colonies. However, the current predominant use of traditional and top-bar beehives (Chemurot 2011) reduces chances of this pathogen accumulating in honeybee combs since beekeepers harvest the entire comb.|$|R
