Two different methods to obtain ear canal impedances will be discussed in this article. The first one is a classic measurement technique in which a one-microphone-impedance probe is used. Different coupling techniques have been tested with regard to repeatability and measurement uncertainty. Later on, the impedance probe is tested on adults and on children.

The three allocation models varied greatly {{with respect to the}} significant predictive covariates of diarrhea incidence, geographic region, and rural setting, but other aid allocation was a positive predictor in all three models such that areas receiving health aid were likely to also receive substantial water aid and education aid.

A valid measurement requires that both the incident and diffracted beams be collected by the detector. At grazing incidence, however, the diffracted beam may spread beyond the detector due to aberrations. In addition, the diffracted beams of consecutive orders may overlap so that unambiguous efficiency measurements cannot be made. The effect of aberrations on efficiency measurements has been studied, using ray tracing, for the geometry of the measuring instrument in use at the Naval Research Laboratory. This instrument {{is attached to a}} VUV monochromator which furnishes a diverging beam. The main effect of aberrations for this instrument is a spread of the diffracted beam in the direction of dispersion. The width of the diffracted beam is wavelength dependent and is minimal at the horizontal focus, spreading to longer and shorter wavelengths. Reducing the divergence of the incident beam reduces the spread but, for small radius gratings, not always sufficiently so that the entire diffracted beam can be collected by the detector. The distance from the detector to the grating can also be <b>adjusted</b> to <b>aid</b> in collecting all the diffracted beam...|$|R

In spite of uncertainties about the time and scope of enlargement, it is not premature to start reflecting on EU structural assistance to CEECs. One reason is that all external assistance has - wanted or not - a regional impact as it is allocated to certain locations and therefore requires some decisions on priority regions and activities. Second, preaccession aid to CEECs should be designed in a way that allows a smooth switch-over from existing funds (such as PHARE) to the Structural Funds in order to facilitate accession. This means not only to <b>adjust</b> pre-accession <b>aid</b> to the Structural Funds, but may also require - in the opposite direction - to prepare the Structural Funds for the CEECs.

After summarising briefly the national development gap of the CEECs relative to the EU (section 2), a more comprehensive view will be taken on the CEECs’ regions (section 3).

40|$|Loudness {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} related to overall {{satisfaction}} with hearing aids. Individual loudness functions can reliably be measured using categorical loudness scaling (CLS) without any training. Nevertheless, the use of loudness measurement like CLS is by far less common than use of audiometric thresholds to fit hearing aids, although loudness complaints are one of the most mentioned reasons for revisiting the hearing aid dispenser. A possible reason is that loudness measurements are typically conducted with monaural narrow-band signals while binaural broad-band signals as speech or environmental sounds are typical in daily life. This study investigated individual uncomfortable loudness levels (UCL) with a focus on monaural and binaural broad-band signals, as being more realistic compared to monaural narrow-band signals. Nine normal-hearing listeners served as a reference in this experiment. Six hearing-impaired listeners with similar audiograms were aided with a simulated hearing <b>aid,</b> <b>adjusted</b> to compensate the narrow-band loudness perception back to normal. As desired, monaural narrow-band UCLs were restored to normal, however large individual deviations of more than 30 dB were found for the binaural broad-band signal.

The best possible quasi-synchronous timing of the spreading sequences has to be <b>adjusted</b> with the <b>aid</b> of accurate adaptive timing advance control, which has to be significantly more accurate than that used in the lower-bit-rate second-generation GSM system.

A deficiency of the resultant system is that the number of spreading codes exhibiting a certain IFW is limited and so is the IFW duration. This contribution sets out to mitigate the above-mentioned shortcomings so that when the users' delays are in the range of the IFW, we separate them with the aid of the unique, user-specific LAS spreading codes. By contrast, when the users roam at a high distance from the base-station and hence their received signal arrive outside the range of the IFW, we separate them using their unique frequency hopping patterns...|$|R

50|$|While {{providing}} {{financial information}} to the government is a reasonable expectation to calculate a student’s financial need, {{it does not necessarily}} follow that colleges should have access to this information. Providing that information to schools may be problematic because schools learn about students’ other sources of funding and may <b>adjust</b> their financial <b>aid</b> packages accordingly. There is an asymmetric information problem since schools have full knowledge of their customers' ability to pay while students and their families have little information about costs that colleges face to provide their services. That is, when planning for the next academic year, a school will know its current and projected costs as well as each student’s ability to pay after receiving state and federal grants. According to the Center for College Affordability and Productivity (CCAP), “If the federal or state authorities increase financial support per student, the institution has the opportunity to capture part or all of that increased ability to pay by reducing institutional grants and/or raising their charges for tuition, fees, room, or board.” Importantly, it also notes that “the exception to this general pattern is modest aid targeted at only low-income students, like the Pell grant.” The center uses data about net proceeds (tuition plus room, board and other fees) as a percentage of median income to show that financial aid practices have not been effective in decreasing prices in an effort to increase access. Net proceeds at public four-year institutions rose from 15% to 20% of median income from 1987 to 2008. In that same time, productivity has declined in the form of lighter teaching loads for professors and increased expenditures on administrative staff.|$|R

Methods: Personal and family history of AID, ID, and allergies were assessed by questionnaire and medical interview in a large cohort of 450 consecutive adult patients (206 NT 1, 106 NT 2, 138 IH) and 95 pediatric patients (80 NT 1) diagnosed according to the third International Classification of Sleep Disorders criteria in national reference centers for narcolepsy in France and 751 controls (700 adults, 51 children) from the general population. Results: Ten adults with NT 1 (4. 9 %) had a comorbid AID vs 3. 4 % of adult controls, without between-group differences in <b>adjusted</b> models. <b>AID</b> frequency did not differ between children with NT 1 and controls. Conversely, compared with controls, AID frequency was higher in adults with NT 2 (p 5 0. 002), whereas ID (p 5 0. 0002) and allergy (p 5 0. 003) frequencies were higher in adults with IH. A positive family history of AID {{was found in the}} NT 1 group and of ID in the IH group. Conclusions: NT 1 is not associated with increased risk of comorbid immune disorders, in favor of a potentially unique pathophysiology. Conversely, compared with controls, the frequency of auto-immune diseases was higher in adults with NT 2, whereas allergies and autoinflammatory disorders were more common in adults with IH, suggesting an immune dysregulation mechanism in these conditions. Neurology ® 2017; 88 : 93 – 100 GLOSSARY AID 5 autoimmune disease; BDI 5 Beck Depression Inventory; BMI 5 body mass index; CI 5 confidence interval; EDS 5 excessive daytime sleepiness; HLA 5 human leukocyte antigen; ID 5 autoinflammatory disorders; IH 5 idiopathic hyper-somnia; MSLT 5 Multiple Sleep Latency Test; NT 1 5 narcolepsy type 1; NT 2 5 narcolepsy type 2; OR 5 odds ratio; SOREMP 5 sleep-onset REM period. Narcolepsy type 1 (NT 1), formerly called narcolepsy with cataplexy, is a rare disease caused by the selective loss of hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons. 1 – 3 The mechanism of the destruction of these neurons remains unclear; however, an autoimmune process is the most probable hypothesis. Epidemiologic and clinical findings (i. e., rare family cases, frequent discordance in monozygotic twins, young and bimodal age at onset, 1, 4 and the association with the H 1 N 1 influenza pandemic and its vaccine or with streptococcal infections 5 – 8) are in favor of this hypothesis. Moreover, a tight genetic association with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II (DQB 1 * 06 : 02) 9 and more recently HLA class I haplotypes was highlighted 10, 11 as well as with other immune gene variants, such as the purinergic receptor subtype P 2 RY 11 12 and T-cell receptor a locus. 13 Several cytokines with proinflammatory properties, especially interferon-g, and antibodies against different brain antigens have been identified in NT 1...|$|R
40|$|When the United States {{established}} {{diplomatic relations}} with Mexico in 1825, various incidents had already given rise to claims of United States citizens against its southern neighbor. A number of claims dated back to 1817 and during the next three decades the disputes continued to increase and create a multiplicity of problems. The claims involved hundreds of individuals, {{millions of dollars in}} damages, and became intricately entangled in a variety of foreign affairs between the two countries. Turning to arbitration, the United States and Mexico signed a Convention on April 11, 1839. It provided that all claims based on injuries to persons and property of citizens from the United States suffered prior to the Convention should be referred to a board of four commissioners, two from each country, and <b>adjusted</b> with the <b>aid</b> of an impartial umpire. The board meet in Washington from August 25, 1840 to February 25, 1842. During this time, 109 claims were presented and a total of $ 2, 026, 139. 68 was awarded to the claimants. However, a large number of cases were left undecided by the board and over the following years new claims continued to multiply. The Mexican government failed to pay the full amount of the awards and the disputes became a source of aggravation between Mexico and the United States which was finally resolved by the Mexican War. This {{is the story of the}} claims controversy as seen through the trials and tribulations of the individuals involved, as they suffered through long delays, procrastination on the part of Mexico, and became frustrated with the political motives influencing the two governments. The claims evolved into a complex controversy that became irrevocably intertwined with the Texas boundary question. President Polk and other government officials ostentatiously cited the claims as a major cause of the war, but most of the rhetoric can be attributed to political maneuvering and diplomatic posturing. Through many attempts at arbitration, negotiations, and various agreements, the claims were eventually incorporated into the treaty of Guadalupe Hildago and settled by a new commission from 1849 - 1851...|$|R
