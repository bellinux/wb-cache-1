5|$|Lemurs are unusual among {{primates}} {{for their}} rapid dental development, {{particularly among the}} largest species. For example, indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption. By contrast, anthropoid primates exhibit slower dental development with increased size <b>and</b> <b>slower</b> morphological development. Lemurs are also dentally precocious at birth, and have their full permanent dentition at weaning.|$|E
5|$|Passenger train {{services}} {{over the}} bridge declined significantly after the Ruabon to Barmouth line via Llangollen and Dolgellau was closed in 1965, causing all traffic to take the longer <b>and</b> <b>slower</b> route from Shrewsbury via Machynlleth and Dovey Junction. The old trackbed from Morfa Mawddach railway station to Dolgellau now forms the Mawddach Trail, a walk and cycle trail.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{differences in}} articulation rate between fast <b>and</b> <b>slow</b> speakers in a production experiment. It is shown that fast <b>and</b> <b>slow</b> speakers {{differ in their}} articulation rates, {{both in terms of}} the number of phones in the canonical form (intended rate) as well as the number of phones present in the actual realization (realized rate). The articulatory precision index, which indicates the relative deletion rate, also differs for these speakers. The same differences are observed for fast <b>and</b> <b>slow</b> inter-pause stretches in a large German database of spontaneous speech. Both in the database and for the production experiment, however, there is considerable overlap between the measurements for fast <b>and</b> <b>slow</b> speakers. This shows that other factors also play a role in distinguishing fast <b>and</b> <b>slow</b> speakers or inter-pause stretches. The relationship between these factors and the articulation rates is discussed. 1...|$|R

The reader would type the BASIC program listing {{into the computer}} by hand, run it, and could save it to tape for later use.

5|$|When a male detects a female, it chases {{the female}} and begins courtship. Females are larger <b>and</b> <b>slower</b> than males, and many males will escort and intertwine around a single female. The males then align their bodies {{with the female}} and rhythmically contract; the {{resulting}} mass of snakes can remain nearly motionless for several days. After courtship, the snakes copulate for about {{an average of two}} hours.|$|E

50|$|One naming {{convention}} for process corners {{is to use}} two-letter designators, where the first letter refers to the N-channel MOSFET (NMOS) corner, and the second letter refers to the P channel (PMOS) corner. In this {{naming convention}}, three corners exist: typical, fast <b>and</b> <b>slow.</b> Fast <b>and</b> <b>slow</b> corners exhibit carrier mobilities that are higher and lower than normal, respectively. For example, a corner designated as FS denotes fast NFETs <b>and</b> <b>slow</b> PFETs.|$|R

5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster <b>and</b> <b>slower</b> moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E
5|$|Expanding on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's previous work, Congregation has more refined musical details <b>and</b> <b>slower</b> songs such as ballads. Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white {{baby in her arms}} and alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of pleasure and guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E

Clair Brothers built 10 of the consoles, the first live sound console to incorporate parametric equalisation.|$|E

Over 725,000 fin whales were reportedly taken from the Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976; as of 1997 only 38,000 survived. Recovery of the overall population size of southern species is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling <b>and</b> <b>slower</b> recovery rates.|$|E

On 15 August, the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Divisions and the 2nd Canadian (Armoured) Brigade continued the offensive, but progress remained slow. The 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy against determined German resistance and several German counter-attacks, which prevented a breakthrough to Trun. The next day, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division entered Falaise against minor opposition from Waffen SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry, and by 17 August had secured the town.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of lettuce}} {{over the centuries}} has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors. Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi <b>and</b> <b>slower</b> bolting patterns. However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E

The reason for the technological backwardness of {{the merchant}} marine were First World induced boycotts of Soviet shipping.

5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster <b>and</b> <b>slower</b> ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E
5|$|During {{its early}} development, the Norman horse, {{also known as}} the Carrossier Normand, had several {{distinct}} types: the Merlerault; the horse from the plains of Caen; the Cotentin, from the area of the same name; the horse of La Hague; and other, more minor, variations. From Alençon, the Merlerault was developed from the Thoroughbred and was very popular {{at the end of the}} Ancien Régime, which lasted until the late 18th century. It was a mid-sized type, particularly suited for riding and pulling small carriages. The Cotentin was the oldest type of Carrossier Normand from which the Anglo-Normans were in large part developed, and was also the ancestor of the Norman Cob. Intended for the luxury carriage trade, Contentin horses were larger <b>and</b> <b>slower</b> than trotting horses bred for racing. Standing , the type was almost always black in color, allowing drivers to easily form matched teams. Until 1775, Cotentin horses were unrivaled in popularity in France and some other parts of Europe as carriage horses, and remained one of the most popular carriage horse breeds in the world until the early 19th century, when they disappeared due to unchecked crossbreeding.|$|E
