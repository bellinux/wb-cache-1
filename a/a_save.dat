5|$|A sequel, Fortune Winds: Ancient Trader, was {{developed}} by Swedish studio Legendo Entertainment and released in July 2012 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Fortune Winds includes improved AI, new player avatars and <b>a</b> <b>save</b> feature. GamesMaster was unimpressed with the sequel. The magazine awarded it 69 out of 100 and commented that it deviated too much from the original indie game.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Endras of Germany led {{the tournament}} in goaltending with <b>a</b> <b>save</b> {{percentage}} of 0.961, {{and was named}} the tournament's most valuable player and top goaltender by the IIHF directorate. Russian Pavel Datsyuk was named top forward and Petteri Nummelin of Finland was selected as top defenceman. Russia's Ilya Kovalchuk was the tournament's leading scorer with 12 points.|$|E
5|$|Escaping {{the castle}} is made {{difficult}} by shadow creatures {{sent by the}} Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her {{for any length of}} time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from <b>a</b> <b>save</b> point. The player will also restart from <b>a</b> <b>save</b> point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.|$|E

The model is applied by conducting a choice experiment regarding safety-enhancing road investments that target different age groups and road user types.

5|$|Hašek played {{increasingly}} {{well for}} the Senators up until the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. During the season, he reached 300 career wins, and his GAA and save percentage were the second-best in the league. Upon departure to Turin, Hašek's equipment was accidentally left behind in Ottawa. This caused Hašek to miss a number of practices with the Czech National team. At the Winter Olympics, he injured his right adductor muscle while making <b>a</b> <b>save</b> in the first qualifying match against Germany, forcing {{him to leave the}} game after only 9 minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get <b>a</b> <b>save</b> opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Harris missed {{almost half}} of the NWSL season due to {{commitments}} with the United States women's national team at the FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada. She returned to the Spirit in late-July, appearing in a match against the Chicago Red Stars on July 25, which ended in a 1–1 draw. Harris made nine appearances for the Spirit in the regular season, allowing 12 goals and recording <b>a</b> <b>save</b> percentage of 78%.|$|E

5|$|McLeod was the {{starting}} goalkeeper in the team's league debut against the Portland Thorns on April 13, 2014. She allowed one goal, {{leading to the}} first loss of the season for the Dash. She made twenty appearances for the team during the 2014 season, starting nineteen. She ranked second in the league for number of saves with 83 and ended the season with <b>a</b> <b>save</b> percentage of 69%.|$|E
5|$|Media outlets {{have since}} {{recognised}} Trautmann's reputation, with Trautmann placed unofficially as the 19th greatest goalkeeper of all-time by the Daily Mail.

5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} {{versions of the}} game developed for the NES. The first port was handled and published by Jaleco only in Japan. Released on June 23, 1988, it featured characters redrawn in a cute art style and generally shrunken rooms. No scrolling is present, leading to rooms larger than a single screen to be displayed via flip-screens. Many of the background details are missing, and instead of <b>a</b> <b>save</b> feature an over 100 character long password is required to save progress.|$|E
5|$|Viktor Fasth of Sweden {{was named}} the tournament's most {{valuable}} player and top goaltender by the IIHF directorate.

5|$|After {{joining the}} San Francisco Giants in 1962, Pierce played {{a pivotal role}} in helping them win the NL pennant, going 120 in home games and getting a three-hit shutout and <b>a</b> <b>save</b> in a three-game playoff against the Los Angeles Dodgers to clinch the title. His 1,999 career strikeouts were the fifth most by a {{left-hander}} when he retired, and his AL total of 1,842 ranked ninth in league history. He also ranked tenth among left-handers in career wins (211), sixth in games started (432) and games pitched (585), eighth in shutouts (38) and ninth in innings pitched (3,306⅔). He holds the White Sox franchise record for career strikeouts (1,796), and his club marks of 186 wins, 2,931 innings and 390 starts are team records for a left-hander. The White Sox retired his number 19 in 1987, and unveiled a statue in his honor at U.S. Cellular Field in 2007; he was selected to the White Sox All-Century Team in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Although born in England, Boucaud qualifies to {{play for}} Trinidad and Tobago through his parents, with his father born in Port of Spain and his mother born in Princes Town. Aged 19, his {{international}} debut came as a 61st-minute substitute in a 2–0 friendly victory over Iraq at the Hawthorns on 23 May 2004. A week later, he played in a 4–1 away defeat against Scotland on 30 May 2004, in which he forced goalkeeper Craig Gordon into making <b>a</b> <b>save</b> from a powerful shot. His first start for Trinidad was in a 3–0 home defeat to Northern Ireland on 6 June 2004. He played in three 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers for Trinidad, playing against Saint Kitts and Nevis once and Mexico twice.|$|E

The club reached {{and won the}} League Cup Final, though Young, who had played {{in all but one}} of the preceding rounds, was left out of the team for the final. A second final followed a month later, this time in European competition in the form of the European Cup Winners' Cup. City faced Polish club Górnik Zabrze in the final, held at Prater Stadium in Vienna. Young scored the opening goal, from a rebound after <b>a</b> <b>save</b> by Hubert Kostka. Shortly before half-time Young was fouled in the penalty area by Kostka, and Francis Lee scored the resulting penalty. City won the match 2–1 to become the first English team to win a European and domestic trophy within the same season.|$|E
5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people {{sitting in front of}} the game, finding that they would {{converse}} with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included <b>a</b> <b>save</b> system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E
5|$|D is {{a horror}} themed {{interactive}} movie and adventure game developed by WARP {{and directed by}} Kenji Eno. It is the first entry in the D series and was first published by Panasonic for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1995, later being ported to the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and MS-DOS. The story follows Laura Harris as she goes to investigate a hospital after learning her father went on a mass murdering spree and barricaded himself inside. The hospital morphs into a castle upon her arrival, which she must explore to find her father. The player controls Laura through computer generated full motion video (FMV) sequences, and must complete the game within two hours without <b>a</b> <b>save</b> or pause function.|$|E
