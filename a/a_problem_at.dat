5|$|Crime {{continued}} to be <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> the Anacostia Station late into {{the first decade of}} the 21st century. Assaults and shootings were more frequent at the station than at any other station in the transit system. There were 32 robberies at the station in 2007. Although Anacostia was one of the 10 Metro stations with the highest crime rate in 2007 (and the only such station on the list inside the District of Columbia), no auto thefts or auto break-ins were reported at the station that year. To help deter crime, Metro installed outdoor security cameras at all 10 high-crime Metrorail stations in July 2008. In September 2008, Metro Transit Police stepped up their visibility and presence at all stations with high student ridership, including Anacostia.|$|E

The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large Lore Lindu and Bogani Nani Wartabone National Parks are within its range, but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas, and human encroachment is also <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> Lore Lindu. The rail has been trapped for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators. A 2007 survey of protected areas of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves.|$|E

While some drivers came into the pit lane for their first regular stop as early as lap 13, the top runners stayed out until lap 37, when Vettel {{was the first to}} come in, followed by Rosberg and Hamilton one lap later respectively. Following the stops, Hamilton led Rosberg by seven seconds. Max Verstappen dropped down the order when <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> the rear of the car caused him to be stationary for 31 seconds during his stop on lap 30. Fernando Alonso, who had been running in ninth place, retired from the race with a gearbox failure on lap 43. By lap 45, Hamilton had extended his lead to ten seconds, while Rosberg remained two seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her disappearance, {{according}} to her friends, Carol was feeling depressed. She had talked of tracing her biological parents, as she was adopted. On 17 July 1976, she went missing. Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man, and Carol had left their home in Leece twice before. It was for this reason, Gordon claimed, {{that he did not}} report her missing for six weeks. Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays. Gordon claimed that it wasn't until she didn't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in September (the start of the school term) that he realised that there was <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>At</b> this time he reported her missing via his solicitor, and her family was informed. On the day she vanished, the family had been due to visit Blackpool on a day trip. However, Carol said she felt unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed. She was never seen alive again by her family. Gordon claimed he returned home to find Carol had left the house, leaving behind her wedding ring, {{and that there was no}} sign of a struggle. A missing persons enquiry was launched, but nothing came of it. This missing persons report was subsequently lost, and it was implied by some that it was because both Gordon and a senior police commander (who, by the time the article was published, had died) involved in the case were freemasons. This was rebutted by Sandra Lean, who, in No Smoke, claimed that Gordon had never been a freemason. At the time, police told Gordon that, should a body be found, he would be the main suspect.|$|E

Burbank's City Manager, Mike Flad, estimated the city's 2009–10 fiscal budget will suffer a 5% shortfall. For the city's 2010–11 fiscal year, the city projected a deficit of $5.8 million and projected the deficit will remain <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> least until 2014–15, when it is projected to be $6.9 million.

25|$|The main disadvantage, {{like the}} clutch braking system, is that {{steering}} dissipates heat through the brakes. Unlike the clutched system, however, {{in this case}} all turning requires braking. This {{can be used on}} lighter tanks, but the amount of kinetic energy in larger tanks makes the required brakes impractically large. Another disadvantage is that the differential will allow the tracks to turn at different speeds no matter what the cause may be. This may be the application of braking, but also occurs as the tank travels over terrain; if one side of the tank enters softer terrain and slows down, the tank will naturally turn towards that side. Forward momentum tends to offset this effect, so it is mainly <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> low speeds.|$|E

25|$|Algorithms {{are usually}} {{discussed}} {{with the assumption}} that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An algorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to parallel algorithms or distributed algorithms. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a network. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms, and are called inherently serial problems.|$|E
25|$|Gardermoen has had {{considerable}} problems with fog and freezing rain, and has several times had a complete close-down. This was also <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> Fornebu, and {{reported to be}} at Hurum as well. On average there is super cooled rain three times per month during the winter. The use of deicing fluids is restricted since the area underneath the airport contains the Tandrum Delta, one of the country's largest uncontained quaternary aquifers (underground water systems). On 14 December 1998, a combination of freezing fog and supercooled rain caused glaze at Gardermoen. At least twenty aircraft engines were damaged by ice during take-off, and five aircraft needed to make precautionary landings with only one working engine. On 18 January 2006, an Infratek deicing system was set up, that uses infrared heat in large hangar tents. It was hoped that it could reduce chemical deicers by 90%, but the technique has proved unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|CBS did {{not believe}} that KKR would sell WTVJ to another network, so it {{returned}} with a very low offer. KKR turned CBS's offer down almost out of hand and then approached the other networks. ABC was not interested, since it was more than satisfied with its longtime affiliate, WPLG. However, NBC was very interested because its longtime affiliate, WSVN, heavily preempted the network's daytime lineup—including programs that the network aired in the noon timeslot in favor of running a local newscast, as well as an occasional prime time show. NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than CBS and ABC at the time, and was particularly annoyed at losing valuable advertising in such a fast-growing market. This had not been <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> first since most of the programs that were preempted by WSVN aired on West Palm Beach-based WPTV, which provided at least grade B signal coverage to nearly the entire Miami-Fort Lauderdale market, and had been available on cable in the area for decades. In the few cases where WPTV and WSVN both turned down an NBC program, the network usually arranged for other stations in the area to carry its programming. However, by 1985, WPTV had been dropped from most Miami cable systems to make way for new cable channels (partly due to limited headend channel capacity), resulting in some NBC programs that were preempted by WSVN being unavailable to some viewers. NBC realized that purchasing its own station with less restrictive ownership laws would guarantee that all of its shows would make it to air. Hence, it made an offer almost as high as Telepictures did a few months before, and in 1987, KKR agreed to sell WTVJ to NBC for $270 million.|$|E
25|$|But {{the most}} {{significant}} system introduced in F1 was the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), a system that stores energy created by braking that is stored through a flywheel and this saved energy is then channeled to the car's drivetrain to increase acceleration. A few well funded teams had tested this technology the previous year {{but it was too}} experimental and all of the teams' KERS systems needed more development to the point where none of them would be ready for 2009. Due to the recession, many more rule changes were brought in to reduce the cost of Formula One. Initially a standardised engine was proposed, but this idea was rejected by the teams, who came up with their own cost-cutting measures. These included a huge reduction in testing times and an increase in the required engine and gearbox mileage. Many teams voiced concerns over the cost of KERS and have suggested a standardised unit, but so far no such opportunity exists. The new rules and regulations saw a new order in 2009, with new teams Brawn GP and Red Bull Racing and their drivers leading the way, with Ferrari and McLaren having a poor season. However Ferrari started by the British Grand Prix {{to make the most of}} their car with a string of podium finishes and a race victory in Belgium, while a redesign of the McLaren challenger helped Lewis Hamilton to win two races and gain more points than any other driver after it was upgraded at the German Grand Prix. After dominating the beginning of the season with six out of seven race wins, Jenson Button eventually clinched the Drivers' title in Brazil, with Brawn GP winning the Constructors' Championship in its only season, before being taken over by Mercedes. Rubens Barrichello, Jenson Button's teammate, was second in the Drivers' Championship for the whole season until he had <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> the Brazilian Grand Prix and was overtaken (in points) by Sebastian Vettel, a Red Bull driver, who won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to finish eleven points behind Button. Also, the major manufacturer teams were starting to disappear rapidly due to the worldwide economy crisis. In addition to Ford/Jaguar which had left in 2004, Honda had departed in 2008 also due to uncompetitiveness, Toyota and BMW both departed entirely in 2009 (BMW sold Sauber, a team it had bought in 2005 after its split with Williams even though in 2010 the team was still called BMW Sauber), Renault changed their involvement as a full works effort to engine supplier in 2011 and Cosworth departed entirely as an engine supplier in 2013.|$|E
