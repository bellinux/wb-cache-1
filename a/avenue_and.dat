5|$|The Downtown Transit Project {{subcommittee}} unanimously approved Metro {{recommendations that}} would {{reduce the number of}} bus tunnel stations from six to five, saving $35 million, as well as opting for tunnel boring machines for the 3rd Avenue segment to minimize surface-level disruptions that would be present from cut-and-cover excavation. Stations would be located at Union Station south of Jackson Street, under 3rd <b>Avenue</b> <b>and</b> James Street, under 3rd <b>Avenue</b> <b>and</b> University Street, at the Westlake Mall and at 9th <b>Avenue</b> <b>and</b> Pine Street near the Washington State Convention Center.

5|$|A month later, an {{environmental}} {{study was conducted}} {{that focused on the}} possibilities of rerouting the proposed freeway. In April 1972, the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR78 freeway through the city of Escondido. The city then turned its focus to widening Lincoln <b>Avenue</b> <b>and</b> Ash Street instead, and also requested that the routing of SR78 be moved to Broadway, Washington <b>Avenue,</b> <b>and</b> Ash Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow. Five years later, signs were installed on eastbound SR78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound, to bypass the Escondido traffic.|$|E
