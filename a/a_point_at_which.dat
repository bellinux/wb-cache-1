5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E
5|$|Early on September22, an {{aircraft}} fix located Vera 175km (110mi) north-northeast of Saipan. Throughout {{the course of}} the day, periodic reconnaissance flights into the storm indicated that Vera had begun to rapidly intensify. By 1800UTC later that day, data analysis concluded that the tropical cyclone had reached typhoon intensity. Rapid intensification continued into the following day, as the typhoon's maximum sustained winds and barometric pressure quickly rose and fell, respectively. Concurrently, Vera's size grew to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> it spanned 250km (155mi) across. At 0600UTC the following day, Vera achieved its minimum estimated barometric pressure at 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg). This indicated a 75mbar (hPa; 2.22inHg) pressure drop in the preceding 24hours. Upon reaching its minimum pressure, Vera was estimated to have attained winds equivalent to a Category5– the highest classification possible on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The typhoon's winds continued to increase before peaking at 1200UTC on September23, when reconnaissance aircraft reported maximum sustained winds of 305km/h (190mph). Upon peaking in wind speed, Vera was located 645km (400mi) northeast of Guam. The tropical cyclone's ability to quickly intensify was attributed to conducive atmospheric divergence and highly sustainable sea surface temperatures.|$|E

25|$|Cryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers {{typically}} involves {{looking for}} {{attacks against the}} block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher.

25|$|Wéiqí {{is a game}} {{in which}} two players take turns placing black and white stones on a board {{consisting}} of a grid of 19x19 lines. Stones are placed on the intersections of the grid. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones may be removed if a stone or group of stones is surrounded on four sides by stones of the opposing color occupying all orthogonally-adjacent points. The two players place stones alternately until they reach <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> neither player wishes to make another move; the game has no set ending conditions beyond this. At the conclusion of the game, it is scored by counting the territory encircled by each side (empty space along with captured stones) and the number of stones remaining on the board to determine the winner. Games may also be won by resignation.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the Type 100 {{proved to}} be an {{effective}} and reliable weapon in close quarter fighting, perceived lack of requirement for SMGs and Japan's poor industrial capacity meant that only around 27,000 were ever produced. As a result of this, when the weapon was issued to regular combat units only officers and some NCOs received it; the Type 100 was never a common battlefield weapon. Special forces units are known to have been prioritized for reception of the weapon {{due to the nature of}} their operations; however, some American service personnel did report encountering the weapon in the Pacific Islands late in the war. Additionally, no Japanese soldier was ever equipped with the weapon until late 1941, and it was not produced in any significant quantity until 1943 — <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the manufacturing quality of Japanese weapons had already begun to deteriorate.|$|E
25|$|The center trace is a {{straight}} line, {{which is what}} Raoult's law predicts for an ideal mixture. The top trace illustrates a nonideal mixture that has a positive deviation from Raoult's law, where the total combined vapor pressure of constituents, X and Y, is greater than what is predicted by Raoult's law. The top trace deviates sufficiently {{that there is a}} point on the curve where its tangent is horizontal. Whenever a mixture has a positive deviation and has <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the tangent is horizontal, the composition at that point is a positive azeotrope. At that point the total vapor pressure is at a maximum. Likewise the bottom trace illustrates a nonideal mixture that has a negative deviation from Raoult's law, and at the composition where tangent to the trace is horizontal there is a negative azeotrope. This is also the point where total vapor pressure is minimum.|$|E
