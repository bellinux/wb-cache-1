5|$|In September 1939 Knight {{was asked}} to produce a {{recruitment}} poster for the Women's Land Army, WLA. Knight hired two Suffolk Punch horses and a plough from a farmer and painted them outdoors in a cherry orchard on Averills' farm in Worcestershire. Her original design for the WLA poster was rejected for placing {{too much emphasis on}} the horses rather than the women working. A new design, with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>woman,</b> was accepted. Knight painted her 1940 Royal Academy entry, January 1940, showing a similar scene at the same time. During the Second World War, Knight was an official war artist, contracted by the War Artists' Advisory Committee on several short-term commissions.|$|E
