5|$|During {{his nine}} years as {{territorial}} governor, Edwards made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> money through several profitable ventures, including farming, land speculation, {{and investment in}} sawmills, grist mills, and stores.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Meyerbeer's {{last years}} saw the {{composition}} of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> non-operatic music, including a Coronation March for William I of Prussia, (1861), an overture for the 1862 International Exhibition in London, and incidental music (now lost) to 's play La jeunesse de Goethe (1860). He composed a few settings of liturgical material, including one of the 91st Psalm (1853); and also choral works for the synagogue at Paris.|$|E
5|$|After the victory, a {{prize crew}} was put aboard Chesapeake. The {{commander}} of the prize, Lieutenant Falkiner, had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> trouble from the restive Americans, who outnumbered his own men. He {{had some of the}} leaders of the unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, ironically, been shipped aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners. The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles (holes) in the maindeck through which two 18-pounder cannon, loaded with grapeshot, were pointed at them.|$|E

5|$|An {{economic}} {{boom in the}} south {{following the end of}} World War I greatly increased Southern's revenues. Harrison spent <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> time traveling around the southern United States, endeavoring to increase southern industry. When he traveled, he used two private railroad cars, named the Carolina and the Virginia. Other railroad presidents used only one, which made Harrison's practice unique. The Carolina was a sleeping car and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors, with a kitchen, dining room, and observation area.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{returned}} to Harvard after the war, and initiated {{the construction of}} a 96-inch synchro-cyclotron, which has since been dismantled. From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, he drew the ire of Senator Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive defense of his colleagues in academia. As chairman, he was responsible for the renovation of the old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.|$|E
5|$|Etruscan {{architecture}} {{was created}} between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of ancient Rome finally absorbed Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood {{and other materials}} of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources we have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> information on what once existed.|$|E

5|$|F. Nelson Blount {{was killed}} when his private {{airplane}} hit a tree during an emergency landing, in Marlboro, New Hampshire, on August 31, 1967. By that time <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> Blount's collection was controlled by the Steamtown Foundation and had been relocated to Bellows Falls. Blount owned several corporations and one, the Green Mountain Railroad (GMRC), controlled the tracks that lay between Walpole, Bellows Falls and Chester, Vermont, which Steamtown was to use for its excursions. When Blount died most of the controlling stock of the GMRC {{was transferred to the}} president of the railroad, Robert Adams.|$|E
5|$|I hope I {{have not}} exaggerated {{in talking about}} Liszt; he won't make me {{anything}} wonderful, so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; but—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; if I can {{spend some time with}} him and go through <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> music with him, I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;... The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlap between the writers of Unknown and Astounding, there was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. Sf historian Paul Carter {{has argued that the}} spectrum of fantastic fiction from Weird Tales through Unknown to Astounding was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as Wonder Stories were more like the works of Edgar Allan Poe than they were tales of scientific imagination.|$|E

5|$|One of McCreary's first acts as {{governor}} was signing a bill appropriating $75,000 {{for the construction}} of a new governor's mansion. The legislature appointed a commission of five, including McCreary, to oversee the mansion's construction. The governor exercised <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> influence over the process, including the replacement of a conservatory with a ballroom in the construction plan and the selection of a contractor from his hometown of Richmond as assistant superintendent of construction. Changing societal trends also affected construction. A hastily constructed stable to house horse-drawn carriages was soon abandoned in favor of a garage for automobiles.|$|E
5|$|The flow of {{the river}} has {{decreased}} in power in recent years, partly because of surface run-off in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, especially from the large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway, which sends <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> silt into the system, slowing the flow and creating a risk of flooding downstream. This problem has now been partially alleviated by {{the construction of the}} Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water to be relatively clean.|$|E
5|$|The series created <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> criticism, {{especially}} among the Cuban American community. MLB umpire Rich Garcia, who is of Cuban descent, opposed the series. MLB umpires filed a grievance against MLB attempting to block them from being sent to umpire the game in Cuba, and refused to officiate the game in Baltimore. Rafael Palmeiro, an Oriole player of Cuban descent, also opposed the series and {{did not make the}} trip to Cuba. The Cuban American National Foundation protested the series.|$|E

5|$|There are oft-repeated {{historical}} {{claims that}} Joshua Norton arrived in San Francisco {{on a specific}} vessel, the Franzeska, on 23 November 1849; that he arrived with $40,000, {{in whole or in}} part a bequest from his father's estate; and that he parlayed this into a fortune of $250,000. None of this is substantiated by contemporaneous documentation. What is known is that, after Norton arrived in San Francisco, he enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> success in commodities markets and in real estate speculation, and that by late 1852, he was one of the more prosperous, respected citizens of the city.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter Asser {{seems to}} have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives no {{information}} about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It is evident from Asser's account that he spent <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who {{is not the same}} Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} {{joining the}} Western Interprovincial Football Union (now Canadian Football League), Pollard reported being given <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> propaganda {{to turn him}} away. He {{was picked up by}} the British Columbia Lions of the WIFU, with whom he played for until 1956. Pollard then played a single season for the Calgary Stampeders in 1957. He did not see much action with the Stampeders and ended his career due to health problems.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{distributed}} element filters {{began in}} the years before World WarII. A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937. Mason had filed a patent much earlier, in 1927, and that patent may contain the first published design which moves away from a lumped element analysis. Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires – the planar technologies were not yet in use. Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic counter-measures. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved.|$|E
5|$|Princess Ida (1884) spoofed women's {{education}} and male chauvinism and continued {{the theme from}} Iolanthe of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson's poem The Princess: A Medley. Gilbert had written a blank verse farce {{based on the same}} material in 1870, called The Princess, and he reused <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of Princess Ida. Ida is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, he dismissed her.|$|E
5|$|Surveys {{taken during}} 1932 and 1933 {{proved that the}} skyway saved time on the new and old routes. Not only was the {{distance}} shortened by , but it took at least six minutes less to travel the new route during regular traffic. Trucks gained even more time, saving anywhere from five to eleven minutes. During times of previous traffic congestion on weekends on the old route, the viaduct saved around 25minutes or more from the elimination of traffic congestion. In addition, the new route {{did not have the}} much longer delays and traffic back-ups that were caused whenever the bridges on the old highway were opened. It was found that the skyway also diverted <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> traffic from other routes.|$|E
