5|$|I am {{not quite}} {{certain that the}} present {{regulations}} governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction, {{and it would be}} worth considering whether they could not be arranged so that each team would play once <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> once at the place where their opponents hail from.|$|E
5|$|It was not, however, {{until the}} 1960s that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly {{successful}} Functionalism.

5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the millennium, Danish {{architecture}} has flourished both <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> abroad.
