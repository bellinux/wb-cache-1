5000|$|In November 1944, {{the first}} {{transport}} of 500 women from Auschwitz came to Lenzing {{to work in}} the newly opened local subcamp of Mauthausen concentration camp which was located in the Lenzinger suburb of Pettighofen. Eventually 600 female prisoners, mainly Jewish women came to Lenzing from Auschwitz, and a few others came from Ravensbrück and the main camp at Mauthausen. The SS staff in the small subcamp included mainly SS men as well as a small contingent of SS women. Frau Schmidt served in her capacities as Lagerführerin, or female commandant. Her main boss was Mauthausen commandant Franz Ziereis who commanded all of the subcamps in Austria. Later Margarete Freinberger became an Oberaufseherin in the camp under Schmidt. Only one other female overseer is known today, Maria Kunik. Attitudes by the former guards was reported as arrogant and brutal, but not as horrible as in Mauthausen proper. The prisoners in the Lenzing camp worked for the Lenzing AG company making <b>artificial</b> <b>wool.</b> Many women in fact died from the work, and others perished in the Mauthausen gas chambers when they could no longer work. In the winter of January 1945, a group of prisoners were severely injured when a train carrying supplies to the camp derailed. The SS sent them, along with any other prisoners who could no longer work to Mauthausen where they were gassed. The women [...] "cried and wailed {{all the way to the}} main camp." [...] In May 1945 the American Army neared the Lenzing camp. The SS staff fled after Lagerführerin Schmidt gave a speech to the surviving women as to not [...] "dishonor them". On 5 May 1945 the US Army liberated 565 women from the Lenzing subcamp.|$|E
50|$|The colors can be <b>artificial,</b> but undyed <b>wool</b> {{of various}} colors is {{available}} and much in demand. 'Originally, the sweater had a patterned band {{of at least}} two colours at the hem, the wrist and the yoke, forming the main pattern across the shoulders. During the 21st century, this changed so that now it is common for only the yoke to be patterned'.|$|R
5000|$|European {{manufacturers}} use wool blends or even 100% wool, usually Merino {{or other}} high-quality wool. Some models might include {{a thin layer}} of polyester to transport moisture away from the skin. Wool, in addition to being fire retardant, provides highly effective insulation and will keep its insulating properties even when wet, as opposed to cotton. In central Europe in Poland there is still one company called EWAX, which manufactures traditional cotton Long Johns. [...] The type known as [...] "thermal underwear" [...] is made from two-ply fabric of either a wool layer and an <b>artificial</b> fibre, only <b>wool</b> or [...] - [...] again mostly in the U.S. [...] - [...] two layers of only artificial fibres, which uses trapped body heat to insulate against cold air.|$|R
40|$|The non-pathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens strain WCS 417 r {{has been}} shown to induce {{systemic}} resistance in radish against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. raphani. In this paper we investigate the involvement of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins in this Pseudomonas-induced resistance. For comparison, salicylic acid (SA) and isonicotinic acid (INA) were used as inducers. It appeared that in our rock <b>wool</b> <b>artificial</b> soil system both strain WCS 417 r and SA could induce resistance, whereas strain WCS 417 r-B 4, a lipopolysaccharide-mutant, and INA could not. The induced resistance was expressed as a reduction in the percentage of diseased plants, but not in the disease severity. Western blot analyses revealed that in the control plants PR- 2 is constitutively present in the intercellular fluid of leaves and PR- 3 in the roots. Treatment with either of the inducing agents, with or without pathogen-inoculation, induced no further accumulation of cross-reacting homologues of PR- 1 - 5. We concluded that in our system induction of systemic resistance by strain WCS 417 r and SA is not associated with accumulation of PRs proteins. This demonstrates that accumulation of PR proteins is not a prerequisite for the expression of induced systemic resistance...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{studying}} {{degrees of}} adherence ability to various surfaces were undertaken with presumably epizoochorous diaspores of 14 native and eight introduced species from southern California. A commonly available laboratory shaker was modified {{so as to}} provide a standard means for dislodging diaspores from surfaces. Diaspores were dropped onto a cloth-covered board and percentages of dislodged diaspores recorded after inversion and then after intervals of shaking. Three fabrics were used: a velvet with short pile, an artificial wood with short curly strands, and a furlike fabric with straight strands. Attachment to the velvet was nil for most species, showing that a lower threshold for strand length necessary to promote attachment exists. On the <b>artificial</b> <b>wool,</b> some species tended toward brief attachment, some toward prolonged attachment, and some were intermediate. Results with the furlike fabric were similar, but a difference {{could be seen in}} that diaspores with hooklike devices adhered better to the artificial wool; a few species (notably grasses with bristly awns) showed better adherence on the furlike fabric. Diaspores were also tested on natural animal surfaces (one feather and four fur samples). Natural substrates proved comparable to artificial counterparts. Distinctive categories of diaspores are evident, based upon diaspore morphology and adherence capability. Nature of surface proves more important than weight or size of the diaspore in promoting adherence...|$|E
40|$|Excised shoot {{tips from}} adult Syringa vulgaris L. plants were rejuvenated by {{repeated}} subculturing in vitro. The number of subcultures required to rejuvenate the shoots was strongly {{dependent on the}} age and genotype of the plant material. Three rootstocks (K 8, A 2 and A 3) and 5 cultivars (Mademoiselle Marie Legray, Madame Florent Stepman, Maréchal Foch, Hugo Koster and Herman Eilers) were studied in vitro. The basic culture medium for isolation, subculture and shoot elongation contained: Murashige and Skoog (MS) macro-salts 1. 5 strength, MS micro-salts (except Fe), NaFeEDTA 50 mg/ 1, saccharose 3. 5 ° 2 iP 0. 8 mg/ 1, Difco Bacto-agar 0. 8 °pH 6. 0 and distilled water. The cultures were incubated in a growth room at 21 °C and a day/night schedule of 16 h fluorescent light/ 8 h darkness. After rejuvenation, cloning was realized by repeated single-node culture. The application of a cytokinin and low irradiance (4 – 5 W m- 2) induced stem elongation from pre-formed buds in the axils of the leaves. Zeatin(riboside) was most effective for stem elongation, followed by 2 iP. The cytokinins, BA and kinetin, were not very effective in inducing stem elongation. Stem elongation was dependent on the genotype used. High cytokinin levels (2 – 5 mg/ 1) induced axillary branching but hardly any stem elongation and the leaves were strongly curled. Single-node culture and stem elongation in a medium containing 1. 0 mg/ 1 2 iP was definitely the best method of propagating lilac in vitro. Shoots were easy to root on a cytokinin-free medium with auxin or on an <b>artificial</b> substrate (rock <b>wool)</b> after an auxin dip. Acclimatization of in vitro rooted shoots to greenhouse conditions was successful when at low irradiance and high relative humidity for the first 2 weeks after transfer...|$|R
