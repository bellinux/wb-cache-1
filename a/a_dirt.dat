5|$|Bart stays up late on Christmas Eve to kill Santa Claus for not {{bringing}} him <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> bike three Christmases ago. He eventually falls asleep and dreams that the Polar Express, driven by Otto Mann, lands {{in front of}} the house and flies him to the North Pole. Bart meets Santa (Krusty the Clown) only to find out that he has run out of money, since giving out presents in return for cookies every year is not a sustainable business model. Feeling pity, Bart decides that Santa no longer has to give him <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> bike and leaves with Santa throwing a party in his office after revealing how stupid kids are.|$|E
5|$|Highway 129 {{was first}} {{designated}} between Aubrey Falls and Chapleau in 1956, following the Thessalon–Chapleau Highway, <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> road {{along the banks}} of the Mississagi River that opened to traffic on January 28, 1949.|$|E
5|$|Roberts' son, Kenny Roberts Jr., won the 2000 500cc World Championship, {{making them}} the only {{father and son}} duo to have won the title. Ironically, Roberts has stated that he {{considers}} himself <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> tracker at heart and only took up road racing because {{it was necessary to}} do so if a rider was going to compete for the Grand National championship. He also said that he would have preferred to remain in the United States to compete in the Grand National championship if Yamaha or another manufacturer had been able to construct <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> track racer capable of competing with Harley-Davidson.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} run on <b>a</b> natural <b>dirt</b> surface until Woodbine {{installed}} <b>a</b> synthetic <b>dirt</b> surface in 2006. In 2016, the surface was Tapeta; it was Polytrack between 2006 and 2015.|$|R
50|$|From 2006 to 2013, {{the race}} was run on <b>a</b> Polytrack {{artificial}} <b>dirt</b> surface. In 2014, the Polytrack was replaced by <b>a</b> new <b>dirt</b> surface.|$|R

5|$|During the 1920s {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> {{airstrip}} known as Dutch Flats {{in what is}} now the Midway neighborhood of Point Loma. That is where Charles Lindbergh first tested and flew his airplane, The Spirit of St. Louis, which had been built in San Diego by the Ryan Aeronautical Company. A U.S. Post Office now located on the site contains several historic plaques commemorating Dutch Flats and Lindbergh.|$|E
5|$|Glenwood Canyon {{has served}} as the primary {{transportation}} artery through the Rocky Mountains, even before the creation of U.S. highways. Railroads have used the canyon since 1887 and <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> road was built through the canyon in the early 20th century. The first paved road was built from 1936 to 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million today).|$|E

5|$|The first road to use {{the general}} {{alignment}} of modern Route 14 was called the El Camino Sierra, or Sierra Highway, which extended from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe. <b>A</b> <b>dirt</b> road was completed in the 1910s from {{what had been a}} pack trail. The Los Angeles Times declared El Camino Sierra complete in 1931, when the portion from Mojave to the Owens Valley, along modern US 395, was paved.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{designed}} to run along the lake shore, instead of Dundas Street to the north, because the numerous hills encountered along Dundas would have increased costs without improving accessibility. Middle Road, <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> lane named because of its position between the two, was not considered since Lake Shore and Dundas were both overcrowded {{and in need of}} serious repairs.|$|E
5|$|The last race run on dirt in a NASCAR {{national}} touring series {{occurred on}} September 30, 1970, at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds in Raleigh in a Grand National (now Sprint Cup Series) race, which was won by Richard Petty. Afterwards, NASCAR sanctioned the Busch All-Star Tour, <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> late model series, which lasted from 1985 to 2002.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> 1/2 mile <b>dirt</b> oval {{operated}} at the fairgrounds from July 28, 1924 through around 1927 (this track had run motorcycles from 1910 through 1923). <b>A</b> 1/5 mile <b>dirt</b> oval {{was used}} for midgets on November 11, 1934. <b>A</b> 1/10 mile <b>dirt</b> oval operated from July 4, 1978 through 1984 (this was originally used for speedway motorcycles beginning in 1969.) The 1/5 mile oval opened in 1985. <b>A</b> 1/5 mile <b>dirt</b> figure 8 was added in 2000. The track has also operated as Seaside Park Speedway.|$|R
50|$|The track has <b>a</b> one-mile <b>dirt</b> oval. There is no turf course.|$|R
5|$|When Brown was {{six years}} old, his father took him to an air show. Brown gained an intense {{interest}} in flying from this experience, and afterward, was attracted to <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> airfield near his home, which he visited frequently in spite of being chased away by a local mechanic.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were despatched {{in the direction}} of the crash site, known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. The crash site was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> road that enabled them to drive to within three or four miles of the crash site. The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E

5|$|The Barlow Road {{begins at}} The Dalles and heads south to Tygh Valley (some {{consider}} Tygh Valley {{to be the}} beginning), then turns west and roughly parallels the White River on the north and then west, crosses the south shoulder of Mount Hood at Barlow Pass, follows Camp Creek and the Sandy River for some way, and finally leads to Oregon City. The road was rendered largely irrelevant in the early 1900s by {{the construction of the}} Mount Hood Highway. It still exists as <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> road in some places, while many other parts have been paved over by newer streets and highways.|$|E
5|$|The Yellowhead {{began as}} the Yellowhead Red River cart trail. When the {{province}} was surveyed, the road evolved from <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> to gravel to all-weather road known as Provincial Highway 5 from the Alberta–Saskatchewan boundary to Saskatoon, and as Provincial Highway 14 from Saskatoon to the Manitoba–Saskatchewan boundary. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the highway was straightened and widened. On August 15, 1970 the Yellowhead was opened {{for the northern}} Trans-Canada route. The highway was completely designated for the entire route as Saskatchewan Highway 16 in 1976.|$|E
5|$|The first {{numbered}} highway {{along the}} SR85 corridor {{was established in}} 1927 between Gila Bend and Phoenix as US80. At the time, it was only paved from Phoenix to Hassayampa. Although not paved between Hassayampa and Gila Bend, it was an improved road. This original routing of US80 still exists as Old US80 west of the SR85 alignment. <b>A</b> <b>dirt</b> road between Gila Bend and Ajo did exist at this time, {{but it was not}} a part of the state highway system. By 1935, the entire route of US80 between Gila Bend and Phoenix had been paved. The road south of Gila Bend had also been improved to a gravel road.|$|E

5|$|The road intersects with Island Pond Road, <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> path in Harriman, as it heads {{along the}} border. Arden Valley Road intersects with Crooked Road thereafter. Harris Mine is {{visible to the}} left as the road {{proceeds}} {{around the base of}} Echo Mountain. To the southeast of Lindley Mountain, Arden Valley Road turns east and into the park. Arden Valley Road passes Lake Cohasset and Upper Lake Cohasset as it heads eastward. The road intersects with the Long Path and RamapoDunderbergAppalachian Trails soon afterward. Bradley Mine is visible to the left, and Arden Valley Road comes to an end at Tiorati Circle., where the road continues eastward as Tiorati Brook Road.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 93 northwest of Congress and southeast of Nothing. Beginning at US 93 southbound, SR 97 crosses US 93 northbound after several feet. It crosses through a desert region in a northeasterly direction, meeting <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> road that connects back to US 93. SR 97 curves northward before heading eastward at an intersection with Burro Creek Road. Again turning northeastward, the roadway meets various local roads, {{most of them}} dirt. The highway meets its northern terminus at SR 96, which continues northwestward toward Bagdad.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{exiting the}} mountains, Sierra Highway enters the Antelope Valley {{and serves as}} one of the main streets of Palmdale, Lancaster, and Rosamond. The highway runs {{parallel}} to the modern Route14 and the railroad, becoming a frontage road. Just shy of Mojave the freeway portion of Route14 ends, while the frontage road becomes <b>a</b> <b>dirt</b> path and eventually terminates. From this point, the canonical route of Sierra Highway joins State Route 14, passing through downtown Mojave.|$|E
