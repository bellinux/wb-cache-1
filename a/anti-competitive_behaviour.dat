40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} copyright and competition law, paying {{special attention to the}} elements of conflict which have repeatedly emerged from recent antitrust cases in both the United States and Europe. In particular, the thesis argued is that the framework of intellectual property rights is crucial to antitrust evaluations because of the deterministic relation which exists between property rights on the one hand, and market structure and modes of competition on the other. In consideration of this relationship, it will be shown that several purportedly <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>behaviours</b> are in reality of an ambiguous character when considered within the system of incentives defined by copyright. What is more, given that copyright is essentially a calculated restriction on competition introduced by legislators to correct a specific market failure (i. e., creation of a sub-optimal level of copyrightable works), it then becomes quite difficult to pursue <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{in a manner consistent with}} the nature of copyright and the incentives system. The work also shows how scholars are confronted with a structural weakness in the economic theory, vis-à-vis the current needs of antitrust enforcement in markets regulated by copyright. This weakness is probably attributable to the fact that the theory principally grew out of a study of the structure and dynamics of the manufacturing industries, and has therefore produced analysis tools geared to that particular context. However such tools are not ideally suited to the markets of information goods protected by copyright, which have modes of competition that differ substantially from those of the sectors which produce tangible goods. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{economic}} terminology, 'competition intensity' {{can be used}} {{to mirror}} to a certain degree the status of industrial competition in a specific market, while in the construction market, it particularly involves the part of project competition intensity (PCI). Based on a road project in China, two forms of PCI, overt and covert, are identified in this study. To lower project construction cost thus enabling better project tendering performance, clients can facilitate higher levels of overt PCI by tailoring their tendering procedures, whereas, through covert PCI project competitors can adopt <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>behaviours</b> to attain the expected works. The difference between overt PCI and covert PCI indicates various practitioners' perspectives and impact on the levels of competition intensity in construction. The findings suggest a way to promote PCI studies in the future, and offer new insights into other parts of competition intensity in construction.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between standardization processes, {{intellectual property rights}} and competition rules has increasingly become {{of interest in the}} recent years. Recent investigations of the European Commission confirm that standardization processes and in particular ownership of IPRs that cover standardized technology might in certain circumstances infringe competition rules. The article first explores the meaning and different forms of standardization. It then analyses selected parts of the Guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to horizontal co-operation agreements, in particular those parts that cover standardisation agreements. The Guidelines have been adopted by the Commission in December 2010 with a view to addressing the anti-competitive concerns stemming from inter alia standardisation agreements (eg, they encourage IPRs holders to disclose their exclusive rights before the adoption of the standard, as well as to give an irrevocable commitment to offer to license the IPR to all parties interested on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms: so-called FRAND commitment). The author will then present and comment on different points of view on whether the ownership of IPRs which cover standardized technologies really create market dominance capable of triggering <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Finally, a set of additional solutions proposed by various legal scholars will be highlighted and commented...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Entrepreneurship and New Venture Creation)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Business Administration, 2014. This study {{examined}} the attitudes of entrepreneurs and policy makers towards enterprise development performance as well as explored the perceived constraints to enterprise development in South Africa’s construction sector. For {{the purpose of this}} study, attitudes of policymakers were measured on attributes of enterprise development and constraints to enterprise development. A survey of 120 respondents in the construction sector ranging from policy makers, owners of SMMEs and managers of established large construction firms was conducted on a convenience and purposive basis. The results of the study suggest that the success of enterprise development in South Africa’s construction sector hinges on positive attitudes of all stakeholders while corruption and <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>behaviours</b> of bigger enterprises towards small and medium enterprises were cited as the main bane of enterprise development in the sector. These results correlate findings cited in literature review concerning the phenomena. The findings of the survey should serve to inform policymakers on strategies which need to be adopted to deepen enterprise development in the construction sector in a manner which benefits black-owned SMMEs. This research paper has established {{that there is a need}} for policy makers to align enterprise development opportunities of established organisations to those of developing organisation in SMMEs in the construction industry...|$|R

The question is, if the theory of law could profit from the cooperation with human ethologic thinking, if the human ethology {{could be used as}} the background of nature law theories. Answering the question can be essential for the discussions about human rights.

Using anthropology of law (Hoebel, Pospíšil, Wesel) the explication accents the system of reciprocal obligation as a base of law. This point allows bringing some critical notes to the relevance of ethologic research for the theory of law. In the second part there are discussed four fields of human ethology research - territorial, competitive and <b>anti-competitive,</b> family <b>behaviour,</b> which are relevant for the property law, criminal law and family law.

40|$|In {{response}} to the Government’s public discussion document on the way forward for competition policy in Hong Kong, we are pleased to submit this paper for consideration. In summary, our response is as follows. 1. We have no hesitation {{to say that a}} competition law for Hong Kong is necessary, if not long overdue. Our analysis is based on the economic efficiency that a competition law will promote and the market distortion that it will cure. Contrary to what some may believe, small market economies are more prone to anti-competitive conduct, due to their unique features of high industry concentration, substantial entry barriers, and high level of aggregate concentration. 2. Laissez-faire does not guarantee fair competition. Given their tremendous costs to society, a reasonable amount of evidence of <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>behaviours</b> will justify a law. A competition law will also protect Hong Kong consumers from international cartels originated from other countries, whose damages are estimated to far outweigh the costs of setting up and enforcing a law. 3. An unbiased competition regime should be extended to all sectors of the economy, in light of the deficiency of a sector-specific approach. We see two main drawbacks of the latter approach: misallocation of resources of the economy in the long run due to the different rules set for different sectors; and a credibility problem that arises when the very same agency acts as both the traditional industry regulator and competition policy enforcer. Nor is it fair to target certain industries of the economy. 4. On the scope of the proposed competition law, we recommend a broad approach covering anti-competitive conduct as well as market structure. In terms of market structure, we do not mean anti-monopoly, as monopoly per se is not anti-competitive. It is only the abuse of monopoly (via predatory pricing, tying and bundling etc) that would be scrutinized. We argue that mergers and acquisitions (M 2 ̆ 6 As) need to be regulated, as they can be motivated by market power considerations as well as efficiency gains. Reduced competition {{as a result of a}} merger cannot be reversed by regulating the behaviour of the merged firm ex post. We recommend a light-touched merger control regime with the adoption of large safe harbours, on the justifications that the importance of scale economy in Hong Kong sometimes necessitates a certain degree of rationalization. 5. On the enforcement front, we recommend the set-up of a competition authority empowered with investigative function (plus the power to issue civil injunctive orders) and a specialist tribunal with adjudicative function (the Canada model). It combines the benefits of expertise (of the competition authority) and the safeguards from bias (with independent adjudication), and leads to a high degree of transparency. 6. In terms of sanctions, we propose that punitive fines and director disqualifications be imposed on offenders of hardcore cartels (price fixing, market sharing and bid rigging), and monetary fines, civil or administrative, on all other competition infringements. This is to balance the severity of sanctions against the gravity of harm, and to achieve the necessary deterrent effect against blatant behaviour. 7. We strongly recommend that a leniency program be included in the competition law to encourage whistle-blowing. Whistle-blowing is more effective (if not the only possible means) to detect and lead to successful prosecution of hardcore cartels, as demonstrated clearly by the recent experiences in the US and the EU. 8. We recommend “partial exemption” of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) from the new law, similar to the US approach. In our view, exemptions of SMEs from regulations of M 2 ̆ 6 As and abuse of dominant position can be justified on economic efficiency grounds. However, price-fixing (market sharing and bid rigging as well) benefits the sellers more than it hurts consumers and hence should be prohibited by law. 9. The safety zone provided by the partial exemption scheme would help reduce SME’s compliance costs and protect them from excessive litigation. At the same time, the law would enable SMEs to sue other players, an option not feasible absent the law, thereby making them better off. 10. No adverse presumption in law should be construed against any type of enterprises, small or big, domestic or foreign. A competition law should neither penalize big players if they are efficient, nor protect small players if they are inefficient. The law is to protect the competition process, not competitors. The government is recommended to do more to educate the public about the nature and essence of competition law...|$|R
