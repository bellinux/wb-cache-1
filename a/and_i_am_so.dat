After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
500|$|On Christmas Eve 2012, Burgess and Maddren {{announced}} {{that they would be}} leaving the group. Maddren had secured a role the Australian musical production of The Addams Family, while Burgess had decided to explore other options and expand her solo music career. She stated, [...] "It has been an amazing five years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> thankful to all of [...] for being amazing supporters". The pair departed in January 2013.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{presented}} {{three stories}} that it felt were particularly emotional: {{the first was}} {{about a woman who}} removed miniskirts from her college wardrobe after being raped, but continued wearing her favorite boots; another was about wedding attire anxieties; and the third was about the choice of adorning a newly reconstructed breast with a tattoo. The same article also noted a humorous ode to black {{as a part of a}} wardrobe or in fact as a wardrobe, when one character notes: [...] "Sometimes I buy something that isn't black, and I put it on <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> sorry".|$|E

500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject {{to a lot of}} people, {{but the point is that}} Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest". Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{military}} activity resumed {{in the winter}} of 1807, Napoleon hoped to overwhelm a Russian rear guard at Hof near Eylau, which was called [...] "Preussisch Eylau" [...] (and is now within the borders of the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast). He ordered his dragoons to take a bridge; they failed and suffered severe casualties. D'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers—heavy cavalry of big men on big horses—thundered over the bridge and scattered the Russian rear guard. As the retreating infantry fled, d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers captured four guns and two standards. Napoleon was so pleased with d'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers that he embraced the six-foot man in front of his division the next day. In his own turn, d'Hautpoul was so pleased that he announced first, to have such a compliment, he must be willing to die for his emperor, and second, to his troops: [...] "The Emperor has embraced me on behalf of all of you. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> pleased with you that I kiss all your arses." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{subsequent}} {{interviews with}} Brian Williams on October 29, 2008, Palin {{was quoted as}} saying, [...] "I {{am not going to}} label myself anything, Brian, and I think that's what annoys a lot of Americans, especially in a political campaign is start trying to label different parts of America, different backgrounds. I'm not going to label myself, but I do believe in women's rights; I believe in equal rights, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> thankful I was brought up in where really gender has never been an issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} via Houston's official website on October 12, 2009 that the singer would embark {{on her first}} world tour in 11 years in promotion of her latest album I Look to You. [...] "This is my first full tour since the My Love Is Your Love tour <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> excited to be performing for my fans around the world after all this time. I am putting together a great show and cannot wait to perform the songs from my new album I Look To You {{along with some of}} your favourites." ...|$|E
2500|$|In these {{difficult}} times {{the one person}} who continuously provided moral support to Pisemsky was Ivan Turgenev. In 1869 he informed Pisemsky that his One Thousand Souls had been translated into German and enjoyed [...] "great success in Berlin". [...] "So now {{the time has come for}} you to step outside the borders of your motherland and for Aleksey Pisemsky to become a European name," [...] Turgenev wrote on October 9, 1869. [...] "The best Berlin critic, Frenzel, in National Zeitung devoted a whole article to you where he calls your novel 'a rare phenomenon', and I tell you, now you are well known in Germany," [...] wrote Turgenev in another letter, enclosing clips from other papers, too. [...] "The success of One Thousand Souls encourages [...] to start upon the novel Troubled Seas <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> happy both for you and for Russian literature in general… Critical reviews of One Thousand Souls here in Germany are most favourable, your characters are being compared to those of Dickens, Thackeray, etc, etc", he continued. Julian Schmidt’s large article in Zeitgenossensche [...] Bilder, part of the series devoted to first class European authors, provided for Pisemsky another cause to celebrate, and following Turgenev's advice, in 1875 he visited Schmidt to thank him personally.|$|E

2500|$|Howard D. Griffin (1911-1986) {{purchased}} a boat dealership in 1936 {{while he was}} a student at what became the University of Louisiana at Monroe. By the 1960s, Griffin's company had become the largest outboard motor dealership in the world. He also sold motorcycles. From 1965 to 1985, Griffin and his wife, Birdie M. Griffin (1915-1985), operated their seasonal Land O' Toys store on South Grand Street in Monroe. The motto was [...] "Land O’ Toys; Loads of fun for girls and boys; Bring the kids and look around; The biggest toy deal in the town." [...] Once Christmas was over, the toy store was quickly phased out, and the outboard motors returned to the showroom. From her childhood memories, Sherry Lynn Mason recalls the Land O' Toys: [...] "I loved that store. Every time [...] took me there, we were waiting for his outboard motor to be fixed across the street. It was a magical place to me!” Amy Berry Baker recalls, [...] "It wasn't Christmas until we went to Howard Griffin ... magical for kids," [...] according to an article in The Monroe News-Star. Mrs. Griffin died December 15, 1985, and the store close permanently a few days after Christmas of that year. In March 2011, the remaining abandoned building burned. All that remains are the memories of the former customers, now all adults. Cheri Chadduck recalled, [...] "Memories are completely magical, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> grateful for my childhood recollections of time there." ...|$|E
