5|$|When {{they entered}} service, the IK-3s {{suffered}} from minor equipment and instrument faults, largely caused by {{deficiencies in the}} Yugoslav <b>aeronautical</b> <b>industry</b> which had resulted {{in a mixture of}} foreign and Yugoslav-made instruments being fitted to the aircraft. The Yugoslav Minister of War approved the acquisition of a further 48 IK-3s to be delivered in 1941–42. The operational aircraft were allocated to the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun, six each to the 161st Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Savo Poljanec) and the 162nd Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Todor Gogić). The IK-3 was then tested against Yugoslav Messerschmitt Bf 109Es in mock dogfights. The evaluation concluded that the IK-3 had several advantages over the Bf 109E; the Yugoslav aircraft was more manoeuvrable in level flight, enabling it to quickly get behind a pursuing Bf 109E by making tight horizontal turns.|$|E

Frustrated by this, in 1931 they decided to design a replacement for the Czechoslovakian-built Avia BH-33E biplane fighter then in service with the VVKJ. Working in a basement in Belgrade, then in Ilić's apartment in Novi Sad, they devoted their spare time to secretly working on their design. Their original concept was for a low-wing monoplane with a retractable undercarriage, but contemporary thinking led them to modify their initial design into a strut-braced high-wing monoplane armed with a hub-firing autocannon and fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. The gull-wing design emphasised power and manoeuvrability over other characteristics.|$|E

The design concept for what became the Ikarus IK-2 was submitted to the VVKJ on 22 September 1933. With this work completed, Ilić and Sivčev had time to start preliminary development of a new low-wing monoplane that could better meet and defeat the high performance bomber prototypes then in development by potential adversaries.|$|E

40|$|In present day, several <b>industries</b> such as <b>aeronautical</b> <b>industries,</b> {{automobile}} industries, marine industries, chemical {{industries and}} transportation industries relay on fibre reinforced composites to manufacture several components such as flaps, doors, gears and other components.

The anisotropic nature of laminated composite materials become the source of de-lamination, de-lamination growth is the fundamental issue {{in the evaluation of}} laminated composite systems for durability and damage tolerance. Prediction of the Inter laminar shear strength of the fibre reinforced composites is important for engineering applications yet difficult in nature.

In aircraft design it is important to couple low structural weight with high damage tolerance.

In this work, a nondestructive evaluation of FML specimens based on an eddy-current technique that uses an HTS SQUID (Superconductive QUantum Interference Device) magnetometer is proposed. The aim is to demonstrate that this technique is capable of detecting the presence of damage hidden by plastic deformation after impact events...|$|R

The programme of refinement and improvement of quality control was a strategic factor that gave rise to Fiat Aviazione’s success during those years.|$|R

Silicon–aluminum alloys (Al-Si), with Si {{contents}} up to 12 % {{are important}} materials in automotive and <b>aeronautical</b> <b>industries</b> {{due to their}} low density and high wear resistance. The cutting force, surface roughness and tool wear of diamond tools and cemented carbides tool were compared when turning Al-Si alloy. The results indicated that there wasn't remarkable difference between diamond tools and cemented carbides tool in cutting force and surface roughness when rough turning silicon-aluminum alloy. While in finish turning, less cutting force and surface roughness can be obtained when using diamond tools. The flank wears of diamond tools were less than cemented carbides. It was concluded that diamond tools can improve machining characteristics and reduce tool wear...|$|R
