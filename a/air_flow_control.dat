With respect to weld quality and weld penetration depth, the methods applied here have also yielded practice-relevant knowledge about the interactions between the laser radiation and the welding fumes as well as about the attainable benefits of controlling the air flow in an appropriate way. Experimental investigations and numerical calculations served to adequately identify the influencing factors which are essential for are liable remote laser beam welding process. One challenge is to find optimum parameter constellations for a given configuration of a welding installation. Because of the complexity of the interactions, empirical designing is generally impracticable or insufficient in order to achieve an efficient <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>control.</b> Virtual welding installation models with which the cabin air flow can be simulated may serve as a useful tool for this purpose. In combination with methods of statistical design and evaluation of experiments, it is possible to make a significance assessment of different manipulated variables and to establish functional dependencies between manipulated and target variables on which the optimisation of the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> can be based. Using the obtained results, it was possible to elaborate a resource-conserving <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> concept which can be applied to retrofit many remote laser beam welding installations in a relatively simple and favourable way.

30|$|A {{fuel cell}} system {{consists}} of a stack and various ancillary equipments including air compressors, cooling water circulation, humidifier, pumps, and electrical control equipment. Among all the ancillary equipments, the power consumption of air compressor is the greatest, typically accounting for up to 80  % power of the overall ancillary equipments and 15  %– 20  % of the {{fuel cell system}} [2, 4]. For a fuel cell stack, air flowrate must be greater than the amount needed by the electrochemical reaction, and the oxygen excess ratio (OER), which is the ratio between the flowrate of oxygen provided and reacted, is critical to ensure the system stability and reliability. If the OER is too low, even though higher than 1, {{it is likely to}} cause “oxygen starvation” [5, 6] and results in cell reversal, which is harmful to the stack. On the other hand, a higher OER will lower the concentration difference in cathode flow field and improve the fuel cell performance, while greater air flow results in higher power consumption for the air compressor and lower system efficiency, which is called “oxygen saturation.” In addition, the air pressure in cathode flow field of the fuel cell stack and the pressure difference between both sides of proton exchange membrane must be maintained in a certain range during operation. <b>Air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> is important to maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the system, and different <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> techniques have been provided by researchers [7, 8, 9, 10].|$|E

The paper reports on a summer analysis in different European climates of the energetic advantage of direct and indirect evaporative cooling techniques, in which external air flow is established by outdoor, indoor and inlet air enthalpies comparison.
