5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent {{only a small percentage}} of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E
5|$|Combinations also trigger special modes, {{including}} alternative camera angles, {{a sniper}} mode, and <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> mode, which unlocks more in-game secrets. Playable {{versions of the}} 1981 Donkey Kong and 1983 Jetpac are hidden within the game. The player-character can also ride animals, such as a rhino and swordfish, who recur from earlier series games. Optional hardware support includes a widescreen mode and Rumble Pak compatibility.|$|E
50|$|Time Machine, {{included}} in Apple's Mac OS X v10.5 operating system, is not <b>a</b> <b>snapshotting</b> scheme but <b>a</b> system-level incremental backup service: it merely watches mounted volumes for changes and copies changed files periodically to a specially-designated volume using hard links.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} get {{admissible}} test functions w^h, the restriction w^h|_Γ _d= 0 must be satisfied. That is why, {{for the design of}} <b>a</b> consistent <b>snapshot</b> collection strategy, the snapshots must be of the form T - T_d. Then, the problem resides in the correct description of T_d^h. A possible solution is to describe it as in standard FEM, i.e., T_d^h = N^B,TT^B_n, but this could lead to <b>a</b> <b>snapshots</b> set with <b>a</b> very high frequency content, decreasing the compressibility of the signal [11].|$|R

5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> of a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances {{of the program}} to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.|$|E
5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a tag team match where MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) (with Melina) defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against the team of Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas. The match started off with Nitro and Haas in the ring. Haas took the advantage in the match {{and was able to}} tag in Holly. There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all of the superstars were able to participate in the match. After <b>a</b> <b>Snapshot</b> to Haas, Mercury pinned Haas, which resulted in MNM retaining the WWE Tag Team title.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{scientific}} paintings adopted {{elements from}} {{the tradition of}} history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, {{as well as his}} close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> of the society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{large room}} in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the reign of}} King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in <b>a</b> <b>snapshot.</b> Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position {{similar to that of the}} viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E
5|$|After {{the team}} split, Nitro, {{alongside}} Melina, was quickly placed into the Intercontinental Championship picture, winning the title twice. In November, after serving his suspension {{and a brief}} stint back in OVW, Mercury returned to WWE, reuniting MNM to answer an open challenge put out by The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the December to Dismember pay-per-view. At the event, MNM lost to the Hardys. MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon {{as part of a}} four-way ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in the face with a ladder, necessitating a trip to the emergency room where his broken nose received 15 stitches. The facial injury was worked into the angle, and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face, the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure {{one or both of the}} Hardys, even going so far as to attack and perform <b>a</b> <b>Snapshot</b> on Matt on exposed concrete following a match. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February, which concluded the feud.|$|E
