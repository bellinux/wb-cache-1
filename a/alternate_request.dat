Mobile devices {{known as}} {{smartphones}} are evolving to incorporate several processors and a RAM memory greater than a gigabyte {{in response to}} the high resource demand of today’s software applications. These devices were designed to be highly available information devices and are equipped with special features for that purpose; they are designed in a way that facilitates their mobility from place to place and {{with the use of a}} battery as a power source to provide considerable autonomy. Even with the recent evolution of these devices, the goal for them remains the same: high information availability (anytime, anywhere). These devices are not designed for high computational loads, the processor’s intensive work blocks the high availability of information (a busy processor doesn’t address <b>alternate</b> <b>requests</b> for information handling), however, the increasing power of these devices opens the scenario for using the concurrent processing features of their multiple processors for other possibilities. Also, given the ir current popularity and ubiquity, these devices may become useful in the distributed computing scenario, where the solution of complex computational tasks may be shared between many devices [29]. Nowadays there are yet some applications requiring information intensive processing on the smartphones [17] [28] [38]. Concurrent programming offers promising approaches to help in the creation of parallel and distributed systems. The Actors Model [7] is an interesting paradigm because it is a design that helps to minimize complex programming errors using the system resources in parallel and distributed environments.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A {{solution}} {{to the problems of}} computer scheduling of students based on course requests rather than section requests is discussed. The solution involves keeping all course data in core during the scheduling process to enable the scheduling program to run as fast as possible and using a scheduling algorithm which tries all possible combinations of sections for the requested courses until a conflict-free schedule is found, or until it is determined that the remaining conflicts are unresolvable. The algorithm schedules recitations and labs where required and maintains section balancing in terms of the percentage of scheduled stations for lecture, lab, and recitation sections within a course. Several methods of giving the student more choice in the sections he will be scheduled for are discussed. These include instructor preference and course <b>request</b> <b>alternates.</b> These features are not implemented in the algorithm currently being used...|$|R
40|$|Recognizing {{handwritten}} {{mathematics is}} a challenging classification problem, requiring simulta-neous identification {{of all the}} symbols comprising an input {{as well as the}} complex two-dimensional relationships between symbols and subexpressions. Because of the ambiguity present in handwrit-ten input, it is often unrealistic to hope for consistently perfect recognition accuracy. We present a system which captures all recognizable interpretations of the input and organizes them in a parse forest from which individual parse trees may be extracted and reported. If the top-ranked interpretation is incorrect, the user may <b>request</b> <b>alternates</b> and select the recognition result they desire. The tree extraction step uses a novel probabilistic tree scoring strategy in which a Bayesian network is constructed based on the structure of the input, and each joint variable assignment cor-responds to a different parse tree. Parse trees are then reported in order of decreasing probability. Two accuracy evaluations demonstrate that the resulting recognition system is more accurate than previous versions (which used non-probabilistic methods) and other academic math recognizers. ...|$|R
