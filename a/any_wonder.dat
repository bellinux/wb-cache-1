500|$|Just {{like his}} comic book counterpart, Smallvilles Clark Kent was a {{symbolic}} representation of Jesus Christ. Established early on, the pilot episode contained {{a moment when}} Clark was crucified on a scarecrow post during a high school hazing. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Rob Owen noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, [...] "Is it <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?" [...] Echoing Owen, Judge Byun identified the same symbolism: [...] "Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all {{for the greater good}} of humanity, and Smallville shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role." ...|$|E
500|$|Celia Larkin, {{writing on}} 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent, said [...] "There was {{something}} very satisfying about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above {{the roar of the}} Red Tops. If you actually take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not just read what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing. How cruel can you get?" ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Linder of IGN commented [...] "2004's Greatest Hits: My Prerogative [...] {{captured}} the highlights from Britney's heyday, but lacks the more mature club-oriented material that she's churned out in recent years. That helps make this collection a justifiable fan purchase". Mike Diver of BBC Online called it [...] "the definitive Britney album" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "these songs don't just make a mark, lingering in the memory– they are essential pieces of {{the past ten years}} of pop history, and deserve better than dismissal by so-called discerning listeners". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called the album [...] "a high-gloss collection of tunes that selectively sums up the career of one of the biggest female pop singers of the past decade. It's a disc that's light on filler [...] and heavy on Spears' more high-energy cuts, which, without question, play to her strengths as a performer". Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This is Britney's second greatest hits, and it's incredibly strong. It focuses mainly on her more upbeat, danceable numbers, with a few slower ones thrown in to change things up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs" [...] and summarized the review adding [...] "As {{one of the most successful}} artists of the decade, is it <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> this compilation is so good?".|$|E

500|$|The pilot {{received}} favorable reviews {{upon its}} release. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{thought it was}} a [...] "respectful addition to Superman lore" [...] and had [...] "all the markings of a super series". Owen noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, [...] "Is it <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?" [...] Echoing Owen, DVD Verdict noted the same symbolism: Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good of humanity, and Smallville shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role. Elizabeth White of Media Life believed the show had potential to be a big hit for The WB but felt it needed to survive not only its time slot—Tuesdays at 9:00 p.m. (EST)—but also the audience's expectations of [...] "what Superman should be". USA Todays Robert Bianco was a bit more mixed in his criticism. Bianco stated, [...] "For all its innovations, there's also something rehashed and repetitive about Smallville... shows often look more familiar at the outset than they do as they progress. There's talent and intelligence at work in Smallville. Given time, maybe they'll find a more distinctive voice." [...] Jeremy Conrad, from IGN, swore to himself that he would never watch Smallville, because he was a [...] "huge Superman fan" [...] and he did not like the idea the creators would be making changes to the Superman mythology. After viewing the pilot, Conrad stated, [...] "It's a very solid start to the series, and one of the better pilot episodes I've seen in a while." [...] In The Futon Critic's 50 best episodes of 2001 rankings, the pilot was placed 31st, with Brian Ford Sullivan stating, [...] "Smallville opened us to a surprisingly fresh take on the Superman myth-this time showing us the humble beginnings of a young Clark Kent." ...|$|E

He was like some terrible moral huntsman digging mankind out of the snug burrows {{in which they had}} lived hitherto.

60|$|Is it not {{at least}} {{possible}} that this gift was psychic power, and that Christ, as the greatest exponent who has ever appeared upon earth of that power, desired to surround Himself with others who possessed it to a lesser degree? This He would do for two reasons. The first is that a psychic circle is {{a great source of}} strength to one who is himself psychic, as is shown continually in our own experience, where, with a sympathetic and helpful surrounding, an atmosphere is created where all the powers are drawn out. How sensitive Christ was to such an atmosphere is shown by the remark of the Evangelist, that when He visited His own native town, where the townspeople could not take Him seriously, He was unable to do <b>any</b> <b>wonders.</b> The second reason may have been that He desired them to act as His deputies, either during his lifetime or after His death, and that for this reason some natural psychic powers were necessary.|$|R
