40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{mechanical}} solution to save fuel by shutting down an {{internal combustion engine}} whenever it is unnecessary for propulsion, e. g., when a vehicle is waiting for traffic lights.

Therefore, a hybrid control strategy, which is treated as a top-level controller, is introduced to deal with this finite-state mechanical system. At the lower level, the engine and clutches are controlled in a coordinated manner such that the vehicle is launched according to the driver’s demands. Using a comprehensive powertrain simulation package, the proposed controller is evaluated numerically...|$|R

40|$|Currently, many {{different}} topologies {{are designed with}} different transmission technologies such as automated manual transmission (AMT) and continuously variable transmission (CVT). The choice of topology determines the energy-flow efficiency between the hybrid system, the engine, and the vehicle wheels. The optimal topology minimizing fuel consumption {{is influenced by the}} transmission technology. Therefore, an AMT (high efficiency) and a push-belt CVT (moderate efficiency), are used in this research for comparison. In addition, a controlled switching topology is introduced as a benchmark, where controlled coupling with <b>additional</b> <b>clutches</b> of the electric machine before or after the transmission minimizing transmission losses and improving hybrid performance is investigated. The results showed that a switching topology can significantly improve CO 2 emission reduction (average relative improvements between 2 % and 7 %), particularly for CVT-based hybrid vehicles. Moreover, in case of an AMT, a precoupled topology is preferable, {{and in the case of}} a CVT, a postcoupled is preferable for full-hybrid vehicles. For these cases, selecting the optimal fixed topology can improve the relative CO 2 emission reduction between 2 % and 8 %...|$|R

40|$|Sex-role reversal, {{in which}} males care for offspring, can occur when mate {{competition}} is stronger between females than males. Secondary sex traits and mate attracting displays in sex-role-reversed species are usually {{more pronounced in}} females than in males. The red phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius) is a textbook example of a sex-role-reversed species. It is generally agreed that males are responsible for all incubation and parental care duties, whereas females typically desert males after having completed a clutch and may pair with new males to lay <b>additional</b> <b>clutches.</b> The breeding plumage of female red phalaropes is usually more brightly colored than male plumage, a reversed sexual dichromatism usually associated with sex-role reversal. Here, we confirm with PCR-based sexing that male red phalaropes can exhibit both the red body plumage typical of a female and the incubation behavior typical of a male. Our result, combined with previous observations of brightly colored red phalaropes incubating nests at the same arctic location (Igloolik Island, Nunavut, Canada), suggests that plumage dichromatism alone may {{not be sufficient to}} distinguish males from females in this breeding population of red phalaropes. This stresses the need for more systematic genetic sexing combined with standardized description of intersexual differences in red phalarope plumages. Determining whether such female-like plumage on males is a result of phenotypic plasticity or genetic variation could contribute to further understanding sex-role reversal strategies in the short Arctic summer...|$|R

50|$|For 1990, Ford {{introduced}} an electronically-controlled four-wheel drive system {{as an option}} for the Aerostar.

The system shifted traction to the front wheels as it detected rear wheel spin, with no driver input required.

40|$|Alternative {{hypotheses}} {{of hybrid}} zones make specific predictions about reproductive components of fitness in the hybrids. The dynamic-equilibrium and reinforcement hypotheses are premised on reduced hybrid fitness, {{which should be}} apparent as reduced clutch or brood size or as increased embryonic mortality. The hybrid-superiority and introgression hypotheses predict normal clutch and brood size and embryonic mortality. Reproductive success was measured at four study sites on a transect across the hybrid zone between the Yellow- (Colaptes auratus auratus) and Red-shafted (C. a. cafer) subspecies of the Northern Flicker. Two <b>additional</b> <b>clutch</b> size samples representing pure Yellow- and Redshafted flickers were obtained from museum egg collections. Mean clutch size {{did not differ significantly}} among the six samples. Factorial ANOVAs showed that early clutches and broods are larger than late clutches and broods, but no significant difference was detected between hybrid and parental study sites. Analyses of the effect of phenotype (yellow-shafted, red-shafted, hybrid) also suggest that neither clutch size nor brood size is affected, with the exception that hybrid males sired significantly smaller broods. Finally, there were no significant effects of type of cross (red-shafted male x hybrid female, etc.) on the ratio broodsize / clutch-size. The only evidence for reduced hybrid fitness was in the test where males with hybrid phenotypes appear to have sired small broods. This may indicate that abnormal behavior of hybrid males affects female fecundity, but it is also plausible that this marginally significant result is a type I statistical error. The overall lack of evidence for reduced hybrid fitness is inconsistent with either the dynamic-equilibrium or reinforcement models. Of the two remaining alternatives, the bounded hybrid-superiority model appears the more likely explanation of the Northern Flicker hybrid zone because earlier work (Moore and Buchanan 1985) showed that the hybrid zone is not becoming broader, as predicted by the introgression model...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model {{framework}} for the simulation of growth and reproduction of Daphnia at varying conditions of food concentration and temperature. The core of our framework consists of an individual level model that simulates allocation of assimilated carbon into somatic growth, maintenance costs, and reproduction {{on the basis of}} a closed carbon budget. A fixed percentage of assimilated carbon is allocated into somatic growth and maintenance costs. Special physiological adaptations in energy acquisition and usage allow realistic model performance even at very low food concentrations close to minimal food requirements. All model parameters are based on physiological measures taken from the literature. Model outputs were thoroughly validated on data from a life-table experiment with Daphnia galeata. For the first time, a successful model validation was performed at such low food concentrations. The escalator boxcar train (EBT) was used to integrate this individual level model into a stage-structured population model. In advance to previous applications of the EBT to Daphnia we included an <b>additional</b> <b>clutch</b> compartment into the model structure that accounts for the characteristic time delay between egg deposition and hatching in cladocerans. By linking two levels of biological organisation, this model approach represents a comprehensive framework for studying Daphnia both at laboratory conditions and in the field. We compared outputs of our stage-structured model with predictions by two other models having analogous parameterisation: (i) another individual level Daphnia model (Kooijman–Metz model) and (ii) a classical unstructured population model. In contrast to our Daphnia model, the Kooijman–Metz model lacks the structure to account for the optimisation of energy acquisition and maintenance requirements by individual daphnids. The unstructured population model showed different patterns of population dynamics that were not in concordance with typical patterns observed in the field. Thus, we conclude our model provides a comprehensive tool for the simulation of growth and reproduction of Daphnia and corresponding population dynamics.
