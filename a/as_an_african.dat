Wanting {{to make a}} statement about urban life <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> American in the South, OutKast wrote and recorded the album as teenagers and addressed coming of age topics with the album's songs. They also incorporated repetitive hooks and Southern slang in their lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{left for}} Basic Combat Training in November 1946. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> American, {{he entered the}} Army {{at a time when}} it was still segregated. In 1948, U.S. {{president}} Harry S. Truman ordered desegregation of the U.S. military with Executive Order 9981. However, many units remained de facto segregated, with African Americans mostly being pooled into service units and non-combat duties. It would be several years before troops were fully integrated.|$|E
5|$|Carine Ngarlemdana {{made her}} Olympic debut at the 2012 games. At {{the time she}} was 17 years of age. She was the flag bearer at both the opening and closing ceremonies. She was the third Chadian in Olympic history to compete in a judo event. Ngarlemdana {{qualified}} for the 70 kilogram event <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> Judo Union qualifier. On 1 August Ngarlemdana competed {{in the first round of}} her event. She was drawn against Sally Conway (Great Britain). Ngarlemdana lost 0002—1110 and was therefore eliminated from the competition. Overall she finished joint 17th and, along with five other athletes, last in the competition.|$|E

5|$|Copeland was {{appointed}} a soloist at ABT in August 2007, {{one of the}} youngest ABT dancers promoted to soloist. Although, she was described by early accounts as the first African American woman promoted to soloist for ABT, Anne Benna Sims and Nora Kimball were soloists with ABT in the 1980s. Male soloist Keith Lee also preceded her. As of 2008, Copeland was the only African-American woman in the dance company during her entire ABT career. The only male African American in the company during her career, Danny Tidwell, left in 2005. In an international ballet community with a lack of diversity, she was so unusual <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> American ballerina, that she endured cultural isolation. She has been described in the press as the Jackie Robinson of classical ballet.|$|E
5|$|The other pirates {{on trial}} were Manuel Aponte Monteverde of Añasco; Vicente del Valle Carbajal of Punta Espada (or Santo Domingo, {{depending}} on the report); Vicente Ximénes of Cumaná; Antonio Delgado of Humacao; Victoriano Saldaña of Juncos; Agustín de Soto of San Germán; Carlos Díaz of Trinidad de Barlovento; Carlos Torres of Fajardo; Juan Manuel Fuentes of Havana, and José Rodríguez of Curaçao. Torres stood out <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> and Cofresí's slave. Among the few sentenced for piracy who were not executed, his sentence was to be sold at public auction with his price earmarked for trial costs. Cofresí confessed to capturing a French sloop in Vieques; a Danish schooner; a sailing ship from St. Thomas; a brigatine and a schooner from the Dominican Republic; a sloop with a load of cattle in Boca del Infierno; a ship from which he stole 800 pieces of eight in Patillas, and an American schooner with a cargo worth 8,000 pieces of eight (abandoned and burned in Punta de Peñones).|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Franco, there was a pro-independence armed {{movement}} based in Algeria, the Movement for the Independence and Self-determination of the Canaries Archipelago (MAIAC).

25|$|This has {{resulted}} in less food available for human consumption, especially in developing and least developed countries, where a family's daily allowances for food purchases are extremely limited. The crisis can be seen, in a sense, to dichotomize rich and poor nations, since, for example, filling a tank of an average car with biofuel, amounts to as much maize (Africa's principal food staple) <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> person consumes in an entire year.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} base of the mountain, the Matterhorn is {{composed}} of gneiss belonging to the Dent Blanche klippe, an isolated part of the Austroalpine nappes, lying over the Penninic nappes. The Austroalpine nappes are part of the Apulian plate, a small continent which broke up from Africa before the Alpine orogeny. For this reason the Matterhorn has been popularized <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> mountain. The Austroalpine nappes are mostly common in the Eastern Alps.|$|E
25|$|Olaudah Equiano (Gustavus Vassa) {{published}} his memoir, {{one of the}} genre of {{what became known as}} slave narratives - accounts by slaves who achieved freedom. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> with direct experience of the slave trade and slavery, Equiano was pleased that his book became highly influential in the anti-slavery movement. Clarkson wrote to the Rev. Mr. Jones at Trinity College, to introduce Equiano to him and the community. He asked for aid from the Rev. Jones in selling copies of the memoir and arranging for Equiano to visit Cambridge to lecture.|$|E

She was slower than Maria Konovalova on the final leg, but maintained Kenya's lead to win the women's title. The team's time of 2:13:35 hours was later ratified <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> record for the ekiden marathon relay.|$|E

25|$|In {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, Kongo artists began making crucifixes and other {{religious}} objects that depicted Jesus <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African.</b> Such objects produced by many workshops over a long period (given their variety) reflect that emerging belief that Kongo was a central part of the Christian world, and fundamental to its history. A story of the eighteenth century was that the partially ruined cathedral of São Salvador, originally constructed for the Jesuits in 1549 and eventually elevated to cathedral status, was actually built overnight by angels. It was called affectionately, Nkulumbimbi. Pope John Paul II would eventually say mass at this cathedral in 1992.|$|E
25|$|Gerry Canavan {{argues that}} Wild Seed {{challenges}} conventional fantasies of race by having Doro’s eugenics project supersede that of Europe’s by millennia. In this “alternate history,” “America itself--now {{transformed into a}} blip between the secret history of Doro's experiments and the brutal aftermath of their horrible success--becomes retold here <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> story, in an Africanist recentering of history {{that serves as a}} strongly anti-colonialist provocation, even if the results are mostly anti-utopian.” Still, while Doro’s eugenic project turns out a “superpowered blackness” that negates notions of white supremacy, his exploitation of his people as mere genetic experiments echoes the breeding methods of New World slave owners, thus replicating the actual history of racial slavery practiced by the Western world.|$|E
25|$|It was {{previously}} classified <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> {{variant of the}} Eurasian golden jackal, {{with at least one}} subspecies (Canis anthus lupaster) having been classified as a grey wolf. In 2015, a series of analyses on the species' mitochondrial DNA and nuclear genome demonstrated that it was in fact distinct from both the golden jackal and the grey wolf, and more closely related to grey wolves and coyotes. It is nonetheless still close enough to the golden jackal to produce hybrid offspring, as indicated through genetic tests on jackals in Israel and a 19th-century captive crossbreeding experiment. As the IUCN's golden jackal page has not been updated since 2008, it has yet to recognise the distinctiveness of the African wolf; thus its conservation status has not been evaluated, and no reliable population estimates are available.|$|E

25|$|Language, {{linguistics}} {{and discourse}} are active {{areas of study}} in the humanities, along with literature and the arts. Discourse analysis seeks to reveal the meaning of race and the actions of racists through careful study {{of the ways in}} which these factors of human society are described and discussed in various written and oral works. Van Dijk (1992), for example, examines the different ways in which descriptions of racism and racist actions are depicted by the perpetrators of such actions as well as by their victims. He notes that when descriptions of actions have negative implications for the majority, and especially for white elites, they are often seen as controversial and such controversial interpretations are typically marked with quotation marks or they are greeted with expressions of distance or doubt. The previously cited book, The Souls of Black Folk by W.E.B. Du Bois, represents early African-American literature that describes the author's experiences with racism when he was traveling in the South <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> American.|$|E

Olugbala means “love for the people” in Yoruba. She now {{identified}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> and felt her old name no longer fit: “It sounded so strange when people called me Joanne.
