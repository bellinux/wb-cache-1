25|$|The case of BCIs {{today has}} {{parallels}} in medicine, as will its evolution.

Researchers <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that sound ethical guidelines, appropriately moderated enthusiasm in media coverage and education about BCI systems will be of utmost importance for the societal acceptance of this technology. Thus, recently more effort is made inside the BCI community to create consensus on ethical guidelines for BCI research, development and dissemination.|$|E

25|$|Failing {{to respond}} to {{physiological}} warning signals or crossing mental barrier by strong will may lead to blackout underwater or on reaching the surface. Trained freedivers <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of this and competitions must be held under strict supervision and with competent first-aiders on standby. However this does not eliminate the risk of blackout. Freedivers are recommended to only dive with a 'buddy' who accompanies them, observing from in the water at the surface, and ready to dive to the rescue if the diver loses consciousness during the ascent. Due {{to the nature of}} the sport, any practice of freediving must include strict adherence to safety measures as an integral part of the activity, and all participants must also be adept in rescue and resuscitation. Without proper training and supervision, competitive freediving/apnea/breath-hold diving is extremely dangerous.|$|E
25|$|The basic social unit of {{the tiger}} is the {{elemental}} one of mother and offspring. Adult animals congregate only on an ad hoc and transitory basis when special conditions permit, such as plentiful supply of food. Otherwise they lead solitary lives, hunting individually for the dispersed forest and tall grassland animals, upon which they prey. They establish and maintain home ranges. Resident adults of either sex tend to confine their movements to a definite area of habitat within which they satisfy their needs, {{and in the case}} of tigresses, those of their growing cubs. Besides providing the requirements of an adequate food supply, sufficient water and shelter, and a modicum of peace and seclusion, this location must make it possible for the resident to maintain contact with other tigers, especially those of the opposite sex. Those sharing the same ground <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of each other's movements and activities.|$|E

500|$|In The Indian Pilgrim (1818) Sherwood {{tried to}} adapt Pilgrim's Progress for the Indian context; the work focused on [...] "the {{supposed}} depravity and pagan idolatry of Brahmans, fakirs, nautch (dance) girls, and soldiers' temporary wives." [...] This text demonstrates Sherwood's religious biases: [...] "Muslims and Jews receive better treatment than Hindus {{because of their}} belief in one God, but Roman Catholics fare little better than the Hindu idolaters." [...] The Indian Pilgrim, although never published in India, was popular in Britain and America. Sherwood also wrote texts for Indian servants of British families {{in the style of}} British writings for the poor. One of these was The Ayah and Lady (1813) in which the ayah, or maid, is [...] "portrayed as sly, selfish, lazy, and untrustworthy. Her employers <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of her faults, yet they tolerate her." [...] A more culturally sensitive and realistic portrayal of Indians appears in The Last Days of Boosy (1842), a sequel to The History of Little Henry and his Bearer, in which the converted Boosy is cast out of his family and community because of his conversion to Christianity.|$|E
500|$|A 2005 study led by Margo Lillie, a {{zoologist}} at the University of British Columbia, and her student Tracy Boechler, {{concluded that}} tipping a cow {{would require a}} force of nearly [...] and is therefore impossible to accomplish by a single person. Her calculations found that it would require more than four people to apply enough force to push over a cow, based on an estimate that a single person could exert [...] of force. However, since a cow can brace itself, Lillie and Boechler suggested that five or six people would, most likely, be needed. Further, cattle <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of their surroundings and {{are very difficult to}} surprise, due to excellent senses of both smell and hearing. Lillie and Boechler's analysis found that if a cow did not move, the principles of static physics suggest that two people might be able to tip a cow if its centre of mass were pushed over its hooves before the cow could react. However, cows are not rigid or unresponsive, and the faster humans have to move, the less force they can exert. Thus Lillie and Boechler concluded that it is unlikely that cows can actually be tipped over in this way. Lillie stated, [...] "It just makes the physics of it all, in my opinion, impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|Lohan's next {{appearance}} was in Chapter 27 as a John Lennon fan who befriends Mark David Chapman, played by Jared Leto, {{on the day}} he murders Lennon. Filming finished in early 2006, but the film was not released until March 2008 due to difficulties in finding a distributor. In May 2007, the drama Georgia Rule was released. In the film, Lohan portrays an out-of-control teenager whose mother (Felicity Huffman) brings her to the house of her own estranged mother (Jane Fonda). Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Lohan hits a true note of spiteful princess narcissism." [...] During filming in 2006, Lohan was hospitalized, her representative saying [...] "she was overheated and dehydrated." [...] At the time Lohan was going through a breakup with Hard Rock Cafe heir Harry Morton, which contributed to her problems on the set, according to Allure. In a letter that was made public, studio executive James G. Robinson called Lohan [...] "irresponsible and unprofessional." [...] He mentioned [...] "various late arrivals and absences from the set" [...] and said that [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called 'exhaustion.'" [...] In 2007, Lohan was cast in the film Poor Things. But in May of that year, she was arrested on a charge of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} (DUI.) The film's producers initially voiced support, and production was put on hold, as Lohan entered the Promises Treatment Center rehabilitation facility where she stayed for 45 days. She ultimately lost the Poor Things part. In July, less than two weeks out of rehab, Lohan was arrested a second time on charges of possession of cocaine, driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license. In August, Lohan pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine use and driving under the influence and was sentenced to an alcohol education program, community service, one day in jail, and was given three years probation. Lohan released a statement in which she said [...] "it is clear to me that my life has become completely unmanageable because I am addicted to alcohol and drugs." [...] The same month she entered the Cirque Lodge Treatment Center in Sundance, Utah for a third stint at rehabilitation, staying for three months until her discharge in October. In November Lohan served 84 minutes in jail. A sheriff spokesman cited overcrowding and the nonviolent nature of the crime as reasons for the reduced sentence.|$|E

In the U.S., many labor activists have blamed John Sweeney, the former (1995–2009) President of the AFL-CIO, for not doing enough to organize.

Many unions see organizing as a way to ensure the future of their organization. [...] Unions who emphasize organizing and are expansionist are said to have the [...] "organizing model."

The South African Navy was impressed by the testing of a German 155mm PzH2000 gun turret in December 2002 aboard the German Navy frigate Hamburg, replacing the 76mm naval gun and a later test aboard the German frigate Hessen. In January 2006, the Jane's International Defence Review reported that the [...] "development" [...] of the MONARC (modular naval artillery concept) naval 155-millimetre gun turret has been expedited following what the contractor Rheinmetall described as the turret's [...] "tentative pre-selection" [...] as part of the armament solution for the German Navy's future F125 class frigate development program. Unfortunately issues with recoil have derailed most 155mm naval gun programs, including MONARC. Solutions are converging, instead, on very long-range guided shells like Oto Melara's Vulcano.|$|E
