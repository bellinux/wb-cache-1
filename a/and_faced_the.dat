5|$|Dunfermline Athletic {{entered the}} second round after {{receiving}} a bye {{in the first round}} draw <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> First Division club and previous season's runners-up, Clyde, at Broadwood Stadium. Mark Burchill scored first for Dunfermline in the 26th minute with Ruari MacLennan equalising for Clyde one minute into the second half. Owen Morrison scored Dunfermline's second goal after 57 minutes before he and Burchill both scored again to make it 4–1 and win the match.|$|E

The Pirates won the NL East that year <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> Reds in the 1972 NLCS. The Pirates pitched Ellis {{with a sore}} arm, but the Reds won the series.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 the French {{clinched}} {{their third}} Grand Slam; at Twickenham against England.

In that tournament they came from behind numerous times to defeat the Wallabies in their semi-final, <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> All Blacks in final at Eden Park, Auckland; France lost 29–9. They shared the Five Nations with Wales the next year, and also won it in 1989.|$|E

5|$|James II's statue {{has stood}} in several {{locations}} {{since it was}} first erected. It originally stood in the Palace of Whitehall's Pebble Court, where it was installed on New Year's Day, 1686. It was situated behind the Banqueting House <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> river, a position which attracted much satirical comment after James' flight from London during the Glorious Revolution of 1688; {{it was said that}} the statue's location indicated his method of escape.|$|E
5|$|Smithfield Market, a Grade II listed-covered market building, was {{designed}} by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, and is the dominant architectural feature of the area. Some of its original market premises fell into disuse in the late 20th century <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> prospect of demolition. The Corporation of London's public enquiry in 2012 drew widespread support for an urban regeneration plan intent upon preserving Smithfield's historical identity.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{finished}} with an 11–3 record in 1963 <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field in Chicago, the Giants' defense played well, but the Bears newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times and battered him throughout the game. Sherman resisted calls from {{players such as}} linebacker Sam Huff to replace the struggling Tittle. The Giants defense held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat.|$|E

5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
5|$|A fifth-place {{finish in}} the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were not {{guaranteed}} entry into the Champions League, <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> prospect {{of not being able}} to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face a team from England in the group stages. This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.|$|E
5|$|Alves and Van-Dunem {{planned to}} arrest Neto on 21 May before {{he arrived at}} a meeting of the Central Committee and before the {{commission}} released its report on the activities of the Nitistas. However, the MPLA changed the location of the meeting shortly before its scheduled start, throwing the plotters' plans into disarray, but Alves attended the meeting <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> commission anyway. The commission released its report, accusing him of factionalism. Alves fought back, denouncing Neto for not aligning Angola with the Soviet Union. After twelve hours of debate, the party voted 26 to 6 to dismiss Alves and Van-Dunem from their positions.|$|E

While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge in the polls and posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012, but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren. He subsequently joined the board of directors of Kadant paper company, joined Fox News as a commentator, and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services.|$|E

5|$|Following the loss, Virginia Tech was 2–2 on the season, <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> {{potential}} of being ineligible for a postseason bowl game {{if it did}} not improve its winning percentage. The Hokies won their next eight games, finishing the season with a 10–2 record. With late-season wins over perennial rival, 16th-ranked Virginia, and fellow ACC newcomer, ninth-ranked Miami, Virginia Tech clinched the ACC football championship (the last year in which it would be decided without a conference championship game) and a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game. Because the ACC's normal bowl destination, the Orange Bowl, was hosting the national championship game, Virginia Tech was selected to attend the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, instead.|$|E

On August 19, he faced the Browns and pitched a one-hitter, <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> minimum 27 batters in the process. Houtteman ended the season just short of Ted Gray's prediction of 20 victories, and finished {{the season with a}} 19–12 record. He led the league in shutouts with four and was second in games started with 34, second in innings pitched with 274.7, third in wins, and third in complete games with 21. His ERA of 3.54 was good for fifth in the American League. He also earned six points in MVP voting, and finished tied for 24th. On October 2, the day after the 1950 season ended, Houtteman married Shelagh Marie Kelly. They met in New York's Catskill Mountains at Grossinger's Resort.|$|E

The Reds reached the playoffs, <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> San Francisco Giants in the 2012 National League Division Series (NLDS). On October 11, 2012, Latos gave up a grand slam to Buster Posey in a 6-run top of the fifth inning in the elimination game of the NLDS. Latos took the loss in this game, as the Reds were eliminated.|$|E

5|$|Jagiello's baptism {{failed to}} end the crusade of the Teutonic Knights, who claimed his {{conversion}} was a sham, perhaps even a heresy, and renewed their incursions on the pretext that pagans remained in Lithuania. From then on, however, the Order found it harder to sustain {{the cause of a}} crusade <b>and</b> <b>faced</b> <b>the</b> growing threat to its existence posed by the Kingdom of Poland and a genuinely Christian Lithuania alliance. Władysław sponsored the creation of the diocese of Vilnius under bishop Andrzej Wasilko, the former confessor of Elisabeth of Hungary. The bishopric, which included Samogitia, then largely controlled by the Teutonic Order, was subordinated to the see of Gniezno and not to that of Teutonic Königsberg. The decision may not have improved Władysław's relations with the Order, but it served to introduce closer ties between Lithuania and Poland, enabling the Polish church to freely assist its Lithuanian counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Looking for a 3-peat, the Heat {{dominated}} the 2014 postseason, going 12–3 {{in the first}} three rounds.

With James limited in Game 1 due to leg cramps, the Spurs ended the game on a 31–9 run, winning the game 110–95. The Heat would win Game 2, but that would be their only win of the series, as the Spurs would win Games 3, 4, and 5 to win the Championship, their first since 2007 and the fifth and final title of Duncan's career. Kawhi Leonard was named Finals MVP, becoming the third-youngest Finals MVP after Duncan and Magic Johnson.|$|E

They lost again, this time in a far less dramatic game, 31–16. Led by quarterback Y. A. Tittle and head coach Allie Sherman, the Giants won three consecutive Eastern Division titles from 1961–1963. In 1961, they were beaten 37–0 by the Packers. In 1962, {{they went into the}} championship game with a league-best 12–2 record and a nine–game winning streak, but they lost to the Packers again, 16–7.|$|E
