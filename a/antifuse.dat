50|$|The <b>antifuse</b> {{is usually}} {{triggered}} using an approximately 5 mA current. With a poly-diffusion <b>antifuse,</b> the high current density creates heat, which melts a thin insulating layer between polysilicon and diffusion electrodes, creating a permanent resistive silicon link.|$|E
50|$|An <b>antifuse</b> is an {{electrical}} device that performs the opposite function to a fuse. Whereas a fuse {{starts with a}} low resistance and is designed to permanently break {{an electrical}}ly conductive path (typically when the current through the path exceeds a specified limit), an <b>antifuse</b> starts with a high resistance and is designed to permanently create an electrically conductive path (typically when the voltage across the <b>antifuse</b> exceeds a certain level). This technology has many applications.|$|E
5000|$|Commercially {{available}} semiconductor antifuse-based OTP memory arrays {{have been}} around at least since 1969, with initial <b>antifuse</b> bit cells dependent on blowing a capacitor between crossing conductive lines. Texas Instruments developed a MOS gate oxide breakdown <b>antifuse</b> in 1979. [...] A dual-gate-oxide two-transistor (2T) MOS <b>antifuse</b> was introduced in 1982. [...] Early oxide breakdown technologies exhibited a variety of scaling, programming, size and manufacturing problems that prevented volume production of memory devices based on these technologies.|$|E
50|$|Silicon <b>antifuses</b> are {{connections}} {{that are made}} by applying a voltage across a modified area of silicon inside the chip. They are called <b>antifuses</b> because they work in the opposite way to normal fuses, which begin life as connections until they are broken by an electric current.|$|R
50|$|<b>Antifuses</b> {{are widely}} used to {{permanently}} program integrated circuits (ICs).|$|R
50|$|Dielectric <b>antifuses</b> {{employ a}} very thin oxide barrier between a pair of conductors. Formation of the {{conductive}} channel is performed by a dielectric breakdown forced by a high voltage pulse. Dielectric <b>antifuses</b> are usually employed in CMOS and BiCMOS processes as the required oxide layer thickness is lower than those available in bipolar processes.|$|R
50|$|Although antifuse-based PROM {{has been}} {{available}} for decades, it wasn’t available in standard CMOS until 2001 when Kilopass Technology Inc. patented 1T, 2T, and 3.5T <b>antifuse</b> bit cell technologies using a standard CMOS process, enabling integration of PROM into logic CMOS chips. The first process node <b>antifuse</b> can be implemented in standard CMOS is 0.18 um. Since the gate oxide breakdown {{is less than the}} junction breakdown, special diffusion steps were not required to create the <b>antifuse</b> programming element. In 2005, a split channel <b>antifuse</b> device was introduced by Sidense. This split channel bit cell combines the thick (IO) and thin (gate) oxide devices into one transistor (1T) with a common polysilicon gate.|$|E

5000|$|Antifuses {{are best}} known for their use in mini-light (or miniature) style {{low-voltage}} Christmas tree lights. Ordinarily (for operation from mains voltages), the lamps are wired in series. (The larger, traditional, C7 and C9 style lights are wired in parallel and are rated to operate directly at mains voltage.) Because the series string would be rendered inoperable by a single lamp failing, each bulb has an <b>antifuse</b> installed within it. When the bulb blows, the entire mains voltage is applied across the single blown lamp. This rapidly causes the <b>antifuse</b> to short out the blown bulb, allowing the series circuit to resume functioning, albeit with {{a larger proportion of}} the mains voltage now applied to each of the remaining lamps. The <b>antifuse</b> is made using wire with a high resistance coating and this wire is coiled over the two vertical filament support wires inside the bulb. The insulation of the <b>antifuse</b> wire withstands the ordinary low voltage imposed across a functioning lamp but rapidly breaks down under the full mains voltage, giving the <b>antifuse</b> action. Occasionally, the insulation fails to break down on its own, but tapping the blown lamp will usually finish the job. Often a special bulb with no <b>antifuse</b> and often a slightly different rating (so it blows first as the voltage gets too high) known as a [...] "fuse bulb" [...] is incorporated into the string of lights to protect against the possibility of severe overcurrent if too many bulbs fail.|$|E
50|$|The Zener <b>antifuses</b> can be {{made without}} {{additional}} manufacturing steps with most CMOS, BiCMOS and bipolar processes; hence their popularity in analog and mixed-signal circuits. They are historically used especially with bipolar processes, where the thin oxide needed for dielectric <b>antifuses</b> is not available. Their disadvantage, however, is lower area efficiency compared to other types.|$|R
40|$|Electroluminescence (EL) {{spectra of}} {{nanoscale}} diodes formed after gate-oxide breakdown of n+-polysilicon/oxide/p+-substrate metal–oxide–semiconductor capacitors were measured in reverse and forward bias. The nanoscale diodes, called diode <b>antifuses,</b> {{are created by}} {{the formation of a}} small link between the n+-poly and the p+-substrate with the properties of a diode. A previously published multimechanism model for avalanche emission from conventional silicon p–n junctions is applied to fit the EL spectra in reverse-biased silicon-diode <b>antifuses.</b> The results show that the light from reverse-biased diode <b>antifuses</b> is caused by the same phenomena as in conventional p–n junctions. Forward-bias spectra of the diode <b>antifuses</b> show different shapes when lightly or highly doped p substrates are used. In the case of a lightly doped p substrate, the EL intensity in the forward mode is increased by about two orders of magnitude in the visible-wavelength range with a maximum intensity in the infrared region. A phonon-assisted electron–hole recombination model is applied to fit the low-energy part of emitted spectra. The visible emission is attributed to the Fowler–Nordheim tunneling current through the SiO 2, enabled presumably by electron capture into SiO 2 trap levels and intraband transition of hot electrons injected into the Si bulk...|$|R
5000|$|Programmable {{read-only}} memory (PROM), or one-time programmable ROM (OTP), {{can be written}} to or programmed via a special device called a PROM programmer. Typically, this device uses high voltages to permanently destroy or create internal links (fuses or <b>antifuses)</b> within the chip. Consequently, a PROM can only be programmed once.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{programmable}} logic devices (PLDs), such as structured ASICs, use <b>antifuse</b> technology to configure logic circuits {{and create a}} customized design from a standard IC design. <b>Antifuse</b> PLDs are one time programmable in contrast to other PLDs that are SRAM based and which may be reprogrammed to fix logic bugs or add new functions. <b>Antifuse</b> PLDs have advantages over SRAM based PLDs in that like ASICs, {{they do not need}} to be configured each time power is applied. They may be less susceptible to alpha particles which can cause circuits to malfunction. Also circuits built via the antifuse's permanent conductive paths may be faster than similar circuits implemented in PLDs using SRAM technology. QuickLogic Corporation refers to their antifuses as [...] "ViaLinks" [...] because blown fuses create a connection between two crossing layers of wiring on the chip in the same way that a via on a printed circuit board creates a connection between copper layers.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Actel {{acquired}} GateField which expanded Actel's <b>antifuse</b> FPGA {{offering to}} include flash-based FPGAs. In 2004, Actel announced it had shipped the one-millionth unit of its flash-based ProASICPLUS FPGA.|$|E
50|$|Actel's <b>antifuse</b> FPGAs {{have been}} known for their nonvolatility, live at {{power-up}} operation, single-chip form factor, and security. Actel's flash-based FPGA families include these same characteristics and are also reprogrammable and low power.|$|E
40|$|In FPGAs the routing {{resources}} are fixed and their usage is {{constrained by the}} location of <b>antifuses.</b> In addition, the <b>antifuses</b> affect the layout performance significantly, depending on the technology. Hence, simplistic placement level assumptions {{turn out to be}} grossly inadequate in predicting the timing and wirability behavior of a layout. There is a need, therefore, for a layout technique which changes the layout at placement level based on accurate post-layout timing analysis and net wirability. In this paper we consider such a wirability and performance driven layout flow for row-based FPGAs. Timing information from a post-layout timing analyzer and wirability information from global and channel routers are used by an incremental placer to effectively perturb the placement. A large improvement (up to 29 %) in timing, has been obtained (compared to non-iterative FPGA layout) for a set of industrial designs and benchmark examples...|$|R
40|$|Transistor aging through {{negative}} bias {{temperature instability}} (NBTI) {{has become a}} major lifetime constraint in VLSI circuits. We propose a technique that uses <b>antifuses</b> to widen PMOS transistors later in a circuit?s life cycle to combat aging. Using HSPICE and 70 nm BPTM process numbers, we simulated the technique on four circuits (a ring oscillator, a fan-out four circuit, an ISCAS c 432 and c 2670). Over the lifetime of the circuit, our simulations predict a 8. 89 % and a 13 % improvement in power in the c 432 and c 2670 circuits respectively when compared to similarly performing traditional circuits...|$|R
50|$|Zener zap is {{frequently}} employed in mixed-signal circuits for trimming values of analog components. For example a precision resistor can be manufactured by forming several series resistors with Zeners in parallel (oriented to be nonconductive during normal {{operation of the}} device) and then shorting selected Zeners to shunt the unwanted resistors. By this approach, it is possible only to lower {{the value of the}} resulting resistor. It is therefore necessary to shift the manufacturing tolerances so that the lowest-value typically made is equal to or larger than the desired value. The parallel resistors cannot have too low value as that would sink the zapping current; a series-parallel combination of resistors and <b>antifuses</b> is employed in such cases.|$|R
50|$|Antifuses {{may be used}} in {{programmable}} {{read-only memory}} (PROM). Each bit contains both a fuse and an <b>antifuse</b> and is programmed by triggering one of the two. This programming, performed after manufacturing, is permanent and irreversible.|$|E
50|$|Actel also {{develops}} system-critical FPGAs (RTAX and ProASIC3 families), including extended temperature automotive, military, {{and aerospace}} FPGAs, plus {{a wide variety}} of space-class radiation-tolerant devices. These flash and <b>antifuse</b> FPGAs have high levels of reliability and firm-error immunity.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} NPN transistor {{structure is}} often used in common bipolar processes as the <b>antifuse.</b> A specialized structure optimized for the purpose can be employed where the <b>antifuse</b> {{is an integral part}} of the design. The terminals of the antifuses are usually accessible as bonding pads and the trimming process is performed before wire-bonding and encapsulating the chip. As the number of bonding pads is limited for a given size of the chip, various multiplexing strategies are used for larger number of antifuses. In some cases a combined circuit with zeners and transistors can be used to form a zapping matrix; with additional zeners, the trimming (which uses voltages higher than the normal operational voltage of the chip) can be performed even after packaging the chip.|$|E
40|$|We present two new {{techniques}} that enhance conventional {{focused ion beam}} (FIB) system capabilities for integrated circuit (IC) analysis: in situ electrical biasing and voltage contrast imaging. We have used in situ electrical biasing to enable a number of advanced failure analysis applications including (1) real time evaluation of device electrical behavior during milling and deposition, (2) verification of IC functional modifications without removal from the FIB system, and (3) ultraprecision control for cross sectioning of deep submicron structures, such as programmed amorphous silicon <b>antifuses.</b> We have also developed FIB system voltage contrast imaging {{that can be used}} for a variety of failure analysis applications. The use of passive voltage contrast imaging for defect localization and for navigation on planarized devices will be illustrated. In addition, we describe new, biased voltage contrast imaging techniques and provide examples of their application to the failure analysis of complex ICs. We discuss the necessary changes in system operating parameters to perform biased voltage contrast imaging...|$|R
40|$|FPGAs {{combine the}} logic {{integration}} benefits of custom VLSI with the design, production, and time-to-market advantages of standard logic ICs. The Actel family of FPGAs exemplifies the row-based FPGA model. Rows of logic cells interspersed with routing channels have given this family of FPGA devices {{the flavor of}} traditional channeled gate arrays or standard cells. However, unlike the conventional standard cell design, the FPGA routing channels contain predefined wiring segments of various lengths which are interconnected using <b>antifuses.</b> This paper develops analytical models that permit the design of FPGA channel architecture and {{the analysis of the}} routability of row-based FPGAs devices based on a generic characterization of the row-based FPGA routing algorithms. In particular, it demonstrates that (using probabilistic models for the origination point and length of connections), an FPGA with properly designed segment length and distribution can be nearly as efficient as a mask-programmable channel (in terms of number of required tracks). Experimental results corroborate this prediction. This paper does not address specifics of the routing algorithms, but investigates the design of the channel segmentation architecture (i. e., various lengths and patterns of segments and connections among these segments) in order to increase the probability of successful routing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{application}} note describes FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) {{and how they}} can hold the key functions and the intellectual property (IP) of a system. It discusses ways to protect IP against piracy. SHA- 1 challenge-and-response authentication is judged as the most secure methodology. This document presents a cost-effective authentication scheme that protects IP in SRAM-based FPGA designs. The DS 28 E 01 and DS 28 CN 01 devices are featured. This {{application note}} appeared as an article in Electronic Design magazine and on the publisher's website in July, 2008. Over the past two decades, the FPGA (field-programmable gate array) has transitioned from a prototyping tool to a flexible production solution in both consumer and industrial applications. With FPGA logic complexity increasing from a few thousand gates to millions of gates, the devices can hold more of the key functions (i. e., the intellectual property, IP) of a system. Today, designers can select FPGAs that employ various technologies to hold the configuration data—OTP (one-time programmable) <b>antifuses,</b> reprogrammable flash-based storage cells, and reprogrammable SRAM-based configurable logic cells. Both antifuse- and flash-based solutions provide relatively secure solutions, since the configuration data is stored on the FPGA chip and there are mechanisms that prevent the stored data from being read out. Moreover, unless very sophisticated schemes such as depacking, microprobing, voltage contrast electron-beam microscopy, and focused-ion-beam (FIB) probing are used to pry into the silicon and to disable security mechanisms, 1 it is very unlikely that the data will be compromised.

50|$|One {{approach}} for the ICs that use <b>antifuse</b> technology employs a thin barrier of non-conducting amorphous silicon between two metal conductors. When a sufficiently high voltage is applied across the amorphous silicon it is {{turned into a}} polycrystalline silicon-metal alloy with a low resistance, which is conductive.|$|E
50|$|FPGAs {{that store}} their {{configuration}} internally in nonvolatile flash memory, such as Microsemi's ProAsic 3 or Lattice's XP2 programmable devices, do not expose the bitstream {{and do not}} need encryption.

40|$|The {{possible}} use of programmable integrated circuit interconnect vias using an indirectly heated phase change material is evaluated. Process development and materials investigations are examined. Devices capable of multiple cycles between on/off states for reconfigurable applications {{have been successfully}} demonstrated in a standard CMOS-compatible technology. Building computer chips with these vias would create {{a new kind of}} field programmable gate array (FPGA), whereby the design can be reconfigured depending on its application. The phase change reprogrammable-via is nonvolatile, unlike SRAM-based technology. It also has a relatively low on-state resistance and occupies less real estate on the chip. As the "switches" are placed at the metallization level, it provides flexibility for the designer to place them. Programmable-via can operate at a relatively low voltage compared to FLASH-based technology. Similar to the case of <b>antifuses,</b> programmable-via interconnect structures are projected to be radiation hard. However, the most challenging part of implementation is the circuit design. Issues such as integration of materials and design with current tools need to be overcome. A lack of expert personnel in this area also makes the implementation of programmable-via FPGAs complicated. The market for FPGA is promising due to the attraction of the programmable logic market. An intellectual Property (IP) analysis indicates there exist a significant new space for exploration in this area. The best-suited business model is as a new start-up that demonstrates feasibility and develops intellectual property. The potential commercialization of such technology is also discussed. Although this concept is promising result, {{more research is needed to}} show the reliability and feasibility of such a technology in complex circuits. It will take some time before this approach can be considered for production. by Chee Ying Khoo. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|One time {{programmable}} memory (OTP) is {{one type}} of nonvolatile memory (NVM). The most attractive feature of OTP is low cost and simple process. Existing NVMs such as the FLASH, aside from having technology scaling limitations, require additional masks and process modifications to CMOS that makes the cost increase. Other types of NVMs such as the <b>antifuses</b> (AF) do not have limitation problem {{and the cost of}} fabrication of it is lower than FLASH. However, the mainstream AFs still require three masks to the standard CMOS. OTP has found many applications in trimming, storage element in RFID and IP protection. In particular, CMOS compatible zero-additional-mask approach has been the most popular method to implement OTP memories. In this thesis, a diode based OTP memory technology using the breakdown of PN diode as the OTP element has been developed. The memory cell and array configuration, as well as charge pump that can be readily integrated in conventional CMOS. In Chapter 2, In particular the program disturb problem is resolved by using diode drivers with sufficiently high breakdown voltage. The choices of memory elements and various available diodes in a standard CMOS process are carefully studied to obtain an optimal combination. The electrical characteristic of the polysilicon diodes have been studied. The design of the polysilicon diode and the silicon substrate diodes as memory elements of the diode based OTP memory is discussed in this thesis. Different memory cells were fabricated in the standard 0. 18 -μm CMOS technology to verify the functionality of the design. In Chapter 3, the maximum output voltage of the charge pump circuit is limited by the breakdown voltage between the undesired silicon substrate diode between the N-type drain and the grounded P-type substrate. The output voltage of charge pump which is fully implemented by polysilicon diodes can be larger than the breakdown voltage of the undesired silicon substrate diode. However, the pumping efficiency of the charge pump is very low because of the diode voltage drop of the polysilicon diodes. To improve the pumping efficiency of an ultra high voltage charge pump, the gate control circuit is implemented in my charge pump circuit. A off chip capacitor charge pump which is implemented by polysilicon diodes and gate control circuits is fabricated in the standard 0. 18 -μm CMOS process to verify the idea of the design. Finally, in Chapter 4 the thesis draws the conclusions on the study of diode based OTP memory...|$|R
50|$|The emitter-base Zener diodes {{can handle}} only smaller {{currents}} as the energy is dissipated {{in the base}} depletion region which is very small. Higher amount of dissipated energy (higher current for longer time, or a short very high current spike) causes thermal damage to the junction and/or its contacts. Partial damage of the junction can shift its Zener voltage. Total destruction of the Zener junction by overheating it and causing migration of metallization across the junction ("spiking") can be used intentionally as a 'Zener zap' <b>antifuse.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{example is}} in {{miniature}} Christmas lights which are wired in series. When the filament burns {{out in one}} of the incandescent light bulbs, the electrical resistance becomes very high. The much higher voltage that this creates (equal to the full line voltage rather than the normal voltage divider level) causes the shunt to short out (becoming an <b>antifuse)</b> and become part of the circuit, again allowing electricity to pass and the set to light. If too many lights burn out however, a shunt will also burn out, requiring the use of a multimeter to find the point of failure.|$|E
50|$|Zener diodes {{can be used}} as antifuses. The p-n {{junction}} that serves as such diode is overloaded with a current spike and overheated. At temperatures above 100 °C and current densities above 105 A/cm2 the metallization undergoes electromigration and forms spikes through the junction, shorting it out; this process is known as Zener zap in the industry. The spike is formed on and slightly below the silicon surface, just below the passivation layer without damaging it. The conductive shunt therefore does not compromise integrity and reliability of the semiconductor device. Typically a few-millisecond pulse at 100-200 mA is sufficient for common bipolar devices, for a non-optimized <b>antifuse</b> structure; specialized structures will have lower power demands. The resulting resistance of the junction is in the range of 10 ohms.|$|E
50|$|A {{programmable}} {{read-only memory}} (PROM) or field {{programmable read-only memory}} (FPROM) or one-time programmable non-volatile memory (OTP NVM) {{is a form of}} digital memory where the setting of each bit is locked by a fuse or <b>antifuse.</b> It is one type of ROM (read-only memory). The data in them is permanent and cannot be changed. PROMs are used in digital electronic devices to store permanent data, usually low level programs such as firmware (microcode). The key difference from a standard ROM is that the data is written into a ROM during manufacture, while with a PROM the data is programmed into them after manufacture. Thus, ROMs tend to be used only for large production runs with well-verified data, while PROMs are used to allow companies to test on a subset of the devices in an order before burning data into all of them.|$|E
