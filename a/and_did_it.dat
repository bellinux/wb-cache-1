Nottinghamshire Outlaws batted first, and Will Smith and Chris Read made 51 and 44 not out respectively. The two where the only two Nottinghamshire batsmen to pass 20, and their contributions lifted the hosts to 147 for 8. Michael di Venuto and Luke Sutton took Derbyshire to 92 for 1 before Mark Ealham and Samit Patel chipped away at Derbyshire's batting. Four of Nottinghamshire's bowlers conceded less than 7 an over – which would have been good enough. However, Greg Smith conceded 40 runs, captain Sutton anchored the chase with 61 not out in 54 balls as Derbyshire won with two balls to spare.|$|E

On The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Ford ran through a scene with Edmond O'Brien and ended by drooping his hand over a railing.

25|$|For {{two-thirds of}} the twentieth century the New York Central had some of the most famous trains in the United States. Its 20th Century Limited, begun in 1902, ran from Grand Central Terminal in New York to LaSalle Street Station Chicago and was its most famous train, known for its red carpet {{treatment}} and first class service. In the mid-1930s many railroad companies were introducing streamliner locomotives; until the New York Central introduced the Commodore Vanderbilt all were diesel-electric. The Vanderbilt used the more common steam engine. The Century, which followed the Water Level Route, could complete the 960-mile trip in 16 hours after its June 15, 1938 streamlining (<b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in 15½ hours for a short period after World War II). Also famous was its Empire State Express through upstate New York to Buffalo and Cleveland, and Ohio State Limited from New York to Cincinnati.

However, once Fox pushed X-Men from December to July, Ottman's commitment to direct [...] made him unable to work with Singer. Michael Kamen was eventually hired. Given the film was only completed shortly before its premiere, Kamen wrote the score to the finished scenes, which were sent to him just as work was done on them. Singer asked him not to use any songs in the soundtrack as he [...] "didn't want to date the movie".

Hall of Fame starter-turned-closer Dennis Eckersley called him [...] "the best ever, no doubt", while Trevor Hoffman said he [...] "will go down as the best reliever in the game in history". Torre said, [...] "He's the best I've ever been around. Not only the ability to pitch and perform under pressure, but the calm he puts over the clubhouse." [...] Writer Tom Verducci said, [...] "Rivera is definitively the best at his position by a wider margin than any player at any position {{in the history of}} baseball. There is Rivera, a gulf, and then every other closer." [...] He compared Rivera's reputation for being the best at his position to that of Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said, [...] "Clearly unequivocally, he's the greatest relief pitcher of all time, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> {{in a way that was}} remarkable." [...] Speaking about Rivera's looming presence at the end of games, Alex Rodriguez said, [...] "He's the only guy in baseball who can change the game from a seat in the clubhouse or the bullpen. He would start affecting teams as early as the fifth inning, because they knew he was out there. I've never seen anyone who could affect a game like that." [...] Gossage said that Rivera [...] "might be the greatest closer of all-time" [...] but suggested that the modern closer's job has become too specialized and easy compared to multiple-inning [...] "firemen" [...] from Gossage's era; Rivera had only one regular season save of seven-plus outs in his career, whereas Gossage logged 53. Although the Baseball Writers' Association of America has historically been reluctant to elect relievers into the Baseball Hall of Fame, sportswriters anticipate that Rivera will be elected in his first year of eligibility. In 2016, ESPN.com ranked Rivera 49th on its list of the greatest MLB players.|$|E

The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different.

I was just trying to say that, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked.

[...] Mr. Phillips said he had known men at DuQuoin 21 years ago that were still in the service of Capt. Halliday. [...] He told how Capt. Halliday watched the careers of young men who were striving to get ahead in life, and how he helped them to get on by opening the way for them without ever letting them see his hand.
