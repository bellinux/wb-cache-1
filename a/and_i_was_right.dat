6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said John, {{with one}} of his quizzing expressions, [...] "Colonel Jarvis, that must be the alderman; they are {{commonly}} colonels of city volunteers: yes, that must have been the old gem'mun who spoke to us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> after all about the bandboxes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You!' she says, with a {{smile that}} {{reminded}} me of lemon sherbet. I was waiting up-stairs in the slosh, then, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> down here by the door, putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco, and I heard all they said.|$|E
6000|$|... "By Saint George!" [...] cried Sir Hugh, [...] "I {{have never}} seen signs of so stern a fight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> glad {{that we have been}} in time to save you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, verily. Did I not wot {{well that}} she cared not a fico for me? I hoped when I made off that thou wouldst be the winner, Steve, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> glad thou art, man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father, {{there are}} other confidences which have to be {{respected}} in like wise. Bear with me, dear, till I have told you all, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> sure that you will agree with me. I ask it, father." ...|$|R
6000|$|Faint, sickening sensations crept along all {{the fibers}} of my body, and I {{seemed to know}} how a person feels who hears his death {{sentence}} pronounced from the bench. I waited to hear what my brother would say next. I believed I knew what it would be, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> He said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was well}} for me that I yielded so far. On the second day the {{director}} of the field-hospital sent to the post-office at our nearest town for letters addressed to him or to his care. The messenger brought back a letter for me. I thought I recognized the handwriting, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Mr. Playmore's answer had reached me at last! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Master's come home, mim,' cried Miggs, running {{before him}} into the parlour. 'You was wrong, mim, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> I thought he wouldn't keep us up so late, two nights running, mim. Master's always {{considerate}} so far. I'm so glad, mim, on your account. I'm a little'--here Miggs simpered--'a little sleepy myself; I'll own it now, mim, though I said I wasn't when you asked me. It ain't of no consequence, mim, of course.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That God will provide," [...] said Patience, reverently. [...] "Anyway, I must cleave to Steadfast though 'tis {{very good}} of you, Master Luck and Master Andrew, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{never could have}} thought of such a thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> sorry for the little ones." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> {{good friends}} from the beginning. She loved me and she loved her Aunt Sara; but {{from the very first}} her best and deepest affection went out to Doctor John Haven, who lived in the big brick house {{on the other side of}} Miss Sara's.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say nought about it," [...] Geoffrey answered; [...] "Madge <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> glad to {{have been}} of service to you. It would be a poor world indeed if one could not give a corner of one's fireside to a fellow-creature on such a night as this, {{especially}} when that fellow creature is {{a woman with a}} child. Poor little chap! He looks right well and sturdy, and seems to have taken no ill from his journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suspected}} {{that there was}} some game on, and it struck me that this would be the day for the attempt, the house being upside down, in a manner of speaking, on account of the theatricals. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> I kept near those jewels on and off all day, and, presently, just as I had thought, along comes this fellow. He'd hardly got to the door when I was on him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dubious is no {{word for}} it, Jeeves. I hadn't {{a scrap of}} faith in the idea from the start. When you first mooted it, I said it was rotten, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> I'm not blaming you, Jeeves. It is not your fault that you have sprained your brain. But after this--forgive me if I hurt your feelings, Jeeves----I shall know better than to allow you to handle any but the {{simplest}} and most elementary problems. It is best to be candid about this, don't you think? Kindest to be frank and straightforward?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear father," [...] {{the letter}} ran, [...] "Bartley and I are married. We were married an hour ago, {{just across the}} New Hampshire line, by the Rev. Mr. Jessup. Bartley wants I should let you know the very first thing. I am going to Boston with Bartley to-night, and, {{as soon as we}} get settled there, I will write again. I want you should forgive us both; but if you wont forgive Bartley, you mustn't forgive me. You were mistaken about Bartley, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Bartley has told me everything, and I am {{perfectly}} satisfied. Love to mother.|$|E
60|$|MORELL. Candida, my dear: this altercation {{is hardly}} quite seemingly. It {{is a matter}} between two men; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the <b>right</b> person to settle it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} up at Varley, and slept at the schoolhouse. Bill Swinn and Polly Powlett made me up a bed and got me tea <b>and</b> breakfast. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By my hilt," [...] said Aylward, [...] "I am with you, gossip, {{wherever}} you may go! Say no more, therefore, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> weary of living like a cony in a hole, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>right</b> glad {{to stand by}} you in your venture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I told you," [...] he moaned in Sally's ear, [...] "what... {{was that}} your ankle? Sorry! Don't know what I'm doing to-night... If I told you what I had spent on that woman, you wouldn't believe it. And then she throws me down. And all because I said I didn't like her in that hat. She hasn't spoken {{to me for a}} week, and won't answer when I call up on the 'phone. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> too. It was a rotten hat. Didn't suit her a bit. But that," [...] said Mr. Cracknell, morosely, [...] "is a woman all over!" ...|$|E
60|$|This was all wretched for a {{stranger}} like myself {{to hear and}} see; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> glad when Alan returned, looking like himself in his fine French clothes, though (to be sure) they were now grown almost too battered and withered to deserve the name of fine. I was then taken out in my turn by another of the sons, and given that change of clothing of which I had stood so long in need, {{and a pair of}} Highland brogues made of deer-leather, rather strange at first, but after a little practice very easy to the feet.|$|E
6000|$|I {{knew the}} long words would impress their simple souls with {{a belief that}} I was {{actually}} praying; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> for every man of them pulled his hat off, and stood staring {{at me with a}} mixed look of reverence, incredulity, and astonishment--but not for long. For before I could say amen, yours truly, or anything, that entire body of water shot upward five hundred feet into the air, as smooth as a column of crystal, curled over in broad green cataracts, falling outward with a jar and thunder like the explosion of a thousand subterranean cannon, then surging and swirling back to the centre, one steaming, writhing mass of snowy foam! ...|$|E
5000|$|... "This is {{the kind}} of music that best {{reflects}} who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> now in my life," [...] says Rachelle Ann. [...] "All the albums that I've done are very special to me, but this one is the most special so far. I think people will understand why." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see that, Mills? You see that, Jimmy?" [...] {{he pointed}} out. [...] "Six <b>and</b> three-quarter pounds! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> almost to an ounce. He's a fine fellow!" ...|$|R
60|$|You are overwrought. It will pass, and {{you will}} see your path {{straight}} before you, <b>and</b> know that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right.</b> You cannot run away from the fight.|$|R
60|$|Now this rebel vizir had {{hated me}} from my boy-hood, because once, when {{shooting}} at a bird with a bow, I had shot out his eye by accident. Of course I not only sent a servant at once to offer him my regrets and apologies, but I made them in person. It was all of no use. He cherished an undying hatred towards me, and lost no occasion of showing it. Having once got me in his power I felt he could show no mercy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Mad with triumph and fury {{he came to me}} in my prison and tore out my right eye. That is how I lost it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I turned aside {{with one}} blow the chair he hurled {{at me in}} his terror, and closed with him; and with a heavy crash we rolled upon the floor together. 'It was a fine {{struggle}} that; for he was a tall, strong man, fighting for his life; and I, a powerful madman, thirsting to destroy him. I knew no strength could equal mine, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Right again, though a madman! His struggles grew fainter. I knelt upon his chest, and clasped his brawny throat firmly with both hands. His face grew purple; his eyes were starting from his head, and with protruded tongue, he seemed to mock me. I squeezed the tighter. 'The door was suddenly burst open with a loud noise, and {{a crowd of people}} rushed forward, crying aloud to each other to secure the madman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dreadfully, and so {{was poor}} nurse; but once or twice I thought of the text that--that--you know who was so fond of,--`Call upon me {{in the time of}} trouble and I will deliver thee,' so I prayed and felt a little better. Then the {{lifeboat}} came, and, oh! how my heart did jump, for it seemed just like an answer to my prayer. I never felt any more fear after that, except when I fell into the sea; but even then I was not so frightened as I had been, for I felt somehow that I was sure to be saved, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> you see, for dear Captain Boyns dived for me. I love Captain Boyns!" [...] cried Annie, and here again she kissed her father and held him so tight that he felt quite angry with Mrs Niven, who entered at the moment, and said, apologetically-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Bickley; {{but then}} I have always {{understood}} that the devil is beyond conversion because he is beyond repentance. You see, I think that if that old scoundrel was not the devil himself, at any rate {{he was a bit}} of him, <b>and,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not ashamed to have failed in his case." ...|$|R
2500|$|Freiman has caddied for her {{seven times}} at LPGA tournaments. He observed: [...] "I'm {{probably}} more nervous than she <b>is.</b> <b>I</b> don't choose the clubs, but I {{have to give}} her the yardage. I'm adding up all of the numbers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> better <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> It's nerve-wracking but a lot of fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{about your}} Miss Fielding, now?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Why {{do you suppose}} that he is leaving Paris, <b>and</b> coming here? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> <b>I</b> knew that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> right." ...|$|R
60|$|Here Rima, at a {{distance}} of a few yards from me, remained standing still for some minutes, as if to give me time to recover my breath; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> glad to sit down on a stone to rest. Finally she walked slowly to the centre of the level area, which was about two acres in extent; rising, I followed her and, climbing on to a huge block of stone, began gazing at the wide prospect spread out before me. The day was windless and bright, with only a few white clouds floating at a great height above and casting travelling shadows over that wild, broken country, where forest, marsh, and savannah were only distinguishable by their different colours, like the greys and greens and yellows on a map. At a great distance the circle of the horizon was broken here and there by mountains, but the hills in our neighbourhood were all beneath our feet.|$|E
60|$|But I am glad now, that I {{was forced}} to father my intrepid theory myself, for, {{on the night of}} which I am writing, it was triumphantly {{justified}} and established. Mont Blanc is nearly sixteen thousand feet high; he hid the moon utterly; near him is a peak which is 12,216 feet high; the moon slid along behind the pinnacles, and when she approached that one I watched her with intense interest, for my reputation as a scientist must stand or fall by its decision. I cannot describe the emotions which surged like tidal waves through my breast when I saw the moon glide behind that lofty needle and pass it by without exposing more than two feet four inches of her upper rim above it; I was secure, then. I knew she could rise no higher, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> She sailed behind all the peaks and never succeeded in hoisting her disk above a single one of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not he. He went up-stairs, {{and in a}} {{few minutes}} ran down again, with an open letter in his hand, looking as if the devil was after him before his time. At {{the last three or four}} stairs, he tripped, caught at the bannisters, dropped the letter over them in doing so, tumbled into the passage in such a fury and fright that he looked like a madman, tore his hat off a peg, and rushed out. I just heard him say his {{daughter}} should come back, if he put a straight waistcoat on her, as he passed the door. Between his tumble, his passion, and his hurry, he never thought of coming back for the letter he had dropped over the bannisters. I picked it up before I went away, suspecting it might be good evidence on our side; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Read it yourself; Basil; you have every moral and legal claim on the precious document--and here it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wot then?" [...] {{repeated}} Tim Rokens, assaulting {{his knee}} with his clenched fist in a peculiarly emphatic manner; [...] "I'll tell ye wot then, {{as you may}} <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> may <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> an' nother on us can <b>be</b> both <b>right</b> or wrong, I say as how that we don't know nothin' about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true, sir, <b>and</b> you'll find <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> as {{to all the}} rest. Then, {{there were}} the fore, main, and mizen top-masts--they make six, if I can count, Mr. Mulford?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed he did. He {{said he did}} {{not believe}} she was half as much to blame as her father <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought he <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Didn't you?" ...|$|R
