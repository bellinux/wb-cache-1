5|$|Taken {{together}} with the other sources above, this Hospital {{must be seen as}} a significant medieval establishment. It served a number purposes; especially the provision of a sub-monastic care home for locals. There is no clear evidence about the inclusion of women. The location of the hospital <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> river crossing on the drove road indicates that it was a travellers inn. The hospital at Soutra Aisle in the Scottish Borders served a similar purpose. In addition to being a Traveller's Inn, {{it may have been a}} Chantry for the Cathedral in Old Aberdeen.|$|E

5|$|Avonmouth {{railway station}} was the {{terminus}} of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, a self-contained railway which {{ran along the}} River Avon in Bristol, England. The station, which opened in 1865, was <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pier on the River Severn at Avonmouth. It had two platforms and an adjacent hotel, {{as well as an}} engine shed and water tank. The station was closed in 1902 as the land was required for the expansion of Avonmouth Docks, although it remained in use for workers' trains until 1903. The hotel continued in operation until 1926, when it too was demolished {{to make way for the}} docks. The station site is now in the middle of Avonmouth Docks.|$|E

It is situated adjacent to the former facilities at Shenley Sports grounds, which Watford Football Club use for training purposes. They concluded it was “…essential to support the training facility”, that it would replace an existing building used by the club and that Arsenal’s community work “constituted exceptional circumstances”. The plans were referred to the Environment Secretary John Prescott, who ratified it, {{in spite of the}} area's position on the green belt. Planning permission was obtained in September 1998.|$|E

5|$|Carr Gomm {{contacted}} {{other institutions}} and hospitals {{more suited to}} caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm {{wrote a letter to}} The Times, printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions. The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the British Medical Journal. With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life. He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves's instruction—no mirrors.|$|E

5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E

5|$|The baronial revolt {{was crushed}} between 1266 and 1267, leaving de Clare free to advance north into Glamorgan from his main base in Cardiff. De Clare started to {{construct}} a castle at Caerphilly to control his new gains in 1268. The castle lay in a basin of the Rhymney Valley, alongside the Rhymney River and {{at the heart of}} network of paths and roads, <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> former Roman fort. Work began at a huge pace, with ditches cut to form the basic shape of the castle, temporary wooden palisades erected and extensive water defences created by damming a local stream. The walls and internal buildings were built at speed, forming {{the main part of the}} castle. The architect of the castle and the precise cost of the construction are unknown, but modern estimates suggest that it could have cost as much as castles such as Conwy or Caernarfon, perhaps as much as £19,000, a huge sum for the period.|$|E
5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} two squares {{from its}} original square and ends the turn <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pawn of the opponent's on the same rank, it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent's, {{as if it had}} moved only one square forward. This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance. The diagrams on the right demonstrate an instance of this: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it en passant, moving from b4 to a3 while the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board.|$|E

5|$|After Dernancourt, the 48th Battalion {{marched to}} the rear and began {{establishing}} a reserve line at Beaucourt. On 18 April, Gellibrand was evacuated sick and Leane was appointed to act as brigade commander in his place. The following day he was temporarily promoted {{to the rank of}} colonel. During Gellibrand's absence, on 27–28 April the 12th Brigade was deployed to the line at Villers-Bretonneux, which had just been recaptured from the Germans. In order to push the frontline further east of the town, it was necessary to capture strongly-held German positions in Monument Wood, so-named as it was <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> memorial to the Franco-Prussian War. This task was given to the 12th Brigade, and Leane, knowing that the fighting would be difficult, applied his usual practice of giving the most challenging missions to his own, the 48th Battalion. After the intense fighting at Dernancourt, the 48th had been reinforced with a significant number of unseasoned new recruits. The attack was planned for 02:00 on 3 May, and in order to achieve surprise, there was to be only intermittent shelling of the wood during the day, and just a two minute barrage with all available guns {{at the time of the}} attack. In the event, Leane's first battle as brigade commander went badly, with the artillery barrage being very weak and failing to cut the wire in front of the wood, and the supporting tanks failing to have any impact. One party managed to get through the wire and capture 21 Germans in the farm buildings in the centre of the wood, but a German counterattack forced the Australians back to their start line, with a loss of 12 officers and 143 other ranks, against German casualties of 10 officers and 136 men.|$|E
5|$|SBS {{implementation}} on {{the corridor}} {{is planned for}} November 2017. In the Rockaways and in Broad Channel, due to less dense land uses, and due to lower utilization of stops, several existing Q52 and Q53 stops will be consolidated or discontinued. Q22 local service will continue to serve the stops in the Rockaways, while the low volume stops at Cross Bay Boulevard and 5th Road will be discontinued. A new stop at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 84th Street would replace stops at Beach 81st Street and Beach 86th Street on the Q52. In Broad Channel two stops would be relocated: the northbound stop at Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road would be moved north to Noel Road to be symmetrical with the southbound stop, and the southbound stop at West 15th Road would be moved south to West 17th Road to be symmetrical with the northbound stop, and to be <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crosswalk. Stops on Woodhaven Boulevard would be modified as well: the stop at Atlantic Avenue would be moved north to 91st Avenue, allowing Q52 and Q53 service to use the overpass over Atlantic Avenue using the bus lane, as opposed to using the slow service road. Two SBS stops will be added–at 101st Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard, and at Pitkin Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard–to provide transfers to the Q8 and Q11, respectively. Stations on Woodhaven Boulevard at Jamaica Avenue, 91st Avenue and 101st Avenue, and at Cross Bay Boulevard at Liberty Avenue (northbound) and Rockaway Boulevard (southbound) would be new stations that {{were built in the}} median by the NYCDOT.|$|E

5|$|The Chalk River, Ontario, {{site was}} {{established}} to rehouse the Allied effort at the Montreal Laboratory away from an urban area.
