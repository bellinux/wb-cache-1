Infinite iteration is {{not possible}} in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of ferns and umbellifers (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including bryozoa, corals, hydrozoa like the <b>air</b> <b>fern,</b> Sertularia argentea, and in non-living things, notably electrical discharges. Lindenmayer system fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying {{a small number of}} parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points (internode length), and number of branches per branch point.|$|E

50|$|Various {{species of}} {{floating}} fern {{are able to}} sustain a liquid-solid barrier of <b>air</b> between the <b>fern</b> and the surrounding water when they are submerged. Like the lotus leaf, floating fern species have tiny hierarchical structures that prevent water from wetting the plant surface. Mayser and Barthlott demonstrated this ability by submerging different species of the floating fern salvinia in water inside a pressure vessel to study how the air barrier between the leaf and surrounding water react to changes in pressure that {{would be similar to}} those experienced by the hull of a ship. Much other research is ongoing using these hierarchical structures in coatings on ship hulls to reduce viscous drag effects.|$|R

It is specific to the Kent coast and has been harvested for centuries by fishermen near the estuary and distributed at the harbour, a temporal cottage industry of cleaning, bunching and dying for sale inland, for aquariums. Fine in structure, the plant {{is in fact a}} species of marine animal â€“ the dried skeletal colonies of hydroids. The film, which uses as its soundtrack selections from 'All in a Garden Green' composed by romantic Kent-born John Jenkins in 1650 and performed by local cellist Matthew Roberts, presents this peculiar organism as an evanescent character, bridging animal and vegetal existence. Within the library there was also a shelf of selected books related to the research...|$|E
