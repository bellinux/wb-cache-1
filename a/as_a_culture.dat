30|$|For the {{purposes}} of a fungal metabolite screening program, {{it seems clear that}} rice would serve well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>culture</b> medium. The data supporting the use of rice <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ideal medium may not be surprising to researchers who routinely culture fungi; this study validates the empirical knowledge of many mycologists and natural products researchers who use rice <b>as</b> <b>a</b> go-to <b>culture</b> substrate. While liquid media did not perform well in this study, they should not be discounted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> viable <b>culture</b> condition in other circumstances. Different microbes, such as those found in marine environments, may be far more suited to a liquid growing environment than those cultured here. However, new metabolites have been reported when marine fungi have been grown on rice (Shang et al., 2012), which supports the use of complex solid media <b>as</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>culture</b> condition.|$|R

25|$|The second {{possibility}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> {{associated with}} the Nostratic family is the Zarzian (12,400–8500 BC) culture of the Zagros mountains, stretching northwards into Kohistan in the Caucasus and eastwards into Iran. In western Iran, the M'lefatian culture (10,500–9000 BC) was ancestral to the assemblages of Ali Tappah (9000–5000 BC) and Jeitun (6000–4000 BC). Still further east, the Hissar culture {{has been seen as}} the Mesolithic precursor to the Keltiminar culture (5500–3500 BC) of the Kyrgyz steppe.|$|E
25|$|One major hurdle to {{entrance}} into firefighting for women {{was the lack}} of facilities.

Today fire stations, as public entities, must either follow gender equity law or face judicial injunctions, they are now designed to accommodate firefighters of both genders, some female firefighters still face issues related to their gender.|$|E

25|$|According to Ojibwe {{oral history}} and from {{recordings}} in birch bark scrolls, the Ojibwe originated {{from the mouth}} of the St. Lawrence River on the Atlantic coast of what is now Quebec.

The identification of the Ojibwe <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> or people may have occurred in response to contact with Europeans. The Europeans preferred to deal with bounded groups and tried to identify those they encountered.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in that decade, newer Jewish arrivals in Livingston Manor were as {{committed}} to Judaism as a faith as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture.</b> These immigrants began holding High Holy Days services at a rented pavilion {{on the shores}} of Willowemoc Creek, now the site of Livingston Manor High School. In 1922, the more religious Jews gained the upper hand in the community following the departure of some of the Arbeittering members, and incorporated the congregation of Agudas Achim. They bought land and Izzy Brooks, one of the few practicing Orthodox Jews in town, built the synagogue. It was opened two years later in 1924.|$|E

25|$|Postmodernity (post-modernity or {{the postmodern}} condition) is the {{economic}} or cultural state or condition of society which {{is said to}} exist after modernity. Some schools of thought hold that modernity ended in the late 20th century – in the 1980s or early 1990s – {{and that it was}} replaced by postmodernity, while others would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity, while some believe that modernity ended after World War II. The idea of the post-modern condition is sometimes characterised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> stripped of its capacity to function in any linear or autonomous state as opposed to the progressive mindstate of Modernism.|$|E
25|$|While the {{semi-arid}} plains were {{dominated by}} the nomads, small city-states and sedentary agrarian societies arose in the more humid areas of Central Asia. The Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex of the early 2nd millennium BC was the first sedentary civilisation of the region, practicing irrigation farming of wheat and barley and possibly a form of writing. Bactria-Margiana probably interacted with the contemporary Bronze Age nomads of the Andronovo culture, the originators of the spoke-wheeled chariot, who lived to their north in western Siberia, Russia, and parts of Kazakhstan, and survived <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> until the 1st millennium BC. These cultures, particularly Bactria-Margiana, have been posited as possible representatives of the hypothetical Aryan culture ancestral to the speakers of the Indo-Iranian languages (see Indo-Iranians).|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{the former}} Hanns Mayer {{changed his name}} to Jean Améry (the surname being an anagram in French of his family name) in order to symbolize his {{dissociation}} from German culture and his alliance with French culture.

He refused to publish in Germany or Austria for many years, publishing only in Switzerland. He did not write at all of his experiences in the death camps until 1964, when, at the urging of German poet Helmut Heißenbüttel, he wrote his book Jenseits von Schuld und Sühne ("Beyond Guilt and Atonement"). It was later translated into English by Sidney and Stella P. Rosenfeld as At the Mind's Limits: Contemplations by a Survivor on Auschwitz and its Realities.|$|E

25|$|The Lacandons are descendents of {{the ancient}} Maya. Since the 16th century, {{they have been able}} to survive <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> by living deep in the rainforest, with many {{communities}} out of contact with the rest of the world until the 20th century. Before the Conquest, the Lacandon dominated about a million hectares of these lands, but since then they have been encroached upon, mostly by indigenous from other areas of Chiapas since the early 20th century. This has dramatically altered their lifestyle and worldview. Today the Lacandon Maya are primarily found in three villages called Naja, Lacanja Chansayab and Metzobok. near the ruins of Bonampak and Yaxchilan. Local lore states that the gods resided here when they lived on earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{erection}} of Mughal tombs to honour {{the dead}} {{was the subject}} of a theological debate conducted in part, through built architecture over several centuries. For the majority of Muslims, the spiritual power (barakat) of visiting the resting places (ziyarat) of those venerated in Islam, was a force by which greater personal sanctity could be achieved. However, orthodox Islam found tombs problematic because a number of Hadith forbade their construction. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> also attempting to accommodate, assimilate and subjugate the majority Hindu populace, opposition also came from local traditions which believed dead bodies and the structures over them were impure. For many Muslims at the time of the Taj's construction, tombs could be considered legitimate providing they did not strive for pomp and were seen as a means to provide a reflection of paradise (Jannah) here on earth.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{argues that}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture,</b> our {{attention}} blindness represents a significant challenge {{that we must}} examine and meet head on; particularly since the Internet has revolutionized virtually every aspect of how our lives function now.

She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded {{to meet the challenges of}} industrialization) as though we were currently not living through momentous, epochal changes.|$|E
