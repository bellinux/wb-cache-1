40|$|Respiratory rate is an {{essential}} parameter in many practical applications such as <b>apnea</b> <b>detection,</b> patient <b>monitoring,</b> and elderly people monitoring. In this paper, we describe a novel method and a contact-free multi-modal system which is capable of detecting human breathing activity. The multimodal system, which uses both differential pyro-electric infrared (PIR) and vibration sensors, can also estimate the respiratory rate. Vibration sensors pick up small vibrations due to the breathing activity. Similarly, PIR sensors pick up the thoracic movements. Sensor signals are sampled using a microprocessor board and analyzed on a laptop computer. Sensor signals are processed using wavelet analysis and empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Since breathing is almost periodic, a new multi-modal average magnitude difference function (AMDF) is used to detect the periodicity and the period in the processed signals. By fusing the data of {{two different types of}} sensors we achieve a more robust and reliable contact-free human breathing activity detection system compared to systems using only one specific type of sensors. © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|In {{designing}} a classification system, {{one of the}} most important considerations is how optimal the classifier will adapt and give best generalization when it is given data from unknown model distribution. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression has no simple formula to assess its generalization ability. In such cases, bootstrapping offers an advantage over analytical methods thanks to its simplicity. This paper presents an analysis of bootstrapped multinomial logistic regression applied on <b>apnea</b> <b>detection</b> using ECG data. We examine multinomial logistic regression to detect or recognize multi-class apnea categories (heavy, middle, healthy). We show that for generally complex and highly unstructured medical data such as ECG for <b>apnea</b> <b>detection,</b> bootstrapping gives more meaningful assessment to detect over-fitting than k-fold cross validation. The bootstrapping also gives higher classification accuracy prediction over k-fold cross validation for the same training data proportion...|$|R

40|$|Sleep apnea is a sleep-induced {{breathing}} disorder {{with symptoms}} of momentary and often repetitive cessations in breathing rhythm or sustained reductions in breathing amplitude. The phenomenon {{is known to}} occur {{with varying degrees of}} severity in literally {{millions of people around the}} world and cause a range of chronicle health issues. In spite of its high prevalence and serious consequences, nearly 80 % of people with sleep apnea condition remain undiagnosed. The current standard diagnosis technique, termed polysomnography or PSG, requires the patient to schedule and undergo a complex full-night sleep study in a specially-equipped sleep lab. Due to both high cost and substantial inconvenience, millions of apnea patients are still undiagnosed and thus untreated. This research work aims at a simple, reliable, and miniaturized solution for in-home sleep apnea diagnosis purposes. The proposed solution bears high-level integration and minimal interference with sleeping patients, allowing them to monitor their apnea conditions at the comfort of their homes. Based on a MEMS sensor and an effective <b>apnea</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm, a low-cost single-channel apnea screening solution is proposed. A custom designed IC chip implements the <b>apnea</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm using time-domain signal processing techniques. The chip performs autonomous <b>apnea</b> <b>detection</b> and scoring based on the patient?s airflow signals detected by the MEMS sensor. Variable sensitivity is enabled to accommodate different breathing signal amplitudes. The IC chip was fabricated in standard 0. 5 -?m CMOS technology. A prototype device was designed and assembled including a MEMS sensor, the <b>apnea</b> <b>detection</b> IC chip, a PSoC platform, and wireless transceiver for data transmission. The prototype device demonstrates a valuable screening solution with great potential to reach the broader public with undiagnosed apnea conditions. In a battery-operated miniaturized medical device, an energy-efficient analog-to-digital converter is an integral part linking the analog world of biomedical signals and the digital domain with powerful signal processing capabilities. This dissertation includes the detailed design of a successive approximation register (SAR) ADC for ultra-low power applications. The ADC adopts an asynchronous 2 b/step scheme that halves both conversion time and DAC/digital circuit?s switching activities to reduce static and dynamic energy consumption. A low-power sleep mode is engaged at the end of all conversion steps during each clock period. The technical contributions of this ADC design include an innovative 2 b/step reference scheme based on a hybrid R- 2 R/C- 3 C DAC, an interpolation-assisted time-domain 2 b comparison scheme, and a TDC with dual-edge-comparison mechanism. The prototype ADC was fabricated in 0. 18 ?m CMOS process with an active area of 0. 103 mm^(2), and achieves an ENoB of 9. 2 bits and an FoM of 6. 7 fJ/conversion-step at 100 -kS/s...|$|R

The detection-monitoring program developed for the ICDF groundwater-monitoring wells is applicable to six wells completed in the uppermost portion of the Snake River Plain Aquifer − five wells downgradient of the ICDF and one well upgradient. The ICDF detection-monitoring program was established to meet the substantive requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 264. 97 and 264. 98, which are applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements under CERCLA. Semiannual groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for indicator parameters in March and September. The indicator parameters focus on constituents that are found in higher concentrations in ICDF leachate than in groundwater (bicarbonate alkalinity, sulfate, U- 233, U- 234, and U- 238). The only <b>detection</b> <b>monitoring</b> limits that were exceeded were for bicarbonate alkalinity. Bicarbonate alkalinity is naturally occurring in groundwater. Bicarbonate alkalinity found in ICDF <b>detection</b> <b>monitoring</b> wells is not a result of waste migration from the ICDF landfill or the evaporation pond. The U. S.

The unsupervised analysis of ECG and ICP beats is carried out using hierarchical clustering approach.

40|$|Uncertainty {{built into}} {{conceptual}} groundwater flow and transport models and associated parametric uncertainty should be appropriately included when such models {{are used to}} develop <b>detection</b> <b>monitoring</b> networks for contaminated sites.

The focus is on <b>detection</b> <b>monitoring</b> networks where the primary objective is to intercept the contaminant before it reaches a boundary of interest (e. g., compliance boundary). Different uncertainty propagation approaches identify different well locations and different well combinations (networks) as having the highest detection efficiency.

If several approaches yield consistent results in terms of identifying the best performing candidate wells and the best performing well network for detecting a contaminant plume, this would provide confidence in the suitability of the selected well locations...|$|R
