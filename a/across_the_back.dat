One of them, perhaps Billy, shot Morgan Earp <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> in a {{wound that}} struck both {{shoulder}} blades and a vertebra. Morgan went {{down for a}} minute before picking himself up. Either Frank or Billy shot Virgil Earp in the calf (Virgil thought it was Billy). Virgil, though hit, fired his next shot at Billy Clanton.|$|E
5|$|Broad-headed {{compared}} with other cicadas, the double drummer is mostly brown with a black pattern <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of its thorax, and has red-brown and black underparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the female lacks the male's tymbals and sac-like covers. Found in sclerophyll forest in Queensland and New South Wales, adult double drummers generally perch high in the branches of large eucalypts. They emerge from the ground where they have spent several years as nymphs from November until March, and live for another four to five weeks. They appear in great numbers in some years, yet are absent in others.|$|E
5|$|The brawl {{began with}} 45.9seconds {{remaining}} in the game, when Indiana led 97–82. The Pistons' Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by the Pacers' Ron Artest (now known as Metta World Peace), who slapped him <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would be hit. Wallace responded by shoving Artest {{in the face with}} both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep Wallace and Artest separated.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine cavalry {{was armed}} with a long sword, known as the spathion. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a kontarion and a bow (toxarion) with forty arrows in a quiver, hung from a saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as skoutatoi, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the {{shoulder}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and a quiver of arrows. Cavalry armor consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant, i.e. a throat-guard lined with fabric and having a fringe and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a helmet and leg armor. Light lamellar and scale armor was also used.|$|E
5|$|The opening bout {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship {{between the}} {{champion}} Petey Williams and the challenger Consequences Creed. The duration of the match was 12 minutes and 30 seconds. Williams was accompanied to the ring by Rhaka Khan, who interfered in the contest trying to aid Williams to no avail. Near {{the end of the}} match, Sheik Abdul Bashir walked out to the ring and bashed Creed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with a steel chair, which allowed Williams to force Creed's head into the mat with his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver. Williams followed with the pin to win the match and retain the TNA X Division Championship. After the bout, Bashir continued to attack Creed.|$|E
5|$|The Four-Way Elimination Tag Team {{match for}} the NWA World Tag Team Championship was next, in which The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens), who were {{accompanied}} by Jimmy Hart, defended against the teams of Alex Shelley and Sean Waltman, America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), and Team Canada (A-1 and Eric Young). The bout duration was 18 minutes and 1 second. Waltman was advertised to team with Shelley for the encounter, but missed the show due to undisclosed reasons. In this bout, if {{a member of a}} team is pinned or made to submit, then him and his partner is eliminated from the contest; the objective is to be the last team standing. Shelley began the bout alone, until Chris Candido's legitimate brother Johnny Candido, who was in attendance along with several of Candido's family members, jumped the railing to join Shelley as his tag team partner. A bit later, Douglas kicked Candido in the crotch and pinned him with a roll-up pin, thus eliminating Shelley and Candido from the contest. AMW were the next eliminated; Young pinned Harris with a roll-up after A-1 hit Harris <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with a hockey stick. The Naturals pinned A-1 after slamming him into the mat face-first with their signature tag team Natural Disaster maneuver. Due to the pin, Team Canada were eliminated from the contest, thus giving the victory to The Naturals who retained the NWA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship in which the {{champion}} Samoa Joe defended against the challenger Sting. The duration of the encounter was 16 minutes and 54 seconds. The beginning of the match had Joe on the offensive, with Joe performing a dive between the ropes to hit Sting {{in the face with}} his forearm. The competitors then fought throughout the crowd for an extended period. At one point while the two were fighting on the arena steps, Joe jumped from a luxury box and kicked Sting down the stairs. Afterwards, Sting and Joe fought back towards the ring with each trading the offensive advantage. Back in the ring, Sting earned a near-fall after an aerial splash from the top of a turnbuckle. Joe placed Sting in an STF submission hold after a powerbomb next. Sting reached the ropes, causing the hold to be broken by the referee. Sting threw Joe into a ring corner and performed his signature Stinger Splash before lifting Joe up and slamming Joe neck-first onto the mat with Joe's signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe got up off the mat immediately and attacked Sting. He then slammed Sting head and back-first into the mat with Sting's trademark Scorpion Death Drop maneuver. Sting also got up immediately after the move. Later, Kevin Nash entered the arena and walked to the ringside area. Nash had reportedly left the company but his attendance backstage was leaked to various media outlets. As Joe was arguing with the referee, Sting retrieved a baseball bat that he had left at ringside. Nash pulled the bat from Sting's hands, not allowing him to use it in the match. Afterwards, Joe and Sting fought in the ring when Sting dodged a running Joe, causing him to almost collide with referee Earl Hebner who dodged as well. At this time, Nash hit Joe <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with the baseball bat when Joe came in contact with the ring ropes. Sting followed by performing the Scorpion Death Drop on Joe and pinned him to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The event came to a close as Sting celebrated in-front of the crowd.|$|E

25|$|On March 9, 1996, {{shortly after}} a {{successful}} title defense against The Iron Sheik at Fairfax County's Secret's Restaurant and Sports Arena, Jackson {{was attacked by}} Johnny Gunn who hit him <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with a steel chair. A month later, he lost the title to Gunn after being pinned in a controversial 32 minute match. Jackson later claimed that Gunn had rendered him unconscious with an ether-soaked rag. Sometime during the match however, 22-year-old fan Danelle Evans stole the heavyweight title but it was later recovered by local police.|$|E
25|$|The fur {{is thick}} and soft, ranging from light brown to dark ochre, with {{numerous}} dark rosettes <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and flanks. The underside is pale with dark spots and the tail is ringed. The {{backs of the}} ears are black with bold ocelli. The rosettes are black or brown, open in the center, and irregularly shaped. The legs have medium-sized spots tapering to smaller spots near the paws. This coloration helps the oncilla {{blend in with the}} mottled sunlight of the tropical forest understory. The oncilla's jaw is shortened, with fewer teeth, but with well-developed carnassials and canines.|$|E

25|$|The winter fur is very {{dense and}} silky, but quite closely lying and short, while the summer fur is rougher, shorter and sparse. In summer, the fur is sandy-brown {{on the back}} and head and a white below. The {{division}} between the dark back and the light belly is usually straight, though this trait is only present in 13.5% of Irish stoats. The stoat moults twice a year. In spring, the moult is slow, starting from the forehead, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> toward the belly. In autumn, the moult is quicker, progressing in the reverse direction. The moult, initiated by photoperiod, starts earlier in autumn and later in spring at higher latitudes. In the stoat's northern range, it adopts a completely white coat (save for the black tail-tip) during the winter period. Differences in the winter and summer coats are less apparent in southern forms of the species. In the species' southern range, the coat remains brown, but is denser and sometimes paler than in summer.|$|E
