2500|$|Again in 1946 the Custom Cruiser 98 {{was the top}} of the Oldsmobile line. Three {{body styles}} were offered (a 4-door sedan, a 2-door Club coupe and a 2-door convertible) and all were eight {{cylinder}} powered. Technical features included electro hardened pistons, full pressure lubrication and <b>automatic</b> <b>choke</b> with fast idle mode. Standard equipment included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, dual sun visors, cigarette lighter and plastic radiator ornament, wraparound bumpers, Deluxe instrument cluster clock, rear armrest, and foam rubber sheet cushions.

40|$|Multiphase flow is {{associated}} with concurrent flow {{of more than one}} phase (gas-liquid, liquid-solid, or gas-liquid-solid) in a conduit. The simultaneous flow of these phases in a flow line, may initiate a slug flow in the pipeline. Hydrodynamic slug flow is an alternate or irregular flow with surges of liquid slug and gas pocket. This occurs when the velocity difference between the gas flow rate and liquid flow rate is high enough resulting in an unstable hydrodynamic behaviour usually caused by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Active feedback control technology, though found effective for the control of severe slugs, has not been studied for hydrodynamic slug mitigation in the literature. This work extends active feedback control application for mitigating hydrodynamic slug problem to enhance oil production and recovery. Active feedback Proportional-Integral (PI) control strategy based on measurement of pressure at the riser base as controlled variable with topside choking as manipulated variable was investigated through Olga simulation in this project. A control system that uses the topside choke valve to keep the pressure at the riser base at or below the average pressure in the riser slug cycle has been implemented. This has been found to prevent liquid accumulation or blockage of the flow line. OLGA (olga is a commercial software widely tested and used in oil and gas industries) has been used to assess the capability of active feedback control strategy for hydrodynamic slug control and has been found to give useful results and most interestingly the increase in oil production and recovery. The riser slugging was suppressed and the choke valve opening was improved from 5 % to 12. 65 % using riser base pressure as controlled variable and topside choke valve as the manipulated variable for the manual choking when compared to the <b>automatic</b> <b>choking</b> in a stabilised operation, representing an improvement of 7. 65 % in the valve opening. Secondly, implementing active control at open-loop condition reduced the riser base pressure from 15. 3881 bara to 13. 4016 bara...|$|R
50|$|In 1937 {{bodies were}} the same except for drip moldings running {{from the bottom of}} the front pillar up and over the doors and rear quarter window, new fenders and bumpers, {{headlights}} rigidly attached (adjusted by moving reflector), wheel discs incorporated a hubcap, and a built-in trunk was incorporated on most bodies. A die-cast eggcrate grille was used, but the hood louver treatment differed from that used in Fisher bodied cars. Chrome die cast strips were used at the rear of the hood side panels. A seven-passenger Fisher-bodied Special touring sedan, without a division window was offered on the 138.0 in wheelbase. These two body styles had the eggcrate hood louvers typical of all Fisher bodied Cadillacs for 1937. The Business car line included eight-passenger versions of these Special sedans plus eight-passenger versions of Fleetwood body styles. The eighth passenger was seated with two others on auxiliary seats. A commercial chassis on a 156.0 in wheelbase was offered. Engine changes included a lighter flywheel, a generator relocated in the vee, an oil filter, a new carburetor with full <b>automatic</b> electric <b>choke,</b> an oil bath cleaner, and a relocated distributor. A new transmission design featured pin-type synchronizers, shifter rails relocated to the side of the case, a cover on the bottom of the case, and an extension integral with the transmission mainshaft. Sales totaled 4,332.|$|R
40|$|Drilling {{performed}} from floating {{drilling rigs}} subjected to heave motion may be challenging. As the drillstring is suspended in slips during connection, the entire drillstring follows {{the motion of}} the floating rig. In harsh environment with heavy waves, drillsting heave induces severe surge and swab effects down hole. In a narrow pressure window reservoir, this effect might be crucial and worst case scenario is to lose the well. MPD on floating rigs is an approach to solve issues regarding surge and swab effects. A scaled MPD rig subjected to heave motion has been constructed at NTNU. The objective of the scaled rig is to design an <b>automatic</b> operated <b>choke</b> system to reduce pressure fluctuation due to surge and swab effects on a lab scale. A precise hydraulic model is crucial for a successful experiment. This thesis presents two different hydraulic models for the MPD heave lab. A simplified empirical model is developed based on curve matching from fixed choke experiments, this non-linear model is fairly simple and may be implemented as a controller in the heave lab. CBHP simulations based on the empirical model are performed in this thesis, but the controller has not been tested in the lab. A linear controller has been implemented in the heave lab, which reduced BHP fluctuation up to 64 % (Albert, A. 2013). A sophisticated numerical model has also been developed to analyse hydraulics in the heave lab. The numerical model simulates both flow and pressure throughout the entire heave lab. This model deviates slightly from observed data which is caused by unsteady laminar flow effects and unsteady wall shear stress due to fluid acceleration. The hydraulic analysis address important factors for a real case MPD heave compensation operation, such as; fluid acceleration effect on hydraulic friction factor and flow delay caused by fluid inertia. There is a significant uncertainty associated with along wellbore parameters, especially the unsteady hydraulic friction factor which depends on properties as wellbore geometry and formation properties. Sufficient downhole pressure sampling is crucial for a MPD heave compensation operation, wired drillpipe is therefore advisable, transmitting up to 57600 bits per second. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Early in 1982, Rover {{unveiled}} the Cowley-built, facelifted {{line to the}} public. These cars benefited mostly from small cosmetic changes on the exterior {{as well as a}} quite extensively redesigned interior. Car spotters can distinguish the two series by the headlights, which were chrome-rimmed and flush fitting on the later, recessed on the earlier series, the deeper rear window, now fitted with a rear wash wipe, and the new plastic wrap around bumpers which replaced the three-piece rubber and stainless steel ones. Other details, which are not as easy to assign include the full-width rear badge strip under the tail lights, engine size badges on front wings, and a range of new wheel trims and alloy wheels. [...] The automatic gearbox was now a GM180 model, still offering three speeds but better ratios. [...] The electric window switch pack moved from the centre console to the driver's door (and is well remembered for lacking edge finishing trim around the recesses), and a fully <b>automatic</b> <b>choke</b> appeared – eliminating the manual choke lever which had a tendency to break.|$|E

5000|$|The prototype, with {{chassis number}} 9-B-VI and {{registration}} number OLG-490, which earned it the nickname [...] "Olga", {{was on the}} road by August 1951. Olga and the first series of production Continentals were based on the Mark VI chassis, and used a manual mixture control on the steering wheel boss, as these versions did not have an <b>automatic</b> <b>choke.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 1500 cc {{engine was}} offered on the Plymouth Cricket, the 1250 {{being a little}} underpowered for American tastes. Side marker lamps (US DOT required) were added, and front disc brakes were standardised; these were {{originally}} optional in the UK. The single carburettor / manual choke combination was standard. From 1972, the single carburettor / <b>automatic</b> <b>choke</b> combination, dual carburettors, and air conditioning were all options.|$|E

50|$|The 1.3 L 2A was {{produced}} from 1979 through 1989. 2A motors in 1982 onwards AL20 Tercels {{have a slightly}} different valve cover and timing belt cover than early AL11 Tercels, {{as well as an}} <b>automatic</b> <b>choke,</b> and automatically controlled hot air intake (HAI) system. It also has higher compression ratio, and reformulated combustion chambers to improve the fuel economy and emissions. All variants used belt-driven SOHC eight-valve counter-flow cylinder heads with a single downdraft carburetor.|$|E
50|$|A 49 cc scooter {{which was}} {{manufactured}} from 1977 until 1983, it featured an air-cooled 2-stroke engine.The versions from 1977 until 1980 had a manual choke, points ignition, and a spring starter. Versions from 1980 onwards included a kick start, capacitor discharge ignition, and <b>automatic</b> <b>choke</b> {{as well as}} an improved compression ratio. Most versions include an automatic one speed transmission with a centrifugal clutch, double suspension, and oil injection. Two speed automatic transmissions were introduced towards the end of their production run.|$|E
50|$|Its engine, transmission, and {{cylinder}} heads were constructed of light alloy. An {{engine oil cooler}} (located in the engine fan's shroud) ensured optimal engine operating temperature and long engine life, optimized by a thermostat that bypassed the oil cooler when the engine was cold. Later models of the carburetor featured an <b>automatic</b> <b>choke.</b> Engine intake air passed through a metallic filter, while heavier particles were captured by an oil bath. After 1960, steering featured a hydraulic damper that absorbed steering irregularities.|$|E
5000|$|In 1946 the Special 60 {{series was}} again Oldsmobile's lowest priced group of cars. Special 60s had only 6-cylinder power, wlthough an 8-cylinder was offered in other years. The Business Coupe and the 2-door Sedan were discontinued. Interiors were a tan mixture pattern cloth. Standard tire size was 6.00 x 16 inches. Leather {{interiors}} were offered on convertibles. Technical features included electro hardened aluminum pistons, full-pressure lubrication and <b>automatic</b> <b>choke</b> with fast idle mode. In 1946, dual windshield wipers were standard.|$|E
50|$|For {{the next}} Paris Show, in October 1934, the design was yet again rounded {{off a bit}} (ZC&#8239;4). The {{wheelbase}} increased by about 7 cm and the bonnet now sports four long chrome-capped vents, accenting its length. The front bumper is now of a two-piece design with a gap for the registration plate in the middle. The engine (as with all of Renault's sixes and eights this year) received an <b>automatic</b> <b>choke</b> and an optional engine starter which engaged when the throttle was depressed.|$|E
50|$|Super {{script was}} found {{just above the}} full length body fender molding on the front fenders. New fender edge taillamps were {{featured}} while rear fender skins remained a Buick standard. New fender top parking lamps, harkening back to 1941 styling appeared. Full wheel trim discs were standard along with such features as a cigar lighter, ashtray, and <b>automatic</b> <b>choke.</b> Cloth interiors were standard, except on the convertible which was trimmed in leather and leatherette and had a power top, seat and windows as standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|During {{development}} it {{was referred}} to as the Bentley Mark VII; the chassis cards for these cars describe them as Bentley 7. The R Type name which is now usually applied stems from chassis series RT. The front of the saloon model was identical to the Mark VI, but the boot (trunk) was almost doubled in capacity. The engine displacement was approximately 4½ litres, as fitted to later versions of the Mark VI. An <b>automatic</b> <b>choke</b> was fitted to the R-type's carburettor. The attachment of the rear springs to the chassis was altered in detail between the Mark VI and the R Type.|$|E
50|$|The Honda X8R-S {{also known}} as the Honda SZX50 is a sport moped {{manufactured}} by the Honda Motor Company, from 1998 to 2003. There are two versions of the X8R: the X8R-S, the sport road version; and the X8R-X, the dual purpose version with different wheels, front fender, rear carrier and color scheme. The engine used is that seen in various Honda mopeds of the period but modified to provide more sporting performance.

50|$|The Blast was {{conceived}} as an entry-level motorcycle to attract newcomers to motorcycling {{in general and}} to Harley-Davidson in particular. As such, the design goals were low cost and ease of operation and maintenance. Steps to achieve these goals {{include the use of}} an automatically tensioned belt final drive, self-adjusting hydraulic valve lifters, and a carburetor with an <b>automatic</b> <b>choke.</b> The engine design was borrowed from Harley's Evolution Sportster engine with the rear cylinder eliminated. The plastic bodywork pieces of the Blast were made from Surlyn, a substance used to make the outside of golf balls, to protect the surfaces when the Blast is dropped, and the color is molded-in.|$|E
50|$|The {{new engine}} was {{a return to}} the {{medium-sized}} simpler and more efficient 4-cylinder type rather than the 6-cylinder engines fashionable earlier in the 1930s. It had been given an oil bath air cleaner and an <b>automatic</b> <b>choke</b> for the downdraught carburettor. The valves were mounted {{to one side of the}} block and operated by pushrods. Cooling water was circulated by an impellor and the amount of cooling provided by the radiator was regulated by thermostat. The design, then displacing 1669 cc, was a scaled down version of the Snipe's engine first used in Humber's Twelve of 1933 and now bored out to 75 mm.|$|E

5000|$|For 1961, {{significant}} technical advances {{occurred in}} the form of a new engine and transmission. The engine remained at 1200cc but the power increased to [...] primarily due to an increase in compression ratio to 7.1:1. The carburetor received an electric <b>automatic</b> <b>choke</b> and the transmission was now synchronized on all forward gears. The traditional semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicators worldwide. The standard model called the TYPE 111-112, continued to use the 36hp 1200 engine of the old architecture that dates back to Franz Reimspiess original design of 1937 all the way until the end of the 1965 model year. 1965 standard model in 1965 is called the [...] "A" [...] sedan.|$|E
50|$|At {{launch the}} {{innovative}} {{design of the}} Imp was underdeveloped, {{in part because of}} UK Government pressure to start production quickly in response to the job losses in shipbuilding. Mechanical and cooling system problems were commonplace in the early cars. At the end of 1965 a major revision to the Imp was introduced, effectively splitting the marque into Mk I and Mk II cars. The Mk I Imps had a pneumatic throttle linkage and an <b>automatic</b> <b>choke,</b> both of which were replaced by more conventional items on the Mk II. The Mk II also had improved front suspension geometry and several trim and detail changes. Although the car was constantly improved over its production life, there was no single change as significant as that in 1965.|$|E
