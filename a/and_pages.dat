5|$|The Miller {{brothers}} {{wrote the}} entire first novel, but were unsatisfied with the result; the Millers {{pointed out that}} writing a character for a novel is much harder than writing the characters of a game. Hyperion recruited author David Wingrove {{to assist with the}} project; the Millers ended up giving Wingrove a detailed draft, and the author rewrote the entire book. The book's design was made to fit the themes of the game; the novels are made to look like journals found in Myst, with embossed covers <b>and</b> <b>pages</b> darkened as though with time and use.|$|E

30|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer {{diagnosed}} and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States (Howlader et al. 2011). Women with a history of benign breast disease (BBD) are at an increased risk for developing breast cancer. A well-established BBD classification system was developed by Dupont <b>and</b> <b>Page,</b> which consists of (1) non-proliferative disease, (2) proliferative disease without atypia, and (3) proliferative disease with atypia (Dupont <b>and</b> <b>Page</b> 1985). Dupont <b>and</b> <b>Page,</b> <b>and</b> others reviewed more than 10, 000 benign breast biopsies and they found that women with BBD with atypia had a breast cancer relative risk 4.4 times higher than that of the general population (Dupont <b>and</b> <b>Page</b> 1985; Degnim et al. 2007; Morgan et al. 2012).|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} source {{considered as}} {{evidence for a}} connection between the eighth-century codex and Boniface is in a tenth-century vita of the saint written in Utrecht, which says that the saint held a gospel over his head as protection. The Ragyndrudis Codex is not a gospel, but rather a collection of texts on exegesis, apologia, and dogma, but this has not prevented the Codex from being regarded as the saint's shield, an idea enforced by deep cuts through the (original) binding <b>and</b> <b>pages.</b> The Codex is held in the Domschatz, the treasury of the Fulda Cathedral; a facsimile is on display in the cathedral's museum.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Vice President, the Senate has several officers who are not members.

Other employees include the Chaplain, who is elected by the Senate, <b>and</b> <b>Pages,</b> who are appointed.|$|E

Located next to the mosque to the northeast is the Imperial Portraits Collection.|$|E
25|$|Currently one of {{the most}} active areas of {{knowledge}} representation research are projects associated with the semantic web. The semantic web seeks to add a layer of semantics (meaning) on top of the current Internet. Rather than indexing web sites <b>and</b> <b>pages</b> via keywords, the semantic web creates large ontologies of concepts. Searching for a concept will be more effective than traditional text only searches. Frame languages and automatic classification play a big part in the vision for the future semantic web. The automatic classification gives developers technology to provide order on a constantly evolving network of knowledge. Defining ontologies that are static and incapable of evolving on the fly would be very limiting for Internet-based systems. The classifier technology provides the ability to deal with the dynamic environment of the Internet.|$|E
