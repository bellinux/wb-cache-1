5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E

5|$|Parkman also {{believed}} that Pontiac's War had been secretly instigated by French colonists who were stirring up the Native Americans {{in order to make}} trouble for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but subsequent historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. (The rumor of French instigation arose in part because French war belts from the Seven Years' War were still in circulation in some Native villages.) Rather than the French stirring up the Native Americans, some historians now argue that the Native Americans were trying to stir up the French. Pontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Native alliance; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was initiated and conducted by Native Americans who had Native—not French—objectives.|$|E

25|$|The {{credibility}} of the IPET was also challenged in a 42-page letter to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) submitted by Dr. Ray M. Seed, co-chair of the ILIT study. Dr. Seed described an early intentional plan by the Corps of Engineers to hide their mistakes in the New Orleans flooding after Katrina and to intimidate anyone who tried to intervene. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> done with the help and the complicity of some at the ASCE, according to Dr. Seed.|$|E
25|$|On January 16–17, 1991, {{the first}} combat sortie of Operation Desert Storm, and the longest combat sortie in history, at that time, was {{launched}} from Barksdale AFB, Louisiana.

25|$|Bhabha {{announced}} {{that there would}} be 8,000 MW of nuclear power in the country by 1980. As the years progressed, these predictions were to increase. By 1962, the prediction was that nuclear energy would generate 20,000–25,000 MW by 1987, and by 1969, the AEC predicted that by 2000 there would be 43,500 MW of nuclear generating capacity. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> before a single unit of nuclear electricity was produced in the country. Reality was quite different. Installed capacity in 1979–80 was about 600 MW, about 950 MW in 1987, and 2720 MW in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Within 48 {{hours of}} war being declared, the Corps {{was able to}} entirely staff all of Scotland's {{military}} hospitals, freeing the regular staff for service. In addition to this, St Andrew's were also able to assemble two Foreign Service Units (which served in France and in hospital ships), a Military Nursing Service (derived from females Corps members) and a transport service alongside the British Red Cross attending to wounded soldiers from hospital trains. Whilst <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> happening, St Andrew's usual civilian work of first aid training and casualty transportation continued unabated (albeit the additional services placed strain on the Association's funds).|$|E

This resulted in a renaissance period of JavaScript usage spearheaded by open source libraries and the communities that formed around them, with libraries such as Prototype, jQuery, Dojo Toolkit, MooTools, and others being released.|$|E
25|$|Queipo de Llano, {{the leader}} of the coup in Seville, claimed that he seized Seville with a small force of 130 {{soldiers}} and 15 civilians. Also, he said that alone and gun at hand he had arrested the republican general Villa-Abrile and after he had convinced the entire garrison to join the rising, but <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a lie. The coup in Seville was planned by the chief of staff of Seville, José Cuesta Moreneo, and most of the units of the Seville garrison (4,000 men) were involved in the plot. The commander of the Second Military Division, General Jose Villa-Abrille, was aware of the plotters' preparations, but he did nothing.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the tracks}} of Sínulhḵay̓, Xwechtáal could not follow its trail {{directly}} because of the power and energy emitted by the serpent wherever it slithered. Seeing where the trail lead, {{he came to the}} rock face of the Stawamus Chief Mountain. Xwechtáal saw the serpent's path as it went straight up the face of the cliff, leaving a black line of destruction. The man continued through the mountain pass, following the serpent from lake to lake, and creek to creek. While following the serpent, Xwechtáal would train spiritually by taking morning baths in the creeks, lakes and rivers to cleanse himself and become stronger. Day by day, he would sacrifice more of himself, eating a bit less, and sleeping with less blankets and clothes. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> part of his training to kill the serpent.|$|E

25|$|In October 1958, TVR's debt {{with the}} bank was nearing £10,000. At that point in the year, the factory had {{completed}} as few as ten cars, and orders from the United States had almost ceased {{due to the lack}} of sales success there. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> of little concern to TVR director and financier Fred Thomas, as he had apparently intended to close TVR and use the failure as a tax loss to benefit his own engineering firm. In actuality, the directors decided on 30 October that the company would be dissolved and re-formed as Layton Sports Cars Ltd. When the new company began trading in December 1958, the directors voted to immediately inject £15,000 to expand the workforce and build stocks of car components. In February 1959, a sister company was formed under the name Grantura Engineering Ltd. to avoid incurring the UK's Purchase Tax on sales of the cars (which were then still being offered as kits); Purchase Tax would not be applied to kit cars that were purchased from a different company than that which supplied the mechanical components.|$|E
25|$|Frank Rayner, who {{had been}} with the Company since 1887, and had served as its {{engineer}} and later general manager since 1896, died in December 1945. Sir Ernest Jardine, who as vice-chairman had partly funded the first lock at Cromwell in 1908, died in 1947, and the company ceased to exist in 1948, when the waterways were nationalised. The last act of the directors was to pay a 7.5 per cent dividend on the shares in 1950. Having taken over responsibility for the waterway, the Transport Commission enlarged Newark Town lock in 1952, and the flood lock at Holme was removed {{to reduce the risk of}} flooding in Nottingham. More improvements followed between 1957 and 1960. The two locks at Cromwell became one, capable of holding eight Trent barges, dredging equipment was updated, and several of the locks were mechanised. Traffic increased from 620,000 tonnes during 1951 to 1,017,356 tonnes during 1964, but <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> below Nottingham. Commercial carrying above Nottingham ceased during the 1950s, to be replaced by pleasure cruising.|$|E
25|$|Mascis took Cosloy up on {{his offer}} to release an album and Dinosaur {{recorded}} their debut album for $500 at a home studio in the woods outside Northampton, Massachusetts. Their debut album, Dinosaur, was released in 1985. The music was extremely eclectic and revealed a combination of musical styles that was very unusual, especially for the mid-1980s: the speed of hardcore punk, Crazy Horse-style garage rock, slower and monolithic Black Sabbath-style metal riffs, folk rock, twangy country-rock and the dour moods of gothic music. On the band's later albums, these elements would often be combined into single songs, but on the debut album, each individual song is different stylistically. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> delivered with the extreme level of volume and distortion that would {{become part of the}} band's signature style. Mascis wrote all of the songs. Some of the singing was done by Mascis in his trademark nasal drawl (often compared to singer Neil Young), but the majority of the lead vocals were by Lou Barlow. Mascis would sing most or all of the lead vocals on all of their subsequent releases. The album did not make much of an impact commercially or critically: it sold only about 1,500 copies in its first year and was largely ignored by the majority of the music press.|$|E
