5|$|A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle {{went on to}} {{face each}} other in a Last Man Standing match at Hard Justice. This bout was {{announced}} on the July31 episode of Impact!, when Styles challenged <b>Angle</b> <b>to</b> a match at Hard Justice to end their rivalry. This was due to Angle assaulting Styles from behind earlier in the episode. Styles defeated Angle at the event.|$|E
5|$|As {{initially}} conceived, MSR was a short-range {{system for}} tracking Sprint missiles before they {{appeared in the}} MAR's view, as well as offering a secondary target and jammer tracking role. In this initial concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just enough to create tracks to feed back to the MAR. In the anti-jamming role, each MAR and MSR would measure the <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the jammer.|$|E

5|$|Following Destination X, Samoa Joe {{went on to}} Lockdown on April 13, 2008, to face Kurt Angle in a Six Sides of Steel Cage {{match for}} the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. This match was {{announced}} on the March 13, 2008, episode of Impact! by Management Director Jim Cornette. On the April 10, 2008, episode of Impact!, a stipulation was added that if Joe lost he would retire from professional wrestling. At Lockdown, Joe defeated <b>Angle</b> <b>to</b> win the championship.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} at an <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, {{and a pair}} of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|King's Highway55, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway55 and historically as the Niagara Stone Road and Black Swamp Road, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, which connected the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) with Niagara-on-the-Lake, following Niagara Stone Road. The route divided a swath of wineries {{at the foot of the}} Niagara Escarpment, passing at an oblique <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the concession road grid.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the present}} house {{was built in the}} early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon. There is {{speculation}} that it may lie on the site of a Roman building, based on excavations to the south of the house in 1961/62. The house incorporates remnants of a 13th-century building which lie at an <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the rest of the house. It was situated nearly two miles inland from the parish church of St Andrew, which stands on the coast.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 24 January the Archduke's army took {{positions}} east of {{the small town of}} Byczyna on the royal road leading into Poland. They felt secure in their camp, on the Habsburg side of the border, and did not expect the Poles to cross. Zamoyski marshaled his forces into three lines and was able to position them at an <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the opponent's line.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a right <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E

5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right <b>angle</b> <b>to</b> the wind shear direction.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in {{the sixth}} {{encounter}} of the show next. The match lasted 22 minutes and 44 seconds. Angle was accompanied by Tomko to the ring. The referee forced Tomko {{to head to the}} backstage area due to the referee believing he would interfere. Styles attempted to perform his signature Styles Clash maneuver on Angle, which Angle countered into his signature Ankle Lock submission hold. Styles escaped the hold, causing <b>Angle</b> <b>to</b> crash into the referee, knocking him out in the storyline. Karen Angle then ran down to the ringside area and attempted to hand Angle a steel chair. Once Angle grabbed the chair she refused to release, allowing Styles to grab Angle and perform the Styles Clash by slamming Angle face-first into the mat. Styles then followed with the pin attempt to win the contest. After the encounter, Angle and Tomko assaulted Styles.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles {{was joined}} by Christian Cage and Rhino in his feud with Kurt Angle, who {{was joined by}} Team 3D. Styles and Angle faced in a Lumberjack match on the June12 episode of Impact!, which Angle won. Team 3D then injured both Cage and Rhino in the narrative, with Rhino being knocked out on the June19 episode of Impact!, while on the June26 episode of Impact! Cage was slammed through a glass table by Brother Ray. Rhino {{returned}} from injury on the July3 episode of Impact!, challenging Team 3D and <b>Angle</b> <b>to</b> a Six Man Tag Team match at Victory Road, while teasing at adding Full Metal Mayhem rules to the bout. An online poll was held to determine the stipulation for the match, resulting in Full Metal Mayhem being chosen. The team of Angle and Team 3D were the victors at the event.|$|E
