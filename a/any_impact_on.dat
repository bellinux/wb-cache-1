Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.|$|E
5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented that there is little {{evidence}} that the speech had <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the decision {{to tear down}} the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E

Jessica Shea, Community Manager at 343 Industries, warned fans {{to be wary of}} Halo 4 spoilers that were posted on the internet. O'Connor stated at New York Comic Con that leaks of the game and footage would not have <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> how the game is released or marketed and that unlicensed uploading of high-profile games is inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player {{to let them know}} that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the tower, at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.|$|E

25|$|The Federalist {{states in}} the House of Representatives decided to give their votes to Aaron Burr for President when he and Jefferson tied in the Presidential {{election}} of 1800. Their aim was to prevent at any cost the influential and rich in new visions Jefferson from becoming President. With help from Alexander Hamilton, the gridlock was finally broken on the thirty-sixth vote and Jefferson was elected President on February 17, 1801. The events in the House, combined with the increasing Democratic-Republican majorities in the House and Senate, prompted the Democratic-Republicans {{to call for a}} Constitutional amendment requiring separate votes for President and Vice President in the Electoral College. By doing this, the Democratic-Republicans could dash the Federalists' hopes of having <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the Presidential election of 1804.|$|E

Sri Lanka made 4/642 {{declared}} and India was in trouble at 4/241 when Raina came in to join Sachin Tendulkar. Raina went on to reach the maiden century on debut becoming few of Indian players to do so as the pair put on a double century partnership. Yuvraj recovered {{in time for the}} Third Test but the selectors opted to retain Raina. However, due to poor form throughout 2010 (apart from a half century against Australia at Mohali) and a failure to make <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the Centurion Test which South Africa won by an innings, he was dropped in favour of rookie Cheteshwar Pujara {{for the remainder of the}} series, in which India battled back to a 1–1 draw.He made 100.|$|E

Achieving multi-platinum certifications for ringtones and digital downloads in Spain, the song remained {{at the top of}} the Spanish Singles charts for thirteen weeks, becoming Beyoncé's second Spanish chart-topping single, the first being [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] (2007).

[...] He cited Harold Gray's comic strip Little Orphan Annie as having [...] "influenced Maus fairly directly", and praised Gray's work for using a cartoon-based storytelling vocabulary, rather than an illustration-based one. [...] Justin Green's Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary (1972) inspired Spiegelman to include autobiographical elements in his comics.
