CRISM data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) suggests that the gypsum is more concentrated along the crests of dunes than in the interdune hollows. The source of the gypsum is uncertain. Gypsum is an evaporitic mineral that precipitates from saline water; thus, its presence may indicate conditions different from today’s martian environment. The mineral may have formed through the melting of <b>acidic</b> <b>snow,</b> or the melting and discharge of sulfur-rich water {{from the base of}} the polar ice cap. However, the presence of gypsum does not necessarily require large surface water bodies (e.g., playa lakes). The mineral could have formed in volcanically heated groundwater in the shallow subsurface and later been exposed and concentrated by wind erosion and winnowing ("eolian mining").|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of reactive halogen species – particularly Cl 2 – from sea {{ice and snow}} surfaces is not well understood. In this study, we used a photochemical snow reactor coupled to a chemical ionization mass spectrometer to investigate the production of Br 2, BrCl and Cl 2 from NaCl/NaBr-doped artificial snow samples. At temperatures above the NaCl-water eutectic, illumination of samples (λ > 310 nm) {{in the presence of}} gas phase O 3 led to the accelerated release of Br 2, BrCl and the release of Cl 2 in a process that was significantly enhanced by acidity, high surface area and additional gas phase Br 2. Cl 2 production was only observed when both light and ozone were present. The total halogen release depended on [O 3] and pre-freezing [NaCl]. Our observations support a "halogen explosion" mechanism occurring within the snowpack which is initiated by heterogeneous oxidation, and propagated by Br 2 or BrCl photolysis and by recycling of HOBr and HOCl into the snowpack. Our study implicates an important role for active chemistry occurring within the interstitial air of aged (i. e., <b>acidic)</b> <b>snow</b> for halogen activation at polar sunrise...|$|E

Measured Fluxes of {{nitrous acid}} at Browning Pass, Antarctica were very low, despite {{conditions}} that are gener-ally understood as favorable for HONO emissions, includ-ing: <b>acidic</b> <b>snow</b> surfaces, an abundance of NO− 3 anions in the snow surface, and abundant UV light for NO− 3 photol-ysis. Photochemical modeling suggests noon time HONO fluxes of 5 – 10 nmol m− 2 h− 1; the measured fluxes, however, were close to zero throughout the campaign. The location and state of NO− 3 in snow is crucial to its reactivity. The anal-ysis of soluble mineral ions in snow reveals that the NO− 3 ion is probably present in aged snows as NaNO 3. This is peculiar to our study site, and we suggest that this may affect the pho-tochemical reactivity of NO− 3, by preventing the release of products, or providing a reactive medium for newly formed HONO. In fresh snow, the NO− 3 ion is probably present as dissolved or adsorbed HNO 3 and yet, no HONO emissions were observed.
