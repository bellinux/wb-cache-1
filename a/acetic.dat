5|$|<b>Acetic</b> acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial <b>acetic</b> acid. Vinegar is roughly 3–9% <b>acetic</b> acid by volume, making <b>acetic</b> acid {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. <b>Acetic</b> acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated <b>acetic</b> acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetic</b> acid is a {{chemical}} reagent {{for the production}} of chemical compounds. The largest single use of <b>acetic</b> acid is in the production of vinyl acetate monomer, closely followed by <b>acetic</b> anhydride and ester production. The volume of <b>acetic</b> acid used in vinegar is comparatively small.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetic</b> acid is {{produced}} and excreted by <b>acetic</b> acid bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and <b>acetic</b> acid {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. <b>Acetic</b> acid {{is also a}} component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, most glacial <b>acetic</b> acid was {{obtained}} from the pyroligneous liquor, a product of the distillation of wood. The <b>acetic</b> acid was isolated by treatment with milk of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover <b>acetic</b> acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of glacial <b>acetic</b> acid, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye.|$|E
5|$|Glacial <b>acetic</b> acid is an {{excellent}} polar protic solvent, as noted above. It is frequently used as a solvent for recrystallization to purify organic compounds. <b>Acetic</b> acid {{is used as a}} solvent in the production of terephthalic acid (TPA), the raw material for polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In 2006, about 20% of <b>acetic</b> acid was used for TPA production.|$|E
5|$|Glacial <b>acetic</b> acid {{is used in}} {{analytical}} chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial <b>acetic</b> acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial <b>acetic</b> acid of a very strong acid, such as perchloric acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary use}} of <b>acetic</b> acid is the {{production}} of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). In 2008, this application was estimated to consume {{a third of the}} world's production of <b>acetic</b> acid. The reaction consists of ethylene and <b>acetic</b> acid with oxygen over a palladium catalyst, conducted in the gas phase.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetic</b> acid {{injection}} {{into the}} tumor {{has been used}} to treat cancer since the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetic</b> acid {{is often}} used as a solvent for {{reactions}} involving carbocations, such as Friedel-Crafts alkylation. For example, one stage in the commercial manufacture of synthetic camphor involves a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement of camphene to isobornyl acetate; here <b>acetic</b> acid acts both as a solvent and as a nucleophile to trap the rearranged carbocation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetic</b> acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of <b>acetic</b> acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to <b>acetic</b> acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. <b>Acetic</b> acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin <b>acetic</b> acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin <b>acetic</b> acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetic</b> acid {{is used as}} part of {{cervical}} cancer screening in many areas in the developing world. <b>Acetic</b> acid {{is applied to the}} cervix and if an area of white appears after about a minute the test is positive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetic</b> {{anhydride}} is an acetylation agent. As such, {{its major}} application is for cellulose acetate, a synthetic textile {{also used for}} photographic film. <b>Acetic</b> anhydride is also a reagent {{for the production of}} heroin and other compounds.|$|E
5|$|Amounts of <b>acetic</b> acid used {{in these}} other {{applications}} together (apart from TPA) account for another 5–10% of <b>acetic</b> acid use worldwide. These applications are, however, not expected to grow as much as TPA production.|$|E
5|$|At {{physiological}} pHs, <b>acetic</b> acid {{is usually}} fully ionised to acetate.|$|E
5|$|In 1845 German chemist Hermann Kolbe {{synthesised}} <b>acetic</b> acid from {{inorganic compounds}} {{for the first}} time. This reaction sequence consisted of chlorination of carbon disulfide to carbon tetrachloride, followed by pyrolysis to tetrachloroethylene and aqueous chlorination to trichloroacetic acid, and concluded with electrolytic reduction to <b>acetic</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th-century German alchemist Andreas Libavius {{described}} {{the production of}} acetone from the dry distillation of lead acetate, ketonic decarboxylation. The presence of water in vinegar has such {{a profound effect on}} <b>acetic</b> acid's properties that for centuries chemists believed that glacial <b>acetic</b> acid and the acid found in vinegar were two different substances. French chemist Pierre Adet proved them identical.|$|E
5|$|Ionization of acids is less in an acidic solvent than in water. For example, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a weak acid when dissolved in <b>acetic</b> acid. This is because <b>acetic</b> acid {{is a much}} weaker base than water.|$|E
5|$|Liquid <b>acetic</b> acid is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, {{similar to}} ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), <b>acetic</b> acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of <b>acetic</b> acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged skin {{contact with}} glacial <b>acetic</b> acid {{may result in}} tissue destruction. Inhalation {{exposure}} (eight hours) to <b>acetic</b> acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. Skin sensitization to <b>acetic</b> acid is rare, but has occurred.|$|E
5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% <b>acetic</b> acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute <b>acetic</b> acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life. It can cause severe damage to the digestive system, and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E
5|$|The acetyl group, {{formally}} {{derived from}} <b>acetic</b> acid, {{is fundamental to}} all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it {{is central to the}} metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Unlike longer-chain carboxylic acids (the fatty acids), <b>acetic</b> acid does not occur in natural triglycerides. However, the artificial triglyceride triacetin (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} {{will be based}} on utilizing a novel selective photocatalytic oxidation technology for the selective oxidation of ethylene and ethane to <b>acetic</b> acid. Unlike traditional oxidation catalysts, the selective oxidation process will use UV light to produce <b>acetic</b> acid at ambient temperatures and pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{global demand}} for <b>acetic</b> acid is about 6.5 {{million metric tons}} per year (Mt/a), of which {{approximately}} 1.5Mt/a is met by recycling; the remainder is manufactured from methanol. Vinegar is mostly dilute <b>acetic</b> acid, often produced by fermentation and subsequent oxidation of ethanol.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of ethylenediamine dihydroiodide, provided as a nutritional supplement for livestock, consumes {{a large portion}} of available iodine. Another significant use is a catalyst for the {{production of}} <b>acetic</b> acid by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. In these technologies, which support the world's demand for <b>acetic</b> acid, hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes carbonylation. Hydrolysis of the resulting acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives <b>acetic</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{trivial name}} <b>acetic</b> acid {{is the most}} {{commonly}} used and preferred IUPAC name. The systematic name ethanoic acid, a valid IUPAC name, is constructed according to the substitutive nomenclature. The name <b>acetic</b> acid derives from acetum, the Latin word for vinegar, and is related to the word acid itself.|$|E
5|$|Using modern catalysts, this {{reaction}} {{can have an}} <b>acetic</b> acid yield greater than 95%. The major side-products are ethyl acetate, formic acid, and formaldehyde, {{all of which have}} lower boiling points than <b>acetic</b> acid and are readily separated by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Vinegar is {{typically}} 4–18% <b>acetic</b> acid by mass. Vinegar is used directly as a condiment, {{and in the}} pickling of vegetables and other foods. Table vinegar {{tends to be more}} diluted (4% to 8% <b>acetic</b> acid), while commercial food pickling employs solutions that are more concentrated. The proportion of <b>acetic</b> acid used worldwide as vinegar is not as large as commercial uses, but is by far the oldest and best-known application.|$|E
5|$|By {{altering}} the process conditions, <b>acetic</b> anhydride {{may also be}} produced on the same plant using the rhodium catalysts.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated <b>acetic</b> acid can be ignited {{only with}} {{difficulty}} at standard temperature and pressure, but becomes a flammable risk in temperatures greater than , and can form explosive mixtures with air at higher temperatures (explosive limits: 5.4–16%).|$|E
5|$|Due to incompatibilities, it is {{recommended}} to keep <b>acetic</b> acid away from chromic acid, ethylene glycol, nitric acid, perchloric acid, permanganates, peroxides and hydroxyls.|$|E
5|$|Formulations {{containing}} {{high concentrations}} of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions, yielding salicylic and <b>acetic</b> acids.|$|E
5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates <b>acetic</b> acid. The {{rate at which the}} <b>acetic</b> acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} case, <b>acetic</b> acid reacts with the calcium {{carbonate}} (one {{of the main}} components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing calcium acetate, a salt. Formaldehyde can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create formic acid, which then has basically the same effects as <b>acetic</b> acid, reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts (calcium acetate and calcium formate) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar <b>acetic</b> acid was {{discovered}} in 1996 by {{a team led by}} David Mehringer using the former Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory and the former Millimeter Array located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. It was first detected in the Sagittarius B2 North molecular cloud (also known as the Sgr B2 Large Molecule Heimat source). <b>Acetic</b> acid has the distinction of being the first molecule discovered in the interstellar medium using solely radio interferometers; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{compounds}} {{are used}} as catalysts in the Cativa process for carbonylation of methanol to produce <b>acetic</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|The capping step is {{performed}} by treating the solid support-bound material {{with a mixture}} of <b>acetic</b> anhydride and 1-methylimidazole or, less often, DMAP as catalysts and, in the phosphoramidite method, serves two purposes.|$|E
