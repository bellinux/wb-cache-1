25|$|Also {{known as}} a Janney coupler and the buckeye coupler, the knuckle coupler is the {{derivative}} of <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> that links and connects rolling railway cars such as passenger, refrigerator, freight, and stock cars together on railroad track.

50|$|Sellers {{obtained}} {{more than}} thirty letters-patent for inventions of his own, {{one of the first}} of which, <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> for shafting (1857), is the essential factor in the modern system of interchangeable shafting parts. In 1861, he patented the Kinematoscope (United States Patent 31357), a protean development in the history of film. His invention in 1866 of feed-disks for lathes or other machine tools was the first practical solution of the problem of the infinite gradation of feeds. His other patents relate chiefly to improved forms of tools or modifications of existing machines. The use of absorbent cotton for surgical operations was recommended by him as early as 1861, and he proposed the employment of glycerine in order to keep photographic plates wet.|$|E
50|$|In all {{vehicles}} using {{a transmission}} (virtually all modern vehicles), <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> {{is used to}} separate the engine and transmission when necessary. This is because an internal-combustion engine must continue to run when in use, although a few modern cars shut off the engine when the vehicle is stationary. The clutch accomplishes this in manual transmissions. Without it, the engine and tires would at all times be inextricably linked, and any time the vehicle stopped, the engine would stall. Without the clutch, changing gears would be very difficult, even with the vehicle moving already: deselecting a gear while the transmission is under load requires considerable force (and risks significant damage). As well, selecting a gear requires the revolution speed of the engine {{to be held at}} a very precise value which depends on the vehicle speed and desired gear - the speeds inside the transmission have to match. In a car, the clutch is usually operated by a pedal; on a motorcycle, a lever on the left handlebar serves the purpose.|$|E

50|$|One {{problem with}} X10 is {{excessive}} attenuation of signals {{between the two}} live conductors in the 3-wire 120/240 volt system used in typical North American residential construction. Signals from a transmitter on one live conductor may not propagate through the high impedance of the distribution transformer winding to the other live conductor. Often, there's simply no reliable path to allow the X10 signals to propagate from one transformer leg wire to the other; this failure may {{come and go as}} large 240 volt devices such as stoves or dryers are turned on and off. (When turned on, such devices provide a low-impedance bridge for the X10 signals between the two leg wires.) This problem can be permanently overcome by installing a capacitor between the leg wires as a path for the X10 signals; manufacturers commonly sell signal couplers that plug into 240 volt sockets that perform this function. More sophisticated installations install an active repeater device between the legs, while others combine signal amplifiers with <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>device.</b> A repeater is also needed for inter-phase communication in homes with three-phase electric power. In many countries outside North America, entire houses are typically wired from a single 240 volt single-phase wire, so this problem does not occur.|$|E
