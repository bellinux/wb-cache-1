5|$|Although Utica's {{population}} is predominantly European American, it has diversified since the 1990s. New immigrants <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> have included Bosnians (displaced by the Bosnian War), Russians, Burmese, Vietnamese, and Latinos. More than 15 languages are spoken in the city. Utica {{has a low}} cost of living but its industrial and economic decline have posed difficulties for people {{trying to make a}} new start.|$|E
5|$|Despite the city's {{economic}} decline, it {{has benefited}} from a low cost of living, attracting immigrants <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> from around the world. Among the new waves of immigrants are Muslim Bosnians and Buddhist Vietnamese. Further bolstering the city are its commercial, educational and cultural ties to the Capital District and Syracuse metropolitan areas.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proceeds}} in four parts. It 1) {{summarizes the}} philosophical debate about issues of justice applied to immigration <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> policy; 2) proposes a category framework for making immigration <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> policy; 3) relates the debate concerning {{justice to the}} debates on immigration <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> policy; 4) applies the various concepts of justice to a few specific immigration <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> issues to illustrate {{the applicability of the}} framework while clarifying how issues of justice can be applied to immigration <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> policy...|$|R
50|$|Established in 1989, the Immigration <b>and</b> <b>Refugee</b> Board of Canada (commonly {{referred}} to as Immigration <b>and</b> <b>Refugee</b> Board or simply the IRB), is an independent administrative tribunal {{that is responsible for}} making well-rounded and fair decisions on immigration <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> matters.|$|R

5|$|When Shanghai {{fell to the}} Japanese, Hu and her women {{soldiers}} retreated inland {{with hundreds}} of thousands of soldiers <b>and</b> <b>refugees.</b> They reached Wuhan after many nights of gruelling marches. She gave her written accounts of the corps to the war reporter Fan Changjiang, who distributed them widely and made Hu's corps famous in China. She became the first Chinese woman to be awarded the rank of major general by the Republic of China's Central Military Commission.|$|E
5|$|After the Central African Republic {{attained}} {{independence in}} 1960, developmental activities began, and the urbanization of Bangui ensued. This {{is evidenced by}} the population growth from 279,800 in 1975 to 427,435 in 1988 to 524,000 by 1994. and to 652,000 in 2001. Apart from the ethnic people of the country, the city is also home for a minority group of Greek, Portuguese and Yemeni traders, and also has a small community of French people. The Bangui resident community includes diamond traders from western Africa and Chad, traders from many African countries, <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1975, {{smallpox}} persisted only in the Horn of Africa. Conditions {{were very}} difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia, where there were few roads. Civil war, famine, <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> made the task even more difficult. An intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in these countries in early and mid-1977, {{under the direction of}} Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner. As the campaign neared its goal, Fenner and his team {{played an important role in}} verifying eradication. The last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox (Variola minor) was diagnosed in Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital cook in Merca, Somalia, on 26 October 1977. The last naturally occurring case of the more deadly Variola major had been detected in October 1975 in a two-year-old Bangladeshi girl, Rahima Banu.|$|E
40|$|In {{a context}} of mass {{displacement}} and flows of asylum-seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> peoples across national borders, the need to respond and attend {{to the education of}} asylum-seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children is urgent and pressing, though it is not without its challenges. This literature review focuses on the educational experiences of asylum seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children, including those who are unaccompanied, with a particular focus on inclusion. It seeks to respond to the following three interconnected questions: 1. What does current educational literature tell us about the educational needs and experiences of asylumseeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children as they relate to inclusion? 2. What does current educational literature tell us about the educational needs and experiences of unaccompanied asylum-seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children as they relate to inclusion? 3. What implications and recommendations can be drawn from existing literature? The review has a particular interest in the needs and experiences of unaccompanied asylum-seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children, but recognises that though there is a developing literature specifically on unaccompanied asylum seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children (see, for example, Stanley, 2001; Derluyn and Broekaert, 2008; Pastoor, 2015) such needs must be understood and positioned in relation to the wider educational needs and experiences of asylum seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children more generally. While other literature reviews on asylum-seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children are available (see, for example, Hek, 2005; McBrien, 2005), the present review adds to existing work by: • including an explicit focus on the educational needs and experiences of asylum-seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children who are unaccompanied; • providing an up-to-date review of literature which analyses and reports the educational needs and experiences of asylum-seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children. The review focuses in particular on post-migration experiences within school settings as they relate to asylum seeking <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> children’s social inclusion...|$|R

40|$|The public {{perception}} of young people from migrant <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> backgrounds is often associated with crime or offending behaviour. Unbalanced media stories sometimes reinforce these stereotypes. Executive summary This paper aims to gain a more accurate picture of migrant <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> youth offending, by comparing media portrayals with available police, census and Youth Justice (Department of Human Services) data. To set the context, it briefly explores risk and protective factors, with specific regard to the migrant <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> experience. It also examines the negative impact that misinformed {{public perception}} can have upon the lives of young people from migrant <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> backgrounds. While the picture is still incomplete, as the data collected is currently inconsistent, CMY believes that the available data points to migrant <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> young people being under-represented in the Victoria Police and Youth Justice systems. However, there are particular ethnic groups who appear to be over-represented {{in relation to their}} population in Victoria. There is an urgent need for increased and more accurate data which is essential to develop effective and culturally relevant programs for migrant <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> youth; decrease the number of migrant <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> youth entering the Youth Justice system; and to challenge inaccurate stereotypes. This is particularly important in regards to specific groups who seem to be over-represented in crime statistics. In addition, it is evident that a better response is needed to not only challenges the negative media portrayal of many migrant <b>and</b> <b>refugee</b> young people but also allows these youth to better represent themselves in the media...|$|R
5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind for {{seven to eight}} months. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UNPROFOR, did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UNPAs. The UNPROFOR was tasked with demilitarisation of the UNPAs, ceasefire maintenance, monitoring of local police and creating conditions for return of internally displaced persons <b>and</b> <b>refugees.</b> Those comprised more than 300,000 Croats who were exiled from the RSK-controlled territory, and 20,000 Serbs who fled the areas of western Slavonia captured by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) in Operations Swath-10, Papuk-91 and Hurricane-91 in late 1991.|$|E
5|$|From {{the turn}} of the century, gang warfare persisted in the Whitechapel and Aldgate areas of London between groups of Bessarabians <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> from Odessa, and various revolutionary factions were active in the area. One event, the Tottenham Outrage of January 1909, by two revolutionary Russians in London—Paul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus—was an attempt to rob a payroll van, which left two dead and twenty injured. The event used a tactic often {{employed}} by revolutionary groups in Russia: the expropriation or theft of private property to fund radical activities.|$|E
5|$|Mihailović was {{the first}} to receive reports of contact between the Germans and Partisans, and passed them on to his British Special Operations Executive liaison officer, Colonel Bill Bailey. When Bailey's report arrived in London on 22 March, it was not taken seriously. Italian {{military}} intelligence also became aware of the talks. Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, but when they realised more was being discussed and demanded an explanation, Tito was taken aback. He responded that he was not getting any external support, and needed to look after the interests of captured Partisans <b>and</b> <b>refugees.</b>|$|E

5|$|Since 1999 or earlier, an {{increasingly}} {{large number of}} migrants <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> started to arrive {{in the vicinity of}} Calais, living in the Calais jungle, the nickname given to a series of makeshift camps. The people lived there while they attempted to enter the United Kingdom by stowing away on lorries, ferries, cars, or trains travelling through the Port of Calais or the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal. The people were a mix of refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants from Darfur, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Eritrea and other troubled areas of the world.|$|E
5|$|The Calais migrant crisis led to {{escalating}} {{tension between}} the UK and France {{in the summer of}} 2015. The UK blamed France for not doing enough to stop migrants from entering the tunnel or making attempts to scale fences built along the border. The British Prime Minister David Cameron released a statement saying that illegal immigrants would be removed from the UK even if they reached the island. To discourage migrants <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> from jumping on train shuttles at Calais, the UK government supplied fencing to be installed in the Eurotunnel where the vehicles are loaded onto train shuttles in Calais.|$|E

5|$|The {{war ended}} with Croatian victory, as it {{achieved}} the goals it had declared {{at the beginning}} of the war: independence and preservation of its borders. Approximately 21–25% of Croatia's economy was ruined, with an estimated US$37billion in damaged infrastructure, lost output, and refugee-related costs. A total of 20,000 people were killed in the war, <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> were displaced on both sides. The Serb and Croatian governments began to progressively cooperate with each other but tension remains, in part due to verdicts by the ICTY and lawsuits filed by each country against the other.|$|E
5|$|During the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) the château was {{occupied}} several {{times by the}} English. It was demolished in 1442, but was soon rebuilt using the original stones. In the religious wars of 16th and 17th centuries the château was a base for Huguenot forces, and in 1650 it was partly demolished by royal troops. Another château was erected but it received extensive damage in a fire in 1793 during the French Revolution. The château was renovated in the romantic style after the Bourbon Restoration of 1815, and has been extensively modified since then. During World War II (1939–45) the château housed French troops <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> from Alsace-Lorraine in 1940 and for several months it was partially occupied by some German units. In 1944 {{some members of the}} maquis were hidden there. The château was listed as a monument historique on 31 March 1966, and obtained full protection on 19 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|In Lindblum, {{the party}} meets with Cid, who {{explains}} that he hired the group to kidnap Garnet to get her away from Brahne, who also worries him. Upon learning that Alexandria has invaded the city-state of Burmecia, the party splits in two. Zidane, Vivi, and new joinee Freya investigate Burmecia, while Dagger and Steiner journey back to Alexandria {{to try to stop}} Brahne from starting a war. Zidane's group finds that Burmecia has been conquered with help from a man named Kuja, <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> have fled to the nearby city of Cleyra. They rush to Cleyra to defend it from the encroaching forces. Dagger, meanwhile, is ignored and captured by Brahne, who extracts powerful magical weapons called eidolons from her. Brahne proceeds to use one to destroy Cleyra. Zidane and company escaped the city on Brahne's airship and rescue Garnet, but while they do so Brahne attacks Lindblum with another eidolon.|$|E

On 2 May she shelled Soviet Army forces from the Oder estuary. On 3 May she, {{alongside}} the battleship , moved to protect the bridge across the Peene river at Wolgast. After Schlesien hit a mine near Greifswalder Oie on the same day, Z39 towed her to Swinemünde, where Schlesien was deliberately grounded. The ship was placed so that her guns could fire on and defend roads leading into the city. One day later, Z34, Z38, Z39, Z43, T33, T36, ship tender Jagd, German auxiliary cruiser Orion, anti-aircraft ship Hummel, and five steamer ships, sailed for Copenhagen, taking 35,000 wounded soldiers <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> with them.

5|$|Throughout April {{there were}} {{numerous}} attempts by UNAMIR to establish a ceasefire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April, the RPF secured {{the whole of the}} Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance, except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June, had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the FAR forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far northwest. As well as fighting the war, Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide <b>and</b> <b>refugees</b> from Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.|$|E
