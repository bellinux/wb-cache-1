The parent nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPnEO), covering oligomer range of 1 - 18 ethoxy units per molecule, were extracted from water sam-ples using solid-phase extraction on graphitised carbon black (GCB), while their lipophilic metabolites, including nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP 1 EO), nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP 2 EO) and nonylphenol (NP), were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction into n-hexane. The extracts were analysed by normal-phase HPLC using amino-silica columns and fluorescence detection at 228 / 305 nm. This allowed reliable quantitative determination of individual oligomers down to 0. 1 μg/l. Analyses of sewage effluents collected in several sewage treatment plants of the Canton of Zürich, Switzerland, indicated that NPnEO occur at significant concentrations (96 - 430 μg/l) despite the partial ban introduced in 1986. Oligomer distributions found in analysed sewage samples revealed that the major part of toxic lipophilic metabolites, including NP, still originate from detergent-derived NPnEO...|$|E

This process {{can be made by}} cloud point of polyethoxylated alcohols and micellar solubilization phenomenon. It is commonly called “coacervate extraction” and is used, in our case, for humic acid extraction from aqueous solution at 100 mg/L.

40|$|Concentrations of the weakly {{oestrogenic}} {{degradation products}} of <b>alkylphenol</b> <b>polyethoxylate</b> (APE) surfactants (nonylphenol, octylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate and nonylphenol diethoxylate) were measured {{in water and}} sediments from British rivers and estuaries collected during 1994 and 1995. In addition, a series of samples of tissues of wild fish from the River Aire, and from a laboratory dosing experiment were analysed for alkylphenols, to assess the degree of bioaccumulation of these compounds. Measurable concentrations of APE residues were recorded in the River Aire (15 – 76 μg/l total extractable alkylphenols), the River Mersey (6 – 11 μg/l) and the Tees estuary (up to 76 μg/l). These levels exceed, or are close to, the no observed effect concentration for the induction of vitellogenesis in caged trout (5 – 20 μg/l total extractable alkylphenols), and may be sufficient to exert an oestrogenic effect on fish populations in these areas. A sediment sample from Bingley on the River Aire contained 15 μg/g (dry weight) nonylphenol, and concentrations in sediments from the Tees and Mersey estuaries exceeded 1 μg/g. These rivers receive a variety of trade waters via sewage treatment works (STW) effluents containing significant concentrations of APE. Elsewhere, concentrations in water and sediments were near or below limits of detection and biological effects are unlikely, suggesting that any oestrogenic effects observed in sewage outfalls and rivers not directly impacted by APE-containing trade-waters {{may be caused by}} other chemicals. Analysis of samples of trout muscle taken from a tank dosed at 65 μg/l nonylphenol indicated a bioaccumulation factor of between 90 and 125 after 3 weeks exposure. Samples of wild fish from the River Aire contained up to 0. 8 μg/g nonylphenol in the muscle, a tissue bioaccumulation factor of approximately 50 relative to measured concentrations in water samples.

Octylphenol {{is considered to}} be the most stable degradation intermediate formed from the corresponding nonionic octylphenol polyethoxylates surfactants during biological wastewater treatment. Since octylphenol can exert estrogenic effects in wildlife, a detailed study of its biodegradation is warranted. The aerobic microbiological transformation of octylphenol was examined with and without the addition of the easily assimilable sodium acetate. In both cases the formation of the metabolite 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 2 -pentanol, representing the intact alkyl chain as a tertiary alcohol, was observed. Since the octylphenol degradation rate was not affected by the presence of acetate, this strain did not show any diauxic metabolic behaviour when incubated with octylphenol and sodium acetate as the sources of carbon and energy.

Concentrations of BPA and four alkylphenolic compounds in toilet paper, wastepaper, and cellulose have been investigated at the Department of Waste Management, Dresden University of Technology, Germany. Preliminary results and calculations are presented. With one exception, all xenoestrogens studied were determined in all toilet paper samples at very high concentrations of 2 – 430 mg/kg dry mass (DM). The BPA concentrations in seven classes of wastepaper amounted to 0. 093 to 5. 1 mg/kg DM. In three types of cellulose the EDC concentrations were below or hardly above the respective limit of quantification. Toilet paper, thus, was shown being an important source of xenoestrogen emissions to wastewater. Thermal paper again is estimated being a major source for the contamination of recycled paper with BPA.

40|$|For {{the last}} 40 y, {{substantial}} evidence has surfaced on the hormone-like effects of environmental chemicals such as pesticides and industrial chemicals in wildlife and humans. The endocrine and reproductive {{effects of these}} chemicals {{are believed to be}} due to their ability to: (1) mimic the effect of endogenous hormones, (2) antagonize the effect of endogenous hormones, (3) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of endogenous hormones, and (4) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of hormone receptors.

Aviation crop dusters handling DDT were found to have reduced sperm counts, and workers at a plant producing the insecticide kepone were reported to have lost their libido, became impotent and had low sperm counts. Subsequently, experiments conducted in lab animals demonstrated unambiguously the estrogenic activity of these pesticides.

40|$|Neurodegeneration, a {{progressive}} loss of nerve cells (neurons), occurs in many neurological disorders including Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, Schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Cytoskeletal disruption in neurons and aggregation of proteins {{associated with these}} disorders {{is the hallmark of}} neurodegeneration. However, the cause of neurodegenerative disorders is unknown and currently there are no effective drug treatments. Aging is the most consistent risk factor for developing a neurodegenerative disorder, and recent evidence suggests that environmental factors, which act as endocrine disruptors, pose a risk in the disease process. 4 - nonylphenol (4 -NP), an endocrine-disrupting compound (EDC), has been shown to affect brain development and may cause neurodegeneration. In the environment, 4 -NP arises as a degradation product of <b>alkylphenol</b> <b>polyethoxylates,</b> compounds widely used as nonionic surfactants in commercial production, as well as in herbicides, pesticides, polystyrene plastics, and paints and has been shown to undergo high level of accumulation in biological tissues. However, the mechanism by which 4 -NP exerts its effect is not understood. Recent results from our laboratory indicate that Gβγ, {{an important component of the}} G protein-signaling pathway, induces neurite outgrowth and that the interactions of Gβγ with microtubules (MTs), an important component of the cytoskeleton, is important for this process. Furthermore, we found that blocking the Gβγ-MT interaction induces neurodegeneration. The goal of the present research is to determine whether 4 -NP inhibits neurite outgrowth and induces neurodegeneration by altering the Gβγ-MT- mediated pathway, and if other cytoskeletal components are involved in this process. Pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells were used to conduct the study because they respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) and exhibit a typical phenotype of neurons. In Specific Aim 1, using biochemical, pharmacological, and immunoconfocal methodologies, I have demonstrated that 4 - NP inhibits neurite outgrowth and induces neurodegeneration by altering MT-Gβγ interaction in PC 12 cells. In Specific Aim 2, I have conducted the proteomic analysis of 4 -NP treated cells and found that the compound affects the cytoskeletal profile in NGF-differentiated PC 12 cells. In conclusion, I propose that one of the mechanisms by which 4 -NP causes neuronal damage is by altering the Gβγ-cytoskeletal mediated pathway, which is critical for neuronal growth and development. ...|$|R

The APEOs DPs analyzed included two nonylphenol carboxylates (NP 2 EC, NP 1 EC), two octylphenol carboxylates (OP 2 EC, OP 1 EC), nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP). The highest groundwater concentrations of APEOs DPs were detected in aquifers whose major source of recharge is a river receiving large amounts of effluents from secondary waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). In fact, APEOs DPs concentrations were above those in the river. NP 2 EC was the compound detected at highest concentrations. These increase with ammonium in samples with low dissolved oxygen. These degradation products were virtually absent in oxidizing aquifers whose main source of recharge is not the river. In this case, only the ultimate degradation product (NP) was detected, which suggests that parent compounds have degraded. These results indicate that APEOs are persistent or less degraded in reducing conditions, whereas they are degraded when oxidizing conditions prevail. By contrast, LAS concentrations were more than one order of magnitude lower than expected based on recharge sources in all (oxidizing and reducing) aquifers.

Chemicals were administered via the drinking water or concentrations of 10 - 1000 micrograms/l (OP) or 1000 micrograms/l (BBP), diethylstilbestrol (DES; 100 micrograms/l) and an octylphenol polyethoxylate (OPP; 1000 micrograms/l), which is a weak estrogen or nonestrogenic in vitro, were administered as presumptive positive and negative controls, respectively. Controls received the vehicle (ethanol) in tap water. In study 1, rats were treated from days 1 - 22 after births in studies 2 and 3, the mothers were treated for approximately 8 - 9 weeks, spanning a 2 -week period before mating throughout gestation and 22 days after giving birth. With the exception of DES, treatment generally had no major adverse effect or body weight: in most instances, treated animals were heavier than controls at day 22 and at days 90 - 95. Exposure to OP, OPP, or BBP at a concentration of 1000 micrograms/ 1 resulted in a small (5 - 13 %) but significant (p < 0. 01 or p < 0. 0001) reduction in mean testicular size in studies 2 and 3, an effect that was still evident when testicular weight was expressed relative to body, weight or kidney weight. The effect of OPP is attributed to its metabolism in vivo to OP. DES exposure caused similar reductions in testicular size but also caused reductions in body weight, kidney weight, and litter size. Ventral prostate weight was reduced significantly in DES-treated rats and to minor extent in OP-treated rats. Comparable but more minor effects of treatment with DES or OP on testicular size were observed in study 1.

40|$|Non-ionic surfactants, <b>alkylphenol</b> <b>polyethoxylates</b> (APnEOs, where n designates {{the number}} of ethoxy (EO) units) are {{primarily}} available as nonyl- or octylphenol polyethoxylates (NPnEOs and OPnEOs). NPnEOs are often a mixture of oligomers with various isomeric and branched nonyl side chains, while OPnEOs consist of only 4 -tert-OP ethoxymers. Their starting materials, APs are formed in the environment as their final degradation products. The ability of APs to bioaccumulate and exhibit toxicity and estrogenic activity is strongly tied to their structures. To address the analysis of APnEOs homologues, oligomers and NPs and NPnEOs isomers, hyphenated chromatographic techniques have been developed in the current study. The principles and mechanisms of comprehensive 2 D separations (C 2 DS) were understood using GC×GC-FPD as a model. The applicability of GC×GC for the complete resolution of NPs isomers was investigated although co-elution was always observed. Thus, comparative study of the identification of NPs isomers was performed using EIC, AMDIS and HELP chemometric resolution approaches based on the GC-MS results. Chemometric method provided the pure chromatograms and mass spectra of 15 NPs isomers determined, which failed to be obtained by EIC or AMDIS methods. Since the degradation of NPnEOs {{does not change the}} structure of the nonyl side chain, the isomeric composition of commercial NPnEOs was studied. NPLC first separated NPnEOs into individual oligomers. Preparative collection of each early eluting ethoxymer fraction allowed further separation of different isomeric nonyl group components by using analytical GC-MS. The GC-MS results suggest that each fraction has the same isomeric composition and each corresponding peak has the same isomeric structure. Prep-GC coupled with GC-MS and NMR elucidated the molecular structure of one resolved NP 2 EOs isomer. This is described in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 consists of two studies, which focus on the HILIC technology. The separation mechanism was studied on a zwitterionic HILIC column. Adsorption was shown to be the dominant mechanism while hydrophilic and electrostatic interactions also contributed to the retention under different conditions. On the bare silica packing materials, both adsorption and partition were responsible for retention. The baseline resolution of NPnEOs ethoxymers demonstrated the applicability of HILIC-ESI-MS method. For the simultaneous determination of APnEOs homologues and oligomers, an LC×LC system was established, as reported in Chapter 5. Different separation modes - NPLC, RPLC and HILIC - were compared in terms of separation for alkyl and EO distributions. NPLC offered better resolution than HILIC; however, the immiscibility of non-polar NPLC solvent with RPLC mobile phases leads to HILIC being chosen as 1 D. The need and meaning of comprehensiveness and orthogonality were understood through the use and suggestions for definitions, nomenclature and symbols. A HILIC×RPLC system was then set up and its capability was demonstrated by complete simultaneous separation of APnEOs into individual oligomers, with each alkyl end group resolved. Different descriptors and metrics for assessing system orthogonality were investigated with the obtainment of a relatively high dimensionality of 1. 76. Finally, Chapter 6 provides general conclusions, highlighting the key outcomes in each study and proposes areas for attention and future work...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} development has brought prosperity {{to millions of}} people, but has also left a legacy of polluted environment that continues to impact our natural resources, and ultimately, human well being. Nowadays, many synthetic organic chemicals are of growing concern, because of their high toxicity and high persistence in the environment and in biological systems. Furthermore, the high lipophilicity {{of many of these}} xenobiotics greatly enhances their bioaccumulation, thereby posing potential health hazards. On the other hand, sewage treatment plants (STPs) are the barriers of the environment, where the undesired xenobiotic compounds dissolved in sewages are biotranformed and/or sorbed to sludge. The most common method of sludge disposal in Europe is stabilization by anaerobic treatment, thickening, and spreading on agricultural land or landfills. This yields valuable biogas, and recycles nutrients to agriculture, as well as conditioning of the soil. Problems related to agricultural recycling of sludge include the presence of pollutants, including priority pollutants identified in the EU urban water directives. These include metals, halogenated organics, pharmaceuticals, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), <b>alkylphenol</b> <b>polyethoxylates</b> (APE), phthalic acid esters (PAE), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Metals are currently managed by precipitation, while halogenated aromatics are readily removed by anaerobic dehalogenation. However, pharmaceuticals, LAS, APE, PAE, and PAH are often present in significant quantities in the sludge. Additionally, due to their low solubility most of the compounds will fractionate to the solids portion (i. e., sludge), rather than to the soluble portion (i. e., effluent). As another factor, many of these compounds are inhibitory, and the impact on digester performance is unknown. In this work, we identify the impact of these pollutants on the anaerobic process itself, as well as degradation of the target compounds. For the pharmaceuticals we used a glucose based synthetic medium and continuous reactors operated in a draw and fill mode. For the other compounds we used different types of biological sludge (primary, secondary and mixture) and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR). Additionally in order to assess their impact in anaerobic digestion process batch experiments took place, for all xenobiotics. Furthermore, organic acids are widely recognised as the most appropriate process indicator. To assess comparative impact separately, the (CSTR) reactors were simulated using a widely used model (ADM 1), and the kinetics were assessed statistically by estimating uncertainty in key parameters. The response of the reactors to each pharmaceutical was different. In particular, triclosan and ofloxacin seemed to inhibit the anaerobic digestion process, increasing the dissolved COD concentration rapidly, This upset lasted for some days, but afterwards, the reactor came back to normal levels of performance. Specific methanogenic activity tests showed that triclosan and propranolol inhibited the methanogenesis step significantly, on the other hand clofibric acid and sulfamethoxazole seemed not to affect methanogenesis even at high concentrations. The relative toxicity of the pharmaceuticals may be different at different concentrations. All pharmaceuticals found to be persistent under anaerobic conditions with the exception of sulfamethoxazole. The other target toxic organic compounds had no statistical impact on performance in the contaminated reactors, as compared to an uncontaminated control. This was not only observed in gas flow, but also by statistical analysis of the dynamic removal of acetate and propionate. However, LAS, NPEO, NP and phenanthrene were highly persistent, with no demonstratable removal. DEHP was partially degraded. The mass transfer rate was rate limiting for DEHP removal, meaning that, the solids functioned as a tank equalizing the concentration of the DEHP throughout the solid particle and responded to the changes in the surface concentration at a slower rate than that attributed to biodegradation. Finally it was demonstrated that applying a post-aeration method for anaerobically digested sludge it is possible to reduce some of the selected organic micropollutants. ...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Biyokimyasal olarak zor ayrışan, arıtmaya karşı dirençli, toksik ve/veya mutajenik etkileri olan bazı endüstriyel kirleticilerin su kaynaklarımızdaki varlığı ekosistemleri tehdit etmektedir. Endokrin bozucu özellikleri olduğu bilinen ve noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerin bileşiminde bulunan alkil fenol polietoksilat metabolitlerinin konvansiyonel fiziksel, biyolojik ve kimyasal arıtma yöntemleri ile giderimleri yetersiz kalmaktadır. Bu nedenle alkil fenol polietoksilatların ve alkil fenollerin ileri oksidasyon prosesleri gibi ileri arıtma yöntemleri ile giderim çalışmaları ve uygulamaları son yıllarda önem kazanmıştır. İleri oksidasyon prosesleri arasında hızları ve yüksek giderim verimleri nedeniyle Fenton, Fenton-benzeri ve Foto-Fenton proseslerinin atıksu ve su arıtımında sorunlu kirleticilerin oksidasyonu için tercih edilmektedir. Son yıllarda ekonomik, kolay uygulanabilir ve etkin olması nedeniyle hidrojen peroksit ve persülfat gibi oksidanlarla aktive edilebilen sıfır değerlikli demir ile arıtma prosesleri dikkat çekmektedir.   Yukarıdaki bilgiler ışığında bu tez kapsamında, bir oktil fenol polietoksilat bileşiği olan noniyonik bir yüzey aktif maddenin (ticari ismi: Triton X- 45), persülfat (S 2 O 82 -) iyonları ile aktive edilmiş sıfır değerlikli demir kullanılarak arıtımı incelenmiştir. Yüzey aktif maddenin Persülfat/Sıfır değerlikli demir ileri oksidasyon sistemi ile arıtılabilirliği üç aşamada çalışılmıştır. Birinci aşamada, prosesi etkileyen parametrelerin (katalizör konsantrayonu, oksidan konsantrasyonu, pH, arıtma süresi) oksidasyon verimi üzerindeki etkileri araştırılmış, yüzey aktif madde (20 mg/L sulu çözelti) ve TOK giderimi bazında {{optimize}} edilmiştir. En uygun pH değeri 5, optimum persülfat konsantrasyonu 2. 5 mM, optimum katalizör konsantrasyonu 1 g/L, optimum arıtma süresi 60 dk. olarak belirlenmiştir. Çalışmanın ikinci aşamasında arıtma sisteminin ekotoksikolojik etkilerini incelemek üzere seçilen deneysel koşullarda arıtılmış numunelerde akut toksisite testleri gerçekleştirilmiştir. Toksisite biyodeneylerinde test organizmaları olarak Vibrio fischeri fotobakterileri ve bir tatlısu mikroalgi olan Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata kullanılmıştır. Yapılan deneysel çalışmalar neticesinde, belirlenen en uygun arıtma koşullarında OPEO’ nun % 95 TOK’un ise % 40 oranında giderimi sağlanmıştır. Vibrio fischeri ve Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ile yürütülen akut toksisite deneyleri ile 120 dakikalık reaksiyon süresi sonucunda % bağıl toksisite değerleri Vibrio fischeri için % 66 ’dan % 20 ’ye düşürülmüş, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata için ise % 16 olan bağıl toksisite tamamen giderilmiştir. Surfactants are {{organic chemicals}} that reduce surface tension {{in water and}} other liquids. The most familiar use for surfactants are soaps, laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids and shampoos. They are {{a diverse group of}} chemicals with unique cleaning and/or solubilisation properties. They usually consist of a polar (hydrophilic) and a nonpolar (hydrophobic) group. Due to their amphiphilic nature they are widely used in household cleaning agents (detergents), personal care products, textiles, paints, inks, polymers, pesticide formulations, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil recovery as well as pulp and paper industries. Surfactants enter the environment mainly through the discharge of sewage effluents into natural water and the application sewage sludge on land for soil fertilizing purposes. Most of the commercial surfactants used today by different industries are only partially and slowly biodegradable; they tend to sorb and accumulate on sludge and soil  sediments. causing a potential ecotoxicological and pollution risk in the environment. Moreover, the metabolites of some alkyl phenol ethoxylates have recently been declared as hormone mimicking/endocrine disrupting compounds. Therefore, the efficient management and treatment of surfactants remains a serious challenge. In this respect, more effective {{and at the same time}} economically feasible abatement processes have to be developed to alleviate the problem of surfactants/surfactant metabolites in the environment. <b>Alkylphenol</b> <b>polyethoxylates</b> are industrial compounds belonging to the class of nonionic surfactants that are designed to have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Among them, octylphenol polyethoxylates have been widely used in cleaning products, paints, ink dispersants, textile preparation and leather processing, manufacture of pulp and paper, metalworking, cosmetics and personal care products. However, many of these applications are now restricted by the European Commission due to the raising concerns regarding the environmental safety of alkylphenol (poly) ethoxylates and its metabolites. It has been reported that their aerobic / anaerobic transformation products (alkylphenols such as nonylphenol and octylphenol) are much more inhibitory and estrogenic than the original surfactants. Despite the above-mentioned concerns regarding the use of alkylphenol (poly) ethoxylates, these products still appear in several industrial applications where they cannot not be replaced by alternative chemicals due to technical and economic reasons. Consequently, the presence of these nonionic surfactants and their degradation products have been reported in water bodies, sediments and sludge associated with the continuing discharges from industrial and sewage treatment plants.   The scientific literature on the biodergadability and fate of <b>alkylphenol</b> <b>polyethoxylates</b> in the aquatic as well as terrestrial environment reinforces the idea that more efficient, alternative treatment processes are needed for their effective elimination. Besides conventional biochemical, chemical and physical treatment methods, chemical oxidation (ozonation, advanced oxidation) has been extensively studied as an alternative for the treatment of nonionic surfactants and their metabolites. Among the existing hydroxyl radicals (HO•) -induced advanced oxidation processes, TiO 2 /UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, O 3 /UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes have attracted considerable interest since these exhibit relatively high treatment efficiencies and kinetics. More recently, sulfate radicals (SO 4 •-) -driven advanced oxidation processes have been investigated to treat pollutants found in water and wastewater. The reduction potential of SO 4 •- is lower than that of HO• (2. 6 versus 2. 9 eV); however, SO 4 •- are also capable of non-selectively and rapidly reacting with pollutants in a series of free radical chain reactions being similar to those established for HO•-based advanced oxidation processes. SO 4 •- can be produced from persulfate ions via chemical, radiolytic, thermal or photochemical activation; or alternatively by redox reactions with transition metals as in the case of the Fenton’s reagent. An alternative to iron-based (Fenton-like) advanced oxidation processes are zero valent iron (ZVI; Fe 0) catalyzed treatment systems. They have received global interest and promising results have been reported so far for the removal of chlorinated organics, nitroaromatic compounds, arsenic, heavy metals, nitrate, industrial dyes and phenols by micro-and nanoscale ZVI. ZVI is reactive (redox potential = - 0. 44 eV), non-toxic, abundant, cheap, relatively easy to produce and its treatment applications require little maintenance. ZVI is capable of oxidizing organic as well as inorganic pollutants by an electron transfer mechanism. However, for harsher conditions, ZVI treatment has to be enhanced chemical or thermally by the involvement of oxidants (for example, hydrogen peroxide or persulfate). Besides, the extensive follow-up of toxicity is critical to ensure economically and ecologically safe applications of advanced oxidation processes. The ecotoxicological characterization of sulfate radical-based treatment systems during their application to treat industrial pollutants is an untouched area in this research field. For this purpose, bioassays employing the marine photobacterium Vibrio fischeri remain the most popular test protocols since these enable easy and rapid measurement of cytotoxicity in water and wastewater samples being subjected to advanced oxidation. Although V. fischeri is very sensitive and hence useful for obtaining a preliminary idea about the inhibitory effect of pollutants and their degradation products, it is more appropriate to support toxicity results with other types of test organisms preferably from different trophic levels. For example, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are important freshwater microalage being routinely used as primary producers ito assess the acute and chronic toxicity of surfactants.   Considering the above facts, the motivation of the present work was to study the treatability and acute toxicity of the commercially important nonionic surfactant octylphenol polyethoxylate (known as “Triton X- 45 ”) in aqueous solution with the ZVI/S 2 O 82 - advanced oxidation system. To our knowledge, this was the first study investigating the treatability of a nonionic surfactant with persulfate activated ZVI nanoparticles. Within the scope of this experimental study, firstly, preliminary optimization tests were performed under varying reaction conditions (ZVI and persulfate concentrations, pH’s and treatment time) together with control runs (ZVI only and persulfte only expeirments). Thereafter, time dependent changes in the surfactant, TOC, persulfate concentrations and pH were followed for the optimized treatment system. Then, the acute toxicity of the nonionic surfactant and its degradation products was also followed by employing two different bioassays with V. fischeri and P. subcapitata. It can be said that, OPEO has corrosive and toxic effects on people and other organisms. Results indicated that the nonionic surfactant solution (20 mg/L original concentration) could be degraded in less than 1 hour (40 - 60) by 95 % accompanied with up to 40 % TOC removal by 1 g/L ZVI nanoparticles activated with 2. 5 mM (480 mg/L) persulfate at an initial reaction pH of 5. 0. The acute toxicities (percent relative inhibition rates) decreased significantly from originally 66 % to 21 % and originally 16 % to non-toxic for V. fischeri and P. subcapitata, respectively. The photobacterium V. fischeri appeared to be more sensitive to octylphenol polyethoxylate and its degradation products than the microalgae P. subcapitata. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{the last}} 10 years, the {{appearance}} of emerging organic compounds described as endocrine disrupters in wastewaters and water resources {{has become a major}} concern for both society and public health authorities, the whole industrial world and the agricultural sector. Endocrine disrupting compounds are found in various environmental compartments such as water, sediments, soils and atmosphere, {{as a result of their}} wide usage. Numerous products are concerned including surfactants, industrial additives and formulations, pharmaceuticals, and also personal care products. However, the existing conventional water treatment plants were not designed for these new contaminants. In the present study, an overview of the literature on methods for the elimination (removal and/or degradation) of emerging trace organic contaminants is presented. This review is limited to details of the treatment of one class of endocrine disrupters, namely <b>alkylphenols</b> and their <b>polyethoxylate</b> derivatives, which are suspected to interfere with the hormonal system of wildlife. The technologies proposed for alkylphenol treatment include membrane treatment using biological (membrane bioreactors) or physical processes (membrane filtration such as nanofiltration), biotechnological-based methods (biofilms, immobilized enzymes, etc.), adsorption-oriented processes using conventional (activated carbons) or nonconventional adsorbents (clays, cyclodextrin, etc.), and advanced oxidation processes (photocatalysis, photolysis, and sonochemistry). Examples are taken from the literature to illustrate various features of the technologies used in decontamination methods. Among them, photocatalytic oxidation is an interesting tool for alkylphenol treatment due to its potential to reach complete mineralization...|$|R
