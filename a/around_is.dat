[...] "Yes, it's me again / And, I'm back," [...] Watkins introduces herself while opening the track in a [...] "husky" [...] voice. She then repeats the lines [...] "oh-I, oh-I, oh-I", which was compared by Spin Terry Sutton to Watkins finding [...] "a spiritual instruction in vowel sounds," [...] before going to the first verse of the song. In the first verse, the singer counts her relationship's [...] "twenty-second of loneliness" [...] and expresses how she still loves her boyfriend even acknowledging that he has been cheating on her. Moving on to the song's bridge, she suddenly uses a lower register to [...] "nonchalantly" [...] reveal: [...] "I'll never leave him down, though I might mess around / It's only cause I need some affection." [...] "So I creep / Yeah / And I'll just keep it on the down low," [...] she low-key sings the hook as if she is [...] "confessing to a chosen few." [...] Opening up the second verse, Watkins again counting her [...] "twenty-third of loneliness" [...] and still talks about her love for the partner despite signs of a broken romance. After performing the chorus again, her fellow member Thomas joins in to [...] "sweetly" [...] reveal the reason why's she cheating <b>around</b> <b>is</b> because she needs some attention from her lover. Watkins finally ends the track with the lines [...] "I creep around because I need attention / I don't mess around with my affection" [...] while fading out with the heavy beat and the horn sample. Billboard Larry Flick said the two's vocals in the track were [...] "tightly woven" [...] and [...] "rife with raspy grit," [...] which gave a nice contrast to the song's horn sample and funk guitars.|$|E

Lillian befriends Mattie, the daughter of English tourists, and together they see the famous Pink and White Terraces, but ominous signs have been seen – a tidal wave on the usually calm lake, and there are reports of a waka wairua ghostly canoe seen through the mist.

[...] The top and bottom shutters are on their own plane, with the 2 side shutters sharing a single plane.
