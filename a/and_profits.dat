5|$|One {{important}} reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, {{as well as a}} partnership with BA. BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> within BCal's scheduled route network; BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.|$|E

5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices <b>and</b> <b>profits.</b> He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as something of an eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E
5|$|A {{prospectus}} {{was issued}} which contained a detailed {{breakdown of the}} likely costs, revenue <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> of such a scheme, and the promotors prepared to obtain an Act of Parliament. During this time, someone challenged the original survey and another local surveyor was asked to review it. John Beauchamp suggested that no locks would be required on the upper section, but that costs {{were likely to be}} £15,234. This was later raised to £18,000, and the Act of Parliament, which authorised the construction of a canal that followed Hammett's plans, was obtained on 28 May 1827. The proprietors were empowered to raise £18,000 by the issue of 360 shares of £50 each, with powers to raise another £5,000 by mortgage, or to borrow any part of the £18,000 from the Exchequer Bills Commissioners.|$|E
5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the effects of bancassurance in Korea and {{to find the best}} bancassurance partners in terms of cost, revenue, <b>and</b> <b>profit</b> efficiency. Thick frontier and scenario analyses are used to measure the efficiency change. We find that foreign and small- and medium-sized insurers can gain cost <b>and</b> <b>profit</b> efficiency through bancassurance, but lose revenue efficiency. Large insurers can realize cost efficiency, but lose revenue <b>and</b> <b>profit</b> efficiency. Banks can realize revenue <b>and</b> <b>profit</b> efficiency, but lose cost efficiency. For banks, large insurers are the best bancassurance partners due to product relatedness and good reputation. ...|$|R

The impact of foreign ownership on performance is also examined.

5|$|In 1720 {{the first}} Act of Parliament to {{authorise}} {{improvements to the}} river was obtained by three gentlemen of Cheshire. The act was dated 23 March 1720 and authorised work between Frodsham bridge and Winsford bridge. Rates for tolls were set, which were to be reduced by 20 per cent once the cost of construction had been met, <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> were then {{to be used to}} maintain bridges and highways within Cheshire. Each year the Justices of the Peace were to meet to decide which structures should benefit from this source of revenue. The Act included powers to improve the Witton Brook from the Weaver to Witton Bridge. Following a plea by the owner of brine workings near Middlewich, who felt they would be disadvantaged by the new navigation, a separate Act was obtained on 7 June 1721 to authorise improvements to the River Dane, but did not result in any work being undertaken.|$|E

Stringer Bell continues his reform of the organization by cooperating with other drug lords, sharing with one another territory, product <b>and</b> <b>profits.</b> Stringer's proposal is met with a curt refusal from Marlo Stanfield, leader of a new, growing crew. Against Stringer's advice, Avon decides to take Marlo's territory by force and the two gangs become embroiled in a bitter turf war with multiple deaths. Omar Little continues to rob the Barksdale organization wherever possible. Working with his new boyfriend Dante and two women, he is once more a serious problem. The violence related to the drug trade makes it an obvious choice of investigation for Cedric Daniels' permanently established Major Crimes Unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} Olympic brand {{has been}} controversial. The {{argument}} is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle. Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares. The IOC {{indicated that they would}} address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games. Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.|$|E

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008–2009, this narrowly-defined demographic-based sales plan faltered and sales <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> for the chain declined; Burger King's same-store {{comparable}} sales in the United States and Canada declined 4.6% in the three months ended September 30, while McDonald's posted same-store comparable sales growth of 2.5% within the United States. The Stacker line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting the top layer of cheese and changing the amount of bacon in the sandwiches, and moving the sandwiches from the core section of its menu to the company's value menu. The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale {{at the same rate as}} increasing numbers of burger patties. Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker. The Stacker line and other related calorie-heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing on a broader demographic base.|$|E
5|$|After {{the primary}} defeat, Boddy went into semi-retirement, <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> from {{sales of the}} Daily News began to decrease. In early 1951, he made his assistant, Robert Smith, editor of the paper. In mid-1952, Boddy sold out to a consortium. In August 1952, Boddy {{announced}} his retirement as publisher in Smith's favor. Smith instituted changes, scrapping the money-losing Saturday edition and started a Sunday News. He called in WIlliam Townes as editor, who was well known for restoring ailing newspapers. However, Smith fired Townes after twelve weeks on the job. Smith attempted to sell the paper, and reached an agreement with a small-time Oregon newspaper owner, Sheldon F. Sackett. After signing, Smith {{backed out of the}} deal, apparently out of seller's remorse. By the time Smith finally sold the paper, in December 1952 to Congressman Clinton D. McKinnon, who was leaving office after losing a Senate primary bid, the Daily News was losing over $100,000 a month. McKinnon had no better luck than anyone else in reviving the paper, and in December 1954, the paper was sold to the Chandler family, owners of the Los Angeles Mirror. Under the sale agreement, the Mirror became the Mirror & Daily News (before again being renamed the Mirror-News) and all Daily News employees lost their jobs. On December 18, 1954, publication of the Daily News ceased.|$|E
5|$|This period saw {{a process}} of {{rehabilitation}} for Highland culture. In the 1820s, {{as part of the}} Romantic revival, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe, prompted by the popularity of Macpherson's Ossian cycle and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels. However, the Highlands remained very poor and traditional. The desire to improve agriculture <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> led to the Highland Clearances, in which much {{of the population of the}} Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. One result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. Even with the development of industry there were not enough good jobs. As a result, during the period 1841–1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.|$|E
