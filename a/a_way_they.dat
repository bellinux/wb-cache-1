5|$|The writers {{intended}} to play off {{the idea of}} a hidden character being able to hear conversations revealing secrets. An initial idea of Pemberton's was to have a large parcel on a table at the birthday party, but with Maggie—on whose birthday the episode would be set—absent. Other characters would repeatedly ask where Maggie was, until it was revealed that her head was in the parcel. This idea developed into the possibility of a hollow cake hiding a character, a device used in the final episode. For the writers, there is humour in characters spending time talking earnestly to a cake; they noted that the prop cake had features resembling a face. In the editing stage, the production team kept reintroducing the cake in order to remind viewers of its presence. The original script ended with a knife being plunged into a fake cake followed by the revelation, contrary to viewers' expectations, that no one was under it at the time; instead, the writers upped the drama in the story, making it possible that any of the characters injured. For the writers, the original plot was, in a sense, darker, as some characters got away with wrongdoing in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> do not in the final version.|$|E

25|$|The {{exterior}} set for {{the fictional}} Albert Square {{is located in the}} permanent backlot of the BBC Elstree Centre, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, at , and is outdoors and open to the weather. It was initially built in 1984 with a specification that it should last for at least fifteen years at a cost of £750,000. The EastEnders lot was designed by Keith Harris, who was a senior designer within the production team together with supervising art directors Peter Findley and Gina Parr. The main buildings on the square consisted originally of hollow shells, constructed from marine plywood facades mounted onto steel frames. The lower walls, pavements, etc., were constructed of real brick and tarmac. The set had to be made to look {{as if it had been}} standing for years. This was done by a number of means, including chipping the pavements, using chemicals to crack the top layer of the paint work, using varnish to create damp patches underneath the railway bridge, and making garden walls in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> appeared to sag. The final touches were added in summer 1984, these included a telephone box, telegraph pole that was provided by British Telecom, lampposts that were provided by Hertsmere Borough Council and a number of vehicles parked on the square. On each set all the appliances are fully functional such as gas cookers, the laundry washing machines and The Queen Victoria beer pumps.|$|E

While planning these structures, Speer conceived the concept of [...] "ruin value": that major buildings should be constructed in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> would leave aesthetically pleasing ruins for thousands of years into the future. Such ruins would be a testament to the greatness of Nazi Germany, just as ancient Greek or Roman ruins were symbols of the greatness of those civilizations.|$|E

500|$|Vigilantism in pre-{{territorial}} {{and territorial}} Montana {{has been written}} about, romanticized and chronicled in personal memoirs, biographies, documentary and scholarly works, film and fiction {{for well over a}} century. The first book published in Montana was Thomas J. Dimsdale's 1866 first edition of The Vigilantes of Montana, [...] which was compiled from a series of newspaper articles he wrote for the Montana Post in 1865. [...] Historical analysis of the period ranges from disrepute to heroism, with debates over whether the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time meant the vigilantes acted in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> thought was best for their communities or if modern standards of due process should govern analysis of their actions.|$|E

Pinkner explained that the trailer idea {{did not come from}} his production team, but rather was produced by a Fox division called Special Ops, {{who came up with the}} idea in order to platform Fringe to the audience in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> had not seen before. As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in [...] "Entrada", with the intention of having [...] "students learn about scientific intuition and how it can facilitate the scientific method of collecting data through experimentation and observation in order to formulate and test a hypothesis".|$|E

[...] He concluded by saying [...] "Overall, Spiritual Machines is a lovely album from start to finish, and even better, it is an album {{that will make you}} wonder." [...] Cheryl Hunter of the Hartford Courant [...] said that [...] "It may sound formulaic, yet Maida's intelligent songwriting and nasally, but forthright vocals make Our Lady Peace more than just another faceless modern rock band." [...] Bartley Kives of Winnipeg Free Press gave the album 3 stars out of 5, saying that Our Lady Peace had finally gotten control of their sound and calling it [...] "easily the finest thing they've ever created." ...|$|E
500|$|Marquis {{first took}} up writing {{around the turn}} of the century, writing {{newspaper}} articles. [...] In 1922 he was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He resigned after only ten weeks, but he was there long enough to realize that several participants of the Custer battle were still alive. Between 1923 and 1926 Marquis practiced medicine privately on the Crow Reservation but then tried to make writing his permanent career. Throughout his life Marquis was often in debt; his writing was sometimes interrupted by the need to earn money at medicine, or even his original career of typesetting. From 1926 he returned to his contacts among the Cheyenne, interviewing them in depth. The trust he developed with them allowed them to open up to him in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> had not with any other outsiders. The result formed the bulk of Marquis' most important works.|$|E

500|$|With the {{dissolution}} of the Fasci, the unrest on Sicily did not subside. In January 1898, peasants demanding work and bread ransacked the town hall in Siculiana. In the fall of 1901, Sicilian peasants – following the example of numerous agrarian strikes that were affecting the whole of Italy – again set off a wave of agrarian unrest, conscious of the fact that in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> resumed [...] "the march abruptly interrupted in 1894 by the repression of the Fasci." [...] Just as the Fasci movement, one of the main goals of the 1901 strikes and was a revision of the land leases to undermine the economic power of the gabellotti. After the First World War the communist movement In Sicily built on the incipient organisational structures of the Fasci, such as during the Biennio Rosso. The Fasci inspired social struggle in Sicily well into the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Another account, not {{published}} until 1982, {{is that of}} former Montana Supreme Court Justice (1922–1935) Lew L. Callaway. [...] Edited by his son Lew Callaway Jr., Montana's Righteous Hangmen:The Vigilantes in Action stems from Callaway's association with vigilante Captain James William in the late 1800s. [...] Lew Callaway wrote extensively about the vigilantes and his stories which add more intimate details about how the vigilantes operated are captured in this volume. Although some vigilante activities during this period were criticized by citizens and civic leaders, {{there was a general}} affirmation of their purpose and contribution to law and order in a growing territory. [...] Mark C. Dillon's Montana Vigilantes 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows (2013) concludes that given the lawless environment and criminal activity in Alder Gulch and Helena at the time, the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time, the vigilantes acted in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> thought was best for their communities. [...] He contends that judging the vigilantes by today's understanding and standards of due process is problematic.|$|E

Cashmere stated that the album was [...] "the toughest [...] heard Powderfinger sound".
