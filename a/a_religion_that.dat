25|$|Immigrants {{differ on}} their {{political}} views; however, the Democratic Party {{is considered to}} be in a far stronger position among immigrants overall. Research shows that religious affiliation can also significantly impact both their social values and voting patterns of immigrants, as well as the broader American population.

25|$|Indeed, this {{development}} of a pagan order created the foundations of a bridge of reconciliation over which paganism and Christianity could meet. Likewise, Julian’s persecution of Christians, who by pagan standards were simply part of a different cult, was quite an un-pagan attitude that transformed paganism into <b>a</b> <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> accepted only one form of religious experience while excluding all others—such as Christianity. In trying to compete with Christianity in this manner, Julian fundamentally {{changed the nature of}} pagan worship. That is, he made paganism a religion, whereas it once had been only a system of tradition.|$|E
25|$|Another {{basis for}} this theory has been the {{observed}} mixing of people of Jagannath Hindu tradition contrary to the caste segregation theories popular with colonial era missionaries and Indologists. Since caste barriers never existed among devotees in Jagannath's temple, and Buddhism was {{believed to have been}} <b>a</b> <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> rejected caste system, colonial era Indologists and Christian missionaries such as Verrier Elwin suggested that Jagannath must have been a Buddhist deity and the devotees were a caste-rejecting Buddhist community. According to Starza, this theory is refuted by the fact that other Indic traditions did not support caste distinctions, such as the Hindu Smarta tradition founded by Adi Shankara, and the traditional feeding of the Hindus together in the region regardless of class, caste or economic condition in the memory of Codaganga. This reconciliation is also weak because Jagannath is venerated by all Hindu sects, not just Vaishnavas or a regional group of Hindus, and Jagannath has a pan-Indian influence. The Jagannath temple of Puri {{has been one of the}} major pilgrimage destination for Hindus across the Indian subcontinent since about 800 CE.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining a Social Security {{number for}} a child is voluntary. Further, there is no general legal {{requirement}} that individuals join the Social Security program unless they want or have to work. Under normal circumstances, FICA taxes or SECA taxes will be collected on all wages. About {{the only way to}} avoid paying either FICA or SECA taxes are to join <b>a</b> <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> does not believe in insurance, such as the Amish, Christian Science or a religion whose members have taken a vow of poverty (see IRS publication 517 and 4361). Federal workers employed before 1987, various state and local workers including those in some school districts who had their own retirement and disability programs were given the one-time option of joining Social Security. Many employees and retirement and disability systems opted to keep out of the Social Security system because of the cost and the limited benefits. It was often much cheaper to obtain much higher retirement and disability benefits by staying in their original retirement and disability plans. Now only a few of these plans allow new hires to join their existing plans without also joining Social Security. In 2004, the Social Security Administration estimated that 96% of all U.S. workers were covered by the system with the remaining 4% mostly a minority of government employees enrolled in public employee pensions and not subject to Social Security taxes due to historical exemptions.|$|E

25|$|Wallace Fard {{founded the}} Nation of Islam in the 1930s. Under his wing Wallace took Elijah (Poole) Muhammad, as his student and {{who later became}} {{the leader of the}} organization. The basis of the group was the belief held that Christianity was <b>a</b> <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> was {{exclusively}} a White man's religion, while Islam was the way for black folk; Christianity was a religion like slavery that was forced upon the people who suffered {{at the hands of the}} whites during their enslavement. The beliefs of the members of the Nation of Islam are that alike to those who follow the Koran and worship Allah under the religion of Islam. The Nation of Islam, having a foundation based on a resentment of the way Whites historically treated people of color, the group itself embraces the ideas of Black Nationalism. The group itself has since the leadership of Elijah recruited thousands of followers from all parts (prisons, and those following movements of Black pride and Nationalism). They preached that integration (into White American culture) was not the goal, but instead to unite and create their own footprint and create their own separate community and obliterate oppression. Their aim was to have their own schools, churches and support each other without any reliance on other racial groups. The members of the Nation of Islam are known as “Black Muslims”. As the group became more and more supported with public speakers and figures such as Malcolm X as their orator and so did the attention it received from others outside. In 1959 the group was revealed in a documentary named “The Hate that Hate Produced”. The document shone the organization in a negative light depicting it as a black supremacy group. Even with such depiction the group did not lose support from its people. When Elijah Muhammad died his son took on the role as the leader of the Nation of Islam, converting the group into a more orthodox representation of the word of Islam, and abandoning its tendencies of violence through its beliefs. This conversion led to others to abandon the group unsatisfied with the change in ideology created a “New” Nation of Islam to reignite the flame that the group originally aimed for.|$|E
500|$|Another {{development}} of Heathenry emerged within the occult völkisch movement known as Ariosophy. One of these völkisch Ariosophists was the Austrian occultist Guido von List, who established <b>a</b> <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> he termed [...] "Wotanism", with an inner core that {{he referred to}} as [...] "Armanism". List's Wotanism was based heavily on the Eddas, although over time {{it came to be}} increasingly influenced by the occult teachings of the Theosophical Society. List's ideas were transmitted in Germany by prominent right-wingers, and adherents to his ideas were among the founders of the Reichshammerbund in Leipzig in 1912, and they included individuals who held key positions in the Germanenorden. The Thule Society founded by Rudolf von Sebottendorf developed from the Germanenorden, and it displayed a Theosophically-influenced interpretation of Norse mythology.|$|E
500|$|Bahá'u'lláh, {{the founder}} of the Bahá'í Faith, wrote that since each manifestation of God has the same divine attributes, they {{can be seen as the}} spiritual [...] "return" [...] of all {{previous}} manifestations of God, and the appearance of each new manifestation of God inaugurates <b>a</b> <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> supersedes the former ones, a concept known as progressive revelation. Bahá'ís believe that God's plan unfolds gradually through this process as mankind matures, and that some of the manifestations arrive in specific fulfillment of the missions of previous ones. Thus, Bahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the promised return of Christ. Bahá'í teachings confirm many, but not all, aspects of Jesus as portrayed in the gospels. Bahá'ís believe in the virgin birth and in the Crucifixion, but see the Resurrection and the miracles of Jesus as symbolic.|$|E

500|$|Hubbard is {{therefore}} portrayed, {{as he put}} it himself, as a man who [...] "knew exactly where I was going" [...] from the age of three. He is presented as a person who constantly worked towards a single objective. Each event in his life is seen as a stepping stone along the way to the development of Dianetics and Scientology. He is cast as a singular and forward-thinking individual whose unique qualities and knowledge are essential prerequisites for his discoveries. As the Church puts it, [...] "even in his early youth he exemplified a rare sense of purpose and dedication which, combined with his adventurous spirit, made him a living legend." [...] The story of Hubbard's early life, as told by the Church, is closely related to Scientology's own self-image as a synthesis of Western scientific precision with Eastern philosophy. His claimed knowledge of these fields and practices underlines his claim to have founded <b>a</b> <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> combines the best of both to appeal to all people.|$|E
