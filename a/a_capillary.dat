5|$|Most fish {{exchange}} gases using gills {{on either}} side of the pharynx. Gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments. Each filament contains <b>a</b> <b>capillary</b> network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. However, bony fish have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum.|$|E

25|$|These {{mutations}} have {{a common}} end result; they destabilise the cytoskeletal scaffold of cells. This stability is especially important in erythrocytes as they are constantly {{under the influence of}} deforming shear forces. As disc-shaped erythrocytes pass through capillaries, which can be 2-3 micrometres wide, they are forced to assume an elliptical shape in order to fit through. Normally, this deformation lasts only as long as a cell is present in <b>a</b> <b>capillary,</b> but in hereditary elliptocytosis the instability of the cytoskeleton means that erythrocytes deformed by passing through <b>a</b> <b>capillary</b> are forever rendered elliptical. These elliptical cells are taken up by the spleen and removed from circulation when they are younger than they would normally be, meaning that the erythrocytes of people with hereditary elliptocytosis have a shorter than average life-span (a normal person's erythrocytes average 120 days or more).|$|E
25|$|Blood {{is drawn}} into a test tube {{containing}} liquid sodium citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample.

25|$|In his {{retirement}} Briggs returned to research, establishing {{a laboratory for}} studying fluids under negative pressure at the National Bureau of Standards. This topic was directly related to his earlier research in the water uptake of plants. In one famous experiment he measured the negative pressure (or tension) that would break a column of water held in <b>a</b> <b>capillary</b> tube by capillary action. It turned out that at room temperature the maximum attainable tension in water was 250 bar and in mercury nearly 500 bar. This was published in several papers between (1950–1953), and the 1950 paper remains a classic and is still regularly cited {{in the literature on}} metastable water.|$|E

25|$|Gas {{chromatography}} {{is based}} on a partition equilibrium of analyte between a solid or viscous liquid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter (commonly 0.53 – 0.18mm inside diameter) glass or fused-silica tube (<b>a</b> <b>capillary</b> column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in analytical chemistry; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in biochemistry, it is well suited for use in the petrochemical, environmental monitoring and remediation, and industrial chemical fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.|$|E
25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in <b>a</b> <b>capillary</b> fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E
25|$|Z-Link and Kaza both pride {{themselves}} on horizontal integration of their in-house management, where the artists are given full control over all steps of the publication of their product – from creation, to editing, publishing and distribution. Z-Link goes even further, working to foster new talent until it can gain a truly public following: traditional calls for submission are supplemented by scouting of unpublished works on blogs, Facebook pages and other collective platforms used by fan communities online. Aspiring artists are encouraged {{to reach out to}} an audience, so that budding amateurs, who previously created for friends, can develop a wider fanbase and become published artists. Typically, new artists first publish short installments in Z-Link's monthly manga and gaming magazine, Laabstore, before being commissioned to produce a small print run (500–1,000 copies) of an independent volume. This structure permits Z-Link to reconfigure the traditional publishing channels and capitalize on its position between conventional publication and self-production. It provides the infrastructure for autonomous artists to achieve local print runs at a reasonable cost. Since their creation, Z-Link and Kaza have developed an enthusiastic and loyal following. Their catalogs, however, remain limited in number and difficult to procure, as the works are still distributed through <b>a</b> <b>capillary</b> network including a few bookstores in Algiers, Oran and Constantine.|$|E

25|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} by many different methods, including newborn screening, sweat testing, and genetic testing. As of 2006 in the United States, 10% of cases are diagnosed shortly after birth {{as part of}} newborn screening programs. The newborn screen initially measures for raised blood concentration of immunoreactive trypsinogen. Infants with an abnormal newborn screen need a sweat test to confirm the CF diagnosis. In many cases, a parent makes the diagnosis because the infant tastes salty. Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels can be increased in individuals who have a single mutated copy of the CFTR gene (carriers) or, in rare instances, in individuals with two normal copies of the CFTR gene. Due to these false positives, CF screening in newborns can be controversial. Most U.S. states and countries do not screen for CF routinely at birth. Therefore, most individuals are diagnosed after symptoms (e.g. sinopulmonary disease and GI manifestations) prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis. The most commonly used form of testing is the sweat test. Sweat testing involves application of a medication that stimulates sweating (pilocarpine). To deliver the medication through the skin, iontophoresis is used, whereby one electrode is placed onto the applied medication and an electric current is passed to a separate electrode on the skin. The resultant sweat is then collected on filter paper or in <b>a</b> <b>capillary</b> tube and analyzed for abnormal amounts of sodium and chloride. People with CF have increased amounts {{of them in their}} sweat. In contrast, people with CF have less thiocyanate and hypothiocyanite in their saliva and mucus (Banfi et al.). In the case of milder forms of CF, transepithelial potential difference measurements can be helpful. CF can also be diagnosed by identification of mutations in the CFTR gene.|$|E

40|$|Aboveground and belowground {{changes during}} {{vegetation}} restoration and vegetation successions {{need to be}} characterized {{in relation to their}} individual responses to changes in soil resources. We examined above- and belowground vegetation characteristics, soil moisture, and nutrient status {{at the end of the}} growing season in 2006 in plots with vegetation succession ages of 2, 4, 6, and 8 years (two replicates each) that had been established on abandoned cropland, where potatoes had been grown for 3 years, using hoe and plow cultivation, immediately prior to vegetation clearance and subsequent natural plant colonization. A plant community comprising pioneer species [e. g., Artemisia capillaries, (subshrub) ] was characterized by low levels of species richness (7. 5 +/- 1. 4 species m(- 2)), plant density (35. 7 +/- 4. 2 stems m(- 2)), fine root length density (940. 1 +/- 90. 1 m m(- 2)), and root area density (2. 3 +/- 0. 3 m(2) m(- 2)) that increased rapidly with time.
