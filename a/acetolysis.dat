The excess of the unrearranged acetate in the <b>acetolysis</b> at 40 Â°C has been explained in terms of coordination of the acid to the sulfur, followed by a "quasi-SNi" displacement of the leaving group. This pathway is concurrent with the equilibration of the two isomeric tosylates (through the agency of the episulfonium ion 2) and with the <b>acetolysis</b> of 2, resulting in a 1 : 1 mixture of 4 and 5.

When the <b>acetolysis</b> and the thioacetolysis of 1 were run at the boiling temperature of the solvent, the reactions afforded only a 1 : 1 mixture of 4 and 5 and 8 and 9, respectively, showing that at higher temperature coordination of the acid is not at work.

40|$|The formolysis and <b>acetolysis</b> of ferrocenylmethyl {{benzoate}} are proton catalyzed and acceler-ated by {{addition of}} perchloric acid. Our earlier experiments {{have shown that}} at a temperature of about 20 °C addition of a common benzoate ion in formolysis of 3. 2 10 – 4 mol dm– 3 fer-rocenylmethyl benzoate suppresses the formolysis rate only slightly but the formolysis is sig-nificantly slower at 40 °C. Such rate lowering is not observed in <b>acetolysis</b> of the same sub-strate. Decrease of the formolysis rate at increased temperatures (20 – 40 °C) is most probably caused by the decrease of the hydrogen ion concentration, because the stronger formic acid dis-places the weaker benzoic acid from sodium benzoate, thus reducing the formic acid concen-tration in this acid-catalyzed system. This, however, does not occur in the weaker acetic acid. Besides, the <b>acetolysis</b> rates are equal {{in the presence of}} 0. 1 and 0. 2 mol dm– 3 sodium benzo-ate, while the formolysis rates decrease with the addition of benzoate.
