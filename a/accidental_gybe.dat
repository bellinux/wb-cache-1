2500|$|Preventer, is cordage {{attached}} {{to the end of}} the boom and fixed to (or running through a block) on the rail athwart or forward of the mast. [...] Its most common purpose is to prevent potentially dangerous movement of the spar in an <b>accidental</b> <b>gybe.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Adjusting {{angle to}} the wind - Guys control spar angle {{with respect to the}} {{apparent}} wind. A preventer attaches {{to the end of the}} boom from a point near the mast to prevent an <b>accidental</b> <b>gybe.</b> Sheets control foot tension of loose-footed sails, angle of attack with respect to the apparent wind and/or the amount of leech [...] "twist" [...] near the head of the sail.|$|E
50|$|Running backstays {{support the}} {{headstay}} in a fractionally rigged boat. A masthead rig {{has the advantage}} of not needing them. A running backstay runs from each lateral corner of the stern to the mast at the level where the forestay begins in the fractional rig. Together with other rigging, it supports the mast. Because they are attached low on mast, they can present a significant problem in an <b>accidental</b> <b>gybe,</b> as the boom hits the stay, with the possibility of breaking the boom, mast, or both.|$|E
50|$|During an {{unplanned}} <b>accidental</b> jibe (or <b>gybe),</b> {{neither the}} crew nor {{the boat is}} set up properly to execute a planned jibe. As a result the uncontrolled boom will swing across the boat potentially inflicting injury or knocking crew members overboard. The mainsheet or traveller can also inflict serious injury. Uncontrolled jibes may also damage the boat itself.|$|R
50|$|Lee helm is {{considered}} dangerous in a sailboat. While sailing, if left {{to its own}} devices a boat with lee helm will bear (turn) away from the wind, accelerate, and perform an <b>accidental</b> or uncontrolled <b>gybe,</b> perhaps repeatedly. In an uncontrolled gybe {{the force of the}} wind moves the sails and boom {{from one side of the}} boat to the other. In a strong wind this movement will by very fast and forceful and can damage the boat, the sails, injure the crew, and even cause the boat to Broach (lie over on its side).|$|R
