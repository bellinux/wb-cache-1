500|$|I used to {{play about}} with bells and buzzers and things around the house. My mother would {{sometimes}} say [...] "Oh, come <b>and</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> find something, it's so dark in this cupboard" [...] – she didn't have very good eyesight… So I'd get a battery and I'd hook a switch, and when she opened that cupboard door a light would come on… I started sort of playing with those things.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out <b>and</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} for Ringo {{coincided with a}} spirit of reconciliation among the four ex-Beatles. This was partly due to Starr, Lennon and Harrison's decision to sever their business ties with Allen Klein, whose control of Apple had been the cause of bitter division between them and McCartney. Klaus Voormann, {{a friend of the}} Beatles since their early years in Hamburg, also cites a willingness on the part of all the album's contributors to help Starr fully establish himself as a solo artist. With Richard Perry as his producer, Starr recorded the rhythm track for [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles on 13 March 1973. Lennon played on the session, as did Harrison, who was in Los Angeles for meetings relating to two upcoming Beatles compilations, 1962–1966 and 1967–1970, and to produce a new album by Ravi Shankar. Hearing that Starr and Lennon were working together, Harrison phoned the studio and asked Perry if he could attend. Lennon welcomed Harrison's participation, saying: [...] "Hell yes... Tell him to get down here right away <b>and</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> finish [...] this bridge." ...|$|E

2500|$|Baker {{described}} {{working with}} Michael E. Knight (Tad Martin) and Eakes as a fun but somewhat intimidating experience. [...] "They are naturals at it!" [...] she stated.
