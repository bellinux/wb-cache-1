40|$|Working {{memory and}} {{attention}} interact {{in a way}} that enables us to focus on relevant items and maintain current goals. The influence of working memory on attention has been noted in several studies using dual task designs. Multitasking increases the demands on working memory and reduces the amount of resources available for cognitive control functions such <b>as</b> resolving <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict.</b> However, few studies have investigated the temporal activation of the cortex while multitasking. The present study addresses the extent to which working memory load influences early (P 1) and late (P 300) attention-sensitive event-related potential (ERP) components using a dual task paradigm. Participants performed an arrow flanker task alone (single task condition) or concurrently with a Sternberg memory task (dual task condition). In the flanker task, participants responded to the direction of a central arrow surrounded by congruent or incongruent arrows. In the dual task condition, participants were presented with a Sternberg task that consisted of either 4 or 7 consonants to remember prior to a short block of flanker trials. Participants were slower and less accurate on incongruent versus congruent trials. Furthermore, accuracy on incongruent trials was reduced in both dual task conditions. Likewise, P 300 amplitude to incongruent flanker stimuli decreased when working memory load increased. These findings suggest that interference from incongruent flankers was more difficult to suppress when working memory was taxed. In addition, P 1 amplitude was diminished on all flanker trials in the dual task condition. This result indicates that top-down attentional control over early visual processing is diminished by increasing demands on working memory. Both the behavioral and electrophysiological results suggest that working memory is critical in maintaining attentional focus and resolving conflict...|$|R
40|$|Several brain imaging {{studies have}} assumed that {{response}} conflict is present in Stroop tasks. However, {{this has not been}} demonstrated directly. We examined the time-course of <b>stimulus</b> and response <b>conflict</b> resolution in a numerical Stroop task by combining single-trial electro-myography (EMG) and event-related brain potentials (ERP). EMG enabled the direct tracking of response conflict and the peak latency of the P 300 ERP wave was used to index <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict.</b> In correctly responded trials of the incongruent condition EMG detected robust incorrect response hand activation which appeared consistently in single trials. In 50 – 80 % of the trials correct and incorrect response hand activation coincided temporally, while in 20 – 50 % of the trials incorrect hand activation preceded correct hand activation. EMG data provides robust direct evidence for response conflict. However, congruency effects also appeared in the peak latency of the P 300 wave which suggests that <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict</b> also {{played a role in the}} Stroop paradigm. Findings are explained by the continuous flow model of information processing: Partially processed task-irrelevant stimulus information can result in <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict</b> and can prepare incorrect response activity. A robust congruency effect appeared in the amplitude of incongruent vs. congruent ERPs between 330 – 400 ms, this effect may be related to the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{separate}} <b>stimulus</b> and response <b>conflict</b> in a manual color–word Stroop task by combining electro-myography (EMG) and event-related brain potentials (ERPs). EMG {{served as a}} measure of response conflict by detecting incorrect response hand activation in correctly responded trials. Response conflict was enhanced in both the incongruent and congruent conditions relative to neutral conditions. This suggests that the Stroop conflict (incongruent vs. congruent condition) could be explained by <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict</b> in our study and that response conflict was not restricted to the incongruent condition of the Stroop task. Incorrect response activity was detected in a neutral condition using words but not in a neutral condition with non-words. This suggests that the mere presence of task-irrelevant stimuli semantically related to task-relevant stimuli can prime incorrect response activity. The above factors are important to consider in studies which do not have any explicit measure of response conflict. We have detected a robust marker of Stroop conflict, the N 450 ERP effect, which has been related to ACC activity. The N 450 was probably affected by <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict</b> in our study and it may be a marker of general conflict processing...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from early}} {{scientific}} explorations of binocular rivalry, researchers have {{wondered about the}} degree to which an observer can exert voluntary attentional control over rivalry dynamics. The answer to this question would not only reveal the extent to which we may determine our own conscious visual experience, but also advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying binocular rivalry. Classic studies, intriguingly, reached contradictory conclusions, ranging from an absence of attentional control, as advocated by Breese, to nearly complete control of rivalry dynamics, as reported by Helmholtz. Recent investigations have revisited this question, but the results have continued to echo the conflicting findings of earlier studies, seemingly precluding a comprehensive understanding of attentional effects on rivalry. Here, we review both classic and modern studies, and propose a unifying framework derived from the biased competition theory of attention. The key assumption of this theory is that the nature of <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict</b> determines the limits of attentional modulation. For example, a condition in which unresolved <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict</b> transpires through many levels of visual processing should be very susceptible to attentional control. When applied to binocular rivalry, this framework predicts strong attentional modulations under conditions of unresolved <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict</b> (e. g., initial selection) and conditions where conflict is resolved at higher levels of visual processing (e. g., stimulus rivalry). Additionally, the efficacy of attentional control over rivalry can be increased by utilization of demanding, behaviorally relevant tasks, and likely through perceptual training paradigms. We show that this framework can help facilitate the understanding and synthesis of a diverse set of results on attentional control over rivalry, and we propose several directions for future research on this interesting topic...|$|R

50|$|The {{differences}} between flash suppression and binocular rivalry have been further emphasized by {{the finding that}} <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict</b> between the two eyes is not a requirement to achieve visual suppression. The novel paradigm of generalized flash suppression (GFS) reported by Wilke, Logothetis and Leopold (2003) demonstrates that any visual stimulus can be rendered invisible when presented outside the fovea for {{a certain amount of}} time, followed by the addition of a distracting second stimulus in its vicinity.|$|R
40|$|Humans are {{constantly}} confronted with environmental <b>stimuli</b> that <b>conflict</b> with task goals and {{can interfere with}} successful behavior. Prevailing theories propose the existence of cognitive control mechanisms that can suppress the processing of conflicting input and enhance that of the relevant input. However, the temporal cascade of brain processes invoked in response to <b>conflicting</b> <b>stimuli</b> remains poorly understood. By examining evoked electrical brain responses in a novel, hemifield-specific, visual-flanker task, we demonstrate that task-irrelevant <b>conflicting</b> <b>stimulus</b> input is quickly detected in higher level executive regions while simultaneously inducing rapid, recurrent modulation of sensory processing in the visual cortex. Importantly, however, both of these effects are larger for individuals with greater incongruency-related RT slowing. The combination of neural activation patterns and behavioral interference effects suggest that this initial sensory modulation induced by <b>conflicting</b> <b>stimulus</b> inputs reflects performance-degrading attentional distraction because of their incompatibility rather than any rapid task-enhancing cognitive control mechanisms. The present findings thus provide neural evidence for a model in which attentional distraction is the key initial trigger for the temporal cascade of processes by which the human brain responds to <b>conflicting</b> <b>stimulus</b> input in the environment...|$|R

We hypothesise that transient responses to step stimuli is initiated by convergence-driven accommodation and subsequently followed by slower fine-control of accommodation modulated {{by the amount of}} blur. Inter-subject differences in convergence-driven accommodation may also be a factor to consider. For stereoscopic stimuli, it is proposed that the increase in blur immediately after the onset of the accommodative response inhibits cessation of the response...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{studies have}} shown that {{conflict}} processing improves from childhood to adulthood and declines from adulthood to old age. However the neural mechanisms underlying this lifespan asymmetry were previously unexplored. We combined event-related potentials (ERPs) and electromyography (EMG) to examine lifespan changes in <b>stimulus</b> and response <b>conflict</b> processing using a modified Stroop task. We used a Stroop task that a priori dissociated <b>stimulus</b> and response <b>conflict.</b> Delayed P 3 b latency and increased amplitude revealed that middle age adults have a deficit in stimulus processing. Additionally a sustained P 3 a across frontal and central electrodes occurred only in middle age adults indicating the recruitment of frontal activity. Conversely, decreased lateralized readiness potential (LRP) amplitude and increased EMG activity in the incorrect hand in adolescents reveal protracted development of response processing into late adolescence. The N 450, a measure of conflict processing, was found to be sensitive to both <b>stimulus</b> and response <b>conflict.</b> Altogether these results provide evidence for asymmetrical differences in <b>stimulus</b> and response <b>conflict</b> processing across adolescence, young adulthood and middle age...|$|R

Behavior {{that is associated with}} lesions in the ACC includes: inability to detect errors, severe difficulty with resolving <b>stimulus</b> <b>conflict</b> in a Stroop task, emotional instability, inattention, and akinetic mutism. There is evidence that damage to ACC is present in patients with schizophrenia, where studies have shown patients have difficulty in dealing with conflicting spatial locations in a Stroop-like task and having abnormal ERNs. Participants with ADHD were found to have reduced activation in the dorsal area of the ACC when performing the Stroop task. Together, these findings corroborate results from imaging and electrical studies about the variety of functions attributed to the ACC.|$|R

50|$|Other {{variants}} of the Eriksen Flanker Task have used numbers, color patches, or arrows <b>as</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Also, although most Eriksen Flanker Tasks show the flankers {{on the left}} and right of the target, they can also be placed above or below the target, or in other spatial orientations.These examples all use an arbitrary mapping between the stimulus and the response.

The flankers could be arrows pointing {{in the same direction as}} the target (congruent) the opposite direction (incongruent) or squares (neutral).

40|$|SummaryThe conflict-monitoring {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} {{anterior cingulate cortex}} (ACC) monitors conflict in information processing and recruits dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to resolve competition as needed. We used fMRI to test this prediction directly {{in the context of}} a task-switching paradigm, in which subjects responded to the color or the motion of a visual <b>stimulus.</b> <b>Conflict</b> was indexed in terms of the product of activities in areas specialized for color or motion processing on a trial-by-trial basis. Here, we report that ACC and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) were sensitive to distinct forms of conflict, at the level of the response and the stimulus representation, respectively. Activity in PPC preceded increased activity in DLPFC and predicted enhanced behavioral performance on subsequent trials. These findings suggest that ACC and PPC may act in concert to detect dissociable forms of conflict and signal to DLPFC the need for increased control...|$|R

Arrows have been generally used <b>as</b> imperative <b>stimuli</b> {{in the different}} versions of this paradigm. However, it is unknown whether the directional nature of these stimuli can modulate {{the efficiency of the}} executive control and its interaction with alerting and orienting. We developed three ANT variants to examine attentional effects in response to directional and non-directional stimuli. Arrows (ANTI-A), colored fruits (ANTI-F) and black geometrical-shape (ANTI-G) were used <b>as</b> imperative <b>stimuli</b> (i. e., flanker stimuli). Data collected from fifty-two university students, in two experiments, showed that arrows stimuli produced a greater interference effect and a greater orienting effect as compared to the other stimuli. Moreover, only arrows modulated the interaction between executive control and orienting: a reduced flanker effect in spatially cued trials was only observed in ANTI-A. These results suggest that the directional value of the <b>stimuli</b> increases the <b>conflict</b> and modulates the efficiency of executive control and its interaction with orienting network.
