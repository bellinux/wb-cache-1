5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle {{that can be}} recharged from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of {{electric vehicle}}s that includes all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} 2008 {{study from}} Western Michigan University found that hybrids <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> vehicles are equally safe when travelling {{more than about}} , because tire and wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds. Hybrid cars were also tested safe when leaving a stoplight and {{it was found that}} under this condition they do not pose a risk to pedestrians. All Prius models used in the study engaged their internal combustion engines when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough noise to be detected.|$|E

5|$|Aberhart's {{government}} was re-elected in the 1940 election with a reduced majority of 36 of 63 seats. Among the defeated incumbents were dissident leader Brown, the convicted Unwin, the expelled Barnes, and the Provincial Treasurer Low. Aberhart won re-election by running in Calgary; his replacement as Social Credit candidate in Okotoks–High River was soundly defeated. Aberhart died in 1943 {{and was replaced}} as Premier by Ernest Manning, who steered the Social Credit League in a more conservative <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> direction until his 1968 retirement.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study by}} the Electric Power Research Institute {{published}} in June 2013, the total cost of ownership of the 2013 Nissan Leaf SV is substantially lower than that of comparable conventional and hybrid vehicles. For comparison, the study constructed average hybrid <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> vehicles and assumed an average US distance per trip distribution. The study took into account the manufacturer's suggested retail price, taxes, credits, destination charge, electric charging station, fuel cost, maintenance cost, and additional cost due to the use of a gasoline vehicle for trips beyond the range of the Leaf.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E

5|$|Many {{scholars}} believe Taoism arose as a countermovement to Confucianism. The philosophical terms Tao and De {{are indeed}} shared by both Taoism and Confucianism, and Laozi is traditionally held {{to have been}} a teacher of Confucius. Zhuangzi explicitly criticized Confucianist and Mohist tenets in his work. In general, Taoism rejects the Confucianist emphasis on rituals, hierarchical social order, <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> morality, and favors naturalness, spontaneity, and individualism instead.|$|E
5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, they can not be recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} EF-105F Wild Weasel III (the EF designation was popularly used but unofficial) supplemented its {{sensors and}} electronic jamming equipment with AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> bombs, giving it an offensive capability {{lacking in the}} F-100F. The first of these aircraft flew on 15 January 1966 and they began arriving in Southeast Asia in May, flying their first mission on 6 June 1966, with five assigned to the 13th TFS at Korat RTAFB and six more to the 354th TFS at Takhli RTAFB.|$|E

5|$|Yugoslav naval {{policy in}} the interwar period lacked {{direction}} until the mid-1920s, although it was generally accepted that the Adriatic coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of submarines, coastal torpedo boats, torpedo bombers <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> bomber aircraft to perform this role. The Hrabri-class submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.|$|E
5|$|A Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan in August or September 2005, {{operating in the}} southern province of Uruzgan. The SFTG consisted of elements from the SASR, 4 RAR (Commando), the Incident Response Regiment (IRR) and logistic support personnel. Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were {{deployed to}} Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG. A forward operating base was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt. This task group was withdrawn in September 2006, {{after a year of}} operations working closely with special forces from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. During this period the task group was on patrol for 306 days, involved in 139 contacts, and sustained 11 soldiers wounded. The SFTG was replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> infantry.|$|E
5|$|Also the Norwegian plug-in {{electric}} vehicle {{market share of}} new car sales is {{the highest in the}} world.

5|$|In 1946, France {{attempted}} to reassert control over its colony <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> military fighting broke out. Thảo {{served with the}} Vietminh in the Mekong Delta in the far south of Vietnam during the war against French rule from 1946–54. He almost met his end before he had started; he was apprehended by the local communists in Mỹ Tho, who saw his French-style dress and mistook him for a colonial agent. They tied him up and chained him to a block of stone before throwing him into a river to drown. However, Thảo broke free of the weight and swam to safety. Thảo proceeded further south {{and deeper into the}} Mekong Delta to the town of Vĩnh Long, where he was again arrested by the local Vietminh. Just as Thảo was about to be executed by drowning, one of the communists realised he was a brother of one of their comrades. Thảo was released and rejoined his family, who lived in the region.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 the GUNT {{rebelled against}} Gaddafi, {{stripping}} Libya {{of its main}} cover of legitimacy for its military presence in Chad. Seeing an occasion to unify Chad behind him, Habré ordered his forces to pass the 16th parallel so as to link with the GUNT rebels (who were fighting the Libyans in Tibesti) in December. A few weeks later a bigger force struck at Fada, destroying the local Libyan garrison. In three months, combining the methods of guerilla <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> warfare in a common strategy, Habré was able to retake almost all of northern Chad, and in the following months, inflicted new heavy defeats on the Libyans, until a ceasefire {{putting an end to}} the conflict was signed in September. The ceasefire left open the issue of the disputed Aouzou Strip, which was eventually assigned to Chad by the International Court of Justice in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, the B-52 {{became one}} of the first US {{military}} aircraft to fly using alternative fuel. It took off from Edwards Air Force Base with a 50/50 blend of Fischer-Tropsch process (FT) synthetic fuel <b>and</b> <b>conventional</b> JP-8 jet fuel, which burned in two of the eight engines. On 15 December 2006, a B-52 took off from Edwards with the synthetic fuel powering all eight engines, the first time an air force aircraft was entirely powered by the blend. The seven-hour flight was considered a success. This program is part of the Department of Defense Assured Fuel Initiative, which aims to reduce crude oil usage and obtain half of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016. On 8 August 2007, Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne certified the B-52H as fully approved to use the FT blend.|$|E
