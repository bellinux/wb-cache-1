2500|$|Ivana Baquero as Ofelia / Princess Moanna, a {{child who}} comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the underworld. Del Toro said he was nervous about casting the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot from June–October 2005, when she was 11.) [...] "The {{character}} I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in and she was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age." [...] Baquero says that Del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairy tales to help her [...] "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt". She says she thought the film was [...] "marvelous", and that [...] "at {{the same time it}} can bring you pain, and sadness, and scariness, and happiness".|$|E
2500|$|The {{role was}} {{originated}} on October 29, 1993, by eleven-year-old Jonathan Jackson. Rumors circulated that Jackson’s contract negotiations {{were not going}} well in 1996, and again in 1998, when Jackson responded that he was considering college and had given the series six months notice of his consideration in accordance with his contract. In January 1999, {{it was reported that}} the series had worked out a deal, and Jackson stated he had briefly extended his contract to allow the character's popular romance to continue. His contract allowed him to leave if he received a feature film role, and Jackson left in April, shooting pre-taped scenes that appeared through late May. Jackson explained to Soap Opera Weekly: [...] "I kind of feel that the fact of how much work they've given me this year, at this stage as an actor, they just maxed out quite a bit of what I would do for the show. And I'm at a better age now to go out. There are more projects for people my age or <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> there were a few years ago. Hollywood's the kind of town where you kinda have to strike while the iron's hot." [...] Jackson's manager Tony Monziotti released the statement: [...] " [...] has told GH and made it very clear to me that he wants to periodically go back to GH. It's a question of if the storyline warrants it and they want him to come back; Jonathan would be more than happy to." [...] In early 2000, Jackson stated he would enjoy reprising the role but his schedule would not allow it. He suggested a short-term return that could coincide with the departure of co-star Rebecca Herbst (who plays Lucky's love interest Elizabeth Webber) should she not renew her contract, allowing for periodic returns from the couple later on. Although Herbst expressed interest, the show opted to keep the characters on canvas.|$|E

60|$|To the {{ordinary}} observer {{there would have}} been nothing remarkable in the appearance of the little room, save its entirely unexpected air of luxury and refinement. There was a small Chippendale sideboard against the wall, a round, gate-legged table on which stood a blue china bowl filled with pink roses, a couple of luxurious easy-chairs, some old prints upon the wall. On the sideboard was a basket, as yet unpacked, filled with hothouse fruit, and on a low settee by the side of one of the easy-chairs were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pile of reviews, several volumes of poetry, and a couple of library books. In the centre of the mantelpiece was a photograph, the photograph of <b>a</b> man <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older,</b> perhaps, <b>than</b> this newly-arrived visitor, with rounder face, dressed in country tweeds, a flower in his buttonhole, the picture of a prosperous man, yet with a curious, almost disturbing likeness to the pale, over-nervous, loose-framed youth whose eye had been attracted by its presence, and who was gazing at it, spellbound.|$|R

Boyne listened with a flushed face and starting eyes, and when at last Trannel offered, upon a pledge of the most sacred nature from him never to reveal a word of what he said, he began to relate an adventure of which he was himself the hero.

40|$|The name of Meandrius {{varies in}} the sources between Maiandrios, Leandrios and Leandros: the present edition {{attributes}} the whole corpus of fragments transmitted under the three mentioned names to Meandrius of Miletus, {{according to the}} tradition opened by C. Keil and authoritatively supported, among the others, by A. Meineke, J. Mikolajczak and F. Jacoby. Nothing certain {{can be said about}} his life and chronology: the concise indication «Before Callimachus» given by Jacoby introducing the fragments is the only certain information; but indications of different type and different reliability converge in seeing him as a local historian of the Hellenistic age, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>older</b> <b>than</b> Callimachus or almost contemporary to him. Such chronological dating, though approximate, is enough to state that Meandrius has not been the first author of Milesiaka: certainly before him has to be placed at least Clytus’s work, whom Athenaeus defines as pupil of Aristotle. But a large number of Meandrius’s fragments reached us, much higher than those of all other milesian local historians: hence the decision not to follow a chronological sequence and to devote instead to Meandrius’s fragments the first of the volumes that the Series «I Frammenti degli Storici greci» reserves to the Milesiaka, also because for the Meandrius’s fragments it is possible, although with many doubts and difficulties, to catch a comprehensive view. Fragments – numerically exiguous – by other authors, preceding and subsequent, for whom it is in doubt even their existence, will be gathered in the second volume, presently in preparation. In the light of the recent debate about the editing of fragmentary texts, which led to define new criteria that put in the foreground the study of the context, of the transmission events and of the transmitting sources, the present volume collects and numbers the fragments of Meandrius {{on the basis of the}} source that preserves each, in a sequence reflecting source chronology (it would be anyhow impossible for Meandrius to rearrange the fragments in a sequence reflecting their original place in the structure of the work). Wherever possible, all fragments handed down by the same source have been put together in a single section: thus, as a result, there are sections devoted to fragments handed down by Callimachus, by Strabo, by Diogenes Laertius, by Clemens Alexandrinus; out of these sections are placed a number of fragments that constitute a unique quotation by an author. The work of Meandrius was structured at least in two books; we do not known the title – as frequently happens with ancient quotations – in a unique form but it varied between the general Historiai and the more technical Milesiaka. From the fragments surviving today we can infer isolated «contents», but we are not able to understand their importance and their place inside the work: no supposition is possible about the starting point of the work and how far it went, nor can we determine whether it dealt with the polis of Miletus only, or it ranged up to cover also their colonies. What we can say with certainty is that in Meandrius’s work a number of versions and trends of local elaboration come together, mainly on topics regarding Miletus and their interests, which systematically give prominence or clarify the position of Miletus versus other poleis; it can be perceived in the work the need of defining and protecting whichever made up the town patrimony at all levels, from the origins of the polis up to the chora, to the myths, to the political relationship...|$|R
