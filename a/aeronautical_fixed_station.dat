AFTN comprises aviation entities including: ANS (Air Navigation Services) providers, aviation service providers, airport authorities and government agencies, to name a few. It exchanges vital information for aircraft operations such as distress messages, urgency messages, flight safety messages, meteorological messages, flight regularity messages and aeronautical administrative messages.|$|R

Generally, it was only necessary to relay a message between one or two stations. After World War II, {{there was an increase}} in the number of commercial aircraft operating, and these aircraft were capable of flying greater distances than in the past. As a result, the <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Fixed</b> Telecommunications Network (AFTN) was implemented worldwide as a means of relaying the air traffic communications, sometimes through the use of radioteletype which had become common among military forces in the 1940s.|$|R

Mobile measurements have been collected on a bicycle equipped with a global positioning system (GPS), in an area of Gent (Belgium).

25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{established}} in a permanent structure with equipment {{that is not}} intended for portable operation {{is referred to as}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>station.</b> This is {{the most common form of}} amateur radio station, and can be found in homes, schools, and some public buildings. A typical <b>fixed</b> <b>station</b> is equipped with a transceiver and one or more antennas. For voice communications, the station will be equipped with a microphone; for communications using the Morse code, a telegraph key is common; and for communications over digital modes such as RTTY and PSK31, a station will be equipped with a specialized interface to connect the transceiver to a computer sound card. While not a requirement for radiocommunications, most <b>fixed</b> amateur radio <b>stations</b> are equipped with one or more computers, which serve tasks ranging from logging of contacts with other stations to various levels of <b>station</b> hardware control. <b>Fixed</b> <b>stations</b> might also be equipped with amplifiers, antenna rotators, SWR meters, and other station accessories.|$|R

40|$|Information systems {{consist of}} {{multiple}} mobile <b>stations</b> and <b>fixed</b> <b>stations</b> communicating with each other. Mission critical applications {{are required to}} be executed fault-tolerantly in these systems. However, mobile stations support neither enough volume of storage and processing power nor enough capacity of battery to do reliable communication for a long period. Moreover, wireless communication channels are less reliable. Hence, the communication channels with the mobile stations are often disconnected. Therefore, {{it is difficult for}} multiple mobile stations to take checkpoints synchronously since the communication channels with the mobile stations may be disconnected even during taking the checkpoints. We have proposed hybrid checkpointing where checkpoints are taken asynchronously by the mobile stations and synchronously by the <b>fixed</b> <b>stations.</b> In addition, the mobile stations record messages for getting local states consistent with the checkpoints taken by the <b>fixed</b> <b>stations.</b> In this [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Australia’s {{relationship}} with Indonesia became strained after Indonesia’s declaration in 1963 of confrontation’ (konfrontasi) with Malaysia. During 1964 - 65, Australia {{was engaged in}} a covert war against Indonesia, but it continued to give aid to the country. This ambiguity in Australian foreign policy {{was consistent with the}} overnment’s principle of maintaining a firm but friendly attitude towards Indonesia. A second reason was that government was keen not to abandon an important aid project in Indonesia, the <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Fixed</b> elecommunication Network. The project remedied deficiencies in Indonesia’s civil aviation communications system and would benefit Qantas flights through Indonesian airspace. Continuation of aid would keep lines of communication with Indonesian officials open that would otherwise be closed. ...|$|R
