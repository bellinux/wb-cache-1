40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a method for {{evaluating}} the minimum free Chernov distance of trellis-codes for a discrete memoryless channels (DMC). In order to design an efficient trellis-code for the DMC, we need to evaluate the minimum free Chernov distance of the target code.

To overcome the difficulty, {{we present a}} lower bound on the Chernov distance with an <b>additive</b> <b>property.</b> The lower bound {{plays a key role}} in the minimum distance evaluation algorithm presented here.

5000|$|Synaptic {{potentials}} {{are small}} and many are needed to add up to reach the threshold. The two ways that synaptic potentials {{can add up to}} potentially form an action potential are spatial summation and temporal summation. Spatial summation refers to several excitatory stimuli from different synapses converging on the same postsynaptic neuron {{at the same time to}} reach the threshold needed to reach an action potential. Temporal summation refers to successive excitatory stimuli on the same location of the postsynaptic neuron. Both types of summation are the result of adding together many excitatory potentials. The difference being whether the multiple stimuli are coming from different locations (spatial) or at different times (temporal). Summation has been referred to as a “neurotransmitter induced tug-of-war” between excitatory and inhibitory stimuli. Whether the effects are combined in space or in time, they are both <b>additive</b> <b>properties</b> that require many stimuli acting together to reach the threshold. Synaptic potentials, unlike action potentials, degrade quickly as they move away from the synapse. This is the case for both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.|$|E

There exists a number of different classes of fuzzy measures including plausibility/belief measures; possibility/necessity measures; and probability measures which are a subset of classical measures.|$|R
