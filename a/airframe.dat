5|$|The <b>airframe</b> is of {{semi-monocoque}} structure constructed {{primarily of}} aluminium alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The <b>airframe</b> {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the <b>airframe</b> to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|E
5|$|A third {{aircraft}} was ordered on 18 April 1945 {{and it was}} used for research into power-boosted ailerons during February 1948. The <b>airframe</b> was sold to Blackburn on 17 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|Air Florida Flight 90â€”crashed on January 13, 1982 after ice {{built up}} on the <b>airframe</b> of the jet because of pilot error.|$|E
25|$|The A-7P version {{acquired}} by Portugal were reconstructed and converted A-7A <b>airframes</b> {{powered by the}} Pratt & Whitney TF30-P-408 engine and equipped with A-7E/A-7D avionics. The initial 20 <b>airframes</b> for this conversion were chosen from 28 former-United States Navy <b>airframes</b> stored at AMARC, with the remaining 8 <b>airframes</b> being used for spare parts.|$|R
50|$|AJS/AJSF/AJSH 37: Upgrade of some AJ/SF/SH 37 between 1993 and 1998. Avionics and {{software}} upgrade. 48 AJ 37 <b>airframes</b> modified. 25 SH 37 <b>airframes</b> modified. 25 SF 37 <b>airframes</b> modified. Decommissioned in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Airframes</b> Unlimited T-103 is an American powered {{parachute}} {{designed and}} produced by <b>Airframes</b> Unlimited of Athens, Texas.|$|R
5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces <b>airframe</b> vibration by up to 80% which increases crew comfort and minimises the buildup of stress on the <b>airframe.</b> The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew, and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E
5|$|Competitors have tuned their {{aircraft}} {{for better}} performance. However, the safety implications of engine or <b>airframe</b> failures mean that performance tuning by individual teams, though commonly done in motorsports, is strictly limited in scope.|$|E
5|$|Featuring {{only four}} engines, the design also {{required}} new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy. In May 1964, <b>airframe</b> proposals arrived from Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, and Martin Marietta; engine proposals were submitted by General Electric, Curtiss-Wright, and Pratt & Whitney. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the <b>airframe,</b> along with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines.|$|E
25|$|Total {{production}} was 127 <b>airframes</b> with 124 aircraft completed, {{as the last}} three Eagle piston-engined <b>airframes,</b> VR138, -139, and -140, were never completed.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, the USAF {{signed on}} as a partner, {{providing}} the third and fifth production F-16 <b>airframes</b> for conversion. These two <b>airframes</b> became the only examples of the F-16XL.|$|R
25|$|Aircraft were {{constructed}} by a three firm consortium, Boeing, Vega and Douglas, {{known by the}} acronym BVD. Boeing built <b>airframes</b> at their plant in Seattle, Washington and their production models were appended -BO. Douglas Aircraft Company constructed <b>airframes</b> at Long Beach, California with a -DL suffix. The Vega Aircraft Corporation, {{a subsidiary of the}} Lockheed Aircraft Company, at Burbank, California, delivered <b>airframes</b> with the -VE suffix.|$|R
5|$|In June 1999, the {{contract}} to jointly develop and produce the Chengdu FC-1/Super 7 was signed. The project {{was to be a}} 50:50 partnership; the air forces of both countries would be committed to ordering the fighter. After GEC-Marconi had abandoned the bidding to supply an integrated avionics suite, FIAR and Thomson-CSF proposed a number of avionics suites based on the Grifo S7 and RC400 radars respectively, despite previously hoping to use the PAF's Super 7 to launch its new Blue Hawk radar. Because of sanctions placed on Pakistan after the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests, design work progressed very slowly over the next 18 months, preventing delivery of the Western avionics to the PAF. In early 2001, the PAF decided to decouple the <b>airframe</b> from the avionics, enabling design work on the aircraft to continue. As the <b>airframe</b> was developed, any new avionics requirements by the PAF could be more easily integrated into the <b>airframe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Italian Navy {{early warning}} variant with same <b>airframe</b> as Model 110 but with Eliradar HEW-784 radar in large underfuselage radome. Four built.|$|E
5|$|Izdeliye 154 - A second 152 <b>airframe</b> with a Lyulka TR-1 turbojet. Canceled due to delays {{with the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|After the war, <b>airframes</b> 3, 4, and 5 (and {{possibly}} other partial <b>airframes)</b> {{were brought}} to the U.S. for study. Today, only a single example survives in the National Air and Space Museum: a Kikka that was taken to the Patuxent River Naval Air Base, Maryland for analysis. This aircraft is very incomplete and {{is believed to have been}} patched together from a variety of semi-completed <b>airframes.</b>|$|R

5|$|One of two prototypes ordered on 1 January 1944 to Specification S.28/43. The <b>airframe</b> {{was sold}} by the Controller of Supplies (Air) to Blackburn on 17 April 1950.|$|E
5|$|Prime {{contractor}} Lockheed Martin Aeronautics manufactured {{the majority}} of the <b>airframe</b> and performed final assembly at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia; program partner Boeing Defense, Space & Security provided additional <b>airframe</b> components as well as avionics integration and training systems. F-22 production was split up over many subcontractors across 46 states to increase Congressional support, though this production split may have contributed to increased costs and delays. Many capabilities were deferred to post-service upgrades, reducing the initial cost but increasing total program cost. Production supported over 1,000 subcontractors and suppliers and up to 95,000 jobs.|$|E
50|$|As it {{was common}} {{practice}} to upgrade <b>airframes</b> as improvements became available, some 'N' numbers and/or serial numbered <b>airframes</b> were redesignated as different or new models. Total number of Bach Air Yachts built verified by Air Commerce Bureau and FAA records is 21.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Airframes</b> Unlimited SS-2 Trainer is an American powered {{parachute}} {{that was}} designed and produced by <b>Airframes</b> Unlimited of Athens, Texas for the training role. Now out of production, when it was available the aircraft was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.|$|R
5000|$|There are a {{multitude}} of Hobby Grade Model <b>Airframes</b> that can perform 3D manoeuvres. Many of these models are designed after full scale <b>airframes</b> with slight modifications to accommodate thrust to weight ratios, control surface sizes.Some {{of the most popular}} scale models are below: ...|$|R
