If they did, they didn’t spend the money like Valentino. No other designer ever did. When the terrorism first started in Rome – the period when the Red Brigades were kidnapping people – Valentino was riding around in a bulletproof Mercedes. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what color the Mercedes was? Red. My God, I thought, you must want to get blown up.|$|E

500|$|Serbian writer Janko Veselinović {{was well}} acquainted with the {{folklore}} of Tamnava, where {{he worked as a}} teacher in a village. In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co-villager Petar, a vetrenjak: [...] "As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere.

Then he has to stay in bed for a week. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> why he is like that? He told me.
