5|$|Buss {{supported}} Johnson as {{he revealed}} his diagnosis of HIV in 1991, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> hesitated to keep Johnson {{close to the}} organization, bringing him in as part-owner, and even as a coach.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Kertész {{secretly}} married a French portrait photographer {{by the name}} of Rosza Klein (she used the name Rogi André). The marriage was short-lived <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> spoke about it.|$|E
5|$|McMillin played {{professional}} football {{in the early}} days of the NFL, with the Milwaukee Badgers and the Cleveland Indians. McMillin could only play on certain weeks when the team he was coaching traveled North. The Badgers had to mail him the plays and signals the week before, pay him in advance, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> had any practice with the team.|$|E

5|$|Nash {{spent five}} years out of the cricketing {{spotlight}} (although he dominated Melbourne district cricket, the Victorian selectors refused to select him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> played a Sheffield Shield match). In 1936–1937 he topped the district cricket bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|Ulrika Eleonora (the elder) was sickly, and {{the many}} child births {{eventually}} broke her. When she became seriously ill, in 1693, Charles finally dedicated his time and care to her. Her death in July that year shook him deeply <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> fully recovered. Her infant son Ulric (1684–1685) had been given Ulriksdal Palace, which was renamed for him (Ulric's Dale).|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{arrived in}} Paris in late September 1831; {{he would never}} return to Poland, thus {{becoming}} one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{thing that}} surprises me most," [...] remarked the boss, [...] "is that Brazos doesn't come back. He was foaled on this range, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> been ridden {{anywhere}} else, has he?" ...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{these and}} {{numerous}} other influences, however, Shelly Manne's style of drumming was always his ownpersonal, precise, clear, {{and at the same}} time multilayered, using a very broad range of colors. Manne was often experimental, and had participated in such musically exploratory groups of the early 1950s as those of Jimmy Giuffre and Teddy Charles. Yet his playing never became overly cerebral, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.|$|E
5|$|In summer 2002, Gascoigne went {{on trial}} with American club D.C. United, but {{rejected}} a contract. In February 2003, {{he signed a}} nine-month contract with China League One club Gansu Tianma in both a playing and coaching role. Gascoigne scored in his first match in China, and in total scored two goals in four league games but his mental state meant {{that he had to}} return to America for treatment against drink and depression in April, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> returned despite the club ordering him to do so.|$|E
5|$|Neuer {{was born}} in Fremont, Ohio, {{and was one of}} eight {{children}} born to Henry Neuer and Jennie Catherman. He and his family moved to Sunbury, Pennsylvania, when he was a child. In 1898, Neuer enlisted in the Spanish–American War as a private, and was discharged the following year. After his discharge, he worked as a brakeman for a local railroad for the next few years. In late 1904, the Detroit Tigers intended to sign Neuer to a contract. However, nothing came of it <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> played a game with the organization.|$|E
60|$|I was in Egypt {{for three}} years when I was quite a young man. I was very small fry then, but I came into {{collision}} with Osman <b>and</b> <b>he</b> tried to poison me. I was very ill for two months, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> forgiven me because I recovered.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was too good," [...] said a Greenvale man crustily. [...] "He {{just let}} himself be imposed upon all his life. There's {{dozens of people}} owes him <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> asked for a cent from them. <b>And</b> <b>he's</b> always had some shiftless critter or other hanging round and devouring his substance." ...|$|R

5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, I {{remember}} back then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so positive and so sure <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E
5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, {{and in that}} summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When {{the time came to}} leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of his}} life, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> remarried.|$|E
5|$|Following Desai's {{resignation}} {{and the fall}} of the Janata government headed by him, Reddy appointed Charan Singh as Prime Minister. This was on the condition that he should prove his majority {{on the floor of the}} House before the end of August. Singh was sworn in on 28 July 1979 but never faced Parliament to prove his majority when Reddy convened it on 20 August. Reddy had appointed him Prime Minister since he had produced a letter claiming to have a parliamentary majority with the support of the opposition Congress Party led by his rival, the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In return for her support, Gandhi demanded that a law establishing special courts to try her and her son Sanjay Gandhi be repealed – a proposition that was unacceptable to Charan Singh. Gandhi therefore withdrew her support, forcing Singh to resign. His government lasted 24 days <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> faced Parliament. The convention of appointing a Prime Minister in a hung House but with conditions on time to prove majority was later adopted by President R Venkataraman.|$|E

He's everywhere, in every literary form you can think of. <b>And</b> <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> the same: every age and every writer reinvents its own Shakespeare.|$|R

5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> smoked or drank.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{he scored}} 834 runs but his average fell to 21.94 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> again {{averaged}} over 23 in any {{season in which}} he played regularly. Owing to his increasing weight and lack of physical fitness, he found batting much harder. As his physique declined, {{he was unable to}} produce the same batting feats he had managed previously. In the field, although still catching effectively, his inability to chase the ball meant he fielded closer to the batsmen; he also took fewer catches. In both 1934 and 1935, he averaged around 22 with the bat and scored under 800 runs. In 1935, he scored his final first-class century, against Somerset, having not reached the landmark since 1931. Team-mates and observers noticed that in the final years of his career, Chapman frequently left the field during matches, and they suspected he was drinking in the pavilion.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Hastings {{published}} his autobiography, simply titled The Autobiography of Sir Patrick Hastings, {{and the following}} year published Cases in Court, a book giving his views on 21 of his most noted cases. The same year he published Famous and Infamous Cases, a book on noted trials through history, such as those at Nuremberg. In early 1948, he suffered a small stroke which forced him to retire permanently from work as a barrister. On 11 November 1949, {{he and his wife}} travelled to Kenya, where their son Nicky had moved {{to start a new life}} after the end of the Second World War. While there, he suffered a second stroke due to the air pressure, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> fully recovered. Hastings spent the next two years of his life living in a flat in London, before dying on 26 February 1952 of cerebral thrombosis.|$|E

5|$|In 1955-56, Ray was {{overlooked}} {{and spent}} four years out of first-class cricket, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> played alongside Neil again at first-class level. Neil played in all of Victoria's matches, and Mick played in Queensland’s first six matches before being dropped for the second and final match against Victoria. In 1956-57, Mick played in two matches for Queensland {{earlier in the season}} before being dropped and retiring; neither were against Victoria, so none of the brothers played together in one match. Ray was recalled to the Victorian team {{in the latter half of}} the 1958-59 season. By this time, Neil had moved to New South Wales for employment reasons, and played each other late in the season. The Harvey brothers never played together or against one another again at first-class level. In 1959-60, Neil was in the Indian subcontinent representing Australia as Ray played his final first-class season before retiring.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tour}} matches, Loxton {{sometimes}} opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller {{to save their}} energy for the Tests, and he occasionally batted above the middle-order. Loxton was the most economical, but the least incisive of the bowlers, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> took more than three wickets in an innings. He played 22 first-class matches and scored 973 runs at 57.23 with three centuries, and took 32 wickets at 21.71. He was eighth in the run-scoring aggregates, but was productive when given an opportunity, ranking fifth in the Australian averages. Loxton was the eighth-leading wicket-taker; all seven frontline bowlers ahead of him took at least 50 wickets. Noted for his energetic and combative approach, Loxton was twice forced out of action for his troubles; he pulled a groin while searching for extra pace with the ball early in the tour, and {{towards the end of}} the season, he hit a ball into his face and broke his nose.|$|E
5|$|Seymour's {{operatives}} sought Johnson's support, but he long {{remained silent}} on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, {{in part because of}} their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.|$|E
