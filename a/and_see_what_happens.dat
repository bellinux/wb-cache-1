500|$|Near the novel's conclusion, Judd {{refuses to}} honor his {{agreement}} with Marty {{because there was no}} witness. When Marty asks his mother what a witness is, she responds: [...] "Somebody who knows the Lord Jesus and don't mind tellin' about it."

All I can do is stick to my side of the deal <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens.</b> All in the world I can do." [...] After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: [...] "What {{you going to do with}} that dog once he's yours?" [...] Marty's simple reply is: [...] "Love him." [...] Scholar Claudia Mills noted that: [...] "The resolution of the stand-off comes when Marty, in essence, stands witness, in his mother's religious sense of witness, for an ethic of love, crystallized in his love for Shiloh." ...|$|E

However, he was cautious about his team's prospects going into the year, saying: [...] "We've just got to wait <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> with this car, that's the question mark". At the opening round in Australia, Irvine finished fourth; and in the following race in Malaysia, {{he was forced to}} retire with an hydraulics problem. Irvine later managed to clinch seventh place in the Brazilian Grand Prix, before he suffered consecutive retirements in the next three races. He later finished the Monaco Grand Prix in ninth position, which was followed up with further consecutive retirements in the seven races. However, this marked a turning point as Irvine managed to finish in all of the remaining races. He was in the points scoring positions twice in this period—a sixth-place finish in Belgium and took his final career podium with third in Italy. He finished the season ninth in the Drivers' Championship, with eight points.|$|E

2500|$|Dewey's biographer Richard Norton Smith wrote, [...] "For fifteen years... {{these two}} combatants waged {{political}} warfare. Their dispute pitted East against Midwest, city against countryside, internationalist against isolationist, pragmatic liberals against principled conservatives. Each man thought himself the genuine spokesman of the future; each denounced {{the other as}} a political heretic." [...] In a 1949 speech, Dewey criticized Taft and his followers by saying that [...] "we have in our party some fine, high-minded patriotic people who honestly oppose farm price supports, unemployment insurance, old age benefits, slum clearance, and other social programs... these people believe in a laissez-faire society and look back wistfully to the miscalled 'good old days' of the nineteenth century... if such efforts {{to turn back the}} clock are actually pursued, you can bury the Republican Party as the deadest pigeon in the country."

2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{recorded}} in a two-month-long [...] "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording {{in order to stay}} focused on working and figuring out how to [...] "map out" [...] each song. He described himself as a [...] "studio rat" [...] who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, [...] "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio. ' We just wait <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when we get there. [...] " [...] Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from [...] "fucking around" [...] in the studio; [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while [...] "Criminal" [...] was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. [...] "Kill You" [...] was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.|$|E
2500|$|Bryant Frazer of Studio Daily {{wrote that}} Godard breaks the {{conventional}} [...] "rules" [...] of 3D in five ways: [...] "he does not keep a clean frame" [...] in his screen compositions, [...] "he embraces low-quality cameras", [...] "he gravitates toward deep focus" [...] cinematography, [...] "he rips the 3D image apart and then restores it {{in a single}} shot" [...] and [...] "he uses stereo to elevate the mundane" [...] instead of spectacular subjects like superhero or fantasy films. Frazer said that Godard [...] "wants to experiment with the technology, draw attention to it, test its boundaries, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when the image falls apart completely." [...] Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote that [...] "rather than using 3-D as an effect to create a sensation of flight or to make a viewer feel like the target of propelled objects, Godard uses 3-D to emphasize the materiality, the physical properties, of the world at hand." [...] Bordwell said that, other than [...] "to awe us with special effects", 3D's purposes are typically to be realistic in its enhancement of the depth of objects and [...] "advancing {{our understanding of the}} story", which is usually achieved with only one part of the screen in 3D while the rest is out of focus and in 2D. In Goodbye to Language Godard uses 3D in deep focus shots with images that allow the audience to scan the entire frame. Bordwell wrote that Godard's use of 3D [...] "is aiming to make us perceive the world stripped of our conceptual constructs (language, plot, normal viewpoints, and so on)." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the third}} season was {{wrapping}} production in May 2007, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse negotiated with ABC {{for the show}} to end in three years. [...] The remaining three seasons were to each be a third shorter, containing just sixteen episodes each that would air consecutively week after week from early February through mid-May. [...] The fourth season premiered {{on the last day}} of January in 2008, but was soon interrupted and truncated by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, adding an episode apiece onto the remaining seasons. [...] Then-co-executive producer Edward Kitsis speculated that these would translate into more two-part episodes. [...] The fifth season premiered two weeks early to allow for two breaks in the season for a rerun and a clip-show respectively. [...] In June 2009, the producers ordered an additional hour for the show's final season. [...] Cuse explained that [...] "For us, [...] is just about right. [...] I mean, we aren't sitting here feeling like, 'Oh my God, we need a ton more hours to tell the rest of our story.' [...] It feels like it's going to work out just fine. [...] It will have been the right length." [...] In September, ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson advertised that the final season would be the first Lost season to run uninterrupted and entirely repeat-free; however, Cuse said in October that Lost would premiere in January in order to take a two-week break in February to avoid competing with NBC's coverage of the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games.s Final Season Breakup: Winter Olympics to Ruin Everything]", IGN.
