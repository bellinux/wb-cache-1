5|$|<b>A</b> <b>curtain</b> wall to {{the north}} of the house with a gazebo is also {{designated}} as a listed building. It includes 14th century masonry at the bottom of the wall; however most of the structure as it is now dates from the 18th and 19th centuries. The corner gazebo was built in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 1951, Berger worked in Stuttgart and Böblingen in his native Baden-Württemberg, and managed <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> rail factory. He also contributed {{articles}} to the monthly right-wing journal Nation Europa published in Coburg, and occasionally wrote articles encouraging the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to give greater consideration to {{former members of the}} Waffen-SS. He and his wife Christine had four children: Krista, Wolf, Helgart and Folkart. He died on 5 January 1975 in Gerstetten.|$|E

5|$|In early 1943 Thomas began a {{relationship}} with Pamela Glendower, one of several affairs he had during his marriage. The affairs either ran out of steam or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity. In March 1943 Caitlin {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Aeronwy, in London. They lived in a run-down studio in Chelsea, made up of a single large room with <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> to separate the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{comprises}} {{a rectangular}} courtyard surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> wall, with a tower house, or keep, at one corner, and the round Glassin Tower projecting {{from the opposite}} corner. The foundations of demolished ranges of buildings remain around {{two sides of the}} courtyard. Of the outer court, only an earth bank shows the position of the walls, with fragmentary remains of a bakehouse the only visible structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{second was}} {{released}} as anniversary edition three-disc DVD box {{after six years}} of the theatrical release. This also included Chale Chalo which was a documentary on the making of Lagaan, <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> raiser on the making of the soundtrack, deleted scenes, trailers, along with other collectibles. After its release, it became the highest selling DVD in India beating Sholay (1975).|$|E

5|$|Dolbadarn Castle {{comprises}} a courtyard, {{surrounded by}} a number of towers and a round keep. The castle is built from purple and green slate stone, mainly constructed in a dry stone fashion without mortar, {{with the exception of the}} keep. The courtyard follows the natural shape of the hill and is protected by <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> wall; originally perhaps 15feet (5m) high, it is now only at most 3feet (1m) high. Of the castle buildings, only the keep remains to any significant height.|$|E
5|$|During the company's 1975 centennial {{performances}} of all thirteen Gilbert and Sullivan Operas at the Savoy Theatre, Trial was given four times, as <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> raiser to The Sorcerer, Pinafore and Pirates {{and as an}} afterpiece following The Grand Duke. Before {{the first of the}} four {{performances of}} Trial, a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as Carte, Kenneth Sandford as Gilbert and John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial in 1875. Trial by Jury was eliminated from the D'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.|$|E
5|$|Elliot and Carla {{worry about}} the {{difficult}} conversations {{they have to have}} with J.D. and Turk, respectively ("Options"). In the Act One finale ("When the Truth Comes Out"), all the plotlines come together. Dr. Kelso offers Carla her job back, but she worries how to tell Turk. Elliot worries how to tell J.D. he's not moving in. And Ms. Miller goes in for her CT scan, which turns up a gigantic aneurysm in her temporal lobe. Dr. Cox breaks the news to Ms. Miller, pulling <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> for privacy that also signals the end of the act.|$|E
60|$|A {{motion of}} Steele's hand {{caused me to}} dive through <b>a</b> <b>curtained</b> door back of Hoden's counter. I turned to peep out and was {{in time to see}} George Wright enter with the {{red-headed}} cowboy called Brick.|$|R

5|$|Etal Castle is {{a ruined}} medieval {{fortification}} {{in the village}} of Etal, Northumberland, England. It was built around 1341 by Robert Manners, and comprised a residential tower, a gatehouse and a corner tower, protected by <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. The castle was involved both in local feuding and the border wars between England and Scotland. There was a battle between the rival Manners and Heron families outside the walls in 1428, and in 1513 it was briefly captured by King James IV of Scotland during his invasion of England.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015, Cumberbatch {{condemned}} the UK government's {{response to the}} migrant crisis {{in a speech to}} theatregoers during <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> call at a performance of Hamlet, for which he stars. He also fronted a video campaign to help the charity Save The Children in its mission to aid young Syrian refugees. He was one of the signatories of an open letter, published in The Guardian, criticising the government for its actions regarding the refugee problem. He also gave nightly speeches after his curtain call as Hamlet at the Barbican in London, asking for donations to help Syrian refugees. At the end of the run, the audience contributed more than £150,000 for Save the Children.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> of skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> brail <b>curtain</b> or drape {{appears as}} a pleated panel much like <b>a</b> {{traveler}} <b>curtain</b> when in the lowered position. It is rigged, however, as an Austrian curtain: the multiple lines leading through rings sewn to along the seams {{on the back side}} of the curtain cause the fabric to gather along the bottom in swags as the curtain is raised. It has a faster action than <b>a</b> traveler <b>curtain,</b> and like <b>an</b> Austrian it requires little fly space.|$|R
50|$|Matisse's {{original}} {{title for the}} painting, Composition, draws attention to its abstract quality. Interviewed in 1931, Matisse explained that the painting represents a view from <b>a</b> <b>curtained</b> window in his home at Issy-les-Moulineaux, including the blue glass canopy that covered the front door.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few moments}} more she was {{kneeling}} with hands locked together before a much-gilded little waxem figure of St. Eustacie with his cross-bearing stag by his side, which stood in <b>a</b> <b>curtained</b> recess in the alcove where her stately bed was placed.|$|R
5|$|The Japanese sleeper ray has {{an almost}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc wider than long. Two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{under the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The small, protruding eyes are immediately followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are small and placed close together, and between them is <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> of skin that overlaps the mouth. The protrusible mouth forms a short, transverse line and is surrounded by a deep groove. There are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw, arranged into bands; the teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns. Five pairs of short gill slits are located on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was formed}} around a court, later called the inner court, {{enclosed}} by <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> {{wall with a}} circular tower on each corner and a gatehouse at the front; the north-east tower was larger than the others, perhaps to provide additional defences. Over time the towers acquired their own names: the north-west tower was called the Hazelwell Tower; the north-east the Redcap Tower and the south-west the Lady Tower. The ground fell away sharply on most sides of the castle, but its south and west sides were protected with a wet moat, using a dam fed from a nearby spring using a pipe. The gatehouse had twin towers and a drawbridge.|$|E
5|$|The keep was {{surrounded}} by <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> wall with probably four flanking towers and a fortified gatehouse protecting a relatively small bailey; these outer defences, rather than the keep, probably represented the main defences of the castle. The marshes nearby were drained turning the village of Orford into a sheltered port. The castle, including the surrounding ditch, palisade and stone bridge, cost £1,413 to build, with the work possibly being conducted by the master mason Alnoth. Some of the timbers were brought {{from as far away}} as Scarborough, and the detailed stonework being carved from limestone from Caen in Normandy, the remainder of the stone being variously from local mudstone and coralline, as well as limestone from Northamptonshire.|$|E

30|$|The {{developed}} actuator {{was mounted}} on a mobile robot, {{and the effectiveness of}} the actuator was demonstrated in <b>a</b> <b>curtaining</b> experiment. The developed actuator is relatively simple and can be constructed by a personal 3 D printer, potentially realizing an effective personal life support system.|$|R
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the finless sleeper ray is oval in shape; it is slightly wider than long in adults, and circular or longer than wide in juveniles. The small and bulging eyes are immediately followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles of roughly equal size. A pair of kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. <b>A</b> <b>curtain</b> of skin, reaching the mouth, is present between the small, circular nostrils. The nostrils are connected to the corners of the mouth by a pair of grooves. The small mouth is gently arched and protrusible. The flattened teeth have hexagonal bases and are arranged into narrow bands. There are five pairs of short gill slits.|$|E
5|$|The {{seat of the}} Prince of Monaco was {{established}} on the Rocher de Monaco (Illustration 5) as a fortress in 1191 when the harbour, that is today lined by Monte Carlo, was acquired by the Republic of Genoa. The harbour and its immediate area {{were given to the}} Genoese by the Emperor Henry IV with the proviso that the Genoese protect the coastline from piracy. Further territory was ceded to the new owners by the Council of Peille and the Abbaye de Saint Pons. In 1215 work began on a new fortress, comprising four towers connected by ramparts protected by <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. This forms the core of the present palace.|$|E
5|$|Calshot Castle is an {{artillery}} fort constructed by Henry VIII on the Calshot Spit, Hampshire, England, between 1539 and 1540. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire and defend Southampton Water as it met the Solent. The castle had a keep at its centre, surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>curtain</b> wall and a moat. Initially heavily armed, it had a garrison of 16 men {{and as many as}} 36 artillery guns. The castle continued in use for many years, surviving the English Civil War intact and being extensively modernised in the 1770s. During the 19th century, Calshot Castle was used by the coastguard as a base for combating smuggling. In 1894, however, fresh fears of a French invasion led to it being brought back into use as {{an artillery}} fort: a large coastal battery was constructed alongside the older castle and a boom built across Southampton Water, controlled from the castle.|$|E
50|$|In smaller theatres, <b>a</b> safety <b>curtain</b> is {{not usually}} required. Specifically, most United States {{building}} codes only require <b>a</b> fire <b>curtain</b> in theatres with a stage height of more than 50 ft. The heavy, flame-retardant house tabs can provide some degree of fire separation.|$|R
