40|$|This study {{provides}} development and verification of analysis {{methods used to}} assess performance of a carbon fiber rope (CFR) thermal barrier system that is currently being qualified for use in Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) nozzle joint- 2. Modeled geometry for flow calculations considers the joint to be vented with the porous CFR barriers placed in the 'open' <b>assembly</b> <b>gap.</b> Model development {{is based on a}} 1 -D volume filling approach where flow resistances (<b>assembly</b> <b>gap</b> and CFRs) are defined by serially connected internal flow and the porous media 'Darcy' relationships. Combustion gas flow rates are computed using the volume filling code by assuming a lumped distribution total joint fill volume on a per linear circumferential inch basis. Gas compressibility, friction and heat transfer are included in the modeling. Gas-to-wall heat transfer is simulated by concurrent solution of the compressible flow equations and a large thermal 2 -D finite element (FE) conduction grid. The derived numerical technique loosely couples the FE conduction matrix with the compressible gas flow equations. Free constants that appear in the governing equations are calibrated by parametric model comparison to hot fire subscale test results. The calibrated model is then used to make full-scale motor predictions using RSRM aft dome environments. Model results indicate that CFR thermal barrier systems will provide a thermally benign and controlled pressurization environment for the RSRM nozzle joint- 2 primary seal activation...|$|E

We integrate published data with new data to test and refine this model.

Improving tolerance to freezing has long been a main concern for legume breeders. Medicago truncatula Gaertn. has been selected as a model species for legume biology. Various studies have shown significant macrosynteny between M. truncatula and agronomically important crop legumes. A major freezing tolerance quantitative trait locus (QTL), herein referred to as Mt-FTQTL 6, was previously identified on M. truncatula chromosome 6. The physical location of this QTL was determined in this study and its corresponding chromosomal interval was enriched with additional markers. Markers were first developed using the draft sequence of M. truncatula euchromatin (release versions Mt 3. 0 and Mt 3. 5). Because Mt-FTQTL 6 was found to coincide with an <b>assembly</b> <b>gap,</b> the Glycine max (L.) Merr. genome sequence was also used to generate markers. Five Mt-FTQTL 6 -linked markers were found to be common to a region on Pisum sativum L. linkage group VI harboring a QTL for freezing damage. A subset of markers was tested for transferability across 11 additional legume species. This study lays the groundwork for identifying the molecular basis of Mt-FTQTL 6.

40|$|Carbon Fiber Rope (CFR) {{thermal barrier}} systems are being {{considered}} for use in several RSRM (Reusable Solid Rocket Motor) nozzle joints {{as a replacement for}} the current <b>assembly</b> <b>gap</b> close-out process/design. This study provides for development and test verification of analysis methods used for flow-thermal modeling of a CFR thermal barrier subject to fault conditions such as rope combustion gas blow-by and CFR splice failure. Global model development is based on a 1 -D (one dimensional) transient volume filling approach where the flow conditions are calculated as a function of internal 'pipe' and porous media 'Darcy' flow correlations. Combustion gas flow rates are calculated for the CFR on a per-linear inch basis and solved simultaneously with a detailed thermal-gas dynamic model of a local region of gas blow by (or splice fault). Effects of gas compressibility, friction and heat transfer are accounted for the model. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) solutions of the fault regions are used to characterize the local flow field, quantify the amount of free jet spreading and assist in the determination of impingement film coefficients on the nozzle housings. Gas to wall heat transfer is simulated by a large thermal finite element grid of the local structure. The employed numerical technique loosely couples the FE (Finite Element) solution with the gas dynamics solution of the faulted region. All free constants that appear in the governing equations are calibrated by hot fire sub-scale test. The calibrated model is used to make flight predictions using motor aft end environments and timelines. Model results indicate that CFR barrier systems provide a near 'vented joint' style of pressurization.

Medicago truncatula Gaertn. is an annual temperate forage legume that has been chosen as a model species for agronomically and economically important legume crops. The present study aimed to identify positional candidate genes for a major freezing tolerance quantitative trait locus that was previously mapped to M. truncatula chromosome 6 (Mt-FTQTL 6) using the LR 3 population derived from a cross between the freezing-tolerant accession F 83005 - 5 and the freezing-sensitive accession DZA 045 - 5. The confidence interval of Mt-FTQTL 6 was narrowed down to the region comprised between markers MTIC 153 and NT 6054 using recombinant F 7 and F 8 lines. A bacterial-artificial chromosome (BAC) clone contig map was constructed {{in an attempt to}} close the residual <b>assembly</b> <b>gap</b> existing therein. Twenty positional candidate genes including twelve C-repeat binding factor (CBF) /dehydration-responsive element binding factor 1 (DREB 1) genes were identified from BAC-derived sequences and whole-genome shotgun sequences (WGS). CBF/DREB 1 genes are organized in a tandem array within an approximately 296 -Kb region. Eleven CBF/DREB 1 genes were isolated and sequenced from F 83005 - 5 and DZA 045 - 5 which revealed high polymorphism among these accessions. Unique features characterizing CBF/DREB 1 genes from M. truncatula, such as alternative splicing and large tandem duplication, are elucidated for the first time. Overall, twenty genes were identified as potential candidates to explain Mt-FTQTL 6 effect. Their future functional characterization will uncover the gene(s) involved in freezing tolerance difference observed between F 83005 - 5 and DZA 045 - 5. Knowledge transfer for breeding improvement of crop legumes is expected.

40|$|The BMSTU has solved a task of {{developing}} an original processing method to join cylindrical adhesive joints, which allows joining quality improvement. A key {{point of the}} method is that joining is vertically arranged and a forced air supply with a given amount of the airflow pressure and temperature is directed from the bottom end towards upper one. This method allows locking the adhesive composition in the gap and arrangement of conditions for curing an adhesive composition without its outflow. In this case {{it is possible to}} adjust mutual bracing of joining pieces to reach a specified joining accuracy till the cure of adhesive composition. To study a new method of joining, the BMSTU has built an experimental unit and carried out a set of experiments with an anaerobic adhesive composition Loctite 638 with varying the gap in the join within the range from 0. 1 to 0. 7 mm. In the course of experiments an empirical dependence of the critical shearing force on the gap value in the join has been derived, as well as the recommended conditions for air quality to hold the adhesive compositions depending on viscosity has been revealed. As a result of experimental research, it is found that for adhesive composition of low-viscosity from 20 to 1000 cSt, a range of air quality for holding the adhesive composition in the <b>assembly</b> <b>gap</b> is from 9. 8 to 196 Pa; for adhesive composition of middle-viscosity from 1000 to 2000 cSt, the recommended conditions lie in the range from 197 to 735. 5 Pa; for adhesive composition of high-viscosity from 2000 to 5000 cSt, the recommended assembly conditions are from 736 to 1471 Pa. The realized studies have shown that using a new joining method, the amount of used adhesive composition is by about 25 % less, the labor hours of the joining process are two times decreased, and the joining strength obtained is increased on average by 10 - 15 % as compared to the traditional assembly methods of the adhesive cylindrical joint. This method allows assembling the joints in the increased gaps, excluding the of adhesive composition outflow from the gap and the use of additional components.    </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{gaps between}} two mating {{surfaces}} should be strictly controlled in precision manufacturing. Oversizing of gaps will decrease the dimensional accuracy and {{may reduce the}} fatigue life of a mechanical product. In {{order to reduce the}} gaps and keep them within tolerance, the relative posture (orientation and position) of two components should be optimized in the assembly process. This paper presents an optimal posture evaluation model to control the <b>assembly</b> <b>gaps</b> in aircraft wing assembly. Based on the step alignment strategy, i. e. preliminary alignment and refined alignment, the concept of a small posture transformation (SPT) is introduced. In the preliminary alignment, an initial posture is estimated by a set of auxiliary locating points (ALPs), with which the components can be quickly aligned near each other. In the refined alignment, the <b>assembly</b> <b>gaps</b> are calculated and the formulation of the gaps with component posture is derived by the SPT. A comprehensive weighted minimization model with gap tolerance constraints is established for redistributing the gaps in multi-regions. Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar (PHR) optimization, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and KD-tree searching are introduced for the solution of the optimal posture for localization. Using the SPT, the trigonometric posture transformation is linearized, which benefits the iterative solution process. Through the constrained model, overall gaps are minimized and excess gaps are controlled within tolerance. Practical implications – This method has been tested with simulated model data and real product data, the results of which have shown efficient coordination of mating components. This paper proposed an optimal posture evaluation method for minimizing the gaps between mating surfaces through component adjustments. This will promote the assembly automation and variation control in aircraft wing assembly...|$|R

However gap junctions constructed of Cx 26 -GFP were only minimally affected by Brefeldin A. Nocodazole, a microtubule disruptor, {{had little effect on}} the assembly of Cx 43 -GFP gap junctions, but perturbed assembly of Cx 26 -GFP gap junctions.

The intracellular trafficking properties of the mutated connexins were determined by immunocytochemistry. The results show a relationship between intracellular interruption of connexin trafficking, the efficiency of intercellular communication, and the severity of the disease phenotype. Intracellular retention was explained either by deficiencies in the ability of connexins to oligomerise or by mutational changes at two targeting motifs. The results point to dominance of two specific targeting motifs: one at the amino terminus and one at the membrane aspect of the cytoplasmically located carboxyl tail.

We have applied the strategy to several cosmid <b>assembly</b> <b>gaps</b> resulting from repetitive DNA and have accurately recovered the sequences of these regions. Analysis of these regions revealed six novel transposon-like repetitive elements, IR- 1, IR- 2, IR- 3, IR- 4, IR- 5, and TR- 1. Each of these elements represents a middle-repetitive DNA family in C. elegans containing at least 3 – 140 copies per genome.

Here, we present a reference-quality assembly of the amaranth genome which will assist the agronomic development of the species. Results: Utilizing single-molecule, real-time sequencing (Pacific Biosciences) and chromatin interaction mapping (Hi-C) to close <b>assembly</b> <b>gaps</b> and scaffold contigs, respectively, we improved our previously reported Illumina-based assembly to produce a chromosome-scale assembly with a scaffold N 50 of 24. 4 Mb. The 16 largest scaffolds contain 98 % of the assembly and likely represent the haploid chromosomes (n = 16). To demonstrate the accuracy and utility of this approach, we produced physical and genetic maps and identified candidate genes for the betalain pigmentation pathway. The chromosome-scale assembly facilitated a genome-wide syntenic comparison of amaranth with other Amaranthaceae species, revealing chromosome loss and fusion events in amaranth that explain the reduction from the ancestral haploid chromosome number (n = 18) for a tetraploid member of the Amaranthaceae. Conclusions: The assembly method reported here minimizes cost by relying primarily on short-read technology {{and is one of the}} first reported uses of in vivo Hi-C for assembly of a plant genome. Our analyses implicate chromosome loss and fusion as major evolutionary events in the 2 n = 32 amaranths and clearly establish the homoeologous relationship among most of the subgenome chromosomes, which will facilitate future investigations of intragenomic changes that occurred post polyploidization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During the <b>assembly</b> of <b>gap</b> junctions, a hemichannel in {{the plasma}} {{membrane}} of one cell {{is thought to}} align and dock with another in an apposed membrane to form a cell-to-cell channel. We report here on the existence and properties of nonjunctional, plasma membrane connexin 43 (Cx 43) hemichannels. The opening of the hemichannels was demonstrated by the cellular uptake of 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein from the culture medium when extracellular calcium levels were reduced. Dye uptake exhibited properties {{similar to those of}} gap junction channels. For example, using different dyes, the levels of uptake were correlated with molecular size: 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein (~ 32 %), 7 -hydroxycoumarin- 3 -carboxylic acid (, [...] ~ 24 %), fura- 2 (~ 11 %), and fluorescein-dextran (~ 0. 4 %).

40|$|To insure safe {{performance}} during the launch and {{flight of the}} W 79 Artillery Fired Atomic Projectile (AFAP), the <b>assembly</b> <b>gaps</b> in the high explosive assembly were filled with a continuous film of polyurethane elastomer adhesive called Halthane 73 - 18. To disassemble bonded weapons like the W 79, Lawrence Livermore and Mason & Hanger, Pantex Plant have developed a chemical dissolution process that safely removes the high explosive, thereby facilitating {{the recovery of the}} pit. The solvent of choice for the W 79 AFAP was dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In the W 79 dissolution process, a continuous spray of DMSO is emitted through nozzles mounted in manifold assembly that encircles the HE assembly. The operating pressure and temperature of the DMSO are less than 100 psig and less than 160 {degrees}F. Although warm DMSO readily dissolves the LX- 10 {sup 1 } explosive, it cannot dissolve the Halthane 73 - 18 adhesive due to its chemically crosslinked structure. DMSO does, however, swell the Halthane adhesive. The resulting swollen films are soft and unable to support their own weight, yet they are not necessarily so fragile that they will tear or shred readily under the force of the DMSO spray. Indeed, the swollen Halthane films encountered in several W 79 Type 6 B 2048 units tested in the Pantex Workstation proved to be quite tenacious. They remained intact under the action of DMSO spray and became an encapsulating barrier that shielded the remaining undissolved HE. This effectively stopped the dissolution process, forcing manual removal in order to complete the dissolution process. By comparison, the swollen Halthane film was readily shredded and eliminated under the action of the DMSO spray nozzles in tests at LLNL in workstation of a different design. This apparent difference in response {{is the subject of this}} report...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the Genome <b>Assembly</b> Program (<b>GAP),</b> {{a new program}} for DNA sequence assembly. The program is suitable for large and small projects, a variety of strategies and can handle data {{from a range of}} sequencing instruments. It retains the useful components of our previous work, but includes many novel Ideas and methods. Many of these methods have been made possible by the program's completely new, and highly interactive, graphical user interface. The program provides many visual clues to the current state of a sequencing project and allows users to interact In intuitive and graphical ways with their data. The program has tools to display and manipulate the various types of data that help to solve and check difficult assemblies, particularly those in repetitive genomes. We have introduced the following ne...|$|R

40|$|High-throughput {{sequencing}} {{has been}} dramatically accelerating {{the discovery of}} microsatellite markers (also known as Simple Sequence Repeats). Both 454 and Illumina reads have been used directly in microsatellite discovery and primer design (the "Seq-to-SSR" approach). However, constraints of this approach include: 1) many microsatellite-containing reads do not have sufficient flanking sequences to allow primer design, and 2) difficulties in removing microsatellite loci residing in longer, repetitive regions. In the current study, we applied the novel "Seq-Assembly-SSR" approach to overcome these constraints in Anisogramma anomala. In our approach, Illumina reads were first assembled into a draft genome, and the latter was then used in microsatellite discovery. A. anomala is an obligate biotrophic ascomycete that causes eastern filbert blight disease of commercial European hazelnut. Little is known about its population structure or diversity. Approximately 26 M 146 bp Illumina reads were generated from a paired-end library of a fungal strain from Oregon. The reads were assembled into a draft genome of 333 Mb (excluding gaps), with contig N 50 of 10, 384 bp and scaffold N 50 of 32, 987 bp. A bioinformatics pipeline identified 46, 677 microsatellite motifs at 44, 247 loci, including 2, 430 compound loci. Primers were successfully designed for 42, 923 loci (97 %). After removing 2, 886 loci close to <b>assembly</b> <b>gaps</b> and 676 loci in repetitive regions, a genome-wide microsatellite database of 39, 361 loci was generated for the fungus. In experimental screening of 236 loci using four geographically representative strains, 228 (96. 6 %) were successfully amplified and 214 (90. 7 %) produced single PCR products. Twenty-three (9. 7 %) {{were found to be}} perfect polymorphic loci. A small-scale population study using 11 polymorphic loci revealed considerable gene diversity. Clustering analysis grouped isolates of this fungus into two clades in accordance with their geographic origins. Thus, the "Seq-Assembly-SSR" approach {{has proven to be a}} successful one for microsatellite discovery...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{single layer}} <b>assembly</b> of <b>gap</b> coupled {{elements}} in elliptical shape is proposed in this communication to achieve broadband performance. Among the five patches {{considered in the}} present assembly, two pairs of patches having different patch areas are arranged around an edge truncated elliptical patch. The central edge truncated elliptical patch is fed through an inset feed arrangement and the other patches are parasitically gap coupled to the central patch. With such an arrangement, an enhanced impedance bandwidth of 2. 45 [*]GHz (or 36. 2 %) with respect to central frequency 6. 1 [*]GHz is achieved. Three resonant modes are excited with this arrangement giving improved bandwidth and gain in comparison to a conventional elliptical patch antenna. The simulated radiation patterns of proposed arrangement of patches suggest that these are identical in shape and direction of maximum radiations is directed normally to assembly of patches...|$|R
