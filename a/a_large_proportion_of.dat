30|$|In Germany, {{belonging}} to the nation still rests primarily on ancestry, but second-generation Turks’ experiences with exclusion in white spaces {{are similar to those}} in France. Ethnicity and religious background matter more than class, particularly for those respondents who moved to middle-class neighborhoods in more peripheral parts <b>of</b> Berlin with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> whites. In contrast to Paris, where the neighborhood functions as a proxy for visible difference, there is no exclusion based on one’s address in Berlin. It is only the visible otherness that matters. The consequence of these experiences of exclusion is a withdrawal to the inner-city neighborhoods with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> ethnic minorities.|$|R

5|$|Bohor reedbuck {{are active}} {{throughout}} the day, seeking cover during the daytime and grazing in the night. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> {{the whole day}} is spent on feeding and vigilance.

When threatened, they usually remain motionless or retreat slowly into cover for defense, but if the threat is close, they flee, whistling shrilly to alert the others. It hides from predators rather than forming herds in defense. Many predators, including lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, African wild dogs and Nile crocodiles, prey on the reedbuck.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect the support of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills, {{and reduces}} exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours.
