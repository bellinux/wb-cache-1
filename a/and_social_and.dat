5|$|Despite the {{nationwide}} attention the incident received, the Mussel Slough Tragedy is not remembered much today {{as well as}} later gunfights such as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Richard Maxwell Brown argues in No Duty to Retreat that the Mussel Slough shootout did not fit the mold of the gunfight/hero myth, which usually ignores such factors as ideology, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> economic conflict, thus not implanting it in the lore of the American Old West.|$|E
5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> poverty characteristics. The relative growth of informal employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that {{is suggested by the}} increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit from more flexible labour practices.|$|E
5|$|Homer-Dixon {{explains}} how his theory {{was influenced by}} endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a factor of production independent of labour and capital. He distinguishes his stance from Neo-Malthusianism which seeks to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to any problem. Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> cultural values regarding science.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between player’s gaming orientation (dimensions of achievement, immersion <b>and</b> <b>social</b> orientation) <b>and</b> avatar’s capital (<b>social,</b> economic, cultural <b>and</b> symbolic). The data was gathered through an online survey (n= 905) amidst players of a MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. The results show that avatar’s cultural capital is predicted by immersion orientation (customization, discovery, and role-playing), achievement orientation (mechanics) <b>and</b> <b>social</b> orientation (relationship <b>and</b> socializing). Economic capital is predicted by achievement orientation (advancement, competition, <b>and</b> mechanics) <b>and</b> <b>social</b> orientation (relationship <b>and</b> teamwork). <b>Social</b> capital was predicted by <b>social</b> orientation (relationship, socializing <b>and</b> teamwork) and immersion-orientation (escapism and customization). Symbolic capital was predicted by achievement orientation (advancement, competition, mechanics) <b>and</b> <b>social</b> orientation (relationship <b>and</b> teamwork) ...|$|R
5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1890, Bronisława — who {{a few months earlier}} had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> political activist — invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her {{a year and a half}} longer to gather the necessary funds. She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again. All that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself. In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw. She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891. She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near Warsaw's Old Town. The laboratory was run by her cousin Józef Boguski, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E
