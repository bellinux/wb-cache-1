Generally 6-10 sweeps are sufficient, and on the last sweep the opening of the net is lifted so that is horizontal at about chest height, and then flipped 180 degrees to close the net. The tail end of the net can then place into a kill jar with the lid closed. After about 2 to 5 minutes the insects can be preserved.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Presentation date: 1974 - 11 - 16 Nehalem Bay {{is located}} on the {{northern}} coast of Oregon in Tillamook County and contains approximately 243 ha of salt marsh. The Nehalem marshes occur as islands and land-tied units. West Island is the largest marsh island with an area of 82. 9 ha and a maximum elevation of 3. 079 m above mean lower low water. Three divisions on West Island based on inundation period have been identified: intertidal marsh, below mean high water; transitional marsh, from MHW to 2. 76 m above MLLW; and extratidal marsh, above 2. 76 m. West Island may be further subdivided into four topographic units based on the steepness of the elevation gradient: edge marsh, from. the lower margin to 2. 00 m; low marsh, 2. 00 to 2. 36 m; transitional marsh, 2. 36 to 2. 76 m; and high marsh, 2. 76 m and above. Creek density is low for the lower intertidal marsh, for the edge marsh, and. for the higher extratidal marsh; and is high for the upper intertidal and transitional marsh. Salt marsh vegetation-on West Island was sampled by harvesting aboveground biomass along seven transects at two-month intervals from May of 1972 to September of 1972. Plant species diversity increases with elevation and each species displays a particular elevation range. Analysis of dry-weight data by an ordination routine suggests the presence of 11 plant communities along the elevation gradient on West Island. Plant communities named by dominant species are Triglochin, Scirpus, Carex (tall and short phases), Carex-Deschampsia-Triglochin, Triglochin-Deschampsia, Carex-Deschampsia-Triglochin-Agrostis, Juncus- Agrostis, Juncus-Agrostis-Festuca, Aster-Potentilla-Oenanthe, Carex- Aster-Oenanthe, and Picea-Salix. Plant communities are readily identified by signatures on <b>aerial</b> photographs. <b>Net</b> <b>aerial</b> production on West Island increases with elevation and varies from a minimum of 518 g/m 2 /yr for the Triglochin community to a maximum of 1936 g/m 2 /yr for the Aster-Potentilla-Oenanthe community. The community mean <b>net</b> <b>aerial</b> productivity is 1388 g/m 2 /yr.

Habitat management and enhancement are a proven way to encourage wild bee populations, providing them with food and nesting resources. I examined bee diversity and abundance in plots managed by The Nature Conservancy near Wood River, NE. The plots were seeded with 2 seed mixes at 2 seeding rates: high diversity mix at the recommended rate, high diversity mix double the recommended rate, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) conservation planting (CP) 25 mix at one-half the recommended rate, and NRCS CP 25 mix at the recommended rate. I measured wild bee abundance and diversity, and established a database of wild bees associated with the plots. I also compared genus richness and abundance among the plots using and <b>aerial</b> <b>net</b> and blue vane traps to collect bees. Significant differences were not observed in genus richness and diversity among the plots; however, plot size {{and the ability of}} blue vane traps to draw bees from a long distance may have influenced my results.

In the summer of 2009, we sampled a 77 acre restored prairie easement at Metro Park East. This inventory allowed us to generate a set of baseline data {{to test the hypothesis}} that ecosystem restoration succeeds at protecting native species, even in an urban landscape.

We used track identification, Sherman live trapping and drift fencing to collect vertebrates. For invertebrates, we used <b>aerial</b> <b>netting</b> to collect samples. Plants were identified when in bloom. We sampled a total of 68 animal species and 46 plant species. Nine species that are in regional decline were discovered: bobolink, dickcissle, sedge wren, grasshopper sparrow, yellow-billed cuckoo, red-headed woodpecker, bull snake, ring-necked snake and wild indigo duskywing. These represent 6 birds, 2 snakes, and one butterfly. Our results also allowed us to create a set of future erosion and invasive species management strategies for Metro Park East.

40|$|Nesting {{resources}} structure native bee {{communities and}} the availability of suitable nests may enhance population abundance and persistence. Nesting rates of ground-nesting bees have proven challenging to assess {{due to a lack of}} standardized methods. We quantified the abundance of ground-nesting native bees using emergence traps over a seven-month study period. We then compared specimens captured in emergence traps with pan- and net-collected specimens. We hypothesized that ground-nesting bees would be highly similar to bees found foraging within our study site. However, the species assemblage of ground-nesting bees collected from emergence traps was significantly dissimilar from the assemblages collected with <b>aerial</b> <b>nets</b> and pan traps, indicating different sampling methods target different components of the species assemblage. We then examined the importance of nesting resources found at each emergence trap on the abundance of ground-nesting bees collected from emergence traps. Quantification of potential nesting resources, such as percent bare soil, has been proposed as a proxy of nesting habitat for ground-nesting guilds. Sloped ground and soil compaction were the most predictive nesting resources at the community-level. Further, spatial distribution of nesting resources within the study landscape also affected nesting rates, although this varied by species. Bees occurred in 85 % of emergence traps, with sampling date strongly affecting the number of bees collected. Emergence traps provide a useful method of sampling the ground-nesting native bee community and investigating nesting incidence. © 2014 Gesellschaft für Ökologie...|$|R

Yet, {{little is known about}} how wild bees, globally the most important wild pollinators, use resources in restored habitats. We compared bee use of native and exotic plants in two types of restored native plant hedgerows: mature hedgerows (> 10 years from establishment) designed for natural enemy enhancement and new hedgerows (≤ 2 years from establishment) designed to enhance bee populations. Bees were collected from flowers using timed <b>aerial</b> <b>netting</b> and flowering plant cover was estimated by species using cover classes. At mature hedgerow sites, wild bee abundance, richness, and diversity were greater on native plants than exotic plants. At new sites, where native plants were small and had limited floral display, abundance of bees was greater on native plants than exotic plants; but, controlling for floral cover, {{there was no difference in}} bee diversity and richness between the two plant types. At both mature and new hedgerows, wild bees preferred to forage from native plants than exotic plants. Honey bees, which were from managed colonies, also preferred native plants at mature hedgerow sites but exhibited no preference at new sites. Our study shows that wild bees, and managed bees in some cases, prefer to forage on native plants in hedgerows over co-occurring weedy, exotic plants. Semi-quantitative ranking identified which native plants were most preferred. Hedgerow restoration with native plants may help enhance wild bee abundance and diversity, and maintain honey bee health, in agricultural areas. © 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration...|$|R
40|$|Flight at high {{altitude}} {{is part of}} a migration strategy that maximises insect population displacement. This thesis represents the first substantial analysis of insect migration and layering in Europe. Vertical-looking entomological radar has revealed specific characteristics of high-altitude flight: in particular layering (where {{a large proportion of the}} migrating insects are concentrated in a narrow altitude band). The meteorological mechanisms underpinning the formation of these layers are the focus of this thesis. <b>Aerial</b> <b>netting</b> samples and radar data revealed four distinct periods of high-altitude insect migration: dawn, daytime, dusk, and night-time. The most frequently observed nocturnal profiles during the summertime were layers. It is hypothesised that nocturnal layers initiate at a critical altitude (200 – 500 m above ground level) and time (20 : 00 – 22 : 00 hours UTC). Case study analysis, statistical analysis, and a Lagrangian trajectory model showed that nocturnal insect layers probably result from the insects’ response to meteorological conditions. Temperature was the variable most correlated with nocturnal insect layer presence and intensity because insects are poikilothermic, and temperatures experienced during high-altitude migration in temperate climates are expected to be marginal for many insects’ flight. Hierarchical effects were detected such that other variables—specifically wind speed—were only correlated with insect layer presence and intensity once temperatures were warm. The trajectory model developed comprised: (i) insect flight characteristics; (ii) turbulent winds (which cause vertical spread of the layer); and (iii) mean wind speed, which normally leads to horizontal displacements of hundreds of kilometres in a single migratory flight. This thesis has revealed that there is considerable migratory activity over the UK in the summer months, and a range of fascinating phenomena can be observed (including layers). The UK has moved from one of the least studied to perhaps the best studied environments of aerial insect migration and layering in the world.

40|$|É apresentado um levantamento de Odonata baseado em coletas feitas às margens do Rio Dois de Setembro, Município de Ecoporanga, noroeste do Estado do Espírito Santo. As coletas foram {{realizadas}} de Junho de 2011 a Fevereiro de 2012, com auxílio de redes entomológicas aéreas, em cinco pontos ao longo das margens do rio, incluindo ambientes com distintos graus de antropização. Foram coletados 421 exemplares, representando 19 espécies e mais 15 morfótipos. Dentre as espécies mais encontradas estão Erythrodiplax basalis (Kirby, 1897); Erythrodiplax umbrata Linnaeus, 1758; Hetaerina auripennis (Burmeister, 1839); Perithemis lais (Perty, 1834). A ocorrência das seguintes espécies é registrada pela primeira vez para o Estado do Espírito Santo: Acanthagrion cuyabae Calvert, 1909; Enallagma novaehispaniae Calvert, 1907; Lestes forficula Rambur, 1842. Uma população da espécie ameaçada de extinção Leptagrion capixabae Santos, 1965 foi encontrada.
