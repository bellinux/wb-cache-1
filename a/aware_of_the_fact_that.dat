5|$|In April 1936, {{he and the}} Minister of the Interior Ion Inculeț {{allowed the}} a youth {{congress}} to gather in Târgu Mureș, <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it was masking a fascist gathering; delegates to the congress, traveling in a special train commissioned by the government, vandalized Ion Duca's memorial plate in Sinaia train station, and, upon their arrival in Târgu Mureș, made public their violent anti-Semitic agenda. It was probably there that death squads were designated and assigned missions, leading {{to the murder of}} Mihai Stelescu, a former associate, in June of the next year.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{campaign}} against Dacia was overall unsuccessful; however, the Romans winning {{in a minor}} skirmish allowed him to claim it as a victory, even though he ended up paying the King of Dacia, Decebalus, an annual tribute of eight million sesterces in tribute to end the war. Domitian returned to Rome, and received an ovation, but not a full triumph. Considering that Domitian {{had been given the}} title of Imperator for military victories 22 times, this was markedly restrained, suggesting that the populace, or at least the senate, was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it had been a less than successful war, despite Domitian's claims otherwise. However, in 89AD, Domitian invaded the Iazyges, along with the Quadi and Marcomanni. Few details are known of this war, but it is recorded that the Romans were defeated.|$|E

25|$|In 1881, due to {{the lack}} of heirs to the Romanian throne, King Carol I adopted his nephew, Ferdinand. Ferdinand, a {{complete}} stranger in his new home, started to get close to one of Elisabeth's ladies in waiting Elena Văcărescu. Elisabeth, very close to Elena herself, encouraged the romance, although she was perfectly <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a marriage between the two was forbidden by the Romanian constitution.|$|E
25|$|We {{should all}} be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> when r{{evolutionary}} — not evolutionary — changes come, things can get even worse. The intelligentsia {{should be aware of}} this. And it is the intelligentsia specifically that should keep this in mind and prevent society from radical steps and revolutions of all kinds. We’ve had enough of it. We’ve seen so many revolutions and wars. We need decades of calm and harmonious development.|$|E

25|$|Age {{plays an}} {{important}} role in one's internal and external locus of control. When comparing a young child and an older adult with their levels of locus of control in regards to health, the older person will have more control over their attitude and approach to the situation. As people age they become <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> events outside of their own control happen and that other individuals can have control of their health outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Lewis may {{not have}} been fully <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a quarter of Malaysia's {{population}} is made up of Hokkien- and Cantonese-speaking Chinese. However, Malay had been installed as the National Language with the passing of the Language Act of 1967. By 1982 all national primary and secondary schools in Malaysia would have been teaching with Bahasa Melayu as a base language (see Harold Crouch, Government and Society in Malaysia, Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1996).|$|E

His rich library became the nucleus of today's Central Library of Baroda with a network of libraries in all the towns and villages in his state. He was the first Indian ruler to introduce, in 1906, compulsory and free primary education in his state, placing his territory far in advance of contemporary British India.|$|E

25|$|These {{art historians}} were also <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> their {{scientific}} approach was biased: Only carpets produced by manufactories were exported to Western Europe, and consequently {{were available to}} the Renaissance artists. Village or nomadic rugs did not reach Europe during the Renaissance, and were not depicted in paintings. Not until the mid twentieth century, when collectors like Joseph V. McMullan or James F. Ballard recognized the artistic and art historic value of village or nomadic carpets, were they appreciated in the Western World.|$|E

She was well <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she could be separated from her father and Bahíyyih Khánum comforted her mother and brother when the family heard they were to be exiled separately. Remarking on her role in the 1868 split between Mirza Yahya and Bahá'u'lláh, Shoghi Effendi notes Bahíyyih Khánum was among the most active in encouraging the Bábís to accept the claims of her father.|$|E
25|$|The liberal {{champions of}} {{equality}} {{under the law}} were fully <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> men are born unequal {{and that it is}} precisely their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization. Equality under the law was in their opinion not designed to correct the inexorable facts of the universe and to make natural inequality disappear. It was, on the contrary, the device to secure for the whole of mankind the maximum of benefits it can derive from it. Henceforth no man-made institutions should prevent a man from attaining that station in which he can best serve his fellow citizens.|$|E

25|$|The subdelegates {{found the}} abbey church {{untouched}} {{with all its}} furnishings, such as altars, religious paintings, pews, paraments, chasubles and other liturgical devices. They ordered the prioress to deliver all liturgical devices which they appropriated in favour of the Restitution Commission and brought them to Stade. The prioress made the men <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the convent had more liturgical devices stored {{in a house in}} Stade. On 22November/ 2December 1629O.S./N.S. all the seized liturgical devices from Himmelpforten and in Stade were handed over to the Jesuit Father Matthias Kalkhoven, and disappeared with the Jesuits in April 1632.|$|E
25|$|The fleet {{traveled}} north {{within sight}} of land on the Florida peninsula sailing past the West coast. On 27 May 1586 as they approached further north a small fort was spotted on the shore, with a small inlet close by. This was the location of St Augustine, the most northerly town in Spain's New World Empire. Drake knew of the place and was also <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Spanish under Pedro Menéndez de Avilés had ordered all of the French Huguenot colonists that had tried to settle in the area executed. Drake decided on one final opportunity to raid and plunder, {{and a chance to}} avenge his fellow Protestants.|$|E
25|$|Gestalt Therapy, an {{approach}} created by Fritz Perls, {{was based on}} phenomenology, existentialism and also Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Perls {{spent some time in}} Japanese Zen monasteries and his therapeutic techniques include mindfulness practices and focusing on the present moment. Practices outlined by Perls himself in Ego, hunger and aggression (1969), such as “concentration on eating” (“we have to be fully <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> we are eating”) and “awareness continuum” are strikingly similar to Buddhist mindfulness training. Other authors in Gestalt Therapy who were influenced by Buddhism are Barry Stevens (therapist) and Dick Price (who developed Gestalt Practice by including Buddhist meditation).|$|E

25|$|Unlike Italy, however, Germany did not {{strive to}} achieve full autarky, {{even though in}} May of 1933, Hitler’s regime had {{defaulted}} unilaterally on Germany’s foreign debt along with a decree for sweeping capital controls that {{made it difficult to}} engage in foreign trade. Hitler was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Germany lacked reserves of raw materials, and full autarky was therefore impossible. Thus he chose a different approach. The Nazi government tried {{to limit the number of}} its trade partners, and, when possible, only trade with countries within the German sphere of influence. A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European countries (mostly countries located in Southern and South-Eastern Europe) during the 1930s. The German government strongly encouraged trade with these countries but strongly discouraged trade with any others.|$|E
25|$|By June 13, Russian {{units were}} {{back to their}} {{starting}} line. On June 19, the Russians launched another offensive. This time northwest to Lake Van. The Russians, under Oganovski, launched an offense into the hills west of Manzikert. The Russians underestimated {{the size of the}} Ottoman arm, and were surprised by a large Turkish force at the counterattack. Russian forces began to march from Manzikert towards Mush. However, they were not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Turkish IX Corps, together with the 17th and 28th Divisions was moving to Mush as well. Although the conditions were extremely difficult, the Turks were executing a very efficient operation of reorganization. 1st and 5th Expeditionary Forces were positioned to the south of the Russian offensive force and a “Right Wing Group” was established under the command of Brigadier General Abdülkerim Paşa. This group was independent from the Third Army and Abdülkerim Paşa was directly reporting to Enver Paşa. The Turks were ready to face the Russian attacks.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{backing from}} Sony, Media Molecule were unsure {{about exactly what}} {{direction}} {{they were going to}} take the game. They also worried about whether people would understand, or even like the game, but these worries were dispelled after its first presentation. Media Molecule were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Sony wanted them to demonstrate the game at the upcoming GDC 2007, but they were not told they were to be part of Phil Harrison's keynote speech until near the date it was due to take place. Healey stated that it was only when they arrived in San Francisco for the conference that they realised just how much backing Sony were devoting to the game—much more than Media Molecule had previously thought. Healey relates that although the revelation of Sony's faith in the game boosted their confidence, additionally, it increased the pressure on them with the realisation that their task had become much greater than originally anticipated.|$|E
