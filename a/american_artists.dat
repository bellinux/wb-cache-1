Open to the public free of charge, the new museum was devoted mainly to exhibitions of contemporary art by <b>American</b> <b>artists.</b> At its opening in on June 4, 1938, the museum showed modern American paintings and work by native Americans as well as Tibetan art objects that Roerich had given to Horch. The <b>American</b> <b>artists</b> included Stuart Davis, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Jack Levine, Marsden Hartley, George Luks, John Sloan, Philip Evergood, Reginald Marsh, Charles Burchfield, and Rockwell Kent.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues-influenced boogie-woogie, and the jump blues of Fats Waller and Louis Jordan.

5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues {{differed}} in tone from that of African <b>American</b> <b>artists,</b> often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British {{rhythm and blues}} singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{his fellow}} band members, Fafa – born 13 May 1954 in Ampasamadinika, a {{neighborhood}} of Antananarivo – has based his career entirely around singing. He {{was raised in a}} musical family: his father played mandolin and his mother enjoyed singing. Fafa began playing guitar at the age of nine and sang along with popular European and <b>American</b> <b>artists</b> on the radio, including Harry Belafonte, Claude François and Mike Brant. Fafa discontinued his studies after the 1972 rotaka and returned with his wife and son (born in 1973) to live with his parents in Antananarivo. There he obtained a position at the Ministry of Transportation, becoming the first salaried member of the group. For the first three decades of his career, Fafa often recorded and performed in collaboration with other artists and groups. He released his first solo album in 2008 to strong sales across Madagascar. In the late 1990s Fafa led a successful campaign to increase access to public latrines in the impoverished Antananarivo neighborhood of Isotry.|$|E
