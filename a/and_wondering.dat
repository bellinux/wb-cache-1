The standalone CD artwork has Hamasaki holding {{the door to}} a red telephone box in Covent Garden, London, with the album title and her name superimposed on the booth. This marks Hamasaki's third album cover to be photographed and directed outside of Japan, after LOVEppears and (Miss)understood. The CD and music video DVD format has a close-up of Hamasaki's face, with parts of the British stripes across her face. The box set is coloured black with the red British cross near the corner; the album version is the CD and DVD format, with the CD and DVD cover imprinted onto the mug, red tea tin, and the bag. The digital release uses the standalone CD format. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Chow, and the design was based on Hamasaki's first visit to the UK and Britannia. First pressing issues for both the standalone CD format, the CD and DVD format, and the box set included a 36–page photo album of Hamasaki roaming the streets <b>and</b> <b>wondering</b> around stores and markets in London.|$|E

25|$|Not surprisingly, strikes {{increased}} steadily {{from the}} middle of 1915, and so did crime; but, for the most part, people suffered and endured, scouring the city for food. Working class women in St. Petersburg reportedly spent about forty hours a week in food lines, begging, turning to prostitution or crime, tearing down wooden fences to keep stoves heated for warmth, grumbling about the rich, <b>and</b> <b>wondering</b> when and how this would all come to an end.|$|E
25|$|While {{thinking}} of {{an approach that}} would appeal to an audience outside of rock music, <b>and</b> <b>wondering</b> {{about the nature of}} pop music, Yamaguchi thought of the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach as something that transcended time and genre. Yamaguchi wrote the song as a documentary of the specific feelings that he had when listening to Bach at night time. He wrote the song as a love song, inspired by everyday things. The imagery in the song was inspired by music interacting with the brain of someone falling asleep, creating mixed-up dreams.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the year, Alpha Oumar Konaré, the {{chairman}} of the commission of the African Union and former president of Mali, reportedly urged Bozizé not to stand for election. Bozizé gave an interview to Radio France Internationale on May 17 in which he refused to say whether or not he would run, but he confirmed that Konaré had spoken to him about it, while criticizing Konaré for what he called interference in the country's affairs, <b>and</b> <b>wondering</b> whether he had consulted the opinions of the Central African people before getting involved. He stressed that the matter would depend on the will of the people. Some of his supporters campaigned prominently for him to stand. About 5,000 people walked in Bangui on June 19 to support his candidacy; Bozizé thanked them and asked for time to reflect.|$|E

25|$|In the Spring of 1855, as the Crimean war developed, Darwin was {{pondering the}} war of nature, taking the then current analogy with an {{industrial}} economy further than others, <b>and</b> <b>wondering</b> how species spread. He was dismissive of the ideas that others had put forward of sunken continents like Atlantis, and began experimenting in his house with soaking seeds in brine then seeing if they could germinate. He reported his results in Gardeners' Chronicle and roped in his curate friends including Henslow. The consul in Norway sent seed pods which had washed ashore. Hooker was able to identify them as coming from the Caribbean {{and get them to}} germinate at Kew. Investigation of variation brought him back to animal husbandry. He now began dissecting domestic animals and breeding pigeons, joining a pigeon fancier's club: very unorthodox behaviour for naturalists at that time.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s, Thomas was a {{magazine}} editor, {{but he never}} lost his fascination with the movies. He narrated Twentieth Century Fox's Movietone newsreels until 1952. That year, he went into business with Mike Todd and Merian C. Cooper to exploit Cinerama, a movie format that used three projectors and an enormous curved screen with 7-channel surround sound. (He produced the first movie/documentary in Cinerama: This is Cinerama, the third: Seven Wonders of the World, and the fourth: Search for Paradise) in this format in 1956, with a 1957 release date. Cinerama features were well-received, but the company discontinued the three-projector system by 1963, with the enormous costs and technical difficulties in film production and presentation, {{in favor of a}} single-camera 70mm system which lacked the visual impact of true Cinerama. A quarter-century later, Thomas was still raving about Cinerama in his memoirs <b>and</b> <b>wondering</b> why someone wasn't trying to revive it.|$|E
25|$|According to his successor, Dr Meek, Mr M’Culloch {{had been}} in the habit of preaching out of doors, in the nearby gorge, because of the poor repair of the church. It was here, after sermon, that he shared the letters and written sermons he {{received}} from New England. Towards the end of January 1742, two men, Ingram More, a shoemaker, and Robert Bowman, a weaver, went through the parish, and got about 90 heads of families to sign a petition to the minister, asking that he give them a weekly lecture. Thursday evening was set for this. The first two lectures passed off as expected, and only a few persons came back to the manse for further prayer and discussion. However, on Monday 15 February, all the Fellowships in the parish turned up at the manse and spent several days praying and discussing <b>and</b> <b>wondering</b> about the great events that were being reported from England and America.|$|E

500|$|Writers often extolled McCain for {{his courage}} {{not just in}} war but in politics, and wrote sympathetically about him.

[...] By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies, including, as one writer listed, [...] "the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter...." ...|$|E

[...] He knew that {{most of the}} colonists' powder and military supplies at Concord had already been hidden. [...] No war had been declared.

500|$|Reich {{was taught}} at home {{until he was}} 12, when his mother was {{discovered}} {{having an affair with}} his live-in tutor.

He wrote that he would follow his mother when she went to the tutor's bedroom at night, feeling ashamed and jealous, <b>and</b> <b>wondering</b> if they would kill him if they found out that he knew. He briefly thought of forcing her to have sex with him, on pain of threatening to tell his father.

[...] However, this realism also means that the series contains a relatively large amount of violence, with one critic stating that it is [...] "not {{for the faint of}} heart." [...] Several critics have compared Warriors to Brian Jacques' Redwall series, though one commented that it was [...] "not as elegantly written." [...] The New York Times called the series a [...] "hit with young readers", specifically because of its [...] "sprawling universe", and the series was able to appear on the New York Times Bestseller List for a total of 117 weeks, as of 24 November 2013.|$|E

[...] Ricardo Baca from The Denver Post compared Madonna to actress Drew Barrymore {{on the cover of}} the EP, feeling that the singer looked foolish and that the tracks were weal attempts at [...] "spicing up" [...] the already non-commercial songs from American Life. Kevin C.
