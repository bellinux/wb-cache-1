Two indexes were created - one for extracted geographic relevant-terms (footprint document) and one for reference document collections. Footprint <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> <b>document</b> scores are combined by a linear interpolation to obtain an overall score for document relevance ranking.

40|$|Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) {{community}} has generally accepted {{the thesis that}} both thematic and geographic aspect of documents are useful for GIR. This paper describes a preliminary experiment exploring this thesis by seperately indexing/searching geographical relevant-terms (place names, geo-spatial relations, geographic concepts and geographic adjacetives) extracted from reference document collection. Two indexes were created one for extracted geographic relevant-terms (i. e. document footprint) and one for reference document collections. Geo-Score and Thematic-Score against document collection footprint <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> <b>document</b> collection respectively were combined through a linear interpolation to obtained the final score for document relevance ranking. We used several freely available geographic resources – Wikipedia, World-Gazetteer, GEOnet Name Server (GNS), and WordNet. Apache Lucene {{was used as an}} indexing and search platform while Alias-I LingPipe was used to detect geographic named entities (GNEs), and other geo-relevant concepts and terms in documents.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} reveals that web metrics is a complex topic that can be found under many different terms and phrases: e-metrics, web site traffic measurement, web usage, web mining, online consumer/usage behavior, are just a few. Data mining, web analytics, knowledge data discovery, informetrics (bibliometrics and web-o-metrics) and business analytics are also relevant. â Metricsâ are measures and â analyticsâ are measurements of information, processes and data analysis from processes but web analytics is also becoming synonymous for e-metrics and web metrics. â Verticalizationâ is one of the newest trends in business web analytics/metrics; this means not just web traffic logging and analysis but has been broadened to include understanding and predicting customer behavior and customer relationship management. â Personalizationâ is considered fundamental to improving customer motivation, satisfaction and retention. What is the potential of web metrics for understanding educational use of the NSDL and measuring educational impact? As Einstein said, â Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted. â What do we want to count for the NSDL how, and why? These are the questions that have motivated the creation of this bibliography. We hope it will be a useful starting point <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> <b>document</b> as we begin framing a plan of action for the NSDL in this important area. Status: This bibliography is a work in progress. When it is completed (target date: 08 / 30 / 04) it will be a selective, annotated bibliography on web metrics. Currently, the abstracts in this bibliography are often taken directly from the source articles or websites and are not annotations. Books and journals dealing with this topic are not yet included (with one exception); we plan to include at least other texts and journals in the final version. Acknowledgments: Chris Neuhaus jumpstarted this bibliography and Anita conducted a literature search in databases such as the ACM Digital Library besides editing it. In addition, we found the statements of the Webmetrics Workshop participants most helpful in preparing this bibliography and some of the references in the statements have been included here. We also acknowledge the labor of Shawn Nelson, SIRLS, University of Arizona, in locating the abstracts and articles/items listed in this bibliography. Your feedback and comments (especially critical comments and reader annotations about any of the items) will help to improve this selective, annotative bibliography and are greatly encouraged. Version: This is version 2 of the bibliography prepared by volunteers of the Educational Impact and Evaluation Standing Committee for the NSDL Webmetrics Workshop (a joint workshop of the Technology Standing Committee and the EIESC), Aug. 2 - 3, Costa Mesa, CA. This version adds two tools mentioned at the workshop and includes citations to two papers that were distributed at the workshop as well. Version 1 of the bibliography, also a volunteer effort, was distributed as a paper copy to the 26 participants of the workshop.

40|$|Clinical {{documents}} contain {{statements and}} facts about patients under treatment. They help to coordinate care and transmit knowledge among the clinicians contributing to patient care. However, {{studies show that}} documentation of important clinical information is generally poor and miscommunication is {{a leading cause of}} adverse events. The discharge summary is a formal message between the hospital and the family physician. It has an informational role and serves as a boundary object for coordinating care. The research goal is to create an electronic discharge summary that improves the quality of the data and its interpretation. The method uses the same semantic markup standard, Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) from Health Level 7 (HL 7), for structuring clinical <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> <b>documents.</b> It supports coding concurrent with composition of a clinical document. The coding systems <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> <b>documents</b> are building blocks. They function as boundary objects for representing, learning about and transmitting knowledge via the discharge summary. The hypothesis is that an infostructure based on boundary objects will improve the quality and interpretation of data used in patient care...|$|R
