50|$|The biggest {{cause of}} the sound in the {{conventional}} wind turbine is <b>the</b> air drag <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> of <b>the</b> blades but now <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> of <b>the</b> blades are covered and the more of the wind is more focused towards {{the center of the}} blades due to the diffuser shroud which means <b>the</b> air drag <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> of <b>the</b> blades are minimized.|$|R

5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the beak of all {{birds in the}} family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There {{is evidence that the}} nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E

5|$|Antbirds are {{generally}} small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and rufous plumage, which is sexually dimorphic in pattern and colouring. Some species communicate warnings to rivals by exposing white feather patches {{on their backs}} or shoulders. Most have heavy bills, which in many species are hooked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b>|$|E
5|$|At 6.8 to 9.2 (7.7) mm, {{males are}} only about half as long as females. Their maximum width is 34 to 42 (37) μm. The length of the {{esophagus}} is 2.3 to 3.0 (2.6) mm, of which the muscular pharynx makes up 260 to 315 (273) μm, and is lined by 35 to 42 (37) stichocytes. The back region of the worm is 4.5 to 6.2 (5.1) mm long. The back, or rectal, opening of the digestive tube is located {{near the end of}} the worm, and the length of the cloaca is 530 to 576 (550) μm. Near the back end, there are two alae (ridges) at the sides (laterally), which are 40 to 55 (46) μm long; these are located at 10 to 15 μm from another, small ala <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> In A.putorii, the lateral alae are much longer and reach the ala <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> The spicule, a spikelike structure that functions in reproduction, is curved <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> and hardened and has a length of 380 to 426 (406) μm. It is smaller than that of the similar A.tamiasstriati from North American chipmunks and larger than that of A.murissylvatici from various North American and European small rodents, but about as long as that of A.putorii, which however lacks the curved tip.|$|E

5|$|Most antbirds have proportionately large, heavy bills. Several genera of antshrike have a {{strongly}} hooked tip to the bill, and all antbirds have a notch or 'tooth' <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> {{of the bill}} which helps in holding and crushing insect prey. The two genera of bushbirds have upturned chisel-like bills.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising {{on its hind legs}} and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b>|$|E
5|$|The copulatory bulb {{of males}} (the sperm-transferring organ <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the pedipalps), terminates in a narrow, curving tip called an embolus, which in Unicorn bears a hook {{at its base}} and is {{accompanied}} by a similar curved extension called a translucent sclerite.|$|E

Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars.
