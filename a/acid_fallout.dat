40|$|Prediction of <b>acid</b> <b>fallout</b> and the dry {{deposition}} of Al 2 O 2 was {{the objective of}} this investigation. Sampling was done at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The models available were not appropriate and the data available was negligible. Thus, a bimodal particle distribution was assumed normalized to the few existing data points and used as a foundation for a crude zeroth order approximation for the <b>acid</b> <b>fallout.</b> In addition, a settling spectrum for the Al 2 O 3 particles was devised as a table look-up since the graphs in the literature at first pass could not be fitted with reasonable analytic functions. Consulting services were rendered to researchers. Special emphasis was placed on improving current techniques and adding LIDAR (Light Radar). Suggestions for future studies are made...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} over increased coal consumption are fully {{justified by the}} past history of coal use. Although improved technology has provided some safeguards, increased utilization will require mining practices, emission control technologies, and waste disposal procedures that are not yet fully integrated into the routine use of the coal energy system. The Committee on Health and Evnironmental Effects of Increased Coal Utilization identified six critical environmental issues which are of concern: coal mine worker health and safety, reclamation of arid lands from surface mining, {{the health effects of}} coal combustion products, toxic trace elements in coal combustion wastes, <b>acid</b> <b>fallout,</b> and global effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This presentation addresses the first four of these issues...|$|E
40|$|At {{the outset}} of AOSERP there was {{considerable}} concern that significant quantities of acid precipitation and heavy metals emanating from oil sands plants might adversely affect lakes near the oil sands area. Thus, the Aquatic Fauna Technical Research Committee initiated this project with the objectives to determine: 1) if <b>acid</b> <b>fallout</b> lowers the overall prmductivity of lakes; 2) if acidification directly affects the physiology of fishes, their eggs or fry; and 3) if heavy metals deposited in the lakes or mobilized from sediments are toxic to fishes or their food organisms. These objectives were addressed by the researchers in a whole lake experiment at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario because of the experimental control that could be effected at the facilities. A complementary project directly concerning lakes adjacen...|$|E
40|$|Trace metal {{composition}} of winter snowpack, snow-melt filter residues and top-soil samples were determined along three transects through industrial {{towns in the}} Usa basin, North-East Russia: Inta, Usinsk and Vorkuta. Snow was analysed for Ag, Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn using ICP-MS (Ca and K by F-AAS for Vorkuta only), pH and acidity/alkalinity. Filter residues were analysed for: Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn using F-AAS and GF-AAS; top-soil samples were analysed for Ba, Cu, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, Zn using F-AAS. Results indicate elevated concentrations of elements associated with alkaline combustion ash around the coal mining towns of Vorkuta and Inta. There is little evidence of deposition around the gas and oil town of Usinsk. Atmospheric deposition {{in the vicinity of}} Vorkuta, {{and to a lesser extent}} Inta, added significantly to the soil contaminant loading as a result of ash <b>fallout.</b> <b>Acid</b> deposition was associated with pristine areas whereas alkaline combustion ash near to emission sources more than compensated for the acidity caused by SO 2...|$|R
40|$|An {{array of}} stratigraphic, chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical {{evidence}} indicates that an impact terminated the Cretaceous Period. The 180 -km-diameter Chicxulub crater, which now lies buried on the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, was probably formed by the impact. The impactor was probably a long-period comet. Shock devolatization of the thick carbonate/evaporite sequence impacted at Chicxulub probably led to a severe and long-lasting greenhouse warming and a prompt pulse of sulfuric <b>acid</b> rain. The <b>fallout</b> of crater ejecta formed two layers: a lower layer which varies in thickness following a power-law relation based on distance from the Chicxulub crater and an upper, globally-distributed, uniformly âˆ¼ 3 -mm-thick layer. The upper layer probably represents the fallout of condensates and entrained solid and liquid particles which were distributed globally by the impact fireball. The lower layer consists of brecciated rock and impact melt near the crater and largely altered tektites far from the crater. The clasts of this layer were probably ballistically transported. The Raton, New Mexico K/T boundary section preserves the fireball and ejecta layers in a coal-free nonmarine environment. Siderophile, chalcophile, and lithophile trace element anomalies occur {{similar to those found}} at marine K/T boundary localities. Soot occurs peaking in the 3 -mm-thick fireball layer and the immediately overlying 3 mm of sediment, implying prompt burning of the Cretaceous forests. The Brazos River, Texas continental-shelf K/T sections preserve coarse boundary sediments which were probably produced by impact waves. Siderophile and chalcophile trace-element anomalies occur suggesting that the fireball layer and possibly part of the ejecta layer are interbedded with the coarse boundary sediments. The Beloc, Haiti deep-sea K/T sections preserve a thick ejecta sequence including altered and unaltered tektites and shocked minerals capped by the fireball layer. The thick K/T ejecta preserved at this and other nearby K/T localities require a source crater of Chicxulub's size and location. The composition of the tektites and shocked grains require an impact into recently extracted continental crust with a carbonate/evaporite component as found at the Chicxulub crater...|$|R
