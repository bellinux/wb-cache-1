5|$|The {{squadron}} was re-equipped with F/A-18 Hornet {{fighters and}} moved to RAAF Base Tindal in 1988. It was placed on <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> support the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping deployment to East Timor in 1999, and saw combat in 2003 {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq and in 2015 during the military intervention against ISIL.|$|E
40|$|Background: Electronic {{medical records}} (EMR) provide {{opportunities}} to implement systems of information flow, such as <b>alerts</b> <b>to</b> providers. Methods: Within a group practice with an EMR, {{we conducted a}} trial of automated <b>alerts</b> <b>to</b> the in-baskets of primary care physicians and staff when patients were discharged from hospital to home. We generated alerts for new medications or monitoring needs. Staff received <b>alerts</b> <b>to</b> schedule office visits. Using EMR “digital crumbs”, we tracked when alerts were viewed. We analyzed the impact of physician age, gender, department, and employment status (full-time, part-time) as well as patient conditions (age, gender, comorbidity, and number of office visits in the previous year) on timely opening. Results: Of 763 <b>alerts</b> <b>to</b> physicians, 616 (81...|$|R

5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alert</b> <b>to</b> {{the danger}} {{presented}} to his scattered ranks, Richard, prudent as ever, halted and regrouped his forces once {{more after a}} further pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again, showing they still had stomach to renew the fight. However, a third and final charge caused them to scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills in all directions, showing no inclination to continue the conflict. Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During the night the Saracen dead were looted.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 1975, CINCPAC {{placed the}} 31st Marine Amphibious Unit on 96-hour <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> move the {{evacuation}} fleet into position off Kampong Som (previously Sihanoukville) in the Gulf of Thailand {{for the implementation}} of Operation Eagle Pull. On 6 February the reaction time was reduced to 48 hours, meaning that the evacuation fleet had to maintain a 48-hour cruising radius from Kampong Som. This was further reduced on 28 February to 24 hours, effectively meaning that the fleet had to remain within the Gulf of Thailand.|$|E

5|$|Rain {{came in the}} night. The {{cold front}} that would blow away the smog was {{forecasted}} to arrive between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. Shortly after 9 a.m. the wind arrived, moving mostly from the northeast between 6–10 miles per hour and bringing cooler temperatures in the 50s°F (10–15°C). Glenn at the Interstate Sanitation Commission sent a message advising the <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> end at 9:40a.m., based on weather and air readings. Shortly after noon, Governor Rockefeller declared {{the end of the}} alert; New Jersey and Connecticut also ended their alerts that day.|$|E
5|$|The Dallachy Wing was on <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> attack any ships {{found by}} the {{reconnaissance}} patrol. Although the group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable to attack and a worthwhile target, Coastal Command came under the operational command of the Admiralty and was bound by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels. As a result, the wing was dispatched against Z33 even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and {{in a difficult position}} for aircraft to attack.|$|E
5|$|The attack {{force was}} placed on <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> launch what had been {{designated}} Operation Paravane on 8 September. Good weather was vital for the operation, and the airmen waited at their home bases {{for the next two}} days as forecasts proved unfavourable. Meanwhile, the Air Ministry, No. 5 Group and British military liaison officers in the USSR continued to work with the relevant Soviet headquarters to finalise the arrangements for Force A's flight from Norway to Yagodnik.|$|E

5|$|A 3,000-strong Army unit, as well {{as several}} Australian {{warships}} and aircraft from a number of RAAF squadrons participated in the unsuccessful defence of Java when the Japanese invaded the island in March1942. An Army force made up of elements from the 7thDivision also formed part of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) land forces on Java but saw little action before it surrendered at Bandung on 12March after the Dutch forces on the island began to capitulate. Following the conquest of the NEI, the Japanese Navy's main aircraft carrier force raided the Indian Ocean, attacking Ceylon in early April. The two Australian Army brigades stationed at Ceylon {{at the time of the}} raid were placed on <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> repel a potential invasion but did not see action as this did not eventuate.|$|E
5|$|Early on February 10, RSMC Nadi placed Niuafo'ou and Niuatoputapu under a {{tropical}} cyclone alert, before {{early the next}} day extending the <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> the whole of Tonga. Later that day the Vavau, Haapai, and Nomuka islands were placed under a gale warning. The warnings stayed in force until late on February 12 when the gale warning was canceled, and concurrently, southern Tonga was placed under {{a tropical}} cyclone warning. These warnings were canceled on February 14. During the cyclone, RSMC Nadi placed the Lau Islands under a strong wind warning, and a damaging swell warning was declared for Fiji. Businesses in Nuku'alofa closed as the storm passed by.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Guánica {{was a small}} barrio {{within the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the town of Yauco. It had 60 houses in all and its only defense was eleven members of the 4th Volante de Yauco, a Puerto Rican militia unit, under the command of Lieutenant Enrique Méndez López. When the Guánica lighthouse keeper Robustiano Rivera spotted the approaching convoy, he immediately gave the <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> the residents of the barrio. All of the residents, with the exception Agustín Barrenechea, Vicente Ferrer, Juan María Morciglio, Simón Mejil, Salvador Muñoz, Cornelio Serrano and Pascual Elena who welcomed the invaders, abandoned their homes and joined Rivera on his journey to Yauco where he broke the news of the invading forces to the city's mayor.|$|E

5|$|In March 1695, Captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set {{out from}} Cahabón in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, with 70 Spanish soldiers, {{accompanied}} by {{a large number of}} Maya archers from Verapaz, native muleteers, and four Dominican friars. The Spanish pressed ahead to Lake Petén Itzá and engaged in a series of fierce skirmishes with Itza hunting parties. At the lakeshore, within sight of Nojpetén, the Spanish encountered such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to their main camp. Interrogation of an Itza prisoner revealed that the Itza kingdom {{was in a state of}} high <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> repel the Spanish; the expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón.|$|E
5|$|Nicholson was {{at first}} seen as an {{improvement}} over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, the outgoing governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes hardline Protestant population by preserving the trappings of the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and the handful of New York's Catholics had used for worship. In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor {{that turned out to}} be true), Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be on <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.|$|E
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E

5|$|The {{physiological}} {{responses of the}} epaulette shark to low oxygen are mediated by the nucleoside adenosine. In hypoxic conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply. The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant {{and there is no}} elevation of blood glucose levels. The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> its environment.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Tsingtao, Scharnhorst went into dock for her annual repair; Krosigk accordingly shifted his flag to Gneisenau temporarily. On 10 October, the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing Dynasty broke out, which caused {{a great deal}} of tension amongst the Europeans, who recalled the attacks on foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900–01. The rest of the East Asia Squadron was placed on <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> protect German interests and additional troops were sent to protect the German consulate. But the feared attacks on Europeans did not materialize and so the East Asia Squadron was not needed. By late November, Scharnhorst was back in service and Krosigk returned to the ship. She cruised to Shanghai by way of Tientsin and Yantai, arriving on 12 December. From 14 to 24 January 1912, Scharnhorst toured the ports of the central China coast and returned to Tsingtao on 9 March, where the rest of the squadron had assembled. On 13 April, the ships went on a month-long cruise to Japanese waters, returning to Tsingtao on 13 May. From 17 July to 4 September, Scharnhorst went on another tour of Japanese ports and during this period she also visited Vladivostok in Russia and several ports in the Yellow Sea.|$|E
5|$|In East Africa, {{the blue}} {{wildebeest}} {{is the most}} abundant big game species; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds, but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over {{a short period of}} time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd, a fact necessary for their survival. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large carnivores, especially the spotted hyena. Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators. They are also <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons. Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle. Some illegal hunting goes on but the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are in national parks or on private land. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both as least-concern species.|$|E
