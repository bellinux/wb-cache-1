500|$|After {{completing}} the lead vocals, Swivel decided {{to rework the}} 1980s sound on the snares as they were originally very tight. He therefore added a gated reverb for the snap sound which was long and drawnâ€‘out snap sound. He also subbed in an additional kick underneath to add some real oomph to the bottom. Owing to the work Swivel had accomplished during production, the final mix took only a few hours. He said: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} tracks, but I just enjoyed it, to be honest. I knew how I wanted it to sound, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much the last song we cut; a lot of the mixing was nailed in the production as well, which helped. Dream did a great job producing this track." [...] The bar one guitar track of [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] was entirely programmed. Similarly, the live drum section in the hook was actually done with programmed drums. Once the mixing was over, Swivel's impression were as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|The OSCE {{declared}} on 20 March 2006 {{that the}} [...] "presidential election {{failed to meet}} OSCE commitments for democratic elections." [...] Lukashenko [...] "permitted State authority {{to be used in}} a manner which did not allow citizens to freely and fairly express their will at the ballot box... a pattern of intimidation and the suppression of independent voices... was evident throughout the campaign." [...] The heads of all 25 EU countries declared that the election was [...] "fundamentally flawed". In contrast, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs declared, [...] "Long before the elections, the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights had declared that they [...] would be illegitimate <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> biased in its commentaries on their progress and results, thus playing an instigating role." [...] Lukashenko later stated that he had rigged the election results, but against himself, in order to obtain a majority more typical of European countries. Although he had won 93.5% of the vote, he said, he had directed the government to announce a result of 86%.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{listening}} to the finished tracks, the members selected guest appearances they felt would work with the songs. The group [...] "aim for the stars" [...] on its choices of collaborators, with Wentz stating, [...] "I {{want to bring in}} people who no one would expect...This year it's like, we made some new friends, like Lil Wayne. Or let's get Jay-Z on there." [...] Wentz commented on working with Jay-Z, saying [...] "It was insane. We called him up and thought we were gonna talk to his assistant. Then he answers the phone, like, 'Yo, this is Hov,' and we were like, 'Um ...' It just happened like that. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> crazy." [...] Jay-Z recorded his introduction to the album's opening song [...] "Thriller" [...] while on tour in Australia and sent it to the band, who later put the vocal on the album. At a fashion show in Los Angeles, Wentz met rapper Kanye West, who invited Wentz and Stump to his home to share new music. West then agreed to create a remix of [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] three weeks before the scheduled release of the album. The band was unable to include the remix on the album due to time constraints, but a remix of West's version featuring Lil Wayne, Lupe Fiasco, Travis McCoy, Paul Wall and Tyga was released in July 2007.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Queen entirely {{approved}} of the nomination, and there is one unanimous feeling {{on the part of}} all who have heard of the proposal (<b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> generally known), that there could not be a question about the selection.|$|R
60|$|We {{have had}} a devil of a morning of upset and bustle; the bronze {{candlestick}} Faauma {{has returned to the}} family, in time to take her position of stepmamma, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> to see how the child is at once at home, and all her terrors ended.|$|R
6000|$|... "None {{of taking}} the place by force, Bob. <b>It</b> has <b>been</b> besieged, over and over again; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> nearly always by hunger that it has fallen. That is where the pinch will come, if they besiege us in earnest: it's living on mice and grass you are like to <b>be,</b> before <b>it</b> <b>is</b> over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{always felt}} sorry for that poor fellow, too," [...] said Mavering. [...] "He {{seemed to be a}} good fellow, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> hard lines for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you see how}} careful he was of her, {{coming up}} and down stairs? That was very pretty; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> to see them both so ready {{to show off their}} young {{housekeeping}} to us." ...|$|E
60|$|I slept as {{sound as}} a rock that night, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> broad {{daylight}} when I woke up. I don't believe that I would have wakened then, but I wanted to turn over and couldn't, and that {{is enough to make}} any fellow wake up.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, in {{the middle}} of the Latin American debt crisis it created Sonric's as a way to expand its product line with candies and as a {{response}} to lowered demand because of the contraction of economic power. The brand is known because of its mascot, a wizard (known as El Maguito Sonrics) <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> popular among kids.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{were ten}} years younger, {{this might be}} serious,' meditated Ethel. 'Happily, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only a droll {{adventure}} for me in my old age, and I have heard say that a little raving for a grown-up woman is a wholesome sort of delusion, at his time of life. So I need not worry about <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>and</b> touching while <b>it</b> lasts, good fellow!' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Daytime," [...] said he, [...] "is nothing. You {{turn around}} and night comes on. Then there's nothing better than going {{straight}} {{out of bed to}} the dining room. <b>And</b> <b>it's</b> <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> cold. I could scarcely get warm in a bathtub. But a hot drink is a wardrobe in itself. I've had strong drinks, and I'm flat-out drunk. The wine has gone to my head." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{stood and}} waited and waited, and she didn't move, {{and neither did}} the line. Menendez now said he thought {{she might as well}} give it up. The tide was too low, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> near dinner-time, and, besides this, there was a shower coming on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and I got a {{long ways}} down, and had one bad tumble, too, in a dirty little gully; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> nigh day when I turned to come back. An' then when I got up here I thought I would look fur John Walker's boat--fur I knew he kept it tied up somewhere down this way--and save myself all that walk. I found the ole boat--" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{sat there}} {{for an hour and}} then 'e sent the boy in agin. This time the cabman lost 'is temper, and, arter chasing the boy up the road, gave a young feller twopence to take 'is place and promised 'im another twopence when he came out. Sam tried to get a word with 'im as 'e passed, but he wouldn't listen, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> near 'arf an hour later afore they all came out, talking and laughing.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a square}} box, {{about a foot}} each way; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> heavy, {{probably}} from {{the setting of the}} jewels. Well, anyhow, I am heartily glad, Thorndyke. I know, of course, that you are well off, still 100,000 pounds--for the money has doubled itself since we had it--to say nothing of the jewels, is a nice plum to drop into anyone's mouth." ...|$|R
50|$|Plutarch {{and other}} writers speak {{of him as}} a lyric poet, and Suidas mentions, as his works, mele kai poiemata tina mythica, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> certain that the musical {{compositions}} of his age and school were often combined with suitable original poems, though sometimes, as we are expressly told of many of the names of Terpander, they were adapted to the verses of Homer. <b>Be</b> this as <b>it</b> may, we have now no remains of the poetry of Thaletas.|$|R
6000|$|The captain made {{no answer}} to these words, and {{did not appear to}} hear them. [...] "I tell you, Mr. Easterfield," [...] he said presently, [...] "that I did not know until now how much I cared for that girl. I don't mind saying this to you because you come to me like a friend, and I believe in you. Yes, sir, I did not know how much I cared for her, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> hard on me to find out how little she cares for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{must say}} that the hogs {{charging}} down on me didn't astonish me any more than to find myself {{on top of a}} gate with a young woman charging on my country in this fashion, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> hard on me to have her pitch into the cab question, because Jone and me had had quite a good deal to say about cabs ourselves, comparing New York and London, without any great fluttering of the stars and stripes; but I wasn't going to stand any such talk as that, and so I said: ...|$|E
60|$|Can it be {{wondered}} at that, in the circumstances, our unfortunate hero became almost insane? The wedding-day had been fixed {{before he left}} Red River; preparations were being made for the great event, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> well understood that Dan had gone off hunting with the view, chiefly, {{to be out of}} people's way till the day should arrive. They would scarcely begin to notice his prolonged absence till the day approached. Then, no doubt, when too late, and he should be far on the way to Canada, they would in some alarm send out parties to search for him.|$|E
60|$|And so, {{take it all}} around, we made a good haul. When we {{was ready}} to shove off we was {{a quarter of a}} mile below the island, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn't no {{accidents}} and didn't see nobody. We got home all safe.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} are over the worst now; for if, as you tell me, the smoke is {{beginning}} to come up from some of those floating batteries, their fire will soon slacken a bit. As long as they keep out the shot, those defences of theirs are first rate but, {{as soon as the}} shot begin to embed themselves in the roof, they are worse than nothing--for they can neither dig out the shot, nor get at them with the water. Once establish a fire, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> sure to spread." ...|$|R
60|$|And so {{we talked}} and smoked and stuffed {{watermelons}} much as two hours, <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> late, <b>and</b> {{when we got}} back the house was quiet and dark, and everybody gone to bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, thank God, I {{have done}} that, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much all," [...] {{answered}} the captain, wiping his face. [...] "I {{served in the}} French war-- Truxtun's war, as we call it--and I had a touch with the English in the privateer trade, between twelve and fifteen; and here, quite lately, I was in an encounter with the savage Arabs down {{on the coast of}} Africa; and I account them all as so much snow-balling, compared with the yard-arm and yard-arm work of this very night. I wonder if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> permitted to try a cigar at these conversation-onies, gentlemen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's so; {{but none}} of 'em thunk o' that. And what Mr. Enraghty said stopped the jawin' at the time. It all begun ag'in, worse than ever when we got almost to Philadelphy; and he said some of 'em must take the south fork of the road with Saint Paul and keep on till they saw a big light over Philadelphy, where the New Jerusalem was swellin' up, and the rest would meet 'em there with him and Saint Peter. They said, 'Why couldn't we all go together?' <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> soon after that that he slipped into the river. Stumbled on a round stone, I reckon." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{assured him}} that if he really did let go and have a swim the sharks would {{promptly}} appear. This was a bluff on my part. I didn't believe it. It lasted as a deterrent for two days. The third day the wind fell calm, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> hot. The Snark was moving a knot an hour. Bert dropped down under the bowsprit and let go. And now behold the perversity of things. We had sailed across two thousand miles and more of ocean and had met with no sharks. Within five minutes after Bert finished his swim, the fin of a shark was cutting the surface in circles around the Snark.|$|E
6000|$|And then Herbert {{shook hands}} with them all, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> {{to see how the}} girls wiped their hands in their aprons before they gave them to him, and how they {{afterwards}} left the room with their aprons up to their faces. The women walked out first, and then the men, hanging down their heads, and muttering as they went, each some little prayer that fortune and prosperity might return to the house of Fitzgerald. The property might go, but according to their views Herbert was always, and always would be, the head of the house. And then, last of all, Richard went. [...] "There ain't one of 'em, Mr. Herbert, as wouldn't guv his fist to go wid yer, and think nothing about the wages." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. COADE (thrilling). That was how {{he first}} met me! He used to love me in black <b>and</b> green; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a <b>pretty</b> parasol. Look, I <b>am</b> old... So <b>it</b> can't <b>be</b> the same woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{my story}} deals with him, Madonna, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> no <b>pretty</b> tale. Not such a {{narrative}} as I should choose wherewith to entertain you. Still, {{since you have}} asked for it, you shall hear it.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{falls and}} one gets {{up again in}} life, Blanche; you know I used to call you so in old times, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the <b>prettiest</b> name in the world. Besides, I have practised since then." ...|$|R
60|$|He went on from triumph to triumph. He won {{the monthly}} medal in May, June, July, August, and September. Towards {{the end of}} May he was heard to {{complain}} that Wissahicky Glen was not a sporting course. The Greens Committee sat up night after night trying to adjust his handicap so as to give other members an outside chance against him. The golf experts of the daily papers wrote columns about his play. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> generally considered throughout the country {{that it would be}} a pure formality for anyone else to enter against him in the Amateur Championship--an opinion which was borne out when he got through into the final without losing a hole. A safe man to have betted on, you would have said. But mark the sequel.|$|E
60|$|WELL, all day we {{went through}} the humbug of {{watching}} one another, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> sickly business for two of us and hard to act out, I can tell you. About night we landed at one of them little Missouri towns high up toward Iowa, and had supper at the tavern, and got a room upstairs with a cot and a double bed in it, but I dumped my bag under a deal table in the dark hall while we was moving along it to bed, single file, me last, and the landlord in the lead with a tallow candle. We had up a lot of whisky, and went to playing high-low-jack for dimes, {{and as soon as the}} whisky begun to take hold of Bud we stopped drinking, but we didn't let him stop. We loaded him till he fell out of his chair and laid there snoring.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Esmond, it {{has been}} said, belonged to the noble English family which takes its title from Castlewood, in the county of Hants; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> {{generally}} known that King James II. and his son had offered the title of Marquis to Colonel Esmond and his father, and that the former might have assumed the (Irish) peerage hereditary in his family, but for an informality {{which he did not}} choose to set right. Tired of the political struggles in which he had been engaged, and annoyed by family circumstances in Europe, he preferred to establish himself in Virginia, where he took possession of a large estate conferred by King Charles I. upon his ancestor. Here Mr. Esmond's daughter and grandsons were born, and his wife died. This lady, when she married him, was the widow of the Colonel's kinsman, the unlucky Viscount Castlewood, killed in a duel by Lord Mohun, at the close of King William's reign.|$|E
5000|$|... "At that moment, this drunk lady {{at the bar}} said, Why dont {{you call}} it Ball Four? We laughed about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> funny, <b>and</b> as were walking through the streets later, Shecter said, You know, Ball Four {{is not a bad}} name." ...|$|R
60|$|Florentia. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> all {{extremely}} {{quiet and}} comfortable, and I don't {{in the least}} recognize Dorriforth's lurid picture of the dreadful conditions. There was no scenery--at least not too much; there <b>was</b> just enough, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very <b>pretty,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in its place.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well,' she said, with {{a gentle}} submission, that was as new a sight as Tom's tenderness; 'but indeed I <b>am</b> not tired; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so <b>pretty</b> <b>and</b> pleasant. Is this really Dr. Spencer's old house? Can there be such a charming room in it?' ...|$|R
