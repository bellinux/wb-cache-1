40|$|Aims: To {{define the}} rote of medical or {{surgical}} treatment {{in patients with}} periodic <b>fever,</b> <b>aphthous</b> stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA syndrome). Methods: A Medline search was performed using the terms PFAPA, periodic <b>fever,</b> <b>aphthous</b> stomatitis, pharyngitis, cervical adenitis, treatment. A systematic review of the English literature was performed. Papers on pyrexia of unknown origin in the pediatric population were excluded; this was because the clinical entities included in the differential diagnosis of pyrexia of unknown origin share many clinical characteristics with PFAPA, and may be ill defined. Results: Twenty-seven papers have been published since 1989, of which 20 were in English language. There were five single case reports and two papers involving two patients each. There were 6 retrospective reviews of case notes, involving 5 - 94 patients over a 3 - 10 year review period. Given that current evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} tonsillectomy in PFAPA is extremely weak (level of evidence V), tonsillectomy should not be performed.

30|$|Currently {{recognized}} criteria warranting surgical {{removal of}} the tonsils are recurrent throat infections and SDB, with the latter being the more commonly found indication [1].

Each episode of sore throat should present {{with one or more}} of the following clinical signs or test results: temperature higher than 38.3  °C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, or positive test for group A ß-hemolytic streptococci. If the frequency of sore throats is fewer than the above criteria, watchful waiting is recommended. However, if the patient has any of the modifying factors, surgical intervention is warranted.

40|$|Introduction: {{periodic}} <b>fever,</b> <b>aphthous</b> stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis (PFAPA) {{syndrome is}} a multifactorial autoinflammatory disorder representing a true challenge for differential diagnosis of fevers of unknown origin among children. Areas covered: although current diagnostic criteria confine PFAPA syndrome into the pediatric world, recent evidences have suggested the possible onset {{of this disease}} during adulthood {{as well as the}} possible relapse over time after spontaneous or treatment-induced resolution in childhood. The number of treatment choices currently available is growing significantly. In this regard, inhibition of interleukin (IL) - 1 represents an intriguing promise for PFAPA patients who do not respond to standard therapy or for whom corticosteroid administration is unsuitable. Expert commentary: the challenges associated with the discovery of pathogenetic pathways and treatment alternatives in PFAPA syndrome are immense, reflected by the small number of studies currently in progress. As new mechanisms underlying the regulation of innate immunity are discovered and novel therapeutic approaches are adopted, the next decade promises many exciting advances to manage and treat patients with PFAPA syndrome...|$|R

In this part, we review other autoinflammatory disorders including hyper IgD, tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes, autoinflammatory bone disorders and some other rare autoinflammatory disorders such as Sweet’s and Blau syndromes. In cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes group, we discussed chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome. Autoinflammatory bone disorders are categorized to monogenic disorders such as pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma;gangraenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome, the deficiency of interleukine- 1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) and Majeed syndrome and polygenic background or sporadic group such as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) or synovitis, acne, pustulosis...|$|R
40|$|As no {{specific}} laboratory test has been identified, PFAPA (periodic <b>fever,</b> <b>aphthous</b> stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis) remains {{a diagnosis of}} exclusion. We searched for a practical use of procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in distinguishing PFAPA attacks from acute bacterial and viral infections. Levels of PCT and CRP were measured in 38 patients with PFAPA and 81 children diagnosed with an acute bacterial (n= 42) or viral (n= 39) infection. Statistical analysis {{with the use of}} the C 4. 5 algorithm resulted in the following decision tree: viral infection if CRP≤ 19. 1 mg/L; otherwise for cases with CRP> 19. 1 mg/L: bacterial infection if PCT> 0. 65 ng/mL, PFAPA if PCT≤ 0. 65 ng/mL. The model was tested using a 10 -fold cross validation and in an independent test cohort (n= 30), the rule’s overall accuracy was 76. 4 % and 90 % respectively.

Methods A cohort of patients with a median age of 4. 9 years experiencing 'typical PFAPA' episodes participated in this study. Blood cells and serum cytokines were analyzed by CBC analysis and multiplex ELISA. Results Oscillations in the concentration of blood cells during the afebrile and febrile phases of typical PFAPA syndrome were observed; novel findings include increased monocytes and decreased eosinophils during a febrile episode and increased thrombocytes in the afebrile interval. Relatively modest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were present in sera. IFNγ-induced cytokine IP 10 /CXCL 10 was increased after the onset of fever while T cell-associated cytokines IL 7 and IL 17 were suppressed during afebrile and febrile periods. Conclusions Identification of dysregulated blood cells and serum cytokines is an initial step towards the identification of biomarkers of PFAPA disease and/or players in disease pathogenesis. Future investigations are required to conclusively discern which mediators are associated specifically with PFAPA syndrome. </p...|$|R
