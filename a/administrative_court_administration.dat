40|$|This {{report is}} written in {{cooperation}} with Eskilstuna municipality public administration for urban planning. The reports purpose is to look into how other public authorities carry out public purchase of consultants and entrepreneurs in the urban planning area. The goal is {{to come up with}} suggestions of how Eskilstuna municipality public administration for urban planning can improve its purchasing process in this field in order to minimize the risk where a consultant or entrepreneur files an appeal against the decision of awarding a contract to another rival. The appeal can be filed to the county <b>administrative</b> <b>court.</b> The public <b>administration</b> for urban planning can do its purchases through the model of "lowest price" or "economically most favorable" for them. When using "economically most favorable", the department can value a number of soft parameters by giving them points and the offer which gets most points can be rewarded the right to sign a contract. Bidders who have not been rewarded the contract can file an appeal to the county <b>administrative</b> <b>court</b> if they have rejections about the department’s decision. The court can either rule in the departments favor or against. If the court rules against the department then the entire purchasing process must be redone...|$|R

40|$|Considerations {{concerning}} {{the place and}} position of <b>administrative</b> <b>courts</b> in the future constitution appear before the remarks {{concerning the}} normative model of these courts in Poland during the period 1919 - 1939. The current position of the Head <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> refers to the solutions ofthat interwar time. Generally, in the discussions about the new constitution, {{as well as in}} the drafts of the constitutions already prepared, a tendency advocating the retention of the currently binding solutions is observed. The role of the Head <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> is still seen to be a one-instance, specific and independent organ, guided only by the of bills, and of cassation competence. However, the judiciary supervision of the awards and decisions of the Head <b>Administration</b> <b>Court</b> would be still the responsibility of the Supreme Court. The paper suggests other positions which the Head <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> might assume in the new constitution. The future <b>administrative</b> <b>courts</b> have also been given new considerations. The solutions postulated in the paper might, in the near future, lead to the implementation of a two-instance <b>administrative</b> <b>courts</b> in Poland, which would, together with the Head <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court,</b> become separate and independent of the Supreme Court. The fundamental solutions to the draft of the new bill about the Head <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court,</b> which postulate, among others, an extension of the Court's jurisdiction, have been identified. The new proposals bring administered subjects much closer to the European standards.
