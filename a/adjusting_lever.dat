25|$|On 13 June 1937 the Nemere {{was damaged}} in a bungee-cord launch and was rebuilt with Göppingen airbrakes, the aileron joint <b>adjusting</b> <b>lever,</b> {{previously}} behind the pilot's head, moved under {{the instrument panel}} and the rear canopy oval side-opening replaced with a rectangular aperture.|$|E
50|$|As {{the brake}} linings wear, the shoes must travel a greater {{distance}} {{to reach the}} drum. When the distance reaches a certain point, a self-adjusting mechanism automatically reacts by adjusting the rest position of the shoes {{so that they are}} closer to the drum. Here, the <b>adjusting</b> <b>lever</b> rocks enough to advance the adjuster gear by one tooth. The adjuster has threads on it, like a bolt, so that it unscrews a little bit when it turns, lengthening to fill in the gap. When the brake shoes wear a little more, the adjuster can advance again, so it always keeps the shoes close to the drum. Typically the adjusters only operate when the vehicle is going in reverse and the brakes are engaged.|$|E
5000|$|Euro NCAP {{rating of}} 4 out of 5 stars. Their {{evaluation}} concluded [...] "the column lock, <b>adjuster</b> <b>lever</b> and bracket presented hazards {{in the knee}} impact area for the driver. These could cause high loads on his upper legs and damage to his knees." [...] The A3 also provides almost no protection to pedestrians, giving it two stars {{out of a possible}} four.|$|R
50|$|The Leica MP is Leica's {{latest film}} {{rangefinder}} camera. Unlike the preceding Leica M7, the camera has adopted many retro design features {{from the earlier}} M3. These include a M3 type metal film advance lever, knob film rewind design and M3 type frameline <b>adjust</b> <b>lever.</b> The basic classic design remains unchanged and the design for loading film from the bottom has been retained. The camera comes in various camera finishes including black chrome, black paint and silver chrome and can be further customised with Leica AG's à la carte program.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a variety of}} definitions and methods for identification, operationalization and visualization of complexity drivers. Within the last decades, complexity has increased continuously in many industries, caused by internal and external sources named complexity drivers. Identifying, analyzing and understanding complexity drivers are the first steps in developing and implementing a clear strategy to handle complexity in the company. For an effective complexity management, {{it is necessary to}} know the key drivers of complexity in a system, because they are the main <b>adjusting</b> <b>levers</b> for company’s success. Furthermore, managing a system’s complexity requires an optimum fit between internal and external complexity. Thus, complexity drivers play a significant role for complexity management and are a strategic issue for companies to be competitive.|$|R
30|$|Identifying, {{analyzing}} {{and understanding}} complexity drivers as main elements related to complexity {{are the first}} step to develop and implement a clear strategy to handle complexity [177, 255]. Without an idea of complexity drivers, {{it would be difficult to}} develop an effective complexity strategy [255]. Heydari and Dalili [116] argue that a research in complexity management needs to know what the key drivers of complexity in a system are. The management of complexity is a strategic issue for companies to be competitive [44, 177, 240]. In the study “Managing Complexity in Automotive Engineering”. Erkayhan [72] concludes that the complexity drivers are the main <b>adjusting</b> <b>levers</b> for improvements of the company’s success. Thus, complexity drivers play a significant role for complexity management, because they describe a system’s complexity and help to evaluate and handle it.|$|R
5000|$|Many enthusiasts use {{diagnostic}} {{devices such}} as laptop and hand computers running specially developed software to clear spurious faults and avoid the need for repair. Some manipulate the sensors to set the vehicle to a particular ride height at all times by <b>adjusting</b> the <b>lever</b> ratio on the height-sensing devices, or a supplementary ECU to [...] "fool" [...] the system.|$|R
50|$|Another popular string {{instrument}} is the qanoun, developed by Farabi during the Abbasids era. Legend {{has it that}} Farabi played qanoun in court and alternately made people laugh, cry, or fall asleep. The qanoun developed out of {{string instrument}}s described in inscriptions that date to the Assyrian period. It has about 26 triple-string courses, plucked {{with a piece of}} horn. The musician has the freedom to alter the pitch of individual courses from a quarter to a whole step by <b>adjusting</b> metal <b>levers.</b>|$|R

"Nay, take thy breath," [...] {{said the}} monk, tucking up {{the sleeves of}} his frock; [...] "I will try to help thee the whilst--although, our Lady pity me, I know nothing of these strange devices--not even the names. But our rule {{commands}} us to labour; there can be no harm therefore, in turning this winch--or in placing this steel-headed piece of wood opposite to the chord, (suiting his actions to his words,) nor see I aught uncanonical in <b>adjusting</b> the <b>lever</b> thus, or in touching the spring." ...|$|R
25|$|Consider {{that the}} driver has <b>adjusted</b> the {{reversing}} <b>lever</b> such that the die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the piston valve travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam. The travel of the piston valve is twice the total of lap plus lead.|$|R
50|$|By <b>adjusting</b> {{the policy}} <b>levers,</b> it is {{possible}} to clean up a polluted environment and recover from the collapse seen in the Horror scenario. However, the recovery is only temporary, after a brief time of robust growth the system again collapses, leading to endless cycles of collapse followed by recovery. Abating pollution does not alter the fundamental division of the parameters into the two sets of sustainable and unsustainable futures (Kohring, 2006).|$|R
5000|$|European {{carriers}} generally offer a [...] "business class" [...] {{consisting of}} enhanced economy seating with better service. There {{may be a}} curtain to separate business from economy class, based on demand, but the seats {{are in the same}} cabin. Some airlines such as Air France and Lufthansa use convertible seats that seat three people across in economy, or <b>adjust</b> with a <b>lever</b> to become two seats with a half seat length between them for business class use.|$|R
50|$|The major {{innovations}} {{since then}} {{have been the}} switch from friction to indexed shifting and the gradual {{increase in the number}} of gears. With friction shifting, the rider first moves the lever enough for the chain to jump to the next sprocket, and then <b>adjusts</b> the <b>lever</b> a slight amount to center the chain on that sprocket. An indexed shifter has a detent or ratchet mechanism which stops the gear lever, and hence the cable and the derailleur, after moving a specific distances with each press or pull. Indexed shifters require re-calibration when cables stretch and parts get damaged or swapped. On racing bicycles, 10-gear rear cassettes appeared in 2000, and 11-gear cassettes appeared in 2009. Most current mountain bicycles have either two or three front chainrings with single ring front setups becoming increasingly popular. Most road bicycles have two chainrings, and touring bicycles commonly have three.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{operation}} combines two motions; {{one is the}} primary lead motion which is imparted {{at the bottom of}} the combination lever (12). The secondary is the directional/amplitude motion which is imparted at the top. Consider that the driver has <b>adjusted</b> the reversing <b>lever</b> such that the die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the piston valve travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam. The travel of the piston valve is twice the total of lap plus lead.|$|R
50|$|On {{civilian}} airplanes the FE {{is positioned}} {{so that he}} or she can monitor the forward instruments, pilot selections and <b>adjust</b> the thrust <b>levers</b> located on the centre pedestal; the FE's chair can travel forward and aft and it can swivel laterally 90 degrees, which enables him or her to face forward and set the engine power, then move aft and rotate sideways to monitor and set the systems panel. The FE is the aircraft systems expert onboard and responsible for troubleshooting and suggesting solutions to in-flight emergencies and abnormal technical conditions, as well as computing takeoff and landing data. The FE's seat on modern aircraft has a complete range of motion (side to side, forward to aft, swivel, up and down) to accommodate the many positions required to monitor and operate the aircraft systems.|$|R
40|$|Probabilistic {{classifiers}} {{are introduced}} {{and it is}} shown that the only regular linear probabilistic classifier with convex risk is multinomial regression. Penalized empirical risk minimization is introduced and used to construct supervised learning methods for probabilistic classifiers. A sparse group lasso penalized approach to high dimensional multinomial classification is presented. On different real data examples {{it is found that}} this approach clearly outperforms multinomial lasso in terms of error rate and features included in the model. An efficient coordinate descent algorithm is developed and the convergence is established. This algorithm is implemented in the msgl R package. Examples of high dimensional multiclass problems are studied, in particular examples of multiclass classification based on gene expression measurements. One such example is the – clinically important – problem of identifying the primary tumor site of lever metastases, this particular problem is studied in detail. In order to <b>adjust</b> for the <b>lever</b> contamination found in biopsies of metastases a computational contamination model is develop. The contamination model is presented in a domain adaption framework and a simulation based domain adaption strategy is presented. It is shown that the presented computational contamination approac...|$|R
40|$|In 1999, a Shuttle {{crew member}} {{was unable to}} operate the {{backrest}} lever for the lightweight seat in microgravity. It is essential that crew members can <b>adjust</b> this backrest <b>lever,</b> which is titled forward during launch and then moved backward upon reaching orbit. This adjustment is needed to cushion the crew members during an inadvertent crash landing situation. JSCs Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) performed {{an evaluation of the}} seat controls and provided recommendations on whether the seat lever positions and operations should be modified. The original Shuttle seats were replaced with new lightweight seats whose controls were moved, with one control at the front and the other at the back. The ABF designed a 12 -person experiment to investigate the amount of pull force exerted by suited subjects, when controls were placed in the front and back of the lightweight seat. Each subject was asked to perform the pull test at least three times for each combination of lever position and suit pressure conditions. The results showed that, in general, the subjects were able to pull on the lever at the back position with only about half the amount of force {{that they were able to}} exert on the lever at the front position. In addition, the results also showed that subjects wearing the pressurized suit were unable to reach the seat lever when it was located at the back. The pull forces on the front lever diminished about 50 % when subjects wore pressurized suits. Based on these results from this study, it was recommended that the levers should not be located in the back position. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the levers at the front of the seat could be modified or adjusted to increase the leverage for crew members wearing pressurized launch/escape suits...|$|R
40|$|During a Shuttle {{flight in}} the early part of 1999, one of the crewmembers was unable to operate the {{backrest}} lever for the light-weight seat in microgravity. It is essential that the crewmembers are able to <b>adjust</b> this back-rest <b>lever,</b> which is titled forward 2 degrees from vertical during launch and then moved backwards to 10 degrees aft of vertical upon reaching orbit. This adjustment is needed to cushion the crewmembers during an inadvertent crash landing situation. The original Shuttle seats, which had seat controls located on the front left and right sides of the seat, were replaced recently with the new light-weight seats. The controls for these new, seats were moved to the night side with one control at the front and the other at the back. While it was uncertain whether the problem encountered was unique to that crewmember or not it was clear to the personnel responsible for maintaining the Shuttle seats that not knowing the cause of the problem posed a safety concern for NASA. Hence the Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) of the Johnson Space Center was requested to perform an evaluation of the seat controls and provide NASA with appropriate recommendations on whether the seat lever positions and operations should be modified. The ABF designed an experiment to investigate the amount of pull force exerted by subjects, wearing an unpressurized or pressurized crew launch escape suit, when controls were placed in the front and back (on the right side) of the light-weight seat. Single-axis load cells were attached to the seat levers, which measured the maximum static pull forces that were exerted by the subjects. Twelve subjects, six male and six female, participated in this study. Each subject was asked to perform the pull test at least three times for each combination of lever position and suit pressure conditions. The results from this study showed that as a whole (or in general), the subjects were able to pull on the lever at the back position with only about half the amount of force that they were able to exert on the lever at the front position. In addition, the results also showed that subjects wearing the pressurized suit were unable to reach the seat lever when it was located at the back. Furthermore, the pull forces on the front lever diminished about 50 % when subjects wore the pressurized suits. Based on these results from this study, it was recommended to NASA that the levers should not be located in the back position.
