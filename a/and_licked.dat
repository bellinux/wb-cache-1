5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails <b>and</b> <b>licked</b> their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
500|$|II [...] This {{has been}} {{suggested}} because there were historical accounts reporting that, in regards to Claudius actually accepting the food laced with the lethal poison, things did not go exactly to plan; this could imply a variety of things: Claudius might first have touched the poisoned food <b>and</b> <b>licked</b> his fingers, or might otherwise only have consumed {{a portion of the}} dose of poison needed to be lethal. Those who implicate that a second dose was required claim that he fell into a stupor, threw up, woke up, only to be administered another dose that was then lethal.|$|E
500|$|Three years later, Alexandra blamed sixteen-year-old Olga, who {{was sitting}} beside her seven-year-old brother, for failing to control the misbehaving Tsarevich Alexei during a family dinner. The spoiled Alexei teased others at the table, refused to sit up in his chair, wouldn't eat his food <b>and</b> <b>licked</b> his plate. The Tsarina's {{expectation}} was unreasonable, said Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, a distant cousin of the imperial family. [...] "Olga cannot deal with him", {{he wrote in his}} diary on March 18, 1912. Court official A. A. Mossolov wrote that Olga was already seventeen, but still [...] "she had the ways of a flapper", referring to her rough manners and liking for exuberant play.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to establish a low dose salicylate-induced tinnitus rat model and to investigate whether central or peripheral auditory system is involved in tinnitus. Methods: Lick suppression ratio (R), <b>lick</b> count <b>and</b> <b>lick</b> latency of conditioned rats in salicylate group (120 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and saline group were first compared. Bilateral auditory nerves were ablated in unconditioned rats <b>and</b> <b>lick</b> count <b>and</b> <b>lick</b> latency were compared before and after ablation. The ablation was then performed in conditioned rats <b>and</b> <b>lick</b> count <b>and</b> <b>lick</b> latency were compared between salicylate group and saline group and between ablated and unablated salicylate groups. Results: Both the R value <b>and</b> the <b>lick</b> count in salicylate group were significantly higher than those in saline group <b>and</b> <b>lick</b> latency in salicylate group was significantly shorter than that in saline group. No significant changes were observed in <b>lick</b> count <b>and</b> <b>lick</b> latency before <b>and</b> after ablation. After ablation, <b>lick</b> count <b>and</b> <b>lick</b> latency in salicylate group were significantly higher and shorter respectively than those in saline group, but they were significantly lower and longer respectively than those in unablated salicylate group. Conclusion: A low dose of salicylate (120 mg/kg) can induce tinnitus in rats and both central and peripheral auditor...|$|R

500|$|Björk premiered Biophilias songs {{during the}} Manchester International Festival with a {{residency}} {{commissioned by the}} Festival itself. The singer played in a circular stage which included custom-made instruments like computer-controlled Pendulum Harps and a Tesla Coil, an instrument called Gameleste, an hybrid between a gamelan and a celesta, and a pin Barrel organ called Sharpsichord. The stage also included a circle of projection screens. During the [...] "Mutual Core" [...] performance, the screen projected images of moving tectonic plates, which Alan Pedder of the website Wearsthetrousers likened to [...] "Jóga"'s music video, while the choir performed a sort of choreography, which included huddling at center stage during the verses and dancing during the chorus. The song was performed on every date of her Biophilia Tour. Her performance was well received by critics, which praised the whole show and project, which was called [...] "ambitious". While reviewing Björk's show at the New York Hall of Science, Will Hermes of the website PembrokeMayball stated that [...] "during 'Mutual Core', she sang of tectonic plates under a circle of projection screens illustrating the phenomena, <b>and</b> <b>licked</b> her lips after a line about how 'the Atlantic ridge drifts' like she could feel that motion tingle beneath her skin".|$|E

[...] Making his way outside, Franklin found the source of the strange sound that had {{peppered}} his building. [...] "'The side-walks were literally covered with burning turpentine balls.

2500|$|Modern {{scholars}} have debated the various details of Gildas' story. One {{topic of discussion}} has been about the words Gildas uses to describe the Saxons' subsidies (annonas, epimenia) and whether they are legal terms used in a treaty of foederati, a late Roman political practice of settling allied barbarian peoples {{within the boundaries of}} the empire to furnish troops to aid the defence of the empire. It is not known whether private individuals imitated this practice. It is also not known whether Gildas' reference to [...] "the eastern side of the island" [...] refers to Kent, East Anglia, the Kingdom of Northumbria or the entire east coast of Britain. Gildas describes how their raids took them [...] "sea to sea, heaped up by the eastern band of impious men; and as it devastated all the neighbouring cities and lands, did not cease after it had been kindled, until it burnt nearly the whole surface of the island, <b>and</b> <b>licked</b> the western ocean with its red and savage tongue" [...] (chapter 24).|$|E

2500|$|The accuser's mother, Janet Arvizo, {{testified that}} on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she [...] "saw Michael licking Gavin's head" [...] while he was asleep. Before she testified about it, {{she turned to the}} jury and said, [...] "please don't judge me." [...] Jackson {{allegedly}} had an arm around the boy <b>and</b> <b>licked</b> his hair [...] "over and over" [...] while everyone else on the plane was asleep. Janet said she didn't tell any one what she'd seen, and she continued to let her children stay at Neverland, and she later testified that at a point weeks after that incident, she still didn't have [...] "any concerns about Mr. Jackson at all". Star contradicted his mother when he testified that he had been awake to also witness Jackson lick Gavin's head on the plane; he didn't say anyone was asleep, just that the accuser was not feeling well and had leaned against Jackson's chest. Cynthia Bell, a flight attendant on that flight, said she had not seen Jackson [...] "cuddling" [...] with Arvizo during the flight, but testified that she had seen Jackson put his arm around the accuser while he was listening to music.|$|E
2500|$|Topoff and Ellen Zimmerli {{also did}} {{experiments}} {{to prove that}} the Polyergus queen [...] "tricks" [...] the Formica colony by obtaining chemicals from the Formica queen in the process of killing her. In one test, the Formica queen was killed (by flash freezing then thawing) prior to Polyergus contact. Even though it was already dead, the Polyergus queen bit, stabbed, <b>and</b> <b>licked</b> the queen just as if it were alive: and the Polyergus was consequently accepted by the colony. Another test showed that if no Formica queen was present, then Polyergus had little chance of a successful takeover. Clearly, the Formica queen is providing some sort of chemical(s) to the Polyergus queen, however unintentionally. That takeover can occur even if the host queen is dead, but not if she is not present, proves that chemical absorption is important. The Polyergus queen needs only kill one host queen to be accepted. If the colony was polygynistic, the Polyergus queen can take her time finding the other queens. [...] "Hour by hour, day by day, she methodically locates and kills every Formica queen, sometimes taking several weeks to clear out all remnants of opposition".|$|E
