5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lepiota babruzalka grow singly or {{scattered}} on the ground among decaying leaf litter <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> bamboo stands. The species has been documented only from Chelavur and Nilambur in the Kozhikode and Malappuram Districts of Kerala State. As of 2009, there are 22 Lepiota taxa (21 species and 1 variety) known from Kerala, which is recognized as a biodiversity hotspot.|$|E
5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread out <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the plant for varying distances, {{close to the}} surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these {{come into contact with}} a rooting medium.|$|E
50|$|Azotobacter chroococcum, a nitrogen-fixing bacteria, is {{probably}} concentrated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> petioles. But the bacteria do not fix nitrogen unless {{the plant is}} suffering extreme nitrogen-deficiency.|$|R
50|$|Erigeron disparipilus is a {{perennial}} herb up to 12 cm (4.8 inches) tall. Most {{of the leaves}} are generally clustered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stems. Each stem generally has only one flower head, with 30-60 white ray florets surrounding numerous yellow disc florets.|$|R
50|$|A second Double Fairlie {{from the}} same builders, also with Walschaerts valve gear, was landed at East London in 1878 and {{incorporated}} all these suggested improvements except the water capacity, which remained the same. On this locomotive, the sandboxes were located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chimneys.|$|R
5|$|Prior to opening, {{the flower}} buds are enveloped and {{protected}} {{in a thin}} dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed, and which remains wrapped <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the open flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits longitudinally. Bracteoles are small or absent.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{is formed}} by {{andesite}} and dacite rocks, with fragmentary rocks prevailing over lava flows. The rocks have typical arc-volcano chemistry and composition, with a progression from andesite to dacite in the eruption products with younger age. Potassium-argon dating has indicated an age range from 5,900,000 to 90,000 years. Subsequent erosion has generated a large debris apron <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the volcano and carved rock formations which impressed early explorers; one well-known rock formation is Neza e Sultan.|$|E
5|$|While {{the slaves}} lacked {{military}} training, Spartacus' forces displayed ingenuity {{in their use}} of available local materials, and {{in their use of}} clever, unorthodox tactics when facing the disciplined Roman armies. In response to Glaber's siege, Spartacus' men made ropes and ladders from vines and trees growing on the slopes of Vesuvius and used them to rappel down the cliffs {{on the side of the}} mountain opposite Glaber's forces. They moved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber's men.|$|E
50|$|Drassodes cupreus has a Palearctic distribution. It is {{considered}} to be generally more common than the related D. lapidosus. It occurs at ground level, under stones, in leaf-litter and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> grass tussocks, often in particularly dry sites. In the south of Great Britain, it is found in heathland.|$|R

5|$|In 1330 Sir John de Mohun {{inherited}} the castle; John, although a notable knight, was childless {{and fell into}} considerable debt. His wife Joan took over the running of their estates, and when John died in 1376 she agreed to sell the castle to Lady Elizabeth Luttrell, the leading member of another major Norman family, for 5,000 marks, with the castle to transfer to Elizabeth on Joan's death. At some point during this period additional stone buildings were constructed along the Lower Ward, {{on the side of}} the current mansion, and records suggest that a ditch, or moat, may have existed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the Tor in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Many eusauropods, {{including}} Dinheirosaurus {{have been}} found in the Late Jurassic of Europe. The sauropods are from <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the Tithonian as based on the presence of Anchispirocyclina lusitanica. One sauropod, a diplodocid currently based on an unnamed specimen including vertebrae and some bones, is clearly different from Dinheirosaurus and Losillasaurus, confirming the presence of a least two and possibly more diplodocids in the Late Jurassic of Spain and Portugal. This is unique in the variety of diplodocoids in all Europe, with the only other genera possibly non-diplodocoid (Cetiosauriscus), or classified in Rebbachisauridae. This suggests that the biogeography of primitive sauropods is incomplete, with possible primitive eusauropods and diplodocids surviving in the Late Jurassic, potentially until the Berriasian.|$|E
5|$|The guns on {{the forward}} turret roof were removed in 1911–1912 and the upper forward pair of guns in the {{superstructure}} were removed in 1913–1914. In addition, gun shields were fitted to all guns in the superstructure and the bridge structure was enlarged <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the forward tripod mast. During {{the first year of}} the war, a fire-control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house 4 four-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition a pair of three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added.|$|E

Each structure is narrow and tapers slightly as it rises. Platforms {{can be seen on}} top of the derricks. Several wooden buildings can be seen <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> derricks, and a grid of dirt roads connect the buildings...|$|R
50|$|Many desmids also secrete translucent, {{gelatinous}} mucilage from pores in {{the cell}} wall that acts a protecting agent. These pores are either, as in Micrasterias, uniformly distributed across the cell-wall but always appear to be absent {{in the region of}} the isthmus, or, in highly ornamented forms, as many genera of Cosmarium, grouped symmetrically <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spines, warts and so on with which the cell is provided.|$|R
5|$|The hairpin banksia's {{infructescence}} is {{a typical}} Banksia cone-like structure, with up to 100 crowded embedded follicles which are 1–2.4centimetres (⅓–1in) in diameter; these generally remain closed until burnt by bushfire. The nonlignotuberous subspecies cunninghamii is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, while the others regenerate from buds <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the lignotuber. Old flower spikes fade to brown, then grey with age. Old flower parts usually persist for a long time, giving the infructescence a hairy appearance. In Central and North Queensland, old cones of both var.spinulosa and var.collina are generally bare.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of shell guns and steam {{ships in the}} 1840s created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. In 1850, with {{the closure of the}} prison, seven 8-inch (22.3 cm) guns were mounted along the walls in brick emplacements, but there were concerns about the defences and two earthwork auxiliary batteries were built just alongside the castle to house additional guns. In 1856, {{at the end of the}} Crimean War, there was a large review of the fleet along the Solent, attended by Queen Victoria and numerous tourists. Naval gunboats launched a mock attack on the castle, which responded by firing a volley of forty 8-inch guns, causing chaos among the crowds watching <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the fortification.|$|E
5|$|The last of {{the bronze}} reliefs on the column's {{pedestals}} was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although {{part of the original}} design, were only added in 1867. Each lion weighs seven tons. A hoarding remained <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place. Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the London Zoo to be brought to his studio. He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to decompose and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.|$|E

25|$|The first citrus grove {{was planted}} by Zalman Minkov in 1904. Minkov's grove, {{surrounded}} by a wall, included a guard house, stables, a packing plant, and an irrigation system in which groundwater was pumped from a large well in the inner courtyard. The well was 23 meters deep, the height of an eight-story building, and over six meters in diameter. The water was channeled via an aqueduct to an irrigation pool, {{and from there to}} a network <b>of</b> ditches dug <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees.|$|R

To the southeast of Lindley Mountain, Arden Valley Road turns east and into the park. Arden Valley Road passes Lake Cohasset and Upper Lake Cohasset as it heads eastward. The road intersects with the Long Path and RamapoDunderbergAppalachian Trails soon afterward. Bradley Mine is visible to the left, and Arden Valley Road {{comes to an end}} at Tiorati Circle., where the road continues eastward as Tiorati Brook Road.|$|E
5|$|To evade enemy {{detection}} and interception efforts, the Victor was outfitted with an extensive electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite which were {{operated by the}} air electronics officer (AEO), who had primary responsibility for the aircraft's electronics and communication systems. The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar {{in the vicinity of}} the aircraft, and to provide situational awareness for the crew. Enemy communications could also be jammed, and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective. The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of the bailey are the remains of the Norman chapel, which {{comprised}} a nave, a square tower and an apsidal chancel, 12.7 metres by 6 metres (42ft by 20ft), 4 metres square (13ft square) and 4.6 metres by 4 metres (15ft by 13ft) respectively. It was built from local grey sandstone, and Roman tiles from one of the nearby villas were used to construct its roof and incorporated into the walls. Originally the tower would have had a church bell, and the casting pit for this is buried under the floor of the nave. A stone bench runs <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the walls, and in the 19th century there was also a stone base for a font in the nave, but this has since been lost. A piece of early medieval graffiti, possibly depicting a Norman soldier, has survived on the south exterior wall. A fireplace was added to the chapel during the Tudor period, although this was only in use for a few years before being abandoned.|$|E
40|$|The fuel {{structure}} and flammability of fire-resilient subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) stands in Washington were studied in 1987 {{to determine the}} relation between these forests and fire; for comparison, fuel patterns were also studied in fire-stable ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands. It {{has long been known}} that subalpine fir forests burn catastrophically, but the contributions of fuel {{structure and}} fuel moisture to this pattern of burning have been relatively unstudied. The two main findings of the study were as follows: (1) {{more than twice as much}} fuel in subalpine fir forests accumulated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fir trees than in the forest as a whole, and the many dead branches on the lower boles may allow fire to travel up into the canopy; (2) the fuels in subalpine fir forests were more flammable at the end of the summer than at the beginning, with maximum flammability in early August when the fuel moisture content was 16 - 22 %. The fuel structure of subalpine fir was shown to be different from that of fire-stable ponderosa pine forests: <b>the</b> fuel <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees in ponderosa pine forests was not significantly different from that in the entire forest, and there were few branches on the lower boles...|$|R

50|$|Mathematics and {{architecture}} are related, since, {{as with other}} arts, architects use mathematics for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering buildings, architects use geometry: to define the spatial form of a building; from the Pythagoreans of the sixth century BC onwards, to create forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, aesthetic and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as tessellations; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> tall buildings.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the growth}} of phylogenetic studies in the 1980s, Coelurus has usually {{been found to be}} a coelurosaurian of {{uncertain}} affinities, not fitting with the better-known clades of the Cretaceous. Along with several other generalized coelurosaurians such as the compsognathids, Ornitholestes, and Proceratosaurus, it has had multiple placements <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Coelurosauria. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut (2003) and Smith et al. (2007) found that Coelurus was more closely related to compsognathids than to other coelurosaurs. Oliver Rauhut (2003) proposed that Coeluridae was composed of Coelurus plus the compsognathids, but he and others have not since found the compsognathids to group with Coelurus. However, a work published by Phil Senter in 2007 following the description of Tanycolagreus found it and Coelurus to be closely related at the base of Tyrannosauroidea. Senter proposed that Coelurus and Tanycolagreus were the only coelurids and were actually tyrannosauroids, but the phylogenetic analysis of Turner et al. (2007b) found that Coelurus was a basal coelurosaur, although more derived than the tyrannosaurids. Zanno in 2010 recovered Coelurus as a basal maniraptoran. Coelurus is sometimes put into its own family, Coeluridae, although the membership of the family has not been stable.|$|E
5|$|The Mourning Parents, {{one male}} and one female figure, are {{reclining}} {{on either side}} of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the temple}} is a Shaiva shrine, it {{contains}} {{the images of}} numerous Shakta deities as Parsvadevatas sculpted on its walls. The temple is the first among Bhubaneswar temples to contain Saptamatrika images, a group of seven goddesses. These images are located in between representations of Ganesha and Virabhadra. Except for Ganesha, all other images are depicted with their respective vahanas (vehicles). An eight-armed dancing Ardhanarishvara, an image of Siva-Parvati and the images of Ganga and Yamuna are also found {{on the wall of}} the temple. There are also images of Vishnu, Indra, Surya and Yama in the rectangular niches <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the porch. A sculpture of Kartikeya riding on his peacock vehicle is present on the southern wall. Other noteworthy carvings are those of Shiva subduing the demon-king Ravana, who is seen trying to uproot Mount Kailasa, the abode of Shiva. Shiva is sculpted as Nataraja in various tandavas (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Orissa temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs. A floral motif trailing from the tail of a bird is common between this temple and the ones in Vaital Deula, while a motif of vase and flowers is common between it and the ones in Mukteshvara Temple.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle layer}} of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is the cardiac muscle – a layer of {{involuntary}} striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral <b>around</b> <b>the</b> chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern <b>around</b> <b>the</b> atria and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great vessels, and inner muscles formining a figure 8 <b>around</b> <b>the</b> two ventricles and proceed toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.|$|R

50|$|The {{balustrade}} {{itself is}} of limestone ashlar masonry and concrete construction. The central bay houses a vaulted hemicycle niche containing a drinking fountain. The upper {{portion of the}} balustrade leads to the Promenade. A bandstand was located {{along the top of}} the balustrade on the Promenade, but it was removed because of its deteriorated condition in 1958. By the early 1970s curbs and paving at the old main entrance constructed in the 1890s had been changed and Holly trees were planted to border the entryway. <b>The</b> areas <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stone pillars, originally paved, were grass-covered by that time.|$|R
