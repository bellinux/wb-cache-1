5|$|While still a schoolboy, Massenet was {{admitted}} to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became {{best known for his}} operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works {{in a wide variety of}} styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{believed}} that his campaigns were only a token measure and that Roman rule over the Balkans collapsed immediately after his overthrow in 602, Maurice was in fact {{well on his way to}} forestalling the Slavic landfall on the Balkans, nearly preserving the order of Late Antiquity there. His success was only undone over ten years after his overthrow. Retrospectively, these campaigns were the last in the series of classical Roman campaigns against the Barbarians on the Rhine and Danube, effectively delaying Slavic landfall on the Balkans by two decades. With respect to the Slavs, these campaigns had the typical trait of Roman campaigns against unorganized tribes <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we now call asymmetric warfare.|$|E

[...] Director Aram Avakian's loose {{adaptation}} [...] (1970) stars James Earl Jones, Stacy Keach and Harris Yulin in their earliest feature roles. [...] Graphic scenes earned the film an X rating, {{such as those of}} the botched abortion <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Barth calls a [...] "man rapes chicken" [...] scene not found in the book. [...] Barth and critics widely panned the movie; Barth wrote disdainfully about it in the introduction to the 1988 single-volume edition of The Floating Opera and The End of the Road. [...] Academics Ken Pellow and Rita Hug opined that the linguistic, literary and philosophical aspects of the book made it difficult to adapt; they argued that Jake Horner's frequent speaking to the reader is key to the book's effectiveness but does not lend itself to film.|$|E

[...] In response, Pinter praised France's opposition to the war in Iraq. [...] M. de Villepin concluded: [...] "The poet stands still and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live." [...] He said that Pinter received the award particularly [...] "because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [...] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is truly universal". Lawrence Pollard observed that [...] "the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".|$|E

Each trichotomy is divided {{according to the}} phenomenological category involved: Firstness (quality of feeling, essentially monadic), secondness (reaction or resistance, essentially dyadic), or thirdness (representation or mediation, essentially triadic).|$|E
