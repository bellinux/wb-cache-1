5|$|<b>American</b> <b>Express</b> {{had been}} in discussions to {{potentially}} live stream Lady Gaga's performance during Sunday's ArtRave event. <b>American</b> <b>Express</b> decided not {{to proceed with the}} live stream because of an inability to reach a mutual agreement on the production of the event. However, <b>American</b> <b>Express</b> honored its commitments to Lady Gaga and her team, and the event was able to proceed without an official role for <b>American</b> <b>Express.</b> Lady Gaga is an incredible artist and we hope to work together in the future.|$|E

He played occasional matches for the IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979. Chamberlain promoted the sport so effectively that he was named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame: {{he became one of the}} few athletes who were enshrined in different sports.|$|E
