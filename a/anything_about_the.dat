5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does {{not have anything to}} say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E
5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link is based on the interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E

5|$|The December 1964 South Vietnamese coup {{took place}} before dawn on December 19, 1964, when the ruling {{military}} junta of South Vietnam led by General Nguyễn Khánh dissolved the High National Council (HNC) and arrested {{some of its}} members. The HNC was an unelected legislative-style civilian advisory body they had created {{at the request of}} the United States—South Vietnam's main sponsor—to give a veneer of civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including Khánh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable to do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fait accompli that had been handed to them, because they strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Khánh. At the time, Khánh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal.|$|E
25|$|In February 2016, Olivia Colman gave an {{interview}} on This Morning where she stated that series 3 would be shot in May 2016, {{and said that she}} did not yet know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> plot.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{publication}} of 1Q84, Murakami stated {{that he would not}} reveal <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> book, following criticism that leaks had diminished the novelty of his previous books. 1Q84 was noted for heavy advance orders despite this secrecy.|$|E

25|$|Lula da Silva claimed on Brazilian public {{television}} {{that he did}} not know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> scandals. He also said that people who did not agree with paying a tax for each check issued and/or financial transaction were people who illegally failed to pay their income tax.|$|E
25|$|On 28 May 2008, Edward Tarletski was {{attacked}} again by three youths in Minsk. Tarletski {{stated that he}} did not intend to report the attack to police because they would not do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> incident. He also said this attack was the third against him in five years.|$|E

25|$|In a 2008 report, Greenpeace notes dolphin-safe labels {{may make}} {{consumers}} believe the relevant tuna is environmentally friendly. However, the dolphin-safe label only indicates the by-catch contained no dolphins. It does not specify that the by-catch contained no other species, {{nor does it}} imply <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> environmental impact of the hunt itself.|$|E
25|$|The main {{factor that}} {{encourages}} cyber bullying {{is the fact}} that a cyber bully can hide behind the shield of online anonymity. In other words, social media magnifies the face-to-face social space into a virtual space where a cyber bully can say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> victims without the pressure of facing them.|$|E
25|$|In this example, simple logic tells {{that there}} is a difference: while the first {{statement}} may be true, it does not assert <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> truth of the matter stated. The witness may have told the officer that the truck was blue, but that {{may not have been the}} truth; he might have been mistaken or lying.|$|E

25|$|A {{delivery}} or ball in cricket {{is analogous}} to a pitch in baseball. The word ball in cricket usage does not imply <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of the delivery, unlike baseball's usage of ball to indicate a pitch outside the strike zone. The cricket equivalent of a baseball ball is a wide or a no ball.|$|E
25|$|In February 2006, Reyat {{was charged}} with perjury with regard to his {{testimony}} in the trial. The indictment was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and lists 27 instances in which Reyat allegedly misled the court during his testimony. Reyat had pleaded guilty to constructing the bomb, but denied under oath that he knew <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|Hip-hop {{has also}} adopted and then {{transformed}} traditional or “old world” luxury symbols {{and made them}} modern-day, “cool” commodities. Rapper LL Cool J (Todd Smith) wore a Kangol hat back in the 1980s, when few Americans knew <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> European hat maker—but its association with hip hop would invigorate the brand. In 2003, London-based Kangol even acknowledged the popularity given its sixty-year-old brand by a young LL Cool J in 1983.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} two weeks, the Little Rock Nine stayed home to study {{instead of going to}} the Little Rock Central High School. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was {{reluctant}} to do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mob or the rioting. Eisenhower summoned Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas to intervene and asked for the withdrawal of all troops from the High School after Elizabeth Eckford’s experience attempting to enter the school the first time.|$|E
25|$|Aeschylus {{was one of}} many Greeks {{who were}} {{initiated}} into the Eleusinian Mysteries, an ancient cult of Demeter based in his hometown of Eleusis. Initiates gained secret knowledge through these rites, likely concerning the afterlife. Firm details of specific rites are sparse, as members were sworn under the penalty of death not to reveal <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Mysteries to non-initiates. Nevertheless, according to Aristotle, Aeschylus was accused of revealing some of the cult's secrets on stage.|$|E
25|$|Phelps finally set out {{to return}} to Cairo, passing Commander Henry Walke and the USS Carondelet who had been ordered by General Grant to wait for Phelps’ gunboats and then {{together}} proceed towards Fort Donelson. However, when Walke ordered Phelps to proceed to the next fort with him, Phelps refused, having already received a message to rendezvous with Commander Foote at Cario. Walke felt that Phelps refusal amounted to “insubordination” but Foote never said <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> disagreement.|$|E
