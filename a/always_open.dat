5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} {{drive was}} one of the best in Hollywood. For publicity she gave up all privacy, keeping her doors <b>always</b> <b>open</b> to photographers. In 1954, the day before Christmas she walked into publicist James Byron's office with a gift and asked him to supervise her publicity. From that time till the end of 1961, Byron shaped much of her publicity. Byron appointed most people in her team— William Shiffrin (press agent), Greg Bautzer (attorney) and Charles Goldring (business manager), and constantly planted bits of publicity material in the media. She appeared in about 2,500 newspaper photographs between September 1956 and May 1957, and had about 122,000 lines of newspaper copy written about her during this time.|$|E
5|$|In Toronto, {{engineers}} and surveyors were examining the four-lane bypass, while planners set about designing {{a way to}} handle the commuter highway. In 1963, transportation minister Charles MacNaughton announced the widening of Highway401 in Toronto from four to a minimum of 12lanes between Islington Avenue and Markham Road. The design {{was taken from the}} Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago, which was widened into a similar configuration around the same time. Construction began immediately. While the plan initially called for construction to end in 1967, it continued for nearly a decade. At least four lanes were <b>always</b> <b>open</b> during the large reconstruction project, which included complex new interchanges at Highway27, Highway400, the planned Spadina Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway. The system was completed in 1972, along with the Highway27 (renamed Highway427) bypass between the QEW and Pearson Airport. Most of the interchanges in Toronto were reconstructed as partial cloverleafs and a continuous lighting system was installed.|$|E

Music has <b>always</b> <b>opened</b> my mind—and that's what we want".|$|R

25|$|According to Jewish teachings, hell is {{not entirely}} physical; rather, it can be {{compared}} to a very intense feeling of shame. People are ashamed of their misdeeds and this constitutes suffering which makes up for the bad deeds. When one has so deviated from the will of God, one is said to be in Gehinnom. This is not meant to refer to some point in the future, but to the very present moment. The gates of teshuva (return) are said to be <b>always</b> <b>open,</b> and so one can align his will with that of God at any moment. Being out of alignment with God's will is itself a punishment according to the Torah.|$|E

25|$|The {{enlargement}} of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction of the diaphragm, and its two horizontal dimensions by {{the lifting of the}} front and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall. The lungs' interiors are open to the outside air, and being elastic, therefore expand to fill the increased space. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the respiratory airways (Fig. 2). In health these airways (starting at the nose or mouth, and ending in the microscopic dead-end sacs called alveoli) are <b>always</b> <b>open,</b> though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The alveolar air pressure is therefore always close to atmospheric air pressure (about 100kPa at sea level) at rest, with the pressure gradients that cause air to move {{in and out of the}} lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2–3kPa.|$|E

However, the statement of the problem as posed in her column is ambiguous. The answer depends on what strategy the host is following. If [...] the host operates under a strategy of only offering a switch if the initial guess is correct, it would clearly be disadvantageous to accept the offer. If the host merely selects a door at random, the question is likewise {{very different from the}} standard version.
