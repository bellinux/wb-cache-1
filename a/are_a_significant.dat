5|$|Birds <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{hazard to}} aircraft, {{but it is}} {{difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E

The pasty has become strongly associated with all cultures in this area, and in the similar Iron Range in northern Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|Other {{visitors}} {{stayed to}} prospect for and mine deposits of copper, gold, lead, and silver. These sporadic mining ventures were hampered by their remote location and the harsh desert environment. In December 1903, two men from Ballarat were prospecting for silver. One was an out-of-work Irish miner named Jack Keane {{and the other}} was a one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren. Quite by accident, Keane discovered an immense ledge of free-milling gold by the duo's work site and named the claim the Keane Wonder Mine. This started a minor and short-lived gold rush into the area. The Keane Wonder Mine, along with mines at Rhyolite, Skidoo and Harrisburg, were the only ones to extract enough metal ore to make them worthwhile. Outright shams such as Leadfield also occurred, but most ventures quickly ended after a short series of prospecting mines failed to yield evidence of significant ore (these mines now dot the entire area and <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> hazard to anyone who enters them). The boom towns which sprang up around these mines flourished during the 1900s (decade) but soon declined after the Panic of 1907.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between freshmen retention and selected student services in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). A review of literature revealed that student 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of student services are related to student 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the academic and social systems of the college, which are closely and strongly linked to student retention. The results from this study will help student services 2 ̆ 7 administrators to effectively lead HBCUs in their retention efforts. This study utilized quantitative methods to determine the relationships between freshmen retention and student services. Questionnaires were administered to 2000 students enrolled in freshmen orientation classes at the sampled institutions, 1014 were returned correctly. The dependent and independent variables were analyzed using Pearson Correlation coefficient and Multiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) statistical tools. The 0. 05 level of significance was used to test the null hypotheses. The following are the findings of this study: 1. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between freshmen retention and enrollment management. 2.

For the 2009–10 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 34,215 for Premier League matches {{with a total}} {{aggregate}} attendance figure of 13,001,616. This represents an increase of 13,089 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the league's first season (1992–93).

5|$|The diet of the {{macaroni}} penguin {{consists of}} a variety of crustaceans, squid and fish, although the proportions that each makes up vary with locality and season. Krill, particularly Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), account for over 90% of food during breeding season. Cephalopods and small fish such as the marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii), painted notie (Lepidonotothen larseni), Champsocephalus gunneri, the lanternfish species Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum tenisoni and P. normani become more important during chick-rearing. Like several other penguin species, the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small (10– to 30-mm-diameter) stones; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep-sea diving, or to help grind food, especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans which <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> part of its diet.|$|E
