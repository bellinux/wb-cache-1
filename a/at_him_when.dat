5|$|During {{the hunting}} trip, Jimbo proclaims Kenny his honorary nephew, {{upsetting}} Stan. When night falls, Cartman {{tells the story}} of Scuzzlebutt, a creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of its hands and Patrick Duffy for a leg. The boys are skeptical, so Cartman decides to dress up as the creature the next morning in order to convince and scare them. When he disappears the next morning, the others set out to find him. They then see Cartman disguised as Scuzzlebutt and start shooting <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> they catch up with Cartman {{at the base of the}} mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes. However, he is unable to do so and the delay gives Cartman time to remove the costume. At a lower elevation, Randy orders the South Park residents to dig a trench to divert the lava away from the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker. In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker, but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After Conker briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>when</b> suddenly the entire game freezes. Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{remained}} a stalemate until a miner from San Miguel de Allende devised {{a way to}} approach the building’s main entrance. This miner, who name was Juan José de los Reyes Martínez, is better known as El Pípila, who had joined the insurgent army as it passed through his hometown. El Pípila’s strapped a large flat stone over his back and carrying a flask of tar and a torch, crawled towards the main entrance. The stone protected him from the bullets fired <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> he reached the heavy wooden door of the entrance, he smeared it with tar and lit it. This allowed insurgents to then take the building.|$|E
60|$|Ovid looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{steadily}}, <b>when</b> he {{uttered the}} last word. Benjulia looked back, just as steadily at Ovid.|$|R
60|$|When he awakened {{next morning}} Allonby was already about, and looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously <b>when</b> he {{endeavored}} {{to reopen the}} subject.|$|R
60|$|Andrew {{noticed that}} Frobisher glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> keenly <b>when</b> {{he heard his}} name, but he started the engine and ran the launch alongside.|$|R
25|$|Tahmasp {{was the son}} of Shah Ismail I and Shah-Begi Khanum (known {{under the}} title Tajlu Khanum) of the Turcoman Mawsillu tribe. He was only 10 years old when he succeeded his father Shah Ismail, the founder of Safavid rule in Iran. Too young to rule in his own right, Tahmasp came {{under the control of the}} Qizilbash. Some of the tribes {{recognised}} a Qizilbash leader, Div Sultan Rumlu, as regent (atabeg) to the shah, but others dissented and in 1526 a bloody civil war broke out among the differing factions. Div Sultan emerged victorious but his ally, Chuha Sultan Takkalu, turned against him and urged the shah to get rid of him. On 5 July 1527 as Div Sultan arrived for a meeting of the government, Tahmasp shot an arrow <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> it failed to kill him, the shah's supporters finished him off.|$|E
500|$|After meeting Brian, they recruit {{him to be}} a contestant. He signs up for {{the free}} martinis and food, but ends up falling in love with the reality starlet, Brooke Roberts. Quagmire and Brian are the final two contestants on The Bachelorette. Brooke's visits to the Griffin house is catastrophic, but not nearly as bad as the dinner she had with Quagmire and his mom. Brian wins her heart and the final rose, but when the cameras are turned off, Brooke tells Brian that it was nice [...] "working with him", and it is {{apparent}} that the show really is scripted, as Brian thought. Brian quickly becomes obsessed with Brooke and leaves several messages on her answering machine, even though she never gets back to him. Brooke gets angry at Brian for stalking her and throws her telephone <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he attempts to serenade her outside her apartment. Brian is upset that he became the very thing he was mocking in the beginning.|$|E
500|$|The Pawnee council decides it {{will replace}} the town hall's [...] "Spirit of Pawnee" [...] mural, which has been {{repeatedly}} vandalized because of its racist overtones. When each Pawnee department is asked to propose a new mural, Leslie (Amy Poehler) becomes determined for the parks department to win, especially after she is taunted by [...] "Sewage" [...] Joe (Kirk Fox) in the sewer department. Everyone in the parks department is told {{to come up with}} a possible mural. Tom (Aziz Ansari) pays a local artist (Doug Anthony Jones) to make a painting for him, and he is initially unsatisfied with the result, a colorful abstract painting. When presenting it to the staff, however, he suddenly experiences his first emotional reaction to a work of art. Ann (Rashida Jones), who acknowledges a lack of creative talent, presents a rendering of a park that is widely panned by the others. April (Aubrey Plaza) presents a dark and bizarre piece made of garbage she found in a dumpster. Donna (Retta) presents a version of The Last Supper with famous people from Indiana. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) presents a beautiful pointillist photomosaic of city hall, but everyone laughs <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he accidentally calls his mural a [...] "murinal". Leslie proposes a picture of a historic Pawnee bakery fire, which she thinks will win because it is dark and depressing.|$|E
60|$|They went up, and Jefferson looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> keenly <b>when</b> {{they stood}} on deck; in fact, {{as he had}} done when Austin first clambered, half naked, out of the hatch.|$|R
60|$|She stared <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> but <b>when</b> he {{gave her}} a shove she {{realized}} what he was saying, and made such a spurt as had never before been seen in that dooryard.|$|R
60|$|The {{next time}} he called upon Miss Mydas there was no dog to bark <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>when</b> the young lady saw him {{she fell in love}} with his beauty at once.|$|R
2500|$|At Indianapolis {{later in}} summer 2002, Busch was racing {{in the top}} ten. He aggressively passed Spencer on lap 37. In reply Spencer {{deliberately}} tapped Busch who then crashed into the turn 3 wall. Busch climbed out of his demolished car and until paramedics came, whenever he saw Spencer driving by him under caution, he pointed at Spencer and repeatedly shouted <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> interviewed Kurt called Jimmy Spencer a [...] "decrepit old has-been or maybe I should say a never-was." [...] Spencer replied [...] "Kurt {{has a lot to}} learn, and some of that is to control his mouth".|$|E
2500|$|On 12 November 2012, it was {{announced}} that Breakfast would end on 30 November 2012. The axing was part of the network's wider budget cuts which saw more than 100 staff lose their jobs from various Ten News roles. [...] A newspaper said other staff at the network resented Henry, claiming many wouldn't look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he walked in the room, and were planning to boycott the Christmas party. Despite the show's axing, Ten has shown interest in developing a new breakfast program of a similar style to launch sometime in 2013. It will be fronted by a brand new hosting team. Former Sunrise producer Adam Boland has been signed to produce the new program.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 July 2006, Arsenal {{vice-chairman}} David Dein {{confirmed that}} Arsenal and Chelsea {{had been in}} [...] "civil talks" [...] about the player. Chelsea insisted they would not raise their £16million bid for Cole, but Arsenal held out for at a higher valuation of £25million. Negotiations continued throughout August and looked to be heading for deadlock, but eventually Cole signed for Chelsea on 31 August for a fee of £5million, with William Gallas being transferred from Chelsea to Arsenal {{as part of the}} same deal. The deal was closed after the transfer window had officially ended, and was not confirmed until {{an hour and a half}} after the deadline had passed. The move angered Arsenal fans, who dubbed him [...] "Cashley" [...] and waved fake £20 notes with Cole's face on them <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> the two clubs faced each other on 10 December 2006.|$|E
60|$|Seaforth {{also talked}} a good deal, and Miss Townshead smiled {{now and then}} <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> but <b>when</b> she went {{with them to the}} door he lingered a moment because he felt her eyes were on him.|$|R
60|$|He {{held her}} hand a moment and swung {{abruptly}} away. He met Mrs. Acton as he went down a corridor. He {{stopped in front of}} her, and she looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> questioningly <b>when</b> she saw his face.|$|R
60|$|Dick looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> without answering. <b>When</b> Robert {{had gone}} on to the balcony, he flung himself wearily in a chair.|$|R
2500|$|In July 2008, Newsweek {{reported}} that {{a day or two}} before the shooting, King walked onto the basketball court {{in the middle of a}} game and asked McInerney to be his Valentine in front of the team members who then made fun of McInerney. Just after lunchtime on February 11, King passed McInerney in a corridor and called out, [...] "Love you, baby." [...] Later that day King was seen [...] "parading" [...] back and forth in high-heeled boots and makeup in front of McInerney. According to a teacher, a group of boys were laughing at McInerney who was getting visibly upset and assistant principal Joy Epstein, noticing McInerney's reaction, wagged her finger <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> McInerney endured teasing because of the incident, he attempted to recruit other students to assault King but no one expressed interest. He then told one of King's friends to say goodbye to him [...] "because she would never see him [...] again".|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{learning}} of his death, Dahmer's mother Joyce Flint responded angrily to the media: [...] "Now is everybody happy? Now that he's bludgeoned to death, {{is that good}} enough for everyone?" [...] The response of the families of Dahmer's victims was mixed, although it appears most were pleased with his death. The district attorney who prosecuted Dahmer cautioned against turning Scarver into a folk hero, noting that Dahmer's death was still murder. On May 15, 1995, Scarver was sentenced to two additional terms of life imprisonment for the murders of Dahmer and Anderson. Although Scarver had confessed in 1994 to having concealed the weapon used to kill Dahmer and Anderson in his clothing {{on the morning of}} the murders, in 2015 he publicly stated the murders of Dahmer and Anderson had resulted from a confrontation in which one of the two men had poked him (Scarver) in the back as the three had begun their assigned work detail. In this renewed account of events, Scarver claimed that the two had laughed <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he had turned around in response before Dahmer and Anderson each walked to separate rooms to begin their cleaning duty, with Scarver following Dahmer toward the staff locker room.|$|E
60|$|She seized {{his hand}} and smiled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he drew her up beside him.|$|E
6000|$|Leslie {{went without}} further protest, and Shackleby looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{significantly}} <b>when</b> the booking-clerk said, [...] "If I remember right, Mrs. Leslie bought {{a ticket for}} Thompson's. It's a flag station {{at the head of}} the new road that's to be driven into the Orchard Valley." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{gathered}} up her dress from the floor, and hurried away to her room--without looking back <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as usual <b>when</b> {{she opened the}} door.|$|R
60|$|The great man, {{massive and}} benignant, {{had been looking}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> thoughtfully; <b>when</b> he broke the short silence it was to remark that {{concessions}} flew about thick in the air of Costaguana. Any simple soul that just yearned {{to be taken in}} could bring down a concession at the first shot.|$|R
60|$|A pert-looking maid {{answered}} Jordan's ring, {{and stared}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> {{he asked for}} Miss Burnett.|$|E
60|$|Sir Oliver stared long <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he had done, {{then his}} lips {{tightened}} and he smote his brow.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would come back in time! You are safe now. I have done it! I would never, never have let him--" [...] Her voice died out, while her eyes shone <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as <b>when</b> the sun breaks through a mist. [...] "Never get it back. Oh, my beloved!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{went out}} and Jim sat down again, looking {{straight}} in front, with knitted brows. He {{did not know how}} long he mused, but he got up abruptly when Carrie came in. She glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously <b>when</b> he indicated a chair, and for a few moments he stood opposite, irresolute and frowning. Then he gave her Evelyn's note.|$|R
60|$|One day, however, after I {{had been}} there {{a little over a}} week, against which time he was able to lie in a rude hammock, which I had slung {{up in front of the}} door, he asked me of a sudden if any of his cronies had lent a hand <b>at</b> nursing <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he was sick, and I told him no.|$|R
60|$|I looked <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>when</b> he {{made this}} amazing assertion, with a {{momentary}} doubt of his being in earnest. Doctor Wybrow understood me.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not move}} {{and there was no}} flicker of emotion on her face, but she did not look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> she answered.|$|E
60|$|The other growled, and {{was about}} to aim a blow <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> his son threw himself upon him and besought him to be calm.|$|E
60|$|The farmer's wife {{walked out}} in front of the house into the wind, calling Franco to follow. She then {{attempted}} to drive him along the road, much as Jonas had done. She brandished her stick <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and, <b>when</b> she had succeeded in getting him as far from her as she could, by stern and threatening language, in order to drive him farther, she threw the stick <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with all her force.|$|R
60|$|Peter Rabbit fidgeted uneasily. It {{seemed to}} him that Grandfather Frog had looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> very hard <b>when</b> he said this. But Grandfather Frog just cleared his throat and went on with his story.|$|R
