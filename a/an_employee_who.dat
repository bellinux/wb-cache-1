Later that year it started providing on-site daycare {{in order to}} keep <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>who</b> was planning on being a stay-at-home mom. By 1984, SAS had begun building a fitness center, medical center, on-site cafe and other facilities. It had also developed some of its other benefits programs. SAS became known as a good place to work and was frequently recognized by national magazines like BusinessWeek, Working Mother and Fortune for its work environment.|$|E
5|$|A copy of {{the film}} leaked onto {{peer-to-peer}} file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped workprint, suggesting it {{may have come from}} within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening. Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a {{copy of the}} film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by <b>an</b> <b>employee,</b> <b>who</b> later pleaded guilty to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.|$|E

Scully, fearful {{that he is a}} Super Soldier pursuing Mulder, chases after the train with Doggett and Reyes. <b>An</b> <b>employee</b> <b>who</b> works for the train gets a call on his radio, saying that someone jumped off a train and into a rock quarry. Doggett and Reyes chase after someone they believe to be Mulder, while Scully goes deeper into the quarry. There, she is attacked by the Shadow Man. Suddenly, the Shadow Man is destroyed by the magnetite being mined from the quarry.|$|E
5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's precedent in this area holds it is unconstitutional for a government agency to discipline <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> (<b>who</b> does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, as long as that activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{investigates the}} airbag on Skinner's car, {{which was the}} one used to hit Sharon. Scully defends Skinner to the Office of Professional Responsibility, but it does no good and he is fired. Mulder {{believes}} this was done to weaken the X-Files. Mulder, {{with the help of}} Agent Pendrell finds a face imprint in the airbag which is not Skinner's. He goes to see the prostitute's boss again but discovers that she has been murdered. The agents hope to use Judy, <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>who</b> saw the man who actually hired the prostitute and use her to set up another meeting with him. They agree to meet at the Ambassador Hotel in an hour. Skinner goes to see his wife, telling her why he could not sign the divorce papers. An alarm on Sharon's vital sign monitor starts sounding, but as Skinner is about to run for help, the old woman once again takes the place of Sharon, beckoning him to come closer. As Skinner leans in, he sees his wife again, now awakened from the coma; she says something inaudible to him.|$|E

25|$|In India, {{the case}} of Vishakha and others v State of Rajasthan in 1997 has been {{credited}} with establishing sexual harassment as illegal.

25|$|The way {{to enforce}} a claim for unfair {{dismissal}} is at an employment tribunal. <b>An</b> <b>employee</b> <b>who</b> is dismissed may also have breach of contract claim(s), based on common law.

25|$|An {{important}} physical {{control that}} is frequently overlooked is {{the separation of}} duties, which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself. For example: <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>who</b> submits a request for reimbursement should not {{also be able to}} authorize payment or print the check. An applications programmer should not also be the server administrator or the database administrator – these roles and responsibilities must be separated from one another.|$|E

25|$|This {{situation}} has been {{complicated by the}} most recent revision of the Holidays Act. The holiday is Mondayised only if the employee would not usually work on weekends. For example, an office worker who works only Monday to Friday would get to the Statutory holidays on the Monday (or Tuesday for days that fell on Sundays). But <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>who</b> usually worked Saturdays would not get the Monday holiday as they did not work on the Saturday.|$|E
25|$|Underlying Mr Barker's {{claim is}} that the Commonwealth Bank was wrong to dismiss him in breach of its policies. There are {{numerous}} difficulties facing <b>an</b> <b>employee</b> <b>who</b> believes they were wrongfully dismissed. At common law the employee {{had no right to}} be given a reason for the dismissal. If the employer dismissed an employee without notice, a court would scrutinise whether the employee's conduct justified summary dismissal. Even if the contract does not specify a period of notice, a term is implied that either party could bring the contract of employment to an end by giving a reasonable period of notice.|$|E
