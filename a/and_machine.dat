In the 1960s, urban-dwelling Vietnamese with lower education backgrounds also worked as mechanics in car repair <b>and</b> <b>machine</b> shops owned by Chinese businessmen. Vietnamese immigrants that settled in the countryside worked as fishermen along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong river, and also as rubber plantation workers in Kampong Cham and Kratie provinces.|$|E

FRELIMO militants were able to evade pursuit and surveillance by employing classic guerrilla tactics: ambushing patrols, sabotaging communication and railroad lines, and making hit-and-run attacks against colonial outposts before rapidly fading into accessible backwater areas. The insurgents were typically armed with rifles <b>and</b> <b>machine</b> pistols, and the attackers took full advantage of the monsoon season in order to evade pursuit.|$|E
