50|$|The <b>axial</b> <b>expansion</b> joint absorbs {{movement}} in an axial direction. Standard connectors of the <b>axial</b> <b>expansion</b> joint are welded ends, fixed flanges and loose flanges. <b>Axial</b> <b>expansion</b> joints are often {{equipped with a}} guiding tube {{on the inside of}} the metal bellows. This reduces the flow resistance and prevents damage caused by direct contact with the flowing medium. <b>Axial</b> <b>expansion</b> joints, which can absorb large movements, frequently consist of two metal bellows and an inside or outside sleeve that protects against buckling under internal pressure. For small nominal diameters, protective tubes prevent mechanical damage during installation and operation. <b>Axial</b> <b>expansion</b> joints are suitable for internal and external overpressure. If pressure is applied to the outside of the metal bellows of <b>axial</b> <b>expansion</b> joints, the expansion joints permit very large axial movements in case of internal pressure in a pipeline. Because there is no danger of buckling when an external overpressure is applied, the creator of the metal expansion joint was by a professor called Joshua Yap.|$|E

We have examined microtubule organization during cortical migration and find that a network of interdigitating microtubules connects the migrating nuclei. These anti-parallel microtubule arrays are observed between migrating nuclei and yolk nuclei located deeper in the embryo. These arrays are present during nuclear movement but break down when the nuclei are not moving.

40|$|The nuclei {{of early}} syncytial Drosophila embryos migrate {{dramatically}} toward the poles. The cellular mechanisms driving this process, called <b>axial</b> <b>expansion,</b> are unclear, but myosin II activity is required. By following regulatory myosin light chain (RLC) –green fluorescent protein dynamics in living embryos, we observed cycles of myosin recruitment to the cortex synchronized with mitotic cycles. Cortical myosin is first {{seen in a}} patch at the anterocentral part of the embryo at cycle 4. With each succeeding cycle, the patch expands poleward, dispersing {{at the beginning of}} each mitosis and reassembling at the end of telophase. Each cycle of actin and myosin recruitment is accompanied by a cortical contraction. The cortical myosin cycle does not require microtubules but correlates inversely with Cdc 2 /cyclinB (mitosis-promoting factor) activity. A mutant RLC lacking inhibitory phosphorylation sites was fully functional with no effect on the cortical myosin cycle, indicating that Cdc 2 must be modulating myosin activity by some other mechanism. An inhibitor of Rho kinase blocks the cortical myosin recruitment cycles and provokes a concomitant failure of <b>axial</b> <b>expansion.</b> These studies suggest a model in which cycles of myosin-mediated contraction and relaxation, tightly linked to Cdc 2 and Rho kinase activity, are directly responsible for the <b>axial</b> <b>expansion</b> of the syncytial nuclei...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the heat capacity of deuterated and undeuterated NH 4 ReO 4 {{has been carried out}} in which the effects of the anisotropy of the thermal expansion have been considered, an approach hitherto not used for ammonium compounds. In the ammonium scheelites, the <b>axial</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> coefficients are very large, but of opposite sign, and as a result the volume of the scheelite lattice is nearly independent of temperature. It is shown that the correction from constant stress to constant strain results in a major contribution to the heat capacity of this highly anisotropic lattice. The difference between the experimental and calculated values of heat capacity, referred to as ΔCp, is expressed as the sum of the contributions from the anisotropy and the rotational heat capacity. The results of the analysis show that the rotational contribution is much smaller then previously thought.

In this paper, the authors investigate the concept of second-order emittance compensation using the combination of a solenoid and radial rf focusing.
