We present an artificial neural network (ANN) approach for measuring DI between <b>article</b> <b>groups</b> and show how the restriction of symmetry can be taken into consideration during the ANN estimation process. A likelihood ratio test serves to test the assumption of symmetry.

40|$|Background: Although {{acupuncture}} {{is widely}} used for chronic pain, there remains considerable controversy as to its value. We aimed {{to determine the effect}} size of acupuncture for 4 chronic pain conditions: back and neck pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache, and shoulder pain. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for chronic pain in which allocation concealment was determined unambiguously to be adequate. Individual patient data meta-analyses were conducted using data from 29 of 31 eligible RCTs, with a total of 17 922 patients analyzed. Results: In the primary analysis, including all eligible RCTs, acupuncture was superior to both sham and noacupuncture control for each pain condition (P�. 001 for all comparisons). After exclusion of an outlying set of RCTs that strongly favored acupuncture, the effect sizes were similar across pain conditions. Patients receiving acupuncture had less pain, with scores that were 0. 23 Author Affiliations are listed {{at the end of this}} <b>article.</b> <b>Group</b> Information: The members of the Acupunctur...|$|E
40|$|Background: Concomitant {{syphilis}} {{and human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is increasingly frequent in industrialized countries. Methods: From a large hospital cohort of HIV-infected patients followed up in the Paris area between 1998 and 2006, we examined the effect of early syphilis on plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels and CD 4 cell counts. We compared 282 HIV- 1 –infected men diagnosed as having incident primary or secondary syphilis with 1233 syphilis-free men matched for age (± 5 years), sexual orientation, participating center, length of follow-up (± 6 months), and immunologic and virologic status before the date of syphilis diagnosis (index date). Increase in viral load (VL) (plasma HIV- 1 RNA) of at least 0. 5 log or a rise to greater than 500 copies/mL in patients with previously controlled VL during the 6 months after the index date was analyzed, as were CD 4 cell count variations and CD 4 slope after the index date.

40|$|Abstract. Here we give an {{automated}} {{proof of the}} fact that a cubic curve admits at most one group law. This is achieved by proving the tight connection between the chord-tangent law of composition and any potential group law (as a morphism) on the curve. An automated proof of this is accomplished by implementing the rigidity lemma and the Cayley-Bacharach theorem of algebraic geometry as formal inference rules in Prover 9, a first-order theorem prover developed by Dr. William McCune. 1 In Memory of Bill McCune This book is dedicated to the memory of our friend and colleague, Bill McCune.

The article {{presents}} in details the main regulations of the EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR THE EFFICIENCY OF JUSTICE (CEPEJ) Guidelines {{on the role}} of court-appointed experts in judicial proceedings of Council of Europe’s Member States. The document related to the duties and responsibilities of a court-appointed expert was adopted by CEPEJ at its 24 th Plenary Meeting (Strasbourg, 11 – 12 December 2014) 31. Authors of the <b>article</b> <b>group</b> these duties into personal and procedural categories and analyse them in the relation to Lithuanian legislation, forensic and court practices. Presented and analysed data enables to conclude that: Personal responsibilities (duties) of forensic experts defined in European minimum standards comply with national regulations of the Republic of Lithuania. It should be emphasised that CEPEJ guidelines define the requirements of objectivity and independency for a forensic expert more broadly as well as include the responsibility of technical personnel participating in forensic examination into personal duties of a forensic expert. The main procedural duties of a forensic expert can be found in national legislation; nevertheless, it lacks systematic approach. What is more, there is no national legal regulation on such European duties as communication, documentation/notification and the duty to take out insurance. Court practices reveal that courts are passive in the application of sanctions (responsibilities) to forensic experts for their intentional or negligent activities during the performance of their duties. The same should be stated about parties which avoid exercising their rights for civil claim against forensic experts in the same cases...|$|E
30|$|The REACH {{information}} {{right for}} consumers about candidate list substances {{has been in}} force now for nearly 10  years and several studies have revealed since, {{that a large number}} of suppliers do not fulfill their obligations as foreseen. The data presented show that some companies take their responsibility for a trustful communication with the consumer seriously and have a very ambitious management system for minimizing dangerous substances in their production chains. On the other hand, the quality of answers received by the majority of suppliers is still insufficient. This indicates that the situation has apparently not improved satisfactorily. The aims of the REACH ‘right to know’ are ambitious, but apparently many suppliers are not aware of their communication duty and the concomitant advantages for them. There are also some doubts whether all suppliers’ answers are correct. The number of respondents who announce that their articles contain more than 0.1 % of an SVHC is extremely low considering the targeted choice of articles in the present study, while publicly available data indicate that a lot of consumer articles today still contain SVHCs above the threshold of 0.1 %. Without chemical analysis, it is not possible to decide whether the answers received are correct or not. Such checks are under the responsibility of the national enforcement authorities. Companies could be fined if they do not meet their information duties. In Germany, the fines foreseen for administrative offence are up to 50.000 Euros [45], but apparently such a sanction has not been imposed so far. Competent authorities call also for sanctions in cases where the company did not act with due diligence and relied on the information received by the supplier without making sufficient efforts to find out whether this information is correct [12]. Reasonable diligence would furthermore include the duty to consider information in the press, data published by consumer organizations, news about article recalls due to SVHCs, or knowledge about the expected presence of SVHCs in a certain <b>article</b> <b>group</b> or material. Due diligence can also include analytical testing commissioned by the company. Companies that provided wrong information about the SVHC content in their articles are required by law to pay for costs resulting from analytical surveillance tests by the enforcement authorities [12].|$|E

40|$|Background: For many organizations, the {{transition}} from being a small business to a growing company demands great changes in the internal administration and processes. One area which often is neglected during this phase of rapid expansion is the processes for handling the planning and purchasing of components. Many young companies do not use systematic methods for managing the planning and purchasing of their inbound materials, instead they put their trust in managing the stock by intuition and prior experience. It’s therefore of interest to examine the possibilities of implementing more formal methods for controlling and planning the purchasing and stock keeping in growing companies. When placing orders, there are different methods for determining the lot sizes, where the Economic Order Quantity and Just In time methods {{are the two most}} commonly used. These theories were originally formulated to facilitate the purchasing and stock planning for grand companies during the 20 th century. They’re {{based on the assumption that}} the company using them are able to order in any quantity desired, which not always is a possibility for small companies. This thesis will focus on investigating if there’s a possibility to use EOQ or JIT to improve the material purchasing and planning process for a small company, and if it’s possible to combine these methods for even further improvements. Purpose: Conduct an article segmentation and based on this examine the possibility to combine the EOQ and JIT methods for control of purchasing and inventory in order to lower these costs for a small company. Method: The thesis uses a deductive approach and is carried out in the form of a case study. The research strategy was mainly quantitative. The analysis was based on data gathered through interviews and from the company’s materials planning system. Conclusion: During the analysis it was discovered that an article classification considering individual purchasing values for each of the article groups, can outperform the more classical way of forming groups based only on percentage values. The other part of the analysis showed that there are currently economic incentives for the studied company to change the current way of material control to an customer order based method for <b>article</b> <b>group</b> A and B. But due to limitations in the company’s current supplier base and the high variance of demand it’s not currently recommended for the company to switch to the JIT approach when planning the material purchasing. The EOQ approach will lower the ordering costs and inventory holding costs for all segments, and combined lower the company’s total purchasing and inventory costs with 38, 4 %. As a result EOQ will in the current situation be the most efficient purchasing and material planning tool for all segments...|$|E
