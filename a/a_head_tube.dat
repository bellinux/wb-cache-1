50|$|Not all forks steer on {{bearings}} {{installed in}} <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>tube.</b> The forks on Stridas and Pedersen bicycles pivot about an axis {{external to the}} fork, supported at two different points on the frame.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> facing and {{reaming tool}} is a hand tool used to machine the head tube to ensure proper headset bearing alignment. The tool usually has {{separate}} and interchangeable facing and reaming cutters which can vary widely {{with the many}} available headset standards.|$|E
50|$|The {{critical}} angles in bicycle geometry are {{the head}} angle (the {{angle of the}} head tube), and the seat tube angle (the angle of the seat tube). These angles are measured from the horizontal, and drastically affect the rider position and performance characteristics of the bicycle. Mountain bike geometry will often feature a seat tube angle around 73 degrees, with <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> angle of anywhere from 60-73 degrees. The intended application of the bike affects its geometry very heavily. In general, steeper angles (closer to 90 degrees from the horizontal) are more efficient for pedaling up hills and make for sharper handling. Slacker angles (leaning farther from the vertical) are preferred for high speeds and downhill stability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The newly {{developed}} Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) actuators are more flexible and conformable than traditional monolithic isotropic piezoceramic actuators, {{and capable of}} being surface-bonded in curved structures. In this study, both analytical prediction and experimental investigation are implemented to eval-uate the effectiveness of active control of flexural vibration of the handlebars of a bicycle by using MFC actuators. The handlebars are simulated as a cantilevered hollow cylindrical rod surface-bonded with three flexible MFC actuators, two placed at the clamped end and the third at the bent location subjected to flexural vibration transmitted from <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>tube.</b> A finite element model and a Euler Bernoulli beam model are uti-lized to obtain the analytical predictions of natural frequencies and mode shapes of the MFC/handlebars. In the experimental verification, a primary disturbance {{is assumed to be}} transmitted from the clamped end, and a secondary force from the MFC actuators. Velocity feedback and a Linear Quadratic Regular (LQR) con-troller are utilized to determine appropriate voltage input into the MFC actuators. Close agreement is found between the theoretical assumptions and the experiments. The results obtained suggest that using the MFC actuators to control the flexural vibration of the MFC/handlebars of the bicycle is effective...|$|E

This was the company's {{first use of}} structural carbon composite material, and subsequent variants of the Six13 have used one to three carbon tubes depending on the price point of the model and the model year. Later, the Six13 line was expanded to include the Slice triathlon/time trial bike which employed similar alloy/carbon joinery with aerodynamically tapered tubes.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{subclass}} of {{the hybrid}} category is the comfort bike. Comfort bikes are essentially modern {{versions of the}} old roadster and sports roadster bicycle, though modern comfort bikes are often equipped with derailleur gears rather than hub gears. They typically have a modified mountain bike frame with <b>a</b> tall <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> to provide <b>an</b> upright riding position, 26-inch (ISO 559) or 28 -inch (ISO 622) wheels, and 1.75 or 1.95 in [...] "middleweight" [...] smooth or semi-slick tires. Comfort bikes typically incorporate such features as front suspension forks, seat post suspension with wide plush saddles, and drop-center, angled North Road-style handlebars designed for easy reach while riding in an upright position.|$|R
5000|$|Litespeed's Reactive Pressure Molding (RPM) is an {{advanced}} molding method utilized during manufacture of Litespeed's newest composite frames.

50|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a new or improved frame for a motorcycle which comprises two substantially parallel rectangular loops each formed from a single length of tubing, and {{the ends of the}} tube forming each loop cross and are welded to each other at the top front corner of the loop, the free ends of the tube which extend beyond the crossing point being welded to the side of <b>an</b> inclined <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> adjacent to the top and bottom thereof. The assembled frame is extremely strong for its weight and designed to provide the maximum resistance to any stresses applied to the frame by road shocks or by the driving torque of the power unit.|$|R
5000|$|The Melon Bicycles Slice model’s {{frame and}} fork {{is made from}} 7005 aluminum. The Slice uses a large size 52T {{chainring}} and a 12-25T cassette to provide enough of a gear range to conquer all terrains with only 8 speeds. Grip shifters are used for shifting with an easy to read display indicating the current gear chosen. The Slice uses 20” wheels (406mm) in the 1.75” width. The bicycle geometry features <b>a</b> slacker <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> angle than most folding bikes which provides for smooth riding and greater maneuverability. The bike’s frame is generally built to accommodate common [...] "industry-standard" [...] components such as brakes and gear systems. The bike will accommodate riders up to 6’ 3” in height.|$|R
50|$|The 675 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{striking}} of all Look frames, primarily due to the integration of the stem into the top tube. The 675 was designed around the three most highly loaded (in terms of force) regions of the frame, with special technological advancements used in order to have a large gain in both stiffness and strength or previous models. The stem integration allowed Look to apply their 'Direct Drive' concept, optimising all cockpit parameters. This was achieved by using <b>a</b> shorter <b>head</b> <b>tube,</b> which tapers from 1 inch at the bottom to 1 1/8th inches at the top. The geometry of the frame favours more comfortable riding positions. The claimed weight for the bike varies from approximately 6.91 kg to 7.65 kg dependent on wheel choice.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a prototype fast response probe designed {{for use in a}} cavitation tunnel is investigated. The probe consists of <b>a</b> total <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> with <b>an</b> embedded miniature pressure sensor. Miniaturisation allows installation of the pressure transducer close {{to the head of the}} head of the instrument and improves frequency response through reducing inertia of fluid in the connecting tube. Measurements made with the fast response probe are compared with those of a Pitot tube connected to a slow response transducer and a hot film probe in a thickened turbulent boundary layer on the tunnel ceiling. Measurements of both streamwise velocity and turbulence made with the probe were found to compare well with those of a Pitot tube and a hot film probe. A useful frequency response up to 2. 5 kHz in water was demonstrated without any frequency compensation for pressure tube response...|$|R
50|$|Pedersen {{wrote that}} he {{developed}} the hammock style seat first. It provides suspension from road imperfections with much less weight, 4 oz instead of 3 lb of traditional leather and steel spring saddles of the day. Pedersen then developed a frame, a truss assembled from several thin tubes, around his new seat design. He attributed his inspiration to the Whipple-Murphy bridge truss. The design initially did not support seat height adjustment, and even after some adjustability was added, required the manufacture of eight different sizes. The non-standard frame design would not accommodate a traditional front fork. Instead, Pedersen developed a fork that also consisted of thin tubes assembled into a truss, which {{was attached to the}} frame with bearings at two distinct points, instead of through <b>a</b> traditional <b>head</b> <b>tube.</b> Pedersen also received patents for a chainwheel and bottom bracket combination and lightweight pedals.|$|R
40|$|The fast {{depletion}} of fossil fuel {{has increased the}} havoc and need of finding an alternative for the existing fossil fuel based energy industry. As a result, many renewable energy sources such as Solar, Wind, Geo Thermal, Bio mass, etc [...] . are being looked in to. One of the major sources of renewable energy is our sun. There are two methods of tapping the energy from the sun. 1. Solar Thermal It involves using the sun’s heat directly in some processes or indirectly to produce electricity. 2. Photo Voltaic It involves using the light to produce electricity using Photo Voltaic cells. This report involves only the Solar Thermal part where the sun’s heat is indirectly used to produce electricity. This report focuses mainly on a method known as Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors (CLFR). This method involves the focusing of sun’s energy to <b>an</b> over <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> through mirrors arranged to form the shape {{similar to that of}} a Fresnel lens and hence the name. Water runs in the over <b>head</b> <b>tube,</b> the focused energy from the sun, heats up the over <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> and produces steam which in turn runs a steam turbine which in turn produces electricity. This report focuses mainly the potential of using CLFR technology to be augmented in to existing coal fired power plants in India. India has a solar reception of 5 Peta watt hours per year with an average of 4 – 7 kW/m 2 DNI. One of National Thermal Power Corporation’s Coal fired thermal power station, Dadri Thermal Power Station, has been chosen for the purpose of case study for this particular thesis. Since there is coal shortage at the power plant location and the plant is not able to produce the peak load, our primary objective was to achieve the production of peak load. The existing power cycle and the solar steam augmented power cycles have been simulated using Thermoflow software and the results have been tabulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{automotive}} Stirling engine {{now under}} development by DOE/NASA {{as an alternative}} to the internal combustion engine, imposes severe materials requirements for the hot portion of the engine. Materials selected must be low cost and contain a minimum of strategic elements so that availability is not <b>a</b> problem. Heater <b>head</b> <b>tubes</b> contain high pressure hydrogen on the inside and are exposed to hot combustion gases on the outside surface. The cylinders and regenerator housings must be readily castable into complex shapes having varying wall thicknesses and be amenable to brazing and welding operations. Also, high strength, oxidation resistance, resistance to hydrogen permeation, cyclic operation, and long-life are required.

40|$|The present {{status of}} {{knowledge}} of turbulent flow is inadequate, {{especially in the case}} of rough open channels, for the formulation of a general theory. It is believed that more experimental data and the subsequent interpretation of these data are necessary before a workable theory can be formulated. Hence, a description of the turbulence present in a rough open channel can be valuable. For this study an artificially roughened bed 48 feet in length was placed in a channel 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep. Measurements were made of the following properties of turbulence at three different slopes: 1. Intensity of turbulence. 2. Autocorrelation and cross-correlation coefficients. 3. Microscale and macroscale of turbulence. 4. One-dimensional energy and dissipation spectra. All the measurements were taken with <b>a</b> piezoelectric total <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> in combination with necessary electronics equipment.

50|$|The <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> of <b>a</b> bicycle is {{sometimes}} {{designated by the}} fork steerer column it accepts. This can lead to confusion, since <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> inside diameters are dependent on the headset standard. For example, frames that take one inch (25.4 mm) steerer columns can have three different inside diameters for threaded and threadless headsets (not including integrated-type headsets). The wide variety of integrated and non-standard, proprietary headsets that some frame manufacturers have created (and abandoned in some cases) makes listing all current and past <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> dimensions problematic. The following table includes the most common sizes; nominal <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> diameters are assuming a 0.1-0.2 mm interference fit, which is what most <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> reaming cutters are designed to bore. Adequate press fits are typically between 0.1 and 0.25 mm of interference.|$|R
40|$|In {{the flow}} over the upper {{surface of a}} wing, a {{discrepancy}} between the predicted and actual point of transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer had been found. This effect {{may be due to}} the comparatively small radius of curvature of the upper surface of the wing. The present tests were undertaken to investigate this effect. As no available channel was suitable for this work, a new channel with two working sections was built. One working section had a wall with a twenty inch radius of curvature and the other section had a flat wall. Three types of measurements were made: a. Traverses were made with <b>a</b> total <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> to determine the character of the boundary layer at various Reynolds numbers. b. The turbulence distribution in the boundary layer was investigated by means of a hot wire and a vacuum tube amplifier. c. A similar investigation of the mean velocity distribution in the boundary layer was made by means of a hot wire anemometer. It was found that by using an abbreviated form of the turbulence level traverses, critical Reynolds Numbers of the transitions could be established. These critical Reynolds are plotted as a function of x/r (x being the distance of the transition from the leading edge of the plate; r being radius of curvature of the plate) for both the convex and concave side of the plate...|$|R
