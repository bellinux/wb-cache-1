A medium-sized band may include besides a guitar (popularly called “violão” in Cape Verde) a cavaquinho (that plays the chords rhythmically), a solo instrument besides the singer’s voice and some percussion. A bigger band may include another guitar, an acoustic bass guitar, more than one solo instrument (a violin — popularly called “rabeca” in Cape Verde —, a clarinet, a trumpet, etc.) and several percussion instruments (<b>a</b> <b>shaker,</b> a güiro, a cowbell, congas, etc.).|$|E

25|$|The 'Spirit of America' Nova was {{introduced}} in 1974. In anticipation of the US bicentennial in 1976, the limited edition Nova Coupes were painted white and featured blue and red accent stripes as well as red and blue interior carpets and fabrics. Oldsmobile and Buick entered the compact car market; both the Apollo and Omega debuted, using the same bodystyles from the Nova lineup. Additional options were included on these Nova-like models, such as lighting under the dashboard and in the glove compartment.

500|$|British record {{producer}} Ken Nelson and {{the band}} produced [...] "Trouble" [...] for their debut album, Parachutes. The track was recorded four times before the band got the take they preferred. The backing track was first recorded, and each time they add {{to see if it}} was working. They, however, decided that the first three versions were not [...] "working". The last take was recorded into Pro Tools with <b>a</b> <b>shaker</b> to provide the rhythm to the track. For the backing track, Will Champion played the drums and Martin on the piano which they recorded in a little wooden room. After Guy Berryman's bass was recorded, guitarist Jonny Buckland added the guitar section. In recording the piano section of the track, the band used two microphones—one was brighter-sounding and the other had a fuller sound. Nelson, who wanted to keep the song simple, chose the fuller sound microphone for the mixing.|$|E

500|$|In April 2008 General Motors started {{extensive}} battery testing. In {{two years}} the carmaker put the battery packs to the equivalent of 150,000 real-world miles (240,000km) and ten years of use. The durability of the battery pack was tested for {{a broad range of}} extreme ambient conditions including <b>a</b> <b>shaker</b> table to simulate potholes and a thermal chamber, to simulate temperatures varying from , typical of the Southwest deserts, to [...] typical of the Alaska tundra. In April 2008 the lithium-ion battery pack was placed in Chevrolet Malibus fitted with the Volt powertrain to be used as test mules for further real-world testing. In October 2008 General Motors chose CPI (LG Chemical) to provide the battery systems for the first production version of the Volt. In July 2008 General Motors confirmed that a non-turbocharged, 1.4 L 4-cylinder engine would be used as the range extender, and that the intention was to build it in Flint, Michigan. In April 2009, General Motors allowed journalists to test the Volt powertrain in the body of Chevrolet Cruze sedans used as test mules which lacked the range-extending generator at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan.|$|E

2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>Shaker</b> {{village was}} divided into groups or [...] "families." [...] The leading group in each village was the Church Family, and it was {{surrounded}} by satellite families that were often named for points on the compass rose. Each village was governed by a leadership team consisting of two men (Elders) and two women (Eldresses). [...] Shakers lived together as brothers and sisters. Each house was divided so {{that men and women}} did most things separately. They used different staircases and doors. They sat {{on opposite sides of the}} room in worship, at meals, and in [...] "union meetings" [...] held to provide supervised socialization between the sexes. However, the daily business of <b>a</b> <b>Shaker</b> village required the brethren and sisters to interact. Though there was a division of labor between men and women, they also cooperated in carrying out many tasks, such as harvesting apples, food production, laundry, and gathering firewood.|$|E
2500|$|Rick Rubin {{produced}} [...] "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived" [...] {{with the}} band between April 2007 and February 2008. In the liner notes of the deluxe edition of The Red Album, Cuomo stated that the song did not originally have the subtitle [...] "Variations on <b>a</b> <b>Shaker</b> Hymn", but when guitarist Brian Bell's mother came into the studio to see them, she mentioned that the melody from the song sounded similar to <b>a</b> <b>Shaker</b> hymn that the choir sang in her church. Cuomo wrote that he realised that people might notice the resemblance: [...] "I knew {{people were going to}} come at us after and say 'Hey, you guys ripped off that hymn.' So I put the credit in there off the bat." [...] As a result, the band looked up the hymn and indeed the melody was so similar to Joseph Brackett's [...] "Simple Gifts" [...] that they credited the hymn with the subtitle.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with KROQ-FM, Rivers Cuomo talked extensively about the concept behind the song.

He mentioned the influence for each section, including the Baroque counterpoint vocal style which inspired the final 'Bach' & 'Beethoven' sections. In a January 21, 2009, interview on the NPR program Fresh Air, Cuomo stated that [...] "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on <b>a</b> <b>Shaker</b> Hymn)" [...] is his favorite Weezer song.|$|E
