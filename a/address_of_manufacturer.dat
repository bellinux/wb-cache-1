On-site resources are those occurring {{on nearly every}} site. In, particular, the energies are solar, wind, water, and organic-waste; the materials are rock and earth. The thesis content includes basic information and guidelines necessary for making preliminary design decisions regarding these alternatives. Emphasis {{has been placed on}} analyzing site conditions, on measuring the available resource, on estimating the usable energy resource available, on storing the energy and {{on the use of the}} resource. In addition, there is a case study demonstrating the use of the information in the site-design process for a wind machine.

40|$|A {{survey on}} the {{provision}} of package inserts in pediatric oral formulations by pharmaceutical manufacturers in Nigeria Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to obtain data and understand how pharmaceuticals manufacturers care for safety and efϐicacy of the products distributed for consumption in Nigeria. The study was based on a survey of wholesale pharmacies that distribute pharmaceuticals for manufacturers. The study was carried out in Jos city, a central point in the north-central Nigeria. Materials and Methods: Samples of pediatric formulations in pharmacies were obtained based on the product and the manufacturer. The packages were inspected for packing information leaϐlet and measuring devices. In addition, the manufacturing date, expiry date, storage conditions, product registration status, and the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>manufacturer</b> were also noted. Simple statistic was used to analyze the data. Results: One hundred and twenty seven oral liquid formulations from 31 manufacturers were anayzed. The results showed that leaϐlet and measuring device as well as statement on storage conditions were available in 88 (69. 3 %), 98 (77. 2 %), and 114 (89. 8 %), respectively, in the samples studied. All products had registration numbers, suggesting that the products were authorized for distribution; this implies that some manufacturers deliberately distribute their products in forms other than the approved form. Conclusions: <b>Manufacturers</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical products need to be more committed to the safety and efϐicacy of their products at all times. Regulatory agency should increase surveillance to ensure that manufacturers consistently provide in their ϐinal packages what was declared and approved for registration.
