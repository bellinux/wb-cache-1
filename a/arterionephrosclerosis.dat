40|$|<b>Arterionephrosclerosis</b> is {{diagnosed}} at autopsy by assessing the severity {{and extent of}} certain structural features in the renal cortical arteries seen in tissue sections. These features are characterized by fibrotic intimal thickening and medial shrinkage, a progressive change from the youthful muscular pattern to the elderly sclerotic pattern. Intimal fibrosis can be quantified by expressing intimal thickness {{as a percentage of}} the arterial outer diameter (% OD). The magnitude of <b>arterionephrosclerosis,</b> found by averaging the measures of intimal fibrosis seen in a kidney, can be calculated from age and mean blood pressure, using a standard prediction function. This function is a quantitative statement of a fundamentally important principle: just as blood pressure is a continuous variable that can range from low to high levels, <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> is also a continuous variable that can take any degree of abnormality of arterial structure from minimal to maximal. Furthermore, a correspondence exists between the two quantities so that each can be calculated from the other. In this study, a correlation of 0. 966 was found between the observed and the calculated magnitudes of <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> over 10 -year age groups from 25 to 34 years to 65 to 74 years, using group average data within age groups. For individuals, however, the correlations between observed and calculated magnitudes of <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> were about 0. 6 in a former study of elderly subjects and about 0. 1 in the subjects aged 6 to 27 years in this study. The average growth rate of <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> was found to be about 0. 25 %OD per year from ages 15 to 54 years, and about 0. 13 %OD per year from ages 55 to 70 years; the growth rate did not increase in the oldest age groups when blood pressure averaged higher than blood pressure in more youthful subjects. These and other findings are consistent with the view that the reason a correlation exists between blood pressure and <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> could be because the magnitude of <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> is one of the determinants that sets the level of blood pressure. From this perspective, each individual can be viewed as having other determinants of blood pressure, methodologic or biologic, which add to or subtract from the values set by age and <b>arterionephrosclerosis.</b> When subjects are pooled into groups, so that individual determinants balance out, the group average levels of mean blood pressure could be interpreted as reflecting little other than the magnitude of <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> at each specific age...|$|E

40|$|IntroductionThe {{increased}} risk of end-stage kidney disease among hypertensive African Americans is partly related to APOL 1 allele variants. The initial glomerulosclerosis of hypertension-associated <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> consists of focal global glomerulosclerosis, but in biopsy studies, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is found with progression to end-stage kidney disease, particularly in African Americans. MethodsThis is a study of <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> in successfully APOL 1 -genotyped autopsy kidney tissue of 159 African Americans and 135 whites aged 18  to 89 years from a general population with no clinical renal disease. ResultsGlomerulosclerosis was nearly exclusively focal global glomerulosclerosis with 3 subjects having focal segmental glomerulosclerosis–like lesions that were unrelated to APOL 1 risk status. For both races, in multivariable analysis, the dependent variables of arteriosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis {{were significantly related to}} the independent variables of older age (P < 0. 001) and hypertension (P < 0. 001). A relationship between APOL 1 genotype and arteriosclerosis was apparent only after 35 years of age, when, for any level of elevated blood pressure, more severe arteriosclerosis was found in the interlobular arteries of 14  subjects with 2 APOL 1 risk alleles compared to African Americans with none (n = 37, P = 0. 02) or 1 risk allele (n = 35, P = 0. 02). DiscussionWith the limitation of the small number of subjects contributing to the positive results, the findings imply that APOL 1 risk alleles recessively augment small-vessel arteriosclerosis in conjunction with age and hypertension. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was not a significant finding, indicating that {{in the early stages of}} <b>arterionephrosclerosis,</b> the primary pathologic influence of APOL 1 genotype is vascular rather than glomerular...|$|E

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of podocytopathies ranges from steroid-re-sponsive minimal change disease (MCD) to devastating fo-cal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which may recur and cause {{end-stage renal disease}} in the transplant. Sclerotic lesions of glomeruli may also develop as a sec-ondary event, both in immune complex and non-immune diseases, such as conditions with extensive loss of renal mass, diabetic nephropathy, <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> or re-flux nephropathy. Even amongst the group of patients with so-called ‘primary FSGS’, there is increasing recognition {{of a variety of}} contributing aetiologies, including genetic, viral, drug toxicity and others [1].

40|$|Risk {{factors for}} chronic {{allograft}} nephropathy after renal transplantation: A protocol biopsy study. BackgroundChronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) leads to chronic allograft dysfunction and loss. Regular renal transplant biopsies {{may be useful}} to find risk factors for CAN. MethodsWe carried out 688 protocol biopsies in 258 patients at 6, 12, and 26 weeks after renal transplantation. Patients with signs of CAN in the biopsy 3 (N = 70, CAN group), and those without (N = 120, non-CAN group), were compared. ResultsChronic tubulointerstitial changes increased from biopsy 1 to 3 (5 % vs. 37 %, P < 0. 0001). Fifty-six of 190 patients had acute rejection within 6 months (30 %), 33 of which were found in protocol biopsies (17 %). On univariate analysis, the CAN group had CAN more often at biopsy 2 than the non-CAN group (23 % vs. 4 %, P < 0. 0001), had a lower calculated creatinine clearance at biopsy 1 and 2 (49. 4 ± 25. 8 vs. 57 ± 20. 2 mL/min, P = 0. 01; 47. 3 ± 21. 2 vs. 57. 9 ± 19. 5 mL/min, P = 0. 001, respectively), had a living donor less often than a brain dead donor (7 % vs. 18 %, P = 0. 045), had a longer cold ischemia time (17. 4 ± 7 vs. 14. 9 ± 8. 1 hours, P = 0. 04), and had <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> more often (24 % vs. 12 %, P = 0. 02). On multivariate analysis, the differences in CAN at biopsy 2 (P = 0. 001) and lower GFR at biopsy 2 (P = 0. 002) were confirmed; in addition, nephrocalcinosis (P = 0. 006) and acute rejection (P = 0. 046) were found to occur more often. ConclusionChronic tubulointerstitial changes develop early after renal transplantation and are associated with reduced kidney function. Risk factors for CAN are <b>arterionephrosclerosis</b> (donor-related), nephrocalcinosis (related to preexisting hyperparathyroidism), a long cold-ischemia time (ischemia-perfusion-related), and acute rejection. Renal functional decline precedes morphologic changes of CAN, expressed as tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|With {{prolonged}} {{survival and}} {{aging of the}} HIV-infected population {{in the era of}} antiretroviral therapy, biopsy series have found a broad spectrum of HIV-related and co-morbid kidney disease in these patients. Our study describes the variety of renal pathology found in a prospective cohort of antiretroviral-experienced patients (the Manhattan HIV Brain Bank) who had consented to postmortem organ donation. Nearly one-third of 89 kidney tissue donors had chronic kidney disease, and evidence of some renal pathology was found in 75. The most common diagnoses were <b>arterionephrosclerosis,</b> HIV-associated nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. Other diagnoses included pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis, diabetic nephropathy, fungal infection and amyloidosis. Excluding 2 instances of acute tubular necrosis, slightly over one-third of the cases would have been predicted using current diagnostic criteria for chronic kidney disease. Based on semi-quantitative analysis of stored specimens, pre-mortem microalbuminuria testing could have identified an additional 12 cases. Future studies are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of more sensitive methods for defining chronic kidney disease, in order to identify HIV-infected patients with early kidney disease who may benefit from antiretroviral therapy and other interventions known to delay disease progression and prevent complications...|$|E
40|$|The S protein (S) binds to {{the attack}} complex of {{complement}} (C 5 b- 9) in plasma preventing cytolysis. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, the authors determined the distribution of S in human renal tissue {{and its relationship to}} C 5 b- 9, immunoglobulins, C 3, albumin, and fibronectin. They examined normal and diseased human kidney tissue from patients with several forms of glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and <b>arterionephrosclerosis.</b> S and C 5 b- 9 were found in all diseased tissues; their amounts and distribution directly correlated with severity and location of injury. S and C 5 b- 9 were colocalized in all immune deposits and in all injured glomeruli, tubular basement membranes, and vessel walls. Other than within immune deposits, S and C 5 b- 9 were usually not colocalized with C 3. This study demonstrates that S is deposited in areas of tissue injury and thus may participate in the pathogenesis of renal damage. Because in tissue S and C 5 b- 9 are always associated, the attack complex in tissue must either be derived from the circulation as SC 5 b- 9 or it must be capable of binding S after the formation in situ of C 5 b- 9...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulin-A {{distribution}} in glomerular disease. Analysis of immunofluorescence localization and pathogenetic significance. Renal biopsies from 470 patients with various glomemlonephropathies were studied for patterns {{and frequency of}} glomerular bound IgA. Correlations of IgA with IgG, IgM, C 3, and C 4 were made. Glomerular deposits of IgA were observed in five of six cases of Henoch-Schoenlein anaphylactoid nephritis (83 %), stalk proliferative glomerulonephritis (73 %), lupus nephritis (60 %), and focal proliferative glomerulonephritis (57 %). In addition, IgA was less frequently observed in diffuse (acute) proliferative (33 %), membranoproliferative (42 %), membranous (32 %), focal sclerosing (25 %) crescentic (26 %), and chronic glomerulonephritides (23 %) as well as malignant <b>arterionephrosclerosis,</b> amyloidosis, {{and a group of}} patients with minimal glomerular alteration and no determinable diagnosis (40 %). IgA was not specifically associated with IgG or IgM in any one diagnostic category but was often present with both. Deposits containing C 3 and C 4 most closely paralleled those of IgG and/or IgM. Presence of IgA appeared to correlate with variable degrees of increased glomerular mesangial cellularity in “minimal”, stalk proliferative, and focal-segmental glomerular lesions. The cause and immunopathogenetic significance of mesangial or peripheral glomerular capillary localization of IgA is unknown. Though a number of apparent examples of what has been referred to as IgA-IgG nephropathy were observed in this study, this entity, characterized by mesangial deposits of IgA, IgG, and C 3, could not always be specifically identified or differentiated on histopathologic criteria alone from a variety of other glomerulopathies in which variable proportions of IgA, IgG, IgM, C 3, and C 4 globulins were localized...|$|E
40|$|Ischemic renal diseases: New {{insights}} into old entities. Vascular nephropathies are a steadily increasing cause of end-stage renal failure. <b>Arterionephrosclerosis</b> and arteriolonephrosclerosis are common {{features in the}} hypertensive patient. This {{is especially true for}} blacks of African descent, in whom hypertension and nephrovasculopathies are a major cause of renal insufficiency. That primary hypertension leads to renal vascular lesions, glomerular obsolescence and interstitial fibrosis has long been established. It should not, however, obscure the fact that renal vascular lesions can be observed in animal models as well as in some humans, especially young blacks, in the absence of, or anticipating the onset of hypertension. This leads to considering the hypothesis that nephroangiosclerosis might stem from a genetic defect in the renal vascular bed and that this defect is strongly associated with the hypertensive trait. Atherosclerotic renal disease is a major, potentially treatable cause of chronic renal failure, especially in whites. It leads to renal atrophy, but the ischemic kidney retains a vigorous potential for tubular cell regeneration, which pleads for early recognition and treatment. Recent data suggest that renal ischemia, be it due to renal artery stenosis or to cholesterol crystal embolism, ranks among the multiple causes of secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Irrespective of its initial mechanism, ischemia induces renal fibrosis, the pathophysiology of which is centered on increased generation of angiotensin II. Finally, renal vascular lesions are commonly observed in the course of various nephropathies, {{even in the absence of}} hypertension, and the relationship between these lesions and the unfavorable prognosis of glomerulopathies, especially primary focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous glomerulopathy and IgA glomerulonephritis, remains to be elucidated. Expanding knowledge of the spectrum of nephrovasculopathies opens perspectives for investigating, understanding and treating a major mechanism of progressive renal insufficiency...|$|E
