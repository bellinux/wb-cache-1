MicroPADs are postage-stamp-sized devices made out of paper {{that can be used}} as platforms for low-cost, simple-to-use point-of-care diagnostic assays. P(NIPAM) is a thermally responsive polymer that absorbs aqueous solutions at room temperature and will expel the solutions to microPADs when heated. The fluid delivery characteristics of P(NIPAM) were assessed, and P(NIPAM) was able to deliver multiple solutions to microPADs in specific sequences or simultaneously in a laminar-flow configuration. P(NIPAM) was then shown to be suitable for delivering four classes of reagents to microPADs: small molecules, enzymes, antibodies and DNA. P(NIPAM) successfully delivered a series of standard concentrations of glucose (0 – 5 mM) to microPADs equipped to perform a colorimetric glucose assay. The results of these tests were used to produce an external calibration curve, which in turn was used to determine accurately the concentrations of glucose in sample solutions. P(NIPAM) successfully delivered fluorescein-labeled IgG and fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides (20 base pairs) to microPADs in a variety of concentrations. P(NIPAM) also successfully delivered horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to microPADs, and it was determined that HRP could be stored in P(NIPAM) for 35 days with minimal loss in activity. The combination of P(NIPAM) with microPADs will allow for more complex assays to be performed with minimal user input, will facilitate the preparation of external calibration curves in the field, and may be useful in extending the shelf life of microPADs by stabilizing reagents...|$|E

Though the impact varies from no harm to serious adverse effects including death, it needs attention on priority basis since medication errors’ are preventable. In today's world where people are aware and medical claims are on the hike, it is of utmost priority that we curb this issue. Individual effort to decrease medication error alone might not be successful until {{a change in the}} existing protocols and system is incorporated. Often drug errors that occur cannot be reversed. The best way to ‘treat’ drug errors is to prevent them. Wrong medication (due to syringe swap), overdose (due to misunderstanding or preconception of the dose, pump misuse and dilution error), incorrect administration route, under dosing and omission are common causes of medication error that occur perioperatively. Drug omission and calculation mistakes occur commonly in ICU. Medication errors can occur perioperatively either during preparation, administration or record keeping. Numerous human and system errors can be blamed for occurrence of medication errors. The need of the hour is to stop the blame – game, accept mistakes and develop a safe and ‘just’ culture in order to prevent medication errors.

40|$|Creating {{patterns}} of biomolecules and cells {{has been applied}} widely in many fields associated with the life sciences, including diagnostics. In these applications {{it has become increasingly}} apparent that the spatiotemporal arrangement of biological molecules in vitro is important for the investigation of the cellular functions found in vivo. However, the cell patterning techniques often used are limited to creating 2 D functional surfaces on glass and silicon. In addition, in general, these procedures are not easy to implement in conventional biological laboratories. Here, we show the formation of a living poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer that can be patterned with visible light on plastic surfaces. This new and simple method can be expanded to pattern multiple types of biomolecule on either a previously formed PEG layer or a plastic substrate. Using common plastic wares (i. e., polyethylene films and polystyrene cell culture Petri-dishes), we demonstrate that these PEG-modified surfaces have a high resistance to protein adsorption and cell adhesion, while at the same time, being capable of undergoing further molecular grafting with bioactive motifs. With a photomask and <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system,</b> we illustrate a flexible way to immobilize biological functions {{with a high degree of}} 2 D and 3 D spatial control.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the testing of a spray cooling experiment designed to be flown on NASA's KC- 135 Reduced Gravity Testing Platform. Spray cooling is an example of a thermal management technique that may be utilized in high flux heat acquisition and high thermal energy transport concepts. Many researchers have investigated the utility of spray cooling for the thermal management of devices generating high heat fluxes. However, there has been little research addressing the physics and ultimate performance of spray cooling in a variable gravity environment. An experimental package, consisting of a spray chamber coupled to <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>delivery</b> loop <b>system,</b> was fabricated for variable gravity flight tests. The spray chamber contains two opposing nozzles spraying on target Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) heaters. These heaters are mounted on glass pedestals, which are part of a sump system to remove unconstrained liquid from the test chamber. Liquid is collected in the sumps and returned to the <b>fluid</b> <b>delivery</b> loop. Thermocouples mounted in and around the pedestals are used to determine both the heat loss through the underside of the IT 0 heater and the heat extracted by the spray. A series of flight tests were carried out aboard the KC- 135, utilizing the ability of the aircraft to produce various gravity conditions. During the flight tests, for a fixed flow rate, heat input was varied at 20, 30, 50, and 80 W with variable gravities of 0. 01, 0. 16, 0. 36, and 1. 8 g. Flight test data was compared to terrestrial baseline data in addition to analytical and numerical solutions to evaluate the heat transfer in the heater and support structure.

40|$|A novel {{microfluidic}} {{system has been}} developed that uses the phenomenon of passive pumping along with a user controlled droplet based <b>fluid</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system.</b> Passive pumping is the phenomenon by which surface tension induced pressure differences drive fluid movement in closed channels. The automated <b>fluid</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> consists of <b>a</b> set of voltage controlled valves with micro-nozzles connected to <b>a</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir and <b>a</b> control system. These voltage controlled valves offer a volumetrically precise way to deliver fluid droplets to the inlet of a microfluidic device in a high frequency manner.

It is observed that there is interplay between momentum of the system (imparted by a combination of the droplets created by the valves and the fluid velocity in the channel), and the surface tension of the liquid. Where momentum provides velocity to the fluid flow (or vice-versa), equilibration of surface tension at the inlet provides a sudden stop to any flow. This sudden stop allows the user to control the flow characteristics of the channel and opens the door for a variety of biological applications, ranging anywhere from reagent delivery to drug-cell studies.

The thesis describes the work completed in the investigation of the complex fluid flow that occurs in the region close to the grinding contact zone between the wheel and workpiece and the boundary layer phenomena around the periphery of the rotating grinding wheel. Studies on air scraper and shoe nozzle application are also presented. Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) was employed to obtain a basic understanding of the flow velocity profile in the region close to the grinding contact zone in a low speed grinding system and key characteristics of the fluid flow under varying grinding conditions were identified. The mathematical formulae describing the air velocity distribution around the wheel have been derived from theory based on Newton's laws. Air boundary layer flow around the rotating grinding wheel was studied using LDA measurements and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation to get the air velocity distribution in varying conditions. The experimental results and the investigation made clear the contradictory knowledge relative to this issue and gave a full understanding of the air boundary layer flow. Air scrapers are used to reduce the effects of the air boundary layer. The effects of the size and position of the different scrapers on the air flow velocity and pressure distribution was investigated using CFD simulation.

Dumke FACSM The University of Montana, Missoula, MT Heat {{acclimation}} improves thermal {{tolerance and}} attenuates the physiological and perceptual strain associated with {{exercise in the}} heat. <b>A</b> limited <b>fluid</b> <b>delivery</b> strategy during heat acclimation may promote further adaptations to attenuate heat stress over long periods, decreasing the probability of heat related illness. PURPOSE: To determine i) the effect of <b>fluid</b> <b>delivery</b> by inducing dehydration (DEH= 0. 5 ml*kg- 1 *min- 15) compared to euhydration (EUH= 2. 0 ml * kg- 1 * 15 min- 1) following three heat acclimation bouts on heat stress factors, and ii) {{to determine the effect}} of aerobic performance in the heat following DEH and EUH acclimation trials. METHODS: Eight aerobically fit males (23. 0 ± 0. 9 yrs, 82. 1 ± 2. 0 kg, 184. 0 ± 2. 5 cm, 53. 2 ± 1. 5 ml*kg- 1 *min- 1 VO 2 max) completed 90 -minute heat stress test (HST) in hot conditions (T= 40 °C, RH= 30...|$|R
40|$|Ferrite magnets {{have a long}} history. They {{are used}} in motors, {{magnetic}} <b>fluids,</b> drug <b>delivery</b> <b>systems,</b> etc. Herein we report a mesoscopic ferrite bar magnet based on rod-shaped ε-Fe 2 O 3 with a large coercive field (> 25 [*]kOe). The ε-Fe 2 O 3 –based bar magnet is a single crystal with a single magnetic domain along the longitudinal direction. A wide frequency range spectroscopic study shows that the crystallographic a-axis of ε-Fe 2 O 3, which corresponds to the longitudinal direction of the bar magnet, {{plays an important role}} in linear and non-linear magneto-optical transitions, phonon modes, and the magnon (Kittel mode). Due to its multiferroic property, a magnetic-responsive non-linear optical sheet is manufactured as an application using an ε-Fe 2 O 3 –based bar magnet, resin, and polyethylene terephthalate. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of the large coercive field property, we demonstrate that a mesoscopic ε-Fe 2 O 3 bar magnet can be used as a magnetic force microscopy probe...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{and chronic}} changes in renal {{function}} following unilateral nephrectomy. Free-flow micropuncture {{was used to}} assess proximal and distal tubular function in rats immediately (2 to 5 hours), five days and 30 days after uninephrectomy (UN); results were compared with those in sham-operated littermates. Excretion rates of water, sodium and potassium were approximately doubled in the remaining kidney of UN rats. Two to five hours after UN there were small increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and single nephron GFR which at this stage were not accompanied by an increase in absolute proximal reabsorption; that is, fractional proximal reabsorption fell. After five days, GFR and single nephron GFR had increased further; at this stage absolute proximal reabsorption was also significantly elevated. After 30 days, kidney weight, GFR, single nephron GFR and absolute proximal reabsorption had all increased by approximately 40 %, and glomerulo-tubular balance in the proximal tubule had been fully restored. Data derived from distal tubular collections indicated that at every stage after UN: (<b>a)</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>delivery</b> to both early and late distal puncture sites was increased; (b) in contrast, there was no increase in sodium delivery to the late distal tubule, suggesting that the natriuresis resulted from reduced sodium reabsorption beyond the distal tubule and/or increased delivery of sodium from deep nephrons; and (c) there was a marked increase in potassium secretion into the accessible portion of the distal tubule which was more than adequate to explain the observed kaliuresis...|$|R

A microhole array is a {{critical}} feature in high-precision products, and acts as <b>a</b> microchannel for <b>fluid</b> <b>delivery</b> or <b>a</b> guiding hole for needle positioning. The precision of microhole fabrication affects the functions of product directly. This study presents a computer vision system that uses image processing methods to evaluate the positional error of a microhole array. A ceramic microhole array drilled by microdrilling process was made to demonstrate the proposed method. Analytical {{results show that the}} positional error is related to the precision of machining device noticeably and decreases with the number of holes drilled when adopts the mechanical microdrilling process...|$|R
40|$|The {{immediate}} effect of cisplatin on rat proximal tubular function was investigated by two different methods, the lithium clearance method and the occlusion time-transit time method (TT-OT). Within minutes after administration of cisplatin a significant in-crease in lithium clearance, fractional lithium clearance (C/C) and e#{ 176 }Twas observed (from 270 ± 32 to 387 ± 60 l/min/g kidney weight, 0. 202 ± 0. 03 to 0. 340 ± 0. 06 and 0. 41 5 ± 0. 02 to 0. 497 ± 0. 02, respectively). These increases indicate <b>an</b> increased <b>fluid</b> <b>delivery</b> {{from both the}} proximal straight segment and the late proximal convoluted tubule after cisplatin adminis-tration. Concomitantly absolute proximal reabsorption rate was significantly decreased. Intervention by saline loading (2 % of body weight) did not prevent the increase in e#{ 176 }T, but the increase in C/C was significantly less than in the control group...|$|R
