30|$|As Dr. Bullough said, the {{discovery}} of sex reversal in rice field eel indeed opened a fresh field for sex determination study after several decades in vertebrates, especially in fishes. Up to the present day, {{a large number of}} significant breakthroughs have been achieved from the genetic basis to the biotechnological manipulation of fish sexual dimorphism and sex determination (Gui and Zhu, 2012; Gui, 2015 a; Mei and Gui, 2015). Because some aquaculture fishes exhibit significant sexual dimorphism in growth rate and body size, there are remarkable economic benefits by producing all-females or all-males for aquaculture, and several generations of fish genetic breeding scientists in the Institute have developed a series of sex control breeding biotechnologies to obtain mono-sex populations. Through heterologous sperm-induced gynogenesis and various reproduction mode utilization, three new unisexual all-female varieties, such as allogynogenetic gibel carp (Jiang et al., 1983), high dorsal allogynogenetic gibel carp (Zhu and Jiang, 1993), and allogynogenetic gibel carp “CAS III” (Wang et al., 2011), were bred in gibel carp and applied to aquaculture practice throughout China (Gui and Zhou, 2010; Gui and Zhu, 2012). By artificial gynogenesis and chromosome set manipulation, <b>all-female</b> <b>hybrid</b> common carp was also produced (Wu et al., 1986). Moreover, some sex-specific or sex chromosome-specific genetic markers were identified from yellow catfish and other bagrid catfish (Pseudobagrus ussuriensis) (Wang et al., 2009; Dan et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2015), and all-males of yellow catfish had been massively produced and used for commercial aquaculture (Liu et al., 2013; Gui, 2015 b).|$|E
40|$|<b>All-female</b> <b>hybrids</b> of the {{killifishes}} Fundulus heteroclitus and Fundulus diaphanus, {{known from}} two sites in Nova Scotia, Canada, are shown to reproduce clonally. Isozyme analysis of crosses between female hybrids and male F. heteroclitus reveals that their progeny are genetically identical and show {{no evidence of}} recombination or paternal inheritance. Flow cytometric measurement of DNA content shows the hybrids to be diploid, with DNA values intermediate {{to those of the}} parental species. Because they are related to F. heteroclitus, a fish used widely as a model organism in experimental biology, the clonal hybrids are potentially valuable for experimental studies requiring subjects with a constant genetic background. In addition, the discovery of unisexuality and cloning in a fish whose reproductive physiology and development are so well characterized provides a unique opportunity to examine the underlying causes of clonal reproduction in vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|A {{diversity}} of all-female fishes {{of the genus}} Poeciliopsis coexists with their sexual ancestor species in streams of western Mexico. <b>All-females</b> are <b>hybrids</b> that depend on the sperm of paternal species to reproduce. Rare-female advantage {{is one of several}} hypotheses that attempt to explain how the {{diversity of}} all-female biotypes is maintained within the Poeciliopsis reproductive complexes. According to this hypothesis, the uncommon all-female biotype has a mating advantage over the common ones and has been maintained by a dynamic equilibrium process. In the P. monacha reproductive complex at Arroyo de los Platanos the density of two all-female biotypes (P. 2 monacha-lucida I and II) varies across pools. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyse fecundity and mating success of females from this arroyo to test the hypothesis. Female mating success was inversely correlated to their density, supporting this hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{many species}} of {{aquaculture}} importance, all-female and sterile populations possess superior productivity due to faster growth and a relatively homogenous size of individuals. However, the production of all-female and sterile fish {{in a large scale}} for aquaculture is a challenge in practice, because treatments necessary for gynogenesis induction usually cause massive embryonic and larval mortality, and the number of induced gynogens is too small for their direct use in aquaculture. Here we report the massive production of all-female triploid crucian carp by combining artificial gynogenesis, sex reversal and diploid-tetraploid hybridization. Previously, we have obtained an allotetraploid carp population (4 n = 200) by hybridization between red crucian carp (Carassius auratus red var; &# 9792;) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio; &# 9794;). We induced all-female diploid gynogens of the Japanese crucian carp (Carassius cuvieri; 2 n = 100). We also generated male diploid gynogens of the same species treated gynogenetic fry with 17 -&# 945;-methyltestosterone, leading to the production of sex-revered gynogenetic males. Finally, these males were used to cross with the female diploid Japanese crucian carp gynogens and the allotetraploid females, resulting in the production of fertile all-female diploid Japanese crucian carp (2 n= 100) and sterile <b>all-female</b> triploid <b>hybrids</b> (3 n = 150), respectively. Therefore, diploid crucian carp gynogenetic females and sex-reversed male together with an allotetraploid line provide an opportunity to produce all-female triploid populations in a large scale to meet demands in aquaculture industry. </p...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{considerations}} {{suggest that}} a high load of deleterious mutations should accumulate in asexual genomes. An ideal system for testing this hypothesis occurs in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>all-female</b> fish Poeciliopsis monacha-lucida. The hybrid genotype is retained between generations by an oogenetic process that transmits only a nonrecombinant haploid monacha genome to their ova. The hybrid genotype is re-established in nature by fertilization of these monacha eggs with sperm from a sexual species, P. lucida. The unique reproductive mechanism of these hybrids allows the genetic dissection of the clonal monacha genome by forced matings with males of P. monacha. The resultant F 1 hybrids and their backcross progeny were examined to determine the amount and kinds of genetic changes that might have occurred in two clonal monacha genomes. —Using six allozyme markers, four similar linkage groups were identified in each clonal genome. Segregation and assortment at these loci revealed no apparent differences between monacha genomes from sexually and clonally reproducing species. Mortality of F 1 and backcross progeny revealed {{differences between the two}} clonal genomes, suggesting that deleterious genes may accumulate in genomes sheltered from recombination...|$|R
