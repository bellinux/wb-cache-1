5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> {{of two to}} three years. Males are gregarious when immature, but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females. Females are more tolerant of each other, except after laying their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Female California spiny {{lobsters}} reach sexual maturity at {{a length of}} , which is typically <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of 5–9 years; males are sexually mature after 3–6 years. Because all the hard parts are lost at each molt, {{the life span of}} mature {{spiny lobsters}} is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.|$|E
5|$|Screening among {{family members}} of people with known FH is cost-effective. Other {{strategies}} such as universal screening {{at the age of}} 16 were suggested in 2001. The latter approach may however be less cost-effective in the short term. Screening <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> lower than 16 was thought likely to lead to an unacceptably high rate of false positives.|$|E

5|$|The chicks' {{eyes open}} after about four days and, <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of about eight days, the young birds get their first down. If both parents perish, the ensuing {{intensive}} begging {{sounds of the}} young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves. All the young in the nest leave it {{during the same period}} of a few hours. At this stage, they are normally able to fly. They start feeding themselves partly after one or two days, and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days, 14 at the latest.|$|E

Greene, commanded a brigade at the Battle of Manila during the Spanish–American War. A third, Charles Thurston Greene, was a lieutenant on his father's staff at Culp's Hill. Later in 1863, Charles was wounded by an artillery shell and his leg was amputated, but he remained on active service until 1870. George Sears Greene, Jr., volunteered to serve but {{was not allowed to}} do so by his father so he could survive and carry on the family name.|$|E
40|$|We use {{data from}} the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Mother-Child Files to {{estimate}} the effect of age at enrollment in first grade on eight to eleven year old children's cognitive test scores and behavior problems. We find that children who enroll in first grade <b>at</b> <b>a</b> young <b>age</b> score higher on cognitive tests and have fewer behavior problems than children of the same <b>age</b> who enroll <b>at</b> <b>an</b> older <b>age.</b> This is mainly because children who enroll earlier have had more schooling than their same-aged peers who enrolled later. We also find that among children with {{the same amount of}} schooling, those who enrolled <b>at</b> <b>a</b> younger <b>age</b> have higher verbal scores than those who enrolled <b>at</b> <b>an</b> older <b>age.</b> This is because they were exposed to schooling <b>at</b> <b>a</b> younger <b>age.</b> We assess the extent to which early gains in test scores attributable to enrolling <b>at</b> <b>a</b> younger <b>age</b> decline as children progress through school {{and the extent to which}} the benefit of early enrollment is due to family background characteristics. 12 / 05 / 97 newchidev...|$|R

5|$|Ottoman scouts {{reported}} to Suleiman {{that there were}} untouched villages near Vaslui, and the Ottomans headed for that region. The winter {{made it difficult to}} set camp, which forced the Ottomans to move quickly and head for the Moldavian capital, Suceava. To reach Vaslui, where the Moldavian army had its main camp, they needed to cross Podul Înalt over the Bârlad River. The bridge was made of wood and not suitable for heavy transportation of troops. Stephen chose that area for the battle – the same location where his father, Bogdan II, had defeated the Poles in 1450; and where he, <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of 17, had fought side-by-side with Vlad 'the Impaler'. The area was ideal for the defenders: the valley was a semi-oval surrounded on all sides by hills covered by forest. Inside the valley, the terrain was marshy, which restricted troop movement. Suleiman had full confidence in his troops and made few efforts to scout the area.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, {{when they make}} a fruity and aromatic wine which may have aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> exceeding 100 years.|$|E
5|$|The near {{simultaneous}} {{appearance of}} nodosaurids in both North America and Europe {{is worthy of}} consideration, because at the time, they were separated from each other by a huge body of water. Europelta is the oldest nodosaurid from Europe; it {{is derived from the}} lower Albian Escucha Formation. The oldest western North American nodosaurid is Sauropelta, from the lower Albian Little Sheep Mudstone Member of the Cloverly Formation, <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of 108.5±0.2million years. Eastern North American fossils seem older. Teeth of Priconodon crassus have been derived from the Arundel Clay of the Potomac Group of Maryland, which dates near the Aptian–Albian boundary. A Propanoplosaurus hatchling was uncovered {{from the base of the}} underlying Patuxent Formation, dated to the upper Aptian, making Propanoplosaurus the oldest nodosaurid.|$|E

5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E
5|$|Ram Narayan {{was born}} on 25 December 1927 in Amber village, near Udaipur in northwestern India. His great-great-grandfather, Bagaji Biyavat, was a singer from Amber, and he and Narayan's great-grandfather, Sagad Danji Biyavat, sang at the court of the Maharana of Udaipur. Narayan's grandfather, Har Lalji Biyavat, and father, Nathuji Biyavat, were farmers and singers, Nathuji played the bowed {{instrument}} dilruba, and Narayan's mother was a music lover. Narayan's first language was Rajasthani and he learned Hindi and, later, English. <b>At</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of about six, he found a small sarangi left by the family's Ganga guru, a genealogist, and was taught a fingering technique developed by his father. Narayan's father taught him, but {{was worried about the}} difficulty of playing the sarangi and its association with courtesan music, which gave the instrument a low social status. After a year, Biyavat sought lessons for his son from sarangi player Mehboob Khan of Jaipur, but changed his mind when Khan told him Narayan would have to change his fingering technique. Narayan's father later encouraged him to leave school and devote himself to playing the sarangi.|$|E
