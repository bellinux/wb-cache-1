The preamble to the States of Jersey Law 2005 declares that 'it is recognized that Jersey has <b>autonomous</b> <b>capacity</b> in domestic affairs' and 'it is further recognized that there is an increasing need for Jersey to participate in matters of international affairs'. In July 2005, the Policy and Resources Committee of the States of Jersey established the Constitutional Review Group, chaired by Sir Philip Bailhache, with terms of reference 'to conduct a review and evaluation of the potential advantages and disadvantages for Jersey in seeking independence from the United Kingdom or other incremental change in the constitutional relationship, while retaining the Queen as Head of State'. The Group's 'Second Interim Report' was presented to the States by the Council of Ministers in June 2008. In January 2011, one of Jersey's Council of Ministers was for the first time designated as having responsibility for external relations and is often described as the island's 'minister'. Proposals for Jersey independence have not, however, gained significant political or popular support. In October 2012 the Council of Ministers issued a [...] "Common policy for external relations" [...] that set out a number of principles for the conduct of external relations in accordance with existing undertakings and agreements. This document noted that Jersey [...] "is a self-governing, democratic country with the power of self-determination" [...] and [...] "that it is not Government policy to seek independence from the United Kingdom, but rather to ensure that Jersey is prepared if it were {{in the best interests of}} Islanders to do so". On the basis of the established principles the Council of Ministers decided to [...] "ensure that Jersey is prepared for external change that may affect the Island’s formal relationship with the United Kingdom and/or European Union".|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe 35 kDa thioesterase (TE) domain excised {{from the}} {{megadalton}} tyrocidine synthetase (Tyc Syn) retains <b>autonomous</b> <b>capacity</b> to macrocyclize peptidyl thioesters to D-Phe 1 -L-Leu 10 -macrolactams. Since {{a number of}} nonribosomal peptides undergo O-glycosylation events during tailoring to gain biological activity, the Tyc Syn TE domain was evaluated for cyclization capacity with glycosylated peptidyl-S-NAC substrates. First, Tyr 7 was replaced with Tyr(β-D-Gal) and Tyr(β-D-Glc) {{as well as with}} Ser-containing β-linked D-Gal, D-Glc, D-GlcNAc, and D-GlcNH 2, and these new analogs were shown to be cyclized with comparable kcat/Km catalytic efficiency. Similarly, Gal- or tetra-O-acetyl-Gal-Ser could also be substituted at residues 5, 6, and 8 in the linear decapeptidyl-S-NAC sequences and cyclized without substantial loss in catalytic efficiency by Tyc Syn TE. The cyclic glycopeptides retained antibiotic activity as membrane perturbants in MIC assays, opening the possibility for library construction of cyclic glycopeptides by enzymatic macrocyclization...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCellular uptake of vector {{peptides}} {{used for}} internalization of hydrophilic molecules into cells {{is known to}} follow two different pathways: direct translocation of the plasma membrane and internalization by endocytosis followed by release into the cytosol. These pathways differ in their energy dependence. The first does not need metabolic energy while the second requires metabolic energy. Herein we used erythrocytes and plasma membrane vesicles to study membrane perturbations induced by the cell penetrating peptide penetratin. The results show that cell penetrating peptides are able to be internalized by two metabolic energy-independent pathways: direct crossing of the plasma membrane and endocytosis-like mechanisms. The last mechanism involves the induction of membrane negative curvature resulting in invaginations that mimic the endosomal uptake {{in the absence of}} ATP. This new mechanism called "physical endocytosis" or "self-induced endocytosis" might explain different data concerning the independence or dependence on metabolic energy during cellular uptake and reveals the <b>autonomous</b> <b>capacity</b> of peptides to induce their internalization...|$|E

Although SALL is promoted widely in the tertiary sector, it is often treated as external to language courses due to the challenges in linking SALL and classroom learning and the difficulties in measuring learning gains. This paper presents findings of part of an ongoing study which examines the effectiveness of a SALL component of a taught English enhancement course in promoting learner autonomy in a Hong Kong University. In an attempt to compare students’ levels of autonomy before and after taking the course, two questionnaires which contain parallel items were administered to 163 students at {{the beginning and the end}} of the course. The questionnaire items were developed with reference to Benson’s (2011) definition of autonomy in language learning which contains three levels of control: learning management, learning contents and cognitive processes.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between income inequality and state capacity in South Korea. Korea achieved rapid economic growth accompanied by equity from the 1960 s to the mid 1990 s. However, after the 1997 IMF financial crisis, income inequality in Korea increased dramatically. This change in income inequality is closely related to increases in unemployment and underemployment. I argue that such failures in the labor market are attributed to the rapid decline of the state's capacity after financial liberalization in 1993. During the developmental era, the state had been able to form institutions for low income inequality, due to its relative autonomy from business owners. After the financial liberalization no such <b>autonomous</b> <b>capacity</b> to build employment-protective institutions existed, as these reforms increased the influence of domestic and international capital. Further, the weakening of the state's capacity also reflects changes in the relationship of the Korean economy to the world system...|$|E
40|$|Concrete is {{a mixture}} of cement, water, sand and other {{aggregates}} in adequate proportions. Its high tensile strength and ability to withstand a vast range of environmental changes makes it the first choice for construction material. One of the major problems associated with concrete is its permeability because penetration of gases and/or liquids from the surrounding environment into the concrete, followed by physical and/or chemical reactions within its internal structure/s leads to irreversible damages. Although cement has <b>autonomous</b> <b>capacity</b> to heal, however cracks < 0. 2 mm width can only self-heal. Biomineralization {{is one of the best}} ecofriendly techniques to tackle the problem of cracks in concrete structures. Biologically induced self-healing is beneficial in addressing all the drawbacks of concrete matrix. The most promising technology for producing crack resistant/highly self healing concrete in near future seems to be “BacillaFilla”: genetically modified version of Bacillus subtilis, is a “custom –designed” bacteria to embed deep into the cracks in concrete where they produce a mix of calcium carbonate and a special bacteria glue that hardens to the same strength as of the surrounding concrete...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{describe}} {{the different ways}} in which illness represents an existential problem, and its implications for shared decision-making. METHODS: We explore core concepts of shared decision-making in medical encounters (uncertainty, vulnerability, dependency, autonomy, power, trust, responsibility) to interpret and explain existing results and propose a broader understanding of shared-decision making for future studies. RESULTS: Existential aspects of being are physical, social, psychological, and spiritual. Uncertainty and vulnerability caused by illness expose these aspects and may lead to dependency on the provider, which underscores that autonomy is not just an individual status, but also a varying capacity, relational of nature. In shared decision-making, power and trust are important factors that may increase as well as decrease the patient's dependency, particularly as information overload may increase uncertainty. CONCLUSION: The fundamental uncertainty, state of vulnerability, and lack of power of the ill patient, imbue shared decision-making with a deeper existential significance and call for greater attention to the emotional and relational dimensions of care. Hence, we propose that the aim of shared decision-making should be restoration of the patient's <b>autonomous</b> <b>capacity.</b> PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: In doing shared decision-making, care is needed to encompass existential aspects; informing and exploring preferences is not enough...|$|E

40|$|What is {{happening}} to local production systems in Europe? Combining knowledge from case-study literature with original analyses of statistical data, this book presents an institutional analysis of specialized clusters of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} in Britain, France, Germany and Italy, showing the considerable diversity of forms they take. Many modes of governance - certain forms of market, cooperation among themselves, joining associations, networking with larger firms located in the same area, or making use of local facilities provided by governmental or other external agencies - enable small firms to become part of local production systems. The international comparison shows that such patterns of governance can often be attributed to national differences. While the importance of local production systems is increasing, their most rapidly growing form - groups of small suppliers which depend on a major customer firm - may undermine their <b>autonomous</b> <b>capacities</b> in the future. 1 Patrick Le Galès and Helmut Voelzkow: Introduction: The Governance of Local Economies 2 Andrés Rodriguez-Pose: Local Production Systems and Economic Performance in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom 3 Luigi Burroni and Carlo Trigilia: Italy: Economic Development through Local Economies 4 Ulrich Glassmann and Helmut Voelzkow: The Governance of Local Economies in Germany 5 Valeria Aniello and Patrick Le Galès: Between Large Firms and Marginal Local Economies: The Making of Systems of Local Governance in France 6 Colin Crouch and Henry Farrell: Great Britain: Falling through the Holes in the Network Concept 7 Colin Crouch and Carlo Trigilia: Conclusions: Still Local Economies in Global Capitalism...|$|R

40|$|This article {{interprets the}} settler-colonial {{situation}} as fundamentally {{premised on the}} irruption into a specific locale of a sovereign collective of settlers. A comprehensive body of historical and postcolonial literature highlights how the colonial situation is premised on the sustained reproduction {{of a series of}} exclusive dichotomies. In contrast, this article argues that the settler-colonial situation establishes a system of relationships comprising three different agencies: the settler colonizer, the indigenous colonized, and a variety of differently categorized exogenous 'Others. ' In this context, indigenous and subaltern exogenous Others appeal to the European sovereign to articulate grievances emanating from settler abuse, the metropolitan agency interposes its sovereignty between settler and indigenous or subaltern exogenous communities, and settlers insist on their <b>autonomous</b> <b>capacity</b> to control indigenous policy. The capacity to manage the population economy of a settler locale is thus a crucial marker of a settler substantive sovereignty. Significantly, however, the settler-colonial situation is generally understood as an inherently dynamic circumstance where indigenous and exogenous Others are understood as progressively disappearing in a variety of ways. Only the settler body politic in its ultimate sovereign assertion against metropolitan interference and against indigenous residues or other insurgencies is expected to survive an inherently temporary triangulation...|$|E
