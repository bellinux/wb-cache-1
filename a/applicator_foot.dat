40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis is on the design, operation and testing of a programmable adhesive tape applicator 'EziStick'. The system demonstrates a mechatronics system comprised of mechanical, electronic and computer systems. 'EziStick' is capable of identifying any tape edge and then initialising and loading the tape over the <b>applicator</b> <b>foot</b> for successful application of tape. The tape tension monitoring system will allow continuous monitoring of the tape tension during its application. 'EziStick' is currently attached {{to the end of}} a robot arm to enhance its work envelope. The system is controlled via a low cost microcontroller and it is highly modular and transportable. 'EziStick' may be attached {{to the end of a}}ny robot (machines) with various degrees of freedom. In this way the cost of the system is adjusted by the complexity of the application. The experimental results showed that there is a relationship between the tape application speed and the quality of its application. Although the current prototype is designed for the application of aluminium tape, tests have indicated that other types of tape can be used in 'EziStick'...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic use of high-amplitude {{pressure}} waves, or {{shock wave}} therapy (SWT), {{is emerging as}} a popular method for treating musculoskeletal disorders. However, the mechanism(s) through which this technique promotes healing are unclear. Finite element models of a shock wave source and the foot were constructed {{to gain a better}} understanding of the mechanical stimuli that SWT produces in the context of plantar fasciitis treatment. The model of the shock wave source was based on the geometry of an actual radial shock wave device, in which pressure waves are generated through the collision of two metallic objects: a projectile and an <b>applicator.</b> The <b>foot</b> model was based on the geometry reconstructed from magnetic resonance images of a volunteer and it comprised bones, cartilage, soft tissue, plantar fascia, and Achilles tendon. Dynamic simulations were conducted of a single and of two successive shock wave pulses administered to the foot. The collision between the projectile and the applicator resulted in a stress wave in the applicator. This wave was transmitted into the soft tissue in the form of compression-rarefaction pressure waves with an amplitude of the order of several MPa. The negative pressure at the plantar fascia reached values of over 1. 5 Â MPa, which could be sufficient to generate cavitation in the tissue. The results also show that multiple shock wave pulses may have a cumulative effect in terms of strain energy accumulation in the foot...|$|R
