40|$|A {{detailed}} {{finite element}} analysis of the right rear lug of the American Airlines Flight 587 - Airbus A 300 - 600 R was performed {{as part of the}} National Transportation Safety Board s failure investigation of the accident that occurred on November 12, 2001. The loads experienced by the right rear lug are evaluated using global models of the vertical tail, local models near the right rear lug, and a global-local analysis procedure. The right rear lug was analyzed using two modeling approaches. In the first approach, solid-shell type modeling is used, and in the second approach, layered-shell type modeling is used. The solid-shell and the layered-shell modeling approaches were used in progressive failure analyses (PFA) to determine the load, mode, and location of failure in the right rear lug under loading representative of an Airbus certification test conducted in 1985 (the 1985 -certification test). Both analyses were in excellent agreement with each other on the predicted failure loads, failure mode, and location of failure. The solid-shell type modeling was then used to analyze both a subcomponent test conducted by Airbus in 2003 (the 2003 -subcomponent test) and the <b>accident</b> <b>condition.</b> Excellent agreement was observed between the analyses and the observed failures in both cases. From the analyses conducted and presented in this paper, the following conclusions were drawn. The moment, Mx (moment about the fuselage longitudinal axis), has significant effect on the failure load of the lugs. Higher absolute values of Mx give lower failure loads. The predicted load, mode, and location of the failure of the 1985 -certification test, 2003 -subcomponent test, and the <b>accident</b> <b>condition</b> are in very good agreement. This agreement suggests that the 1985 -certification and 2003 - subcomponent tests represent the <b>accident</b> <b>condition</b> accurately. The failure mode of the right rear lug for the 1985 -certification test, 2003 -subcomponent test, and the accident load case is identified as a cleavage-type failure. For the accident case, the predicted failure load for the right rear lug from the PFA is greater than 1. 98 times the limit load of the lugs. I...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEven {{though the}} {{potential}} for an accident in nuclear power plants is very low, multiple emergency plans are necessary because the impact of such an accident to the public is enormous. One of these emergency plans involves a robotic system for investigating <b>accidents</b> under <b>conditions</b> of high radiation and contaminated air. To develop a robot suitable for operation in a nuclear power plant, we focused on eliminating the three major obstacles that challenge robots in such conditions: the disconnection of radio communication, falling on uneven floors, and loss of localization. To solve the radio problem, a Wi-Fi extender was used in radio shadow areas. To reinforce the walking, we developed two- and four-leg convertible walking, a floor adaptive foot, a roly-poly defensive falling design, and automatic standing recovery after falling methods were developed. To allow the robot to determine its location in the containment building, a bar code landmark reading method was chosen. When a severe accident occurs, this robot will be useful for <b>accident</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring. We also anticipate the robot {{can serve as a}} workman aid in a high radiation area during normal operations...|$|R

40|$|Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) has {{designed}} an impact-limiting {{system for a}} small, lightweight radioactive material shipping container. The Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC) is developing this Type B package for the shipment of tritium, replacing the outdated LP- 50 shipping container. Regulatory accident resistance requirements for Type B packages, including this new tritium package, are specified in 10 CFR 71 (NRC 1983). The regulatory requirements include a 9 -meter free drop onto an unyielding target, a 1 -meter drop onto a mild steel punch, and a 30 -minute 800 {degrees} C fire test. Impact limiters are used to protect the package in the free-drop <b>accident</b> <b>condition</b> in any impact orientation without hindering the package`s resistance to the thermal <b>accident</b> <b>condition.</b> The overall design of the new package {{is based on a}} modular concept using separate thermal shielding and impact mitigating components in an attempt to simplify the design, analysis, test, and certification process. Performance requirements for the tritium package`s limiting system are based on preliminary estimates provided by WSRC. The current tritium hydride vessel (THV) to be transported has relatively delicate valving assemblies and should not experience acceleration levels greater than approximately 200 g`s. A thermal overpack and outer stainless steel shell, to be designed by WSRC, will form the inner boundary of the impact-limiting system (see Figure 1). The mass of the package, including cargo, inner container, thermal overpack, and outer stainless steel shell (not including impact limiters) should be approximately 68 kg. Consistent with the modular design philosophy, the combined thermal overpack and containment system should be considered essentially rigid, with the impact limiters incurring all deformation...|$|R
