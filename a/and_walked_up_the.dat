25|$|Today, {{it is well}} {{established}} that Caspar had been niggling Coleman since the very start of the match, which included making persistent and heavy contact with a nasty boil on Coleman's neck; and that Caspar had punched Coleman twice whilst play was {{at the other end}} of the ground, immediately before Coleman retaliated; and that, apart from his reaction to Caspar's thuggery, Coleman had not been proactive in any way. The match to that time had been a somewhat brutal encounter, and the crowd was highly agitated. During the match bottles were thrown at Coleman, and as he came off the ground at half-time, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> players race, a Carlton fan spat at him through gaps in the cyclone wired barriers that separated the spectators from the players. Coleman snapped, and smashed the fan in the face, badly hurting his hand. He went into the Essendon rooms, shouting with rage at the total absence of any protection from the match officials, took off his jumper, and spoke of not returning to the field.|$|E

60|$|WILLIS: 'I don't {{know what}} you're up to.' He shrugs his {{shoulders}} <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the coach}} reached the narrowest {{part of the}} pass, <b>the</b> driver pulled <b>up,</b> and intimated that, [...] "she would be obleeged if the leddies and gentlemen would get down <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> brae." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{cut across}} into Sixth Avenue, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{stairs to the}} station of the Elevated Railway. A train was just coming in.|$|E
60|$|And {{at last we}} came to the landing, and moored {{the little}} boat <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> winding path to the hotel. The dull pain of {{separation}} was already upon us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hit ’ard and hit straight," [...] ses the {{landlord}} to Ginger {{in a low}} voice, as {{they got out of}} the train <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> road. [...] "’Ow are you feeling?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The opening scene, where Sylvester simply crosses <b>the</b> street <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{stairs to}} the room Tweety is located in. An unseen woman tells him [...] "SCAT!" [...] and throws plates at him. Sylvester scurries {{down the stairs and}} out of the building.|$|R
50|$|Once you arrive, the MoA {{is located}} {{to the left}} of the main gate of the Seoul National University Gwanak Campus. Take the subway or a bus to <b>the</b> main gate <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{staircase}} of the amphi-plaza which is {{to the left of}} the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{will do that}} at once. You {{had better}} go with her outside the station, and the porter shall take you on from there. If you were to get off <b>the</b> {{platform}} here <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lines, others would notice it, {{and there would be}} an immediate rush." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{nodded to}} him, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{street to the}} house of her friend Sally. Having arrived in front of it, she put her hands to her mouth in trumpet form, and shouted: ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} a stout gentleman opened the garden gate <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> path {{leading to the}} bower. At the same moment Miss Pritty issued {{from the house and}} echoed the green-grocer's boy's announcement.|$|E
6000|$|He locked {{his arm in}} Blucher's <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{street to}} where the {{passengers}} were few and the light not strong, and then facing about, put out {{his hands in a}} beseeching way, and said: ...|$|E
5000|$|Walk {{down the}} road to <b>the</b> beach <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> gorge back to the village (about 4 h total). The {{opposite}} (down <b>the</b> gorge and <b>up</b> <b>the</b> road) is not recommended on a sunny day because the road is not shaded and you will be walking uphill and under the sun, the gorge however is almost entirely shaded.|$|R
50|$|Over Silton Estate {{was passed}} to Miss Hinde (their only child) {{and she was}} known by her tenants as being a recluse and quite pedantic in nature. Stories are that she would arrive at <b>the</b> village unannounced <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> village {{inspecting}} the upkeep of the gardens. Miss Hinde lived in hotels {{and did not have}} a home.|$|R
60|$|A {{little later}} the train made a stop of several minutes at quite a large city. The boys {{were tired of}} sitting still and were glad enough {{to go out on}} the {{platform}} to stretch their legs. Here they saw Professor Lemm and his friend leave <b>the</b> train <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> main street of the place.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days later}} he heard the rumble of an {{approaching}} supply train <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> track to meet it. The locomotive stopped farther off than he expected, and a woman got down. Running forward, he {{saw that it was}} Helen.|$|E
60|$|Without {{another word}} the two chums started {{off in the}} {{direction}} of the ranch house, so many miles distant. The others, watched them out of sight, and then turned <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river bank toward the shack Belle had mentioned.|$|E
60|$|At {{last they}} reached Court Leys <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> avenue {{that led to}} the house. They saw Dick hurrying towards them. They waved their hands, but he did not reply, and, when he approached, they saw that his face was white and anxious.|$|E
6000|$|Alice {{laughed and}} blushed, {{but she was}} not vexed. She liked to have him {{understand}} her. [...] "Well, now," [...] she said, as if that were the next thing, [...] "I'm going to cross here at once <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> other pavement, <b>and</b> you must go back through the Garden; or else I shall never get away from you." ...|$|R
60|$|Fergus {{dismounted}} at <b>the</b> gate, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> house. The maid {{who opened}} the door recognized him at once.|$|R
5000|$|Clemson Football. Clemson {{football}} games {{have always been}} a draw for boaters on Lake Hartwell. The University and stadium tower over the lake. During football season, boats from all over <b>the</b> lake travel <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Seneca River to come watch the games. You can park your boat {{on the left side of}} the long earth dike <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill to the famous Esso Club or to the game.|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} churchyard {{on the side}} {{opposite}} to his point of entrance, and went down the hill. Slowly he drew near the gate of her house. This he softly opened, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> gravel drive to the door. Here he paused for several minutes.|$|E
60|$|Here was, indeed, a chance. Robert eagerly assented, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> winding drive {{amid the}} growing fir-trees. When {{he found his}} uncouth guide, however, marching {{straight}} across the broad, gravel square to the main entrance, {{he felt that he}} had placed himself in a false position.|$|E
60|$|They {{left the}} subway at Ninety-sixth Street <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Drive. Jimmy, like every one else {{who saw it}} for the first time, {{experienced}} a slight shock {{at the sight of the}} Pett mansion, but, rallying, followed his uncle up the flagged path to the front door.|$|E
60|$|Then {{a sudden}} {{determination}} sprang {{up in his}} mind. Without a second thought he entered <b>the</b> office <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> desk.|$|R
50|$|Features {{include a}} Redwood Avenue of Giant Sequoias planted in 1863, large square walled gardens, a waterfall, a fernery, ponds <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{hillside}} {{to where you}} can look out across the Holy Loch. A cafe {{can be found at}} the entrance as well as a shop. The garden is located within the Argyll Forest Park, which is itself within the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stepped into}} his boat, <b>and</b> Jorgenson <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> jetty. Lingard, {{clearing}} the yoke lines, heard him call {{out from a}} distance: ...|$|R
60|$|He rose <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{long white}} avenue, going as slowly and silently as possible, for {{he did not}} wish to {{interrupt}} the player. When he reached the open space of the garden he stopped short in new amazement and was again tempted into thinking he must certainly be dreaming.|$|E
60|$|Bertha {{would have}} given a good deal to avoid this visit, but seeing no way to escape she stepped from the {{carriage}} under the keen scrutiny of her hostess <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rickety steps with something of the same squeamish care she would have shown on entering a cow-barn.|$|E
60|$|The {{silence was}} broken by a rattle of leather and a jingle of steel that startled them, and as they turned quickly <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> path a dark figure rose out of the gloom ahead and stood before them, {{sinister}} and threatening. When Walthew had answered the sentry's challenge, Blanca shivered.|$|E
60|$|And {{he turned}} <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>up</b> <b>the</b> path. He had taken perhaps a dozen steps {{when she called}} him.|$|R
5000|$|Outside {{the concert}} hall, Ash chases after Chloe, {{wanting to make}} things right, and they {{reconcile}} ("A Million Love Songs"). Later, at the church where wedding guests are arriving, the children's choir and priest are on the pulpit. Ash and Chloe enter <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> isle under a trumpet fanfare of [...] "Never Forget". The children's choir sing as the couple are married, and after the ceremony is complete, all join in.|$|R
60|$|Dave <b>and</b> Roger <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stream a {{distance}} of several hundred yards. They continued to call Phil's name, but as before, no answer came back.|$|R
