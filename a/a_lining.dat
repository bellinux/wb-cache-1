5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} <b>a</b> <b>lining</b> of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} breeds {{from the}} age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and <b>a</b> <b>lining</b> of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} domed, {{though it may}} lack a roof in {{enclosed}} sites. It has an outer layer of stems and roots, a middle layer of dead grass and leaves, and <b>a</b> <b>lining</b> of feathers, {{as well as of}} paper and other soft materials. Nests typically have external dimensions of 20 × 30cm (8 × 12in), but their size varies greatly. The building of the nest is initiated by the unmated male while displaying to females. The female assists in building, but is less active than the male. Some nest building occurs throughout the year, especially after moult in autumn. In colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests, or roost in street lights, to avoid losing heat during the winter. House sparrows do not hold territories, but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders of the same sex.|$|E

25|$|Industrial {{chimneys}} {{are commonly}} referred to as flue gas stacks and are generally external structures, as opposed to those built into the wall of a building. They are generally located adjacent to a steam-generating boiler or industrial furnace and the gases are carried to them with ductwork. Today the use of reinforced concrete has almost entirely replaced brick as a structural component in the construction of industrial chimneys. Refractory bricks are often used as <b>a</b> <b>lining,</b> particularly if the type of fuel being burned generates flue gases containing acids. Modern industrial chimneys sometimes consist of a concrete windshield with a number of flues on the inside.|$|E

25|$|For {{a period}} {{following}} {{the second world}} war, pure nickel was electroplated as <b>a</b> <b>lining</b> to copper cookware. Nickel {{had the advantage of}} being harder and more thermally efficient than tin, with a higher melting point. Despite its hardness nickel's wear characteristics were similar to that of tin, as nickel would be plated only to a thickness of <20 microns, and often even less owing to nickel's tendency to plate somewhat irregularly, requiring milling to produce an even cooking surface, albeit sticky compared to tin and silver. Copper cookware with aged or damaged nickel linings is eligible for retinning, or possibly replating with nickel, although this service is difficult if not impossible to find in the US and Europe in the early 21st century. Nickel linings began to fall out of favor in the 1980s owing to the isolation of nickel as an allergen.|$|E
25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful {{in the manufacture of}} articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as <b>a</b> <b>lining</b> for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.|$|E

500|$|The {{issue was}} {{resolved}} in November 2010 when a nest {{was found in}} the top of a rotting tree stump, [...] above ground level and [...] in from the edge of a dry swamp forest in Aketajawe-Lolobata National Park. The nest depression was [...] in depth, with a lower layer of small wood chips at its base and <b>a</b> <b>lining</b> of dead leaves. The egg shells were brownish-white with dark brown and black markings of different sizes. The two very young chicks were entirely covered in black down, contrasting with a white pollux (the equivalent of the thumbnail on a human hand) and pink index nail. The bill was black with a white tip, and the legs were black-streaked brown. The eyes had grey irises and blue pupils. Rail chicks leave the nest soon after hatching, so the chicks were assumed to be only a day or two old.|$|E
500|$|The male common {{chiffchaff}} {{returns to}} its breeding territory {{two or three}} weeks before the female and immediately starts singing to establish ownership and attract a female. When a female is located, the male will use a slow butterfly-like flight as part of the courtship ritual, but once a pair-bond has been established, other females will be driven from the territory. The male has little involvement in the nesting process other than defending the territory. The female's nest is built on or near the ground in a concealed site in brambles, nettles or other dense low vegetation. The domed nest has a side entrance, and is constructed from coarse plant material such as dead leaves and grass, with finer material used on the interior before the addition of <b>a</b> <b>lining</b> of feathers. [...] The typical nest is 12.5centimetres (5in) high and 11centimetres (4in) across.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} breeds in well-grown, extensive {{areas of}} woodland, often coniferous or mixed, preferring forest with a structure neither too dense nor too open, {{to allow a}} choice of flight paths. The nest can {{be located in the}} fork of a tree, often near the trunk and where two or three branches begin, on a horizontal branch in the lower canopy, or near the top of a tall shrub. If available, conifers are preferred. A new nest is built every year, generally close to the nest of the previous year, and sometimes using an old wood pigeon (A. n. melaschistos frequently uses the old nests of jungle crows) nest as a base; the male does most of the work. The structure, made of loose twigs up to [...] long, has an average diameter of [...] When the eggs are laid, <b>a</b> <b>lining</b> of fine twigs or bark chippings is added.|$|E

50|$|In modern European poetry, a caesura {{is defined}} as a natural phrase end, {{especially}} when occurring in the middle of <b>a</b> <b>line.</b> <b>A</b> masculine caesura follows a stressed syllable while a feminine caesura follows an unstressed syllable. A caesura is also described by its position in <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of poetry: <b>a</b> caesura close to the beginning of <b>a</b> <b>line</b> is called <b>an</b> initial caesura, one in the middle of <b>a</b> <b>line</b> is medial, and one near the end of <b>a</b> <b>line</b> is terminal. Initial and terminal caesurae are rare in formal, Romance, and Neoclassical verse, which prefer medial caesurae.|$|R
500|$|The {{breeding}} season starts in May in Poland but further north in Scandinavia may not start until early July. The female fieldfare builds a cup-shaped nest with no attempt at concealment. The location is often in woodland {{but may be}} in a hedgerow, garden, among rocks, in a pile of logs, in a hut or on the ground. Fieldfares usually nest in close proximity to others of the same species. The adults will defend the nest aggressively and nesting gregariously may offer protection from predators. The nest is built of dried grasses and weeds with a few twigs and a little moss, with <b>a</b> <b>lining</b> of mud and an inner lining of fine grasses. There are usually five to six eggs in a clutch, but occasionally three, four, seven or eight eggs are laid. The eggs vary in size from [...] to [...] and are variable in colour. Many are pale blue speckled with fine brown dots and resemble those of the common blackbird. Others are bright blue, with or without larger red-brown splotches. Incubation starts before all the eggs are laid and lasts for thirteen to fourteen days. The female does all or most of the incubation. The chicks are altricial and both parents bring food to them. They are usually ready to leave the nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods in the season, especially in the southern parts of the breeding range.|$|E
