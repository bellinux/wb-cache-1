5|$|The Opies {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} use of truce terms throughout England, Scotland and Wales in the 1950s and published their results in <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>called</b> <b>The</b> Lore and Language of Schoolchildren. They found truce terms varied according to geographical location, with the exception of pax. In some places, more than one term was current and often four or five were known, although usually only one term predominated. Schools bordering two linguistic regions honoured both. The words used in urban areas were often at odds with words used in the surrounding countryside. The Opies recorded around 45 truce terms plus variations. The most widely used were barley, fainites, kings, crosses, keys, skinch, cree and scribs.|$|E
