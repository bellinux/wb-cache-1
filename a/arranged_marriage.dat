50|$|The {{practice}} of endogamous consanguineous marriage dramatically limits the marriagable pool; it inherently encourages <b>marriages</b> <b>arranged</b> according to tradition and birth.

In Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, majority (65%+) of all marriages are endogamous and consanguineous <b>arranged</b> <b>marriages.</b> More than 40% of all marriages are endogamous and consanguineous in Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Sudan, Libya and Mauritania; and over 1 in 5 marriages in Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, regions of Nigeria, India and Malaysia with high Muslim populations are endogamous and consanguineous <b>arranged</b> <b>marriages.</b> Among these Islamic populations, <b>arranged</b> <b>marriages</b> include endogamous and non-consanguineous marriages, and therefore exceed the above observed rates of endogamous and consanguineous marriages.|$|R

5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about their {{marriage}} comes from an account Mao gave to the American reporter Edgar Snow in 1936, which Snow included in his book Red Star Over China.

Luo was eighteen and Mao just fourteen {{years old at the time}} of their betrothal. Although Mao took part in the wedding ceremony, he later stated that he was unhappy with the marriage, never consummating it and refusing to live with his wife. Socially disgraced, she lived with Mao's parents for two years until she died of dysentery, while he moved out of the village to continue his studies elsewhere, eventually becoming a founding member of the Communist Party of China. Various biographers have suggested that Mao's experience of this marriage affected his later views, leading him to become a critic of <b>arranged</b> <b>marriage</b> and a vocal feminist. He would marry three more times throughout his life, to Yang Kaihui, He Zizhen and Jiang Qing, the last of whom was better known as Madame Mao.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} if self-arranged marriages (or love marriages) {{have replaced}} parent-arranged marriages {{as the dominant}} form of marriage in India. In particular, I examine if women of recent cohorts (born around 1980) {{are less likely to}} report <b>arranged</b> <b>marriages</b> than women of older cohorts (born around 1956). I also examine if educated women are less likely to report <b>arranged</b> <b>marriages</b> than their less educated counterparts. Results from multinomial regression analysis suggest that women of recent cohorts are more likely to report a parent <b>arranged</b> <b>marriages</b> with their consent. Education is associated with greater autonomy in partner choice decision but it is most strongly associated with parent <b>arranged</b> <b>marriages</b> with consent. I conclude that in a context where a dating culture is not normative, parent <b>arranged</b> <b>marriages</b> with consent may {{be the best way to}} accommodate individual choice while retaining some of the traditional parental control over spouse choice...|$|R
