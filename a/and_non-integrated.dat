40|$|Introduction: Thrombocytopenia {{consists}} in {{a lack of}} blood platelets. Hereditary forms have limited therapeutic possibilities, such as platelets transfusions that only temporarily restore the defect {{and can lead to}} the formation of anti-platelet antibodies, reducing thus the effectiveness of subsequent infusions. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold the great potential to be differentiated into the cells of all the three germ layers, being moreover patient-specific and representing a great tool for the production of autologous platelets. Aim: aim {{of this study was to}} reprogram human somatic cells to iPSCs, for the treatment of platelet’s disorders. For this purpose iPSCs were derived from fibroblasts by both integrating <b>and</b> <b>non-integrating</b> methods <b>and</b> were differentiated along the hematopoietic lineage to give rise to platelets producing megakaryocytes. Materials and Methods: iPS cells were derived by three different reprogramming protocols including retroviral vectors (RV), Sendai virus vectors (SeV) and episomal vectors (EpV), all expressing the four transcription factors, OCT 4, SOX 2, KLF 4, c-Myc. iPSC clones were then fully characterized and differentiated into megakaryocytes by direct differentiation. Results: In this study more than thirty iPSCs clones were derived by RV and SeV transduction and EpV transfection. Six iPSCs clones were fully characterized. The reprogramming protocol based on adenoviral vectors (AdV) resulted inefficient. iPSCs-derived megakaryocytes appeared as multinucleated cells, with protrusions on the surface similar to the pro-platelets and able to release anucleate cells. Conclusions: iPS clones were successfully derived by integrating <b>and</b> <b>non-integrating</b> viral vectors, <b>and</b> <b>non-integrating</b> vectors. All characterized clones expressed all the markers of pluripotency as well as the markers of the three germ layers upon embryoid bodies (EBs) formation. A new protocol for direct differentiation of iPSCs into megakaryocytes was developed, holding a great potential for patient-specific treatment by a tailored-therapy for platelet disorder...|$|R

40|$|Human-induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (iPSCs) are derived from differentiated somatic cells using defined factors and provide a renewable source of autologous cells for cell therapy. Many reprogramming methods have been employed to generate human iPSCs, {{including the use of}} integrating vectors <b>and</b> <b>non-integrating</b> vectors. Maintenance of the genomic integrity of iPSCs is highly desirable if the cells are to be used in clinical applications. Here, using the Affymetrix Cytoscan HD array, we investigated the genomic aberration profiles of 19 human cell lines: 5 embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines, 6 iPSC lines derived using integrating vectors ("integrating iPSC lines"), 6 iPSC lines derived using non-integrating vectors ("non-integrating iPSC lines"), and the 2 parental cell lines from which the iPSCs were derived. The genome-wide copy number variation (CNV), loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and mosaicism patterns of integrating <b>and</b> <b>non-integrating</b> iPSC lines were investigated. The maximum sizes of CNVs in the genomes of the integrating iPSC lines were 20 times higher than those of the non-integrating iPSC lines. Moreover, the total number of CNVs was much higher in integrating iPSC lines than in other cell lines. The average numbers of novel CNVs with a low degree of overlap with the DGV and of likely pathogenic CNVs {{with a high degree of}} overlap with the ISCA (International Symposium on Computer Architecture) database were highest in integrating iPSC lines. Different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) calls revealed that, using the parental cell genotype as a reference, integrating iPSC lines displayed more single nucleotide variations and mosaicism than did non-integrating iPSC lines. This study describes the genome stability of human iPSCs generated using either a DNA-integrating or non-integrating reprogramming method, of the corresponding somatic cells, and of hESCs.

The goal of MRPII is to provide consistent data to all members in the manufacturing process as the product moves through the production line. Paper-based information systems <b>and</b> <b>non-integrated</b> computer systems that provide paper or disk outputs result in many information errors, including missing data, redundant data, numerical errors that result from being incorrectly keyed into the system, incorrect calculations based on numerical errors, and bad decisions based on incorrect or old data. In addition, some data is unreliable in non-integrated systems because the same data is categorized differently in the individual databases used by different functional areas. [...] MRPII systems begin with MRP, material requirements planning. MRP allows for the input of sales forecasts from sales and marketing, or of actual sales demand in the form of customers orders. These demands determine the raw materials demand. MRP and MRPII systems draw on a master production schedule, the breakdown of specific plans for each product on a line. While MRP allows for the coordination of raw materials purchasing, MRPII facilitates the development of a detailed production schedule that accounts for machine and labor capacity, scheduling the production runs according to the arrival of materials. An MRPII output is a final labor and machine schedule. Data about the cost of production, including machine time, labor time and materials used, as well as final production numbers, is provided from the MRPII system to accounting and finance.|$|E
40|$|Vertically {{integrated}} {{firms have}} repeatedly {{been accused of}} abusing a dominant position by refusing to sell the intermediate product to non-integrated downstream producers and thus to practice foreclosure. To evaluate the merit of such an accusation requires an adequate theory of vertical integration which allows to decide whether a refusal to sell follows straightforwardly from profit maximization or is driven by an intent to monopolize. We investigate whether {{in the case of}} successive oligopolies vertical integration is profitable for the participating firms and to what extent cross deliveries between integrated <b>and</b> <b>non-integrated</b> firms can be expected to arise. By contrast to the previous literature where at the downstream level Cournot competition has been assumed to prevail between integrated firms <b>and</b> <b>non-integrated</b> downstream producers, we propose a model where integrated firms <b>and</b> <b>non-integrated</b> upstream suppliers meet in Cournot competition and take as given the inverse demand function for both the final and the intermediate product. Game theory is invoked to examine whether an integrated firm will participate in the intermediate market. If marginal costs at the downstream level are constant and identical as between integrated <b>and</b> <b>non-integrated</b> firms, integrated firms will never wish to sell to non-integrated downstream producers they can, however, be expected to buy from non-integrated upstream suppliers. Utilizing theoretical implications regarding pass through of changes in marginal costs we find empirical evidence supporting the applicability of our model to the gasoline industry in Germany. We finally examine to what extent issues of competition policy and public regulation arise. Copyright Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005 Oligopoly, vertical integration, foreclosure,...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{efficacy}} and biosafety of lentiviral gene transfer {{is influenced by}} the design of the vector. To this end, properties of lentiviral vectors can be modified by using cis -acting elements such as the modification of the U 3 region of the LTR, the incorporation of the central flap (cPPT-CTS) element, or post-transcriptional regulatory elements such as the woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE). Recently, several studies evaluated the influence of the incorporation of insulators into the integrating lentiviral vector genome on transgene expression level and position effects. Methods In the present study, the influence of the matrix attachment region (MAR) of the mouse immunoglobulin-κ (Ig-κ) or the chicken lysozyme (ChL) gene was studied on three types of HIV- 1 -derived lentiviral vectors: self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors (LV), double-copy lentiviral vectors (DC) <b>and</b> <b>non-integrating</b> lentiviral vectors (NILVs) in different cell types: HeLa, HEK 293 T, NIH- 3 T 3, Raji, and T Jurkat cell lines and primary neural progenitors. Results and Discussion Our results demonstrate that the Ig-κ MAR in the context of LV slightly increases transduction efficiency only in Hela, NIH- 3 T 3 and Jurkat cells. In the context of double-copy lentiviral vectors, the Ig-κ MAR has no effect or even negatively influences transduction efficiency. In the same way, in the context of non-integrating lentiviral vectors, the Ig-κ MAR has no effect or even negatively influences transduction efficiency, except in differentiated primary neural progenitor cells. The ChL MAR in the context of integrating <b>and</b> <b>non-integrating</b> lentiviral vectors shows no effect or a decrease of transgene expression in all tested conditions. Conclusions This study demonstrates that MAR sequences not necessarily increase transgene expression and that the effect of these sequences is probably context dependent and/or vector dependent. Thus, this study highlights the importance to consider a MAR sequence in a given context. Moreover, other recent reports pointed out the potential effects of random integration of insulators on the expression level of endogenous genes. Taken together, these results show that the use of an insulator in a vector for gene therapy must be well assessed in the particular therapeutic context that it will be used for, and must be balanced with its potential genotoxic effects. </p...|$|R

40|$|Although {{significant}} advancement {{has been}} made in the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) field, current methods for iPSC derivation are labor intensive and costly. These methods involve manual selection, expansion, and characterization of multiple clones for each reprogrammed cell sample and therefore significantly hampers the feasibility of studies where a large number of iPSCs need to be derived. To develop higher throughput iPSC reprogramming methods, we generated iPSCs as a pooled culture using rigorous cell surface pluripotent marker selection with TRA- 1 - 60 or SSEA 4 antibodies followed by Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (MACS). We observed that pool-selected cells are similar or identical to clonally derived iPSC lines from the same donor by all criteria examined, including stable expression of endogenous pluripotency genes, normal karyotype, loss of exogenous reprogramming factors, and in vitro spontaneous and lineage directed differentiation potential. This strategy can be generalized for iPSC generation using both integrating <b>and</b> <b>non-integrating</b> reprogramming methods.

In this paper, we model a decentralised closed-loop supply chain consisting of a key component supplier <b>and</b> a <b>non-integrated</b> manufacturer, <b>and</b> demonstrate that the interaction between these players significantly impacts the economic and environmental implications of remanufacturing. In our model, the non-integrated manufacturer can purchase new components from the supplier to produce new products, and remanufacture used components to produce remanufactured products. Thus, the non-integrated manufacturer {{is not only a}} buyer but also a rival to the supplier. In a steady state period, we analyse the performances of an integrated manufacturer and the decentralised supply chain. We find that, although the integrated manufacturer always benefits from remanufacturing, the remanufacturing opportunity may constitute a lose-lose situation to the supplier <b>and</b> the <b>non-integrated</b> manufacturer, making their profits be lower than in an identical supply chain without remanufacturing. In addition, the non-integrated manufacturer may be worse off with a lower remanufacturing cost or a larger return rate of used products due to the interaction with the supplier.
