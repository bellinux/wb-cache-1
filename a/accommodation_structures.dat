40|$|A {{simplified}} variational {{model for}} the formation of convoluted <b>accommodation</b> <b>structures,</b> as seen in the hinge zones of larger-scale geological folds, is presented. The model encapsulates some important and intriguing nonlinear features, notably: infinite critical loads, formation of plastic hinges, and buckling on different length-scales. An inextensible elastic beam is forced by uniform overburden pressure and axial load into a V-shaped geometry dictated by formation of a plastic hinge. Using variational methods developed by Dodwell et al., upon which this paper leans heavily, energy minimisation leads to representation as a fourth-order nonlinear differential equation with free boundary conditions. Equilibrium solutions are found using numerical shooting techniques. Under the Maxwell stability criterion, it is recognised that global energy minimisers can exist with convoluted physical shapes. For such solutions, parallels can be drawn with some of the <b>accommodation</b> <b>structures</b> seen in exposed escarpments of real geological folds...|$|E

40|$|Persons {{of faith}} are now seeking {{religious}} exemptions from laws concerning sex, reproduction, and marriage {{on the ground}} that the law makes the objector complicit in the assertedly sinful conduct of others. We term claims of this kind, which were at issue in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, complicity-based conscience claims. Complicity-based conscience claims differ in form and in social logic from the claims featured in the free exercise cases that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) invokes. The distinctive features of complicity-based conscience claims matter, not because they make the claim for religious exemption any less authentic or sincere, but rather because accommodating claims of this kind has the potential to inflict material and dignitary harms on other citizens. Complicity claims focus on the conduct of others outside the faith community. Their accommodation therefore has potential to harm those whom the claimants view as sinning. Today complicity claims are asserted by growing numbers of Americans about contentious “culture war” issues. This dynamic amplifies the effects of accommodation. Faith claims that concern questions in democratic contest will escalate in number, and accommodation of the claims will be fraught with significance, not only for the claimants, but also for those whose conduct the claimants condemn. Some urge accommodation in the hopes of peaceful settlement, yet, as we show, complicity claims can provide an avenue to extend, rather than settle, conflict. We highlight the distinctive form and social logic of complicity-based conscience claims so that those debating accommodation do so with the impact on third parties fully in view. We show how concern about the third-party impact of <b>accommodation</b> <b>structured</b> the Court’s decision in Hobby Lobby and demonstrate how this concern {{is an integral part of}} RFRA’s compelling interest and narrow tailoring inquiries.

40|$|Evidence of pre- and syn-folding {{extension}} {{is widespread}} in the Bude Formation between Wanson Mouth and Sandy Mouth beach, north Cornwall. Early faults with an extensional geometry are common throughout the section leading to omission of small packets of strata. The faults are clearly tectonic as the fault planes are characteristically mineralised by vein-quartz which displays slickenside striae. They also have a well constrained geometry and there is absence of any chaotic disturbed sediment associated with deformation of unlithified sediment. Some of the early extensional faults have classic listric geometries, their trajectories curving sharply and abruptly into bed-parallel detachments. Displacements on individual faults are small (cmm) but cumulatively they may reflect considerable extension, The faults are easily distinguished from the late low-angle normal faults, well documented in the BGS memoir.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} the Variscan orogeny on the Upper Palaeozoic {{succession}} are recognizable throughout central and southern Ireland. The deformation can be zoned using structural styles and trends which illustrate a northward decrease in deformation intensity coupled with increasing control by pre-Variscan structures in the basement. The most intense deformation occurs {{to the south of}} the Dingle-Dungarvan line, where shortening approaches 50 % as a result of layer-parallel shortening, followed by buckling and finally thrusting. The deformatipn is considered to have developed above a shallow-dipping sole thrust which has been located offshore by the SWAT seismic reflection profiles. Cross-faults, which are common throughout the orogen, resulted from N-S shear couples; this is consistent with their origin as <b>accommodation</b> <b>structures</b> due to differential shortening along strike. The original shape of the Munster Basin has exerted a control on the distribution and overall facing of the major structures. The sole thrust extends {{to the north of the}} Dingle-Dungarvan line and the structural zonation of the orogen is due to variations in the stratigraphic level of this thrust. The Leinster Massif is considered to be essentially autochthonous; slip on the sole thrust decays towards the Massif which acted as a rigid, passive block and was partially responsible for the arcuate trend of the orogen...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn eubacteria, {{translation}} of defective messenger RNAs (mRNAs) produces truncated polypeptides that stall on the ribosome.

So far, {{a clear view of}} the structural movements of both the protein and RNA necessary to perform accommodation is still lacking. By using a construct containing the tRNA-like domain as well as the extended helix H 2 of tmRNA, we present a cryo-electron microscopy study of the process of <b>accommodation.</b> The <b>structure</b> suggests how tmRNA and SmpB move into the ribosome decoding site after the release of EF-Tu. GDP. While two SmpB molecules are bound per ribosome in a preaccommodated state, our results show that during accommodation the SmpB protein interacting with the small subunit decoding site stays in place while the one interacting with the large subunit moves away. Relative to canonical translation, an additional movement is observed due to the rotation of H 2. This suggests that the larger movement required to resume translation on a tmRNA internal open reading frame starts during accommodation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to find a concept for {{optimizing}} cost and revenue from providing private accommodation services. The aim is to display how linking all participants who provide private accommodation services into a logistics network will result in better and higher quality service for the guest and in reduced cost for the private accommodation provider. Design – This study researches private accommodation providers in the Primorsko - Goranska County. Primorsko - Goranska County has great potential for providing private accommodation services, but it does not have a well-organized system which could improve the quality of the provided services. Methodology – To prove the study’s thesis, scientific methods of analysis, synthesis, methods of induction and deduction, as well as historic and statistical methods have been employed. Furthermore, it includes data from the Department of Tourism, Office of the Croatian Government in Rijeka, as well as data obtained from the local Association of Private Accommodation HGK – PGŽ (Croatian Chamber of Economy in the Primorsko – Goranska County), data from the statistical yearbook, Institute for tourism as well as data from the Croatian Ministry of Tourism and other scientific and professional literature. Approach – The authors aim to prove that by linking all participants in the process of providing private accommodation into a logistics network would increase the quality of the service and simultaneously optimize the costs. The logistic solution which will be proposed in the “Results” section will provide answers to the suggestion whether private accommodation providers should enter into a system with its business surroundings, i. e. travel agencies, local administration community systems, tourist boards, commercial service associations, state institutions, etc. Findings – This research has reached the conclusion that private accommodation providers do not satisfy the principles of the logistic concept and that other participants in the process of providing private accommodation services (institutions) do not adequately support them. The logistic concept is not the final solution, but a foundation for further research. Originality of the research – This paper represents a valuable contribution to research into private accommodation as a phenomenon in the <b>accommodation</b> <b>structure</b> and <b>accommodation</b> services at the level of the Primorsko – Goranska County as well as the Republic of Croatia as a whole.
