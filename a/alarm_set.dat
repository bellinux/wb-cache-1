6000|$|But now, another {{occupation}} and solicitude of mind {{was beginning to}} be added to these. Her father was growing distressed for money. She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts. The Kellynch property was good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required in its possessor. While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it. It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter. He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so far even as to say, [...] "Can we retrench? Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?" [...] and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female <b>alarm,</b> <b>set</b> seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom. But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards. Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy. She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.|$|E

"By this time, {{my dearest}} sister, you have {{received}} my hurried letter; I wish {{this may be}} more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them {{to understand that they}} were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the <b>alarm,</b> <b>set</b> off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness." ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the rate of compliance with hospital guidelines for alarm limits for pulse oximetry in preterm infants on oxygen therapy. METHODS. All infants admitted to the nurseries at the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, with gestational age < 32 weeks or birth weight < 1500 g between August 2005 and February 2006 were eligible for inclusion. Data on the <b>alarm</b> limits <b>set</b> for infants on oxygen therapy were collected prospectively. The target saturation range recommended in written hospital guidelines was 88 % to 92 %, with <b>alarm</b> limits <b>set</b> at 85 % and 94 %. RESULTS. Data were prospectively collected for 144 subjects with mean (SD) gestational age 29. 3 (2. 4) weeks and birth weight 1226 (354) g; 1073 alarm limits were collected when infants were on oxygen. The lower <b>alarm</b> limit was <b>set</b> correctly 91. 1 % of the time. In contrast, the upper <b>alarm</b> limit was <b>set</b> correctly only 23. 3 % of the time: 76. 5 % of the time it was too high, and 23. 8 % of the time it was set at 100 %. Infants with an upper <b>alarm</b> limit <b>set</b> correctly on a particular day had a significantly lower birth weight, gestational age, postmenstrual age, and postnatal age than infants who had the upper <b>alarm</b> limit <b>set</b> too high. Use of assisted ventilation, higher inspired oxygen concentrations, and more frequent changes in inspired oxygen concentration were all associated with improved odds of having an appropriately <b>set</b> upper <b>alarm</b> limit. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that current guidelines regarding the upper pulse oximeter alarm limit for infants receiving oxygen might be commonly exceeded, although compliance might be better for infants at higher risk of adverse outcomes. However, there might be less variation from guidelines for the lower alarm limit...|$|R
50|$|A {{fire alarm}} system {{has a number of}} devices working {{together}} to detect and warn people through visual and audio appliances when smoke, fire, carbon monoxide or other emergencies are present. These alarms may be activated automatically from smoke detectors, and heat detectors or may also be activated via manual fire alarm activation devices such as manual call points or pull stations. Alarms can be either motorized bells or wall mountable sounders or horns. They can also be speaker strobes which sound an alarm, followed by a voice evacuation message which warns people inside the building not to use the elevators. Fire alarm sounders can be set to certain frequencies and different tones including low, medium and high, depending on the country and manufacturer of the device. Most {{fire alarm system}}s in Europe sound like a siren with alternating frequencies. Fire alarm sounders in the United States and Canada can be either continuous or set to different codes such as Code 3. Fire alarm warning devices can also be set to different volume levels.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the experiments reported here was to demonstrate the effects of opening up the design envelope for auditory alarms {{on the ability of}} people to learn the meanings of a set of alarms. Two sets of alarms were tested, one already extant and one newly-designed set for the same set of functions, designed according to a rationale set out by the authors aimed at increasing the heterogeneity of the <b>alarm</b> <b>set</b> and incorporating some well-established principles of alarm design. For both sets of alarms, a similarity-rating experiment was followed by a learning experiment. The results showed that the newly-designed set was judged to be more internally dissimilar, and easier to learn, than the extant set. The design rationale outlined in the paper is useful for design purposes in a variety of practical domains and shows how alarm designers, even at a relatively late stage in the design process, can improve the efficacy of an <b>alarm</b> <b>set.</b> © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{consider}} systems {{that can be}} modeled as directed acyclic graphs such that nodes represent components {{of the system and}} directed edges represent fault propagation between components. Some components can be equipped with alarms that ring when they detect faulty (abnormal) behavior. We study algorithms that attempt to minimize the number of alarms to be placed so that a fault at any single component can be detected and uniquely diagnosed. We first show that the minimization problem is intractable, i. e., NP-hard, even when restricted to three level graphs in which all nodes have outdegree two or less. We present optimal algorithms for three special classes of graphs – tree structured graphs, single-entry single-exit series–parallel graphs and two level graphs. We then present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the general case which guarantees that the ratio of the number of alarms placed to the optimum required is within a factor that is logarithmic in the number of nodes in the graph. Moreover, by showing a reduction from the minimum dominating set problem to the minimum <b>alarm</b> <b>set</b> problem, we argue that this performance guarantee is tight to within a constant factor. Finally, we demonstrate the connection between the minimum <b>alarm</b> <b>set</b> problem and the minimum test collection problem, and prove similar results...|$|E
