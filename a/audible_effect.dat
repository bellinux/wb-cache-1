50|$|Insulation {{thickness}} or type {{also has}} no <b>audible</b> <b>effect</b> {{as long as}} the insulation is of good quality and does not chemically react with the wire itself (poor-quality insulation has occasionally been found to accelerate oxidation of the copper conductor, increasing resistance over time).

50|$|Electric guitar {{amplifiers}} {{often use}} a class-AB1 amplifier.

50|$|Resistance {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{important}} specification of speaker wire. Low-resistance speaker wire allows more of the amplifier's power to energize the loudspeaker's voice coil. The performance of a conductor such as speaker wire is therefore optimised by limiting its length and maximising its cross-sectional area. Depending on the hearing ability of the listener, this resistance begins to have an <b>audible</b> <b>effect</b> when the resistance exceeds 5 percent of the speaker's impedance.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of a}} capstan {{allows the}} tape to run at a precise and {{constant}} speed.

The alternative to capstan drive, simply driving the tape takeup reel (which was used on some cheap tape recorders), causes problems both with the speed difference between a full and empty reel and with speed variations as described.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "slapstick" [...] {{originates}} {{from the}} Italian language word batacchio or bataccio — called the [...] "slap stick" [...] in English — a club-like object {{composed of two}} wooden slats used in commedia dell'arte. When struck, the batacchio produces a loud smacking noise, though little force transfers from the object to the person being struck. Actors may thus hit one another repeatedly with great <b>audible</b> <b>effect</b> while causing no damage and only very minor, if any, pain. Along with the inflatable bladder (of which the whoopee cushion is a modern variant), it was among the earliest special effects.|$|E
50|$|The terms vibrato and tremolo are {{sometimes}} incorrectly used interchangeably, although (in the classical world) they are properly defined as separate effects with vibrato {{defined as a}} periodic variation in the pitch (frequency) of a musical note, and tremolo as a fast repetition of the same note (usually a semiquaver) {{in order to produce}} the <b>audible</b> <b>effect</b> of a longer note, especially on instruments which do not have the ability of producing long sustained notes, such as the guitar. In practice, it is difficult for a singer or musical instrument player to achieve a pure vibrato or tremolo (where only the pitch or only the volume is varied), and variations in both pitch and volume will often be achieved at the same time. Electronic manipulation or generation of signals makes it easier to achieve or demonstrate pure tremolo or vibrato. In the world of electric guitar and record production vibrato retains the same meaning as in the classical world (a periodic variation in pitch) but tremolo describes a periodic variation in volume usually achieved using outboard effects units.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} {{differences}} in the behaviour of analog and digital systems when high level signals are present, where {{there is the possibility}} that such signals could push the system into overload. With high level signals, analog magnetic tape approaches saturation, and high frequency response drops in proportion to low frequency response. While undesirable, the <b>audible</b> <b>effect</b> of this can be reasonably unobjectionable. In contrast, digital PCM recorders show non-benign behaviour in overload; samples that exceed the peak quantization level are simply truncated, clipping the waveform squarely, which introduces distortion in the form of large quantities of higher-frequency harmonics. In principle, PCM digital systems have the lowest level of nonlinear distortion at full signal amplitude. The opposite is usually true of analog systems, where distortion tends to increase at high signal levels. A study by Manson (1980) considered the requirements of a digital audio system for high quality broadcasting. It concluded that a 16 bit system would be sufficient, but noted the small reserve the system provided in ordinary operating conditions. For this reason, it was suggested that a fast-acting signal limiter or 'soft clipper' be used to prevent the system from becoming overloaded.|$|E
50|$|In {{instrumentation}} systems, the use {{of differential}} inputs with high common mode rejection ratio, to minimise the effects of induced AC signals on the parameter to be measured, is widespread. It may also be possible to introduce narrow notch filters at the power frequency and its lower harmonics; however, {{this can not be}} done in audio systems due to the objectionable <b>audible</b> <b>effects</b> on the wanted signal.|$|R
40|$|Parameter {{interpolation}} (PI) of biquadratic IIR filters (biquads) {{is widely}} used in audio applications to avoid very undesirable <b>audible</b> <b>effects</b> like plops, clicks etc. It is shown that although the simplest linear PI of numerator and denominator coefficients of the transfer function of a biquad guarantees the stability it, however, may sometimes lead to other <b>audible</b> side <b>effects</b> caused, for example, by the possible growth of the magnitude response at some frequencies in some intermediate states of PI procedure. To avoid audible transients {{and to make the}} PI easily portable into digital signal processor (DSP) a special technique is applied called here “sliding edges”. The detailed description of this technique and their comparison is the goal of the present paper. 1...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis focuses on the design optimisation of a brass instrument. The bore profile of such an instrument {{is known to be}} the primary influence on the sound of the instrument as it directly controls the shape of the air-column contained within the instruments' walls. It has long been claimed, however, that other factors, such as the wall material and wall vibrations, are also significant, although to a lesser degree. In recent years, it has been proven that wall vibrations do indeed have an <b>audible</b> <b>effect</b> on the sound (Moore et al 2005, Kausel et al 2007, Nachtmann et al 2007, Kausel, Zietlow and Moore 2010). This effect corresponds to a relative increase in the power of upper harmonics of the sound spectrum when vibrations are greatest, and relative increase {{in the power of the}} lower harmonics, in particular the fundamental, when vibrations are at their least. The result is a timbral difference where a greater relative power in the upper harmonics results in a 'brighter' sound, and where the opposite results in a 'darker' sound. Studies have also found that the degree of the wall vibration is increased when the resonant frequencies of the air-column and those of the instruments' structure align. It is this principle that this work is based on. The primary objective of this work was to devise a suitable approach for incorporating the wall vibration effect into an optimisation method to investigate the optimum designs for two scenarios: maximum wall vibration and minimum wall vibration. It was also of interest to investigate if there were any design characteristics for each scenario. Two analysis methods were investigated for their suitability, namely free and forced vibration using finite element analysis (FEA). Different approaches to defining the design variables were explored and the suitability of different optimisation algorithms was investigated. The free vibration approach was found to be inadequate for this application due to the inherent omission of valuable magnitude information.

50|$|The more bits used to {{represent}} each sample, the finer the granularity in the digital representation, and thus the smaller the error. Such quantization errors may {{be thought of as}} a type of noise, because they are effectively the difference between the original source and its binary representation. With PCM, the only way to mitigate the <b>audible</b> <b>effects</b> of these errors is to use enough bits to ensure that the noise is low enough to be masked either by the signal itself or by other sources of noise. A high quality signal is possible, but at the cost of a high bitrate (e.g., over 700 kbit/s for one channel of CD audio). In effect, many bits are wasted in encoding masked portions of the signal because PCM makes no assumptions about how the human ear hears.|$|R

Tapping either produced no <b>audible</b> <b>effects</b> (Experiment 1) or percussive sounds (Experiments 2). Results showed higher synchronization accuracy and lower timing variability when tapping produced auditory effects, which may be because temporal information is processed more rapidly when auditory feedback is given in addition to tactile feedback. This feedback benefit was stronger for metronomic than for musical sequences. Further, variability was higher in joint than in solo conditions. Correlation analyses revealed interdependencies between participants’ tapping, suggesting that mutual error correction may have inflated variability in joint conditions...|$|R

The ringing is especially audible for impulsive sounds, whereas it is often masked with everyday sounds such as speech and music. With an impulse signal the ringing was found to be audible when the decay time constant for the sinusoid exceeds approximately 0. 8 ms (peak group delay of 1. 6 ms), independent of the center frequency within the frequency range studied. 2) A lateral shift of the auditory image, which occurs when an all-pass section is inserted in the signal path to only one ear.
