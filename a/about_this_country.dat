[...] Gene Siskel from the Chicago Tribune praised the film, saying, [...] "This is a big film, dealing with big issues, made on a grand scale.

Vincent Canby of the New York Times called The Deer Hunter [...] "a big, awkward, crazily ambitious motion picture that comes as close to being a popular epic as any movie <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> since The Godfather.

60|$|In this arduous undertaking, {{which has}} been the whole {{business}} of a long and solitary life, it is incredible the number of learned authors I have consulted, and all to but little purpose. Strange as it may seem, though such multitudes of excellent works have been written <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> there are none extant which give any full and satisfactory account of the early history of New York, or of its three first Dutch Governors. I have, however, gained much valuable and curious matter from an elaborate manuscript, written in exceeding pure and classic low Dutch, excepting a few errors in orthography, which was found in the archives of the Stuyvesant family. Many legends, letters, and other documents have I likewise gleaned in my researches among the family chests and lumber garrets of our respectable Dutch citizens; and I have gathered a host of well-authenticated traditions from divers excellent old ladies of my acquaintance, who requested that their names might not be mentioned. Nor must I neglect to acknowledge how greatly I have been assisted by that admirable and praiseworthy institution, the New York Historical Society, to which I here publicly return my sincere acknowledgments.|$|E

But I sat there and watched that turtle nearly an hour today, and I almost burned up in the sun; but I never heard him sing.

And then I said, I don't wish to be hard on this fellow, and I will just give him ten minutes to commence; ten minutes--and then if he don't, down goes his building. But he didn't commence, you know. I had staid there all that time, thinking may be he might, pretty soon, because he kept on raising his head up and letting it down, and drawing the skin over his eyes for a minute and then opening them out again, as if he was trying to study up something to sing, but just as the ten minutes were up and I was all beat out and blistered, he laid his blamed head down on a knot and went fast asleep." ...|$|E
