5|$|In April 2010, Brown {{asked the}} Queen to {{dissolve}} Parliament. The General Election campaign included the first televised leadership debates in Britain. The {{result of the}} election on 6 May was <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> parliament. Brown was re-elected as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath with 29,559 votes.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{constitutional}} rules governing protocol {{in the event}} of <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> parliament, Brown, as the sitting Prime Minister, would remain in office until a new government could be formed, a process which could continue without resolution until the State Opening of Parliament, which was scheduled for 25 May. On Brown's instructions, Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell had updated the protocol for dealing with <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> parliament earlier in the year. Following confirmation that no party had achieved an overall majority, Brown authorised O'Donnell to begin the process. Four-member teams of civil servants were sent to liaise with the main political parties to facilitate negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929, which resulted in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald (1866–1937) took office. In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis, as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. On 24 August 1931 the Labour government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by most Conservative MPs. Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929. Chamberlain expected the Conservatives to easily triumph, and {{thought he would be}} moved either to the Exchequer or be asked to serve at the Colonial Office, where Joseph Chamberlain had made his mark. Chamberlain easily won in Edgbaston, which he represented {{for the rest of his}} life, but the general election resulted in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his Government resigned, and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald took office.|$|E
5|$|In February 1974, the British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, {{advised the}} Queen {{to call a}} general {{election}} {{in the middle of}} her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain. The election resulted in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.|$|E
5|$|Innes' {{case against}} Marshall ended in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> jury in 1814. Rather than retry the case, Marshall and Innes signed an {{agreement}} to end the legal battle in 1815. The agreement stipulated that neither man would write or publish anything that was disrespectful of the other. Innes upheld {{his part of the}} agreement, but in 1824, eight years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated two-volume version of his History of Kentucky that was even more critical of Innes and others he suspected of participating in the Spanish Conspiracy.|$|E

5|$|Like her {{predecessor}} Rudd, Gillard {{had said}} that health is a priority in her agenda. She announced during the 2010 election, {{that there would be}} an increase of 270 placements for emergency doctors and nurses and 3,000 extra nursing scholarships over the following 10 years. She also said mental health would be a priority in her second term, with a $277million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups. As the election delivered <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> parliament, a $1.8billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} fraught with irregularities. All three judges were pro-Goebel Democrats, {{and at one}} point the juror pool of 368 people was found to have only eight Republicans. Republican appeals courts {{overturned}} Powers' and Howard's convictions, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two convictions and <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> jury and Howard was tried and convicted twice more. Both men were pardoned in 1908 by Governor Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|After Sharif's {{return to}} Pakistan from exile in 2007, Abbasi joined him {{and ran for}} {{a seat in the}} National Assembly in the 18 February 2008 general {{election}} as a candidate of the PML (N), and was successfully re-elected for the fifth time with 99,987 votes from Constituency NA-50 (Rawalpindi). The election resulted in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> parliament where PPP had secured the most seats in the National Assembly and PML (N) the second most. After the formation of a coalition government between PPP and PML (N) with Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister, Abbasi was inducted into the federal cabinet of Gillani with the status of a federal minister in March 2008 and was appointed as the Minister for Commerce. However, he resigned from the ministerial office after PML (N) left the PPP-led coalition government in May 2008 to lead the movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf and to restore the judiciary.|$|E

However, his tenure was short-lived after PML (N) left the PPP led coalition government in May 2008 to lead the movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf and to restore judiciary.|$|E
5|$|Between 1973 and 1977, in New York and New Jersey, Shakur {{was indicted}} ten times, {{resulting}} in seven different criminal trials. Shakur {{was charged with}} two bank robberies, the kidnapping of a Brooklyn heroin dealer, the attempted murder of two Queens police officers stemming from a January 23, 1973 failed ambush, and eight other felonies related to the Turnpike shootout. Of these trials, three resulted in acquittals, one in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> jury, one in a change of venue, one in a mistrial due to pregnancy, and one in a conviction; three indictments were dismissed without trial.|$|E
5|$|Between November 2009 and the British general {{election}} in May 2010, Dannatt {{served as a}} defence adviser to Conservative Party leader David Cameron. Dannatt resigned when Cameron's party formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats after the election produced <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> parliament, arguing that the Prime Minister should rely primarily {{on the advice of}} the incumbent service chiefs. Dannatt published an autobiography in 2010 and continues to be involved with a number of charities and organisations related to the armed forces. He is married with four children, one of whom served as an officer in the Grenadier Guards.|$|E

5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the March 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> parliament. The new Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake tried to get ITAK's support for his minority government but refused to give into ITAK's demands to end state-sponsored colonisation of Tamil-majority areas by Sinhalese, regional autonomy {{and the rights of}} Indian Tamils. As a result, ITAK started negotiations with the opposition SLFP who agreed to introduce the provisions of the B-C pact as bills in parliament. During the negotiations on forming an alternate stable government Chelvanayakam informed the Governor-General that ITAK would support a SLFP government for a full term and as result the Governor-General dissolved parliament.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, the Labour group {{resigned}} and the Liberal Democrats took {{office with a}} minority administration. In the 4 June 2009 council elections the Liberal Democrats gained four seats and, for the first time, overall control of the city council. In 2010 they increased their representation to 38 seats, giving them a majority of 6. In 2011 they lost their majority, leading to <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> council. In the 2013 local elections, in which {{a third of the}} city's wards were up for election, Labour gained 7seats and the Green party doubled their seats from 2to 4. The Liberal Democrats lost 10 seats.|$|E
5|$|Kinne went {{to trial}} {{for the murder of}} Patricia Jones in June 1961 and was acquitted. A January 1962 trial on charges of murdering her husband ended in {{conviction}} and a sentence of life in prison, but the verdict was overturned because of procedural irregularities. The case went to a second trial, which ended within days in a mistrial. A third trial on the charge of murdering her husband ended in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> jury in July 1964. Kinne was released on bond following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial could be held in October 1964.|$|E

5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E
5|$|Silcott was 26 {{years old}} when he was arrested, the oldest of the six charged with murder. He was born in Tottenham in 1959; his parents, both Seventh-day Adventists, had arrived in England from Montserrat two years earlier. He told Rose that he had {{experienced}} racism throughout his entire upbringing, particularly from the police. After leaving school at 15, he took a series of low-paying jobs and in 1976 began breaking into houses. The following year he was convicted of nine counts of burglary and sent to borstal for a few months, and in 1979 he was sentenced to six months for wounding. In September 1980 he stood trial for the murder of 19-year-old Lennie McIntosh, a postal worker, who was stabbed and killed at a party in Muswell Hill in 1979. The first trial resulted in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> jury; a second trial saw him acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks before}} Garza's death, {{a woman named}} Maria America Guerra had been sexually {{assaulted}} while kneeling at the communion rail at another Catholic church in the area. Rumor held that Father Feit was responsible, but local church leaders discouraged people from considering {{the possibility that a}} priest could have been involved in a violent crime. Feit admitted to visiting a priest at that church on the day of Guerra's attack, but he denied assaulting her. He was later charged with rape, and the trial ended in <b>a</b> <b>hung</b> jury. In 1962, rather than facing a second trial, Feit entered a plea of no contest to a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault, and he paid a $500 fine. Years later, Feit said he did not understand that a no contest plea would result in his conviction.|$|E
