5|$|In Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī's (973–1048) Shadows, {{non-uniform}} {{motion is}} described {{as the result of}} acceleration. Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion; Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (c. 1080 – 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that velocity and acceleration <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things,</b> and that force is proportional to acceleration, not to velocity.|$|E

Although peacekeeping and development <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things,</b> the logic behind the {{criticism is}} the same. The third-party officials-whether they are peacekeepers or agents of development-are isolated from the general populace, believing they know what is best, and refusing to gather information from a ground level. This is not out of maliciousness or imperialism, but out of a legitimate belief that they, as educated officials with access to other experts and who are well versed in development and peacekeeping literature, know what is best.|$|E

In Chomsky's view {{there is little reason}} to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation [...] "intellectual" [...] obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: [...] "These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as people in the universities.

2500|$|Williams {{was born}} in the central Texas town of San Angelo. After {{attending}} school through tenth grade, during 1929 he enlisted with the US Merchant Marine. He served for ten years before quitting to marry Lasca Foster. Having trained as a radioman during his seafaring career, Williams worked as an electronics inspector, first for RCA in Galveston, Texas, later at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Washington State through the end of World War II. He and his wife then relocated to San Francisco, where he worked for Mackay Radio company until the publication of his first novel, Hill Girl, during 1951. It was a great success, and Williams spent the remainder of his professional career as an author, primarily of novels, with several screenplays also to his credit. The couple changed residences frequently and apparently spent considerable time in France, where Williams's work has an excellent reputation. After the death of his wife from cancer during 1972, Williams purchased property on the California-Oregon border where he lived alone for a time in a trailer. Ultimately relocating to Los Angeles, Williams committed suicide in his apartment in the Van Nuys neighborhood during early April 1975. Williams had been depressed since the death of his wife, and his emotional state worsened as sales of his books declined as pulp thrillers began to lose popularity in the early 70s. He was survived by a daughter, Alison. Many sources continue to repeat the false rumor that Williams died by drowning in the Gulf of Mexico or in France.

This paper presents an account of a case in which aspects of practice were far from empowering. By describing and analysing the actions taken, the paper shows how a lack of genuine commitment to empowerment can have extremely detrimental effects.

5000|$|The name Tanabata is {{remotely}} {{related to}} the Japanese reading of the Chinese characters 七夕, {{which used to be}} read as [...] "Shichiseki" [...] (see explanation about the various kanji readings).

Gradually this ceremony merged with Kikkōden to become Tanabata.

This study aims to study how satisfaction is related to perception by using the survey instrument, SERVQUAL-TRANS. The student satisfaction survey questionnaire was designed based on the literature extracted. The perceptions and satisfactions of students were surveyed through administering the questionnaires to 260 transnational engineering students. Linear regression analysis was then performed to identify whether there existed statistically positive relationship between perception and satisfaction data. The results revealed {{that there was no}} significant relationship between learning outcome and student satisfaction, but there was significant positive relationship between satisfaction and contributing factors which led to superior student learning experience...|$|R
