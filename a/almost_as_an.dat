From here Buckbarrow looks quite {{formidable}} and the crags are a deterrent to a direct ascent; however, all danger can be bypassed by starting the climb at the more westerly point of Harrow Head farm and following Gill Beck up to a height of around 350m (1,150ft) before bearing north easterly to the highest point above the crags. An alternative is to climb from Greendale, via Greendale Gill and Tongues Gills. Buckbarrow can also be bagged <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> afterthought as the walker descends from Seatallan. Buckbarrow’s formidable crags are a popular rock climbing venue.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamentally}} different mechanism for memristive behavior {{has been proposed}} by Pershin and Di Ventra. The authors show that certain types of semiconductor spintronic structures belong to a broad class of memristive systems as defined by Chua and Kang. The mechanism of memristive behavior in such structures is based entirely on the electron spin degree of freedom which allows for a more convenient control than the ionic transport in nanostructures. When an external control parameter (such as voltage) is changed, the adjustment of electron spin polarization is delayed because of the diffusion and relaxation processes causing hysteresis. This result was anticipated {{in the study of}} spin extraction at semiconductor/ferromagnet interfaces, but was not described in terms of memristive behavior. On a short time scale, these structures behave <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ideal memristor. This result broadens the possible range of applications of semiconductor spintronics and makes a step forward in future practical applications.|$|E

500|$|Some songs {{featured}} on His Band and the Street Choir were first recorded for the albums Astral Weeks and Moondance. Morrison rewrote and rearranged them for release on Street Choir because the recordings {{for his new}} album featured different personnel and instrumentation. The songs on the album, which Rolling Stone reviewer Jon Landau believes have a free, relaxed sound to them, borrow from various music genres; the simple lyrics lack the complexity popularly expected from Morrison's work. According to Pitchfork journalist Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Street Choir eschewed Moondances jazz influences in favor of [...] "soul and gospel, using folk <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> accent", all the while possessing a [...] "heavy R kick". AllMusic contributor Jason Ankeny believed that, without the [...] "overt mysticism" [...] of the singer's previous two records, it was [...] "simply Morrison's valentine to the rhythm and blues that inspired him".|$|E
500|$|At that time, the Yellow River was flooding, causing {{widespread}} devastation to {{the people}} and the rice harvests. As Luan Da had claimed that he could dam the river, Emperor Wu felt that {{it would be wise to}} encourage the mystic to take up the task by quickly pleasing him. The emperor granted Luan Da the title of the General of Five Boons, and <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> afterthought, three other such titles: the General of Heavenly Practitioners, the General of the Earth Practitioners, and General Grand Communicator. Emperor Wu also lavished gifts on him; he was granted the marquisate of Letong, giving him some 2,000 households to rule over, and the emperor also gave him a luxurious mansion, a thousand servants, opulent transportation, many decorations, a seal labelled [...] "General of Heavenly Way", and even the hand in marriage of Princess Wei Zifu, the emperor's eldest daughter, accompanied by a dowry estimated at 10,000 catties of gold. The emperor himself, along with envoys, members of the royal family, and high-ranking officials often invited Luan Da to dine or paid him house calls merely to ask how he was doing. With his marquisate and five generalships, Luan Da had become a man of great standing only a few months after his introduction to the emperor. He was no longer merely Emperor Wu's subject, but an envoy of the immortal beings with status equal to the emperor.|$|E

[...] Murchison has released a recording of traditional euphonium repertoire but has also formed, along with his wife and others, the world music group Mainspring, in which, Murchison’s website says, [...] "A typical concert may consist of traditional jigs and reels from Scotland and Ireland, beautiful Mexican serenades, sambas, a suite of Spanish folk music, an Armenian lament, entertaining original music, and always plenty of light-hearted fun!" ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1917 {{inflation}} had rapidly {{eroded the}} value of salaries and Douglas Laurie called a meeting on 15 December 1917 {{to draw up a}} memorandum to present to the Board of Education. <b>Almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> after thought he invited representatives of Assistant Lecturers from all Universities. The meeting was attended by delegates from 15 institutions. The issues raised by the memorandum drafted at the meeting included: pay; tenure; status; grading; opportunities for research and superannuation. Finally a motion was passed to a new association with the name [...] "The Association of University Lecturers". The name (which implicitly excluded professors from membership) caused some dissent but a split was prevented. However the Scottish Lecturers went their own way and formed a separate Association in 1922 which later merged with AUT in 1949 but retained some of its autonomy.|$|E
2500|$|Herodotus {{provides}} {{much information}} {{about the nature of}} the world and the status of science during his lifetime, often engaging in private speculation. For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the Nile was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from Phoenician sailors that, while circumnavigating Africa, they [...] "saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards". Owing to this brief mention, which is included <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> afterthought, it has been argued that Africa was indeed circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been. His accounts of India are among the oldest records of Indian civilization by an outsider.|$|E

2500|$|Authorities within state-endorsed {{religions}} were {{suspicious of}} pietist doctrine which they {{often viewed as}} a social danger, as it [...] "seemed either to generate an excess of evangelical fervor and so disturb the public tranquility or to promote a mysticism so nebulous as to obscure the imperatives of morality. A movement which cultivated religious feeling <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> end itself". While some pietists (such as Pastor Francis Magny) held that [...] "mysticism and the moral law went together", for others (like his pupil Françoise-Louise de la Tour) [...] "pietist mysticism did less to reinforce the moral law than to take its place...the principle of 'guidance by inner light' was often a signal to follow the most intense of her inner sentiments...the supremacy of feeling over reason". Religious authorities could bring pressure on pietists, such as when they brought some of Magny's followers before the local consistory {{to answer questions about}} their unorthodox views or when they banished Pastor Magny from Vevey for heterodoxy in 1713. Likewise, pietism challenged the orthodoxy via new media and formats: Periodical journals gained importance versus the former pasquills and single thesis, traditional disputation was replaced by competitive debating, which tried to gain new knowledge instead of defending orthodox scholarship.|$|E
2500|$|Some music critics {{consider}} Spirit of Eden and its 1991 follow-up Laughing Stock influential to post-rock, a music {{genre that}} developed in Britain and North America in the 1990s. In {{a review of}} Bark Psychosis' album Hex, where the term [...] "post-rock" [...] was coined, Simon Reynolds opined that Hex aspires to the [...] "baroque grandeur" [...] of Spirit of Eden. Andy Whitman of Paste magazine argues that Spirit of Eden represents the beginning of post-rock: [...] "The telltale marks of the genre—textured guitars, glacial tempos, an emphasis on dynamics, electronica, ambience and minimalism—were all in place, and {{paved the way for}} bands like Sigur Rós, Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Low and latter-period Radiohead." [...] Simon Harper of the Birmingham Post observed how [...] "their combination of jazz, classical, rock and the spacey echoes of dub, using silence <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> instrument in its own right, lends itself to the vernacular of post-rock, and there can be little argument that Tortoise and their Chicago-based compatriots would hardly sound the same {{were it not for the}} staggering achievements of Hollis and Tim Friese-Greene." [...] Numerous bands and artists, including Graham Coxon, Doves and Elbow have praised Spirit of Eden or have cited it as an influence.|$|E
2500|$|Worldwide press {{coverage}} reported in November 2006 that two missing masterpieces by Fra Angelico had turned up, having {{hung in the}} spare room of the late Jean Preston, in her terrace house in Oxford, England. Her father had bought them for £100 each in the 1960s then bequeathed them to her when he died. Preston, an expert medievalist, recognised them as being high quality Florentine renaissance, but {{did not realize that}} they were works by Fra Angelico until they were identified in 2005 by Michael Liversidge of Bristol University. [...] There was almost no demand at all for medieval art during the 1960s and no dealers showed any interest, so Preston's father bought them <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> afterthought along with some manuscripts. Coincidentally the manuscripts turned out to be high quality Victorian forgeries by The Spanish Forger. [...] The paintings are two of eight side panels of a large altarpiece painted in 1439 for Fra Angelico's monastery at San Marco, which was later split up by Napoleon's army. While the centre section is still at the monastery, the other six small panels are in German and US museums. These two panels were presumed lost forever. The Italian Government had hoped to purchase them but they were outbid at auction on 20 April 2007 by a private collector for £1.7M. Both panels are now restored and exhibited in the San Marco Museum in Florence.|$|E
