5|$|Structure 4 is the North Structure. It {{dates to}} the Late Classic but overlies {{construction}} dating to the Middle Preclassic. <b>A</b> <b>stairway</b> ascended {{the front of the}} building, under which were found the remains of Late Classic polychrome ceramics, perhaps belonging to a pre-construction ritual offering. The stucco floors on top of the mound supported asymmetric walls that perhaps date to the Postclassic Period, being associated with a mix of Late Classic and Postclassic pottery.|$|E
5|$|Structure 6 is {{a temple}} on the {{northeast}} side of Plaza 1. It rises in stepped sections topped by a summit shrine and was accessed via <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> from the plaza that divided in two near the summit. Only the lower sections of the walls and columns of the shrine remain.|$|E

On {{the east side of the}} palace <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> leads to a decorated throne of stone and stucco. One of the rooms of the palace contains a stucco decoration representing feathered serpents and crossed bones.|$|E
5|$|There were {{initially}} two platforms, up and down. The up platform was accessed {{from the upper}} floor of the station building via <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> outside the building. The station's original signal box, elevated above the railway viaduct at the junction between Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane, was a prominent feature in Herne Hill for many years.|$|E
50|$|The temple is of a style {{typical of}} the Postclassic period (c. 950-1539 AD) in the Guatemalan Highlands. The northeastern side of the temple was {{accessed}} by <b>a</b> double <b>stairway,</b> with <b>a</b> single <b>stairway</b> {{on each of the}} other sides. Directly opposite the double stairway, another double stairway climbs the lower platform of the two terraces. On the southeastern side, the single stairway is matched by <b>a</b> single <b>stairway</b> in <b>a</b> platform opposite. The temple and the platform are not perfectly aligned, but there appears to have been an attempt to produce general symmetry.|$|R

5|$|In Aprilâ€“May 2012, {{a team of}} archaeologists {{unearthed}} {{a previously}} unknown inscription on <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> at the La Corona site in Guatemala. The inscription, on {{what is known as}} Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in Calakmul in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being used as {{the exterior of the}} school, Studio C holds sets for the school's entrance foyer, the gymnasium, the media lab and a hallway with lockers. As the series progressed and the budget increased, <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> and balcony was installed in the foyer in an attempt to get characters off the floor and not all appear in the same geometric plane. For the first few seasons, the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards; due to warping, it was replaced by concrete painted to look like wood.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{from the}} south of the undercroft is the abbot's passage which dates from around 1150 and {{consists}} of two bays with rib-vaulting. Above the abbot's passage, approached by <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> from the west cloister, is StAnselm's Chapel which also dates from the 12thcentury. It is in three bays and has a 19thcentury Gothic-style plaster vault. The chancel is in one bay and was remodelled in the early 17thcentury. The screen, altar rails, holy table and plaster ceiling of the chancel date from the 17thcentury. The north range of the cloister gives access to a refectory, built by Simon deWhitchurch in the 13thcentury. It contains an Early English pulpit, approached by a staircase with an ascending arcade. The only other similar pulpit in England is in Beaulieu Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Thailand's Ministry of Culture {{details the}} remains of {{fourteen}} forts on and around Khao Daeng Mountain. Forts 4, 8 and 9 are well preserved and characterise the sultanate's military architecture: fort 4 {{can be reached by}} ascending a flight of steps that starts behind the archaeological information centre, fort 8 is accessible via <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> near the Sultan Sulaiman Shah mosque, fort 9 sits atop a small motte near the main road leading from Singha Nakhon to Ko Yo Island. Forts 5 and 6 occupy the upper slopes of the mountain and offer panoramic views of Lake Songkhla and the Gulf of Thailand. The two pagodas on the summit of Khao Daeng were built on the base of fort 10 during the 1830s to commemorate the suppression of rebellions in Kedah.|$|E
5|$|To {{successfully}} complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills {{and how many}} uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings. There are eight skills that can be assigned: 'Climbers' climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang. 'Floaters' use a parachute to fall safely from heights. 'Bombers' explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. 'Blockers' stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. 'Builders' build <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> of 12 steps. 'Bashers', 'Miners' and 'Diggers' dig horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively.|$|E

5|$|Barrington Civic Center Historic District is a {{historic}} district in Barrington, Rhode Island on County Road. The district, which consists of the Barrington Town Hall, Leander R. Peck School and Prince's Hill Cemetery, is located on Prince's Hill {{near the center of}} Barrington. In 1728, Prince's Hill Cemetery was purchased and later expanded to its present size by 1898. The -story Barrington Town Hall was completed in 1888 and originally served as the seat of the town's government, library and high school. With the completion of the Leander R. Peck School in 1917, the high school moved into the adjacent building and the library used its space. The two-story Elizabethan Revival style Peck School is designed with a T-shaped plan and features <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> to access the main entrance on the second story. The Peck School was later used by the fifth and sixth grade elementary students before becoming the public library. Also located within the district is Wood's Pond. The Barrington Civic Center Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and serves as historically significant example of civic and natural environment planning of the late nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5D-43 is {{an unusual}} radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a {{pre-existing}} twin pyramid complex. It {{is built into the}} end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways, the fourth (south) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> on that side. The building has a talud-tablero platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, {{it has been suggested that}} the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake. The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, in the later part of the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|The North Acropolis, {{together}} with the Great Plaza immediately to the south, {{is one of the}} most studied architectural groups in the Maya area; the Tikal Project excavated a massive trench across the complex, thoroughly investigating its construction history. It is a complex group with construction beginning in the Preclassic Period, around 350 BC. It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period, with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures. After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform, which measured , gradually hiding it from view. Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD, each of them had an elaborate roofcomb and <b>a</b> <b>stairway</b> flanked by masks of the gods. By the 9th century AD, 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the North Acropolis; 18 of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits. The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the Postclassic Period.|$|E
