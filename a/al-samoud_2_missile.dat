50|$|A UN panel {{reports that}} Iraq's <b>al-Samoud</b> <b>2</b> <b>missiles,</b> {{disclosed}} by Iraq to weapons inspectors in December, have {{a range of}} 180 km (above the 150 km limit allowed by the UN), splitting opinion over whether they breach UNSCR 1441.|$|R
50|$|On February 13, 2003, a UN panel {{reported}} that Iraq's <b>Al-Samoud</b> <b>2</b> <b>missiles,</b> disclosed by Iraq to weapons inspectors in December, have {{a range of}} 180 km, in breach of UNSCR 1441. The limit allowed by the UN is 150 km.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} <b>Al-Samoud</b> <b>2</b> <b>missiles</b> were fired at Kuwait during the 2003 conflict. One of them, {{aimed at the}} Coalition Headquarters at Camp Doha, was {{successfully}} intercepted by a missile Patriot on March 27. Some debris hit buildings inside the US base. The other missiles were also shot down or landed harmlessly in the desert.|$|R
50|$|Iraq {{agreed to}} destroy the <b>Al-Samoud</b> <b>2</b> long range <b>missiles,</b> and by mid-March 2003, a number had been destroyed. Although UNMOVIC ordered to stop its production, Iraq {{assembled}} some 20 missiles during {{the early months of}} 2003.|$|R
50|$|Inspectors began visiting {{sites where}} WMD {{production}} was suspected, but {{found no evidence}} of such activities, except for 18 undeclared 122mm chemical rockets that were destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision. As was discovered after the invasion of Iraq, no production of WMDs was taking place, and no stockpiles existed. U.N. inspectors also found that the <b>Al-Samoud</b> <b>2</b> and Al-fatah <b>missiles</b> violated U.N. range restrictions, the former also being partially destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision. Debate about Resolution 1441 therefore turns on whether, despite the absence of WMDs and the acceptance of inspections, Iraq failed to comply with the terms of the Resolution, and whether an invasion was justified {{in the absence of any}} further UN Security resolutions on the subject.|$|R
5000|$|Hans Blix {{states that}} Iraq {{still has not}} made a [...] "fundamental decision" [...] to disarm, despite recent signs of {{increased}} cooperation. Specifically, Iraq has refused to destroy its <b>al-Samoud</b> <b>2</b> long range <b>missiles.</b> (These are not a WMD, and Iraq is permitted [...] "battlefield" [...] missiles. However, Iraq's missiles were limited by UN instruction to a diameter of 600mm, and the Al-Samoud II has a diameter of 760mm). These missiles are deployed and mobile. Also, an R-400 aerial bomb was found that could possibly contain biological agents. Given this find, the UN Inspectors have requested access to the Al-Aziziyah weapons range to verify that all 155 R-400 bombs can be accounted for and proven destroyed. Blix also expresses skepticism over Iraq's claims to have destroyed its stockpiles of anthrax and VX nerve agent in Time magazine. Blix said he found it [...] "a bit odd" [...] that Iraq, with [...] "one of the best-organized regimes in the Arab world," [...] would claim to have no records {{of the destruction of}} these illegal substances. [...] "I don't see that they have acquired any credibility," [...] Blix said ...|$|R
50|$|Patriot was {{deployed}} to Iraq {{a second time}} in 2003, this time to provide air and missile defense for the forces conducting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Patriot PAC-3, GEM, and GEM+ missiles both had a very high success rate, intercepting <b>Al-Samoud</b> <b>2</b> and Ababil-100 tactical ballistic missiles. However, no longer-range ballistic missiles were fired during that conflict. The systems were stationed in Kuwait and Iraq successfully destroying a number of hostile surface-to-surface missiles using the new PAC-3 and guidance enhanced missiles. Patriot missile batteries were involved in three friendly fire incidents, resulting in the downing of a Royal Air Force Tornado {{and the death of}} both crew members, Flight Lieutenant David Rhys Williams and Flight Lieutenant Kevin Barry Main, on March 23, 2003. On March 24, 2003, a USAF F-16CJ Fighting Falcon fired a HARM anti-radiation missile at a Patriot missile battery after the Patriot's radar had locked onto and prepared to fire at the aircraft, causing the pilot to mistake it for an Iraqi surface-to-air missile system. The HARM missed its target and no one was injured and the Patriot Radar was examined and continued to operate but was replaced due to a chance that a fragment may have penetrated it and gone undetected. On April 2, 2003, <b>2</b> PAC-3 <b>missiles</b> shot down a USN F/A-18 Hornet killing U.S. Navy Lieutenant Nathan D. White of VFA-195, Carrier Air Wing Five.|$|R

The attempts, which were made near the Fuenterrabía and Foronda airports, were unsuccessful as each time the missiles failed to launch. In 2004, several systems were captured by the Civil Guard. Some Strela <b>2</b> <b>missiles</b> were bought from the IRA in 1999, while Libya was tracked as the original source used by the IRA.|$|R
