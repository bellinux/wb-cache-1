5|$|Stokvis {{was born}} to Rachel Wittering and Joseph Barend Stokvis, Jr., a Jewish {{physician}} and obstetrician in Amsterdam. He studied medicine in Amsterdam and at the University of Utrecht under Franciscus Donders and Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk, obtaining a doctorate on a dissertation on hepatic glucose production in diabetes in 1856. His thesis appeared shortly {{after the publication of}} related work by the French physiologist Claude Bernard. Stokvis may also have been influenced by the chemist Gerardus Mulder in Amsterdam. Subsequently, he travelled to Paris and Vienna (and possibly Prague), before establishing himself in medical practice in Amsterdam. He continued his medical research under the physiologists Adriaan Heynsius, Wilhelm Kühne and Thomas Place. In 1867, the Brussels Academy awarded a gold medal to Stokvis for an essay on the development of <b>albuminuria,</b> a kidney disorder in which the protein albumin can be detected in the urine.|$|E
5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum cubebae, was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was liable to cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of <b>albuminuria</b> were applied.|$|E
25|$|Slightly diminished function; kidney damage {{with normal}} or {{relatively}} high GFR (≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2) and persistent <b>albuminuria.</b> Kidney damage {{is defined as}} pathological abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging studies.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{professional}} guidelines classified {{the severity of}} CKD in five stages, with stage 1 being the mildest and usually causing few symptoms and stage 5 being a severe illness with poor life expectancy if untreated. Stage 5 CKD is often called end-stage kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or end-stage kidney failure, and is largely synonymous with the now outdated terms chronic renal failure or chronic kidney failure; and usually means the patient requires renal replacement therapy, which may involve a form of dialysis, but ideally constitutes a kidney transplant. Recent international guidelines reclassified CKD based on cause, glomerular filtration rate category (G1, G2, G3a, G3b, G4 and G5), and <b>albuminuria</b> category (A1, A2, A3).|$|E
500|$|In March 1887, when Crowley was 11, {{his father}} died of tongue cancer. Crowley {{described}} this as {{a turning point in}} his life, and he always maintained an admiration of his father, describing him as [...] "his hero and his friend". Inheriting a third of his father's wealth, he began misbehaving at school and was harshly punished by Champney; Crowley's family removed him from the school when he developed <b>albuminuria.</b> He then attended Malvern College and Tonbridge School, both of which he despised and left after a few terms. He became increasingly sceptical regarding Christianity, pointing out inconsistencies in the Bible to his religious teachers, and went against the Christian morality of his upbringing by smoking, masturbating, and having sex with prostitutes from whom he contracted gonorrhea. Sent to live with a Brethren tutor in Eastbourne, he undertook chemistry courses at Eastbourne College. Crowley developed interests in chess, poetry, and mountain climbing, and in 1894 climbed Beachy Head before visiting the Alps and joining the Scottish Mountaineering Club. The following year he returned to the Bernese Alps, climbing the Eiger, Trift, Jungfrau, Mönch, and Wetterhorn.|$|E
2500|$|The National Cholesterol Education Program {{compiled}} {{and presented}} {{data from the}} Indian Health Service that indicates increasing mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease vary among American Indian communities. [...] The significant independent predictors of CVD in Native American women were diabetes, age, obesity, LDL, <b>albuminuria,</b> triglycerides, and hypertension. In men the significant predictors of CVD were diabetes, age, LDL, <b>albuminuria,</b> and hypertension. Interestingly, and unlike other ethnic groups, Native Americans appear to have an increasing frequency of coronary heart disease, possibly related to the high and increasing prevalence of diabetes in these communities. Although total and LDL-cholesterol levels are lower than the U.S. average, importance of LDL cholesterol as a contributor to CHD in this group should not be underestimated. Moreover, {{because of the high}} frequency of type 2 diabetes, many Native Americans will have an even lower LDL goal. [...] The evidence for differences in baseline risk between Native American and white populations is not strong enough to justify separate guidelines for Native American populations.|$|E

5000|$|Protein - with {{presence}} in urine known as proteinuria, <b>albuminuria,</b> or microalbuminuria ...|$|E
50|$|Though {{there is}} some {{evidence}} that dietary interventions (to lower red meat intake) can be helpful in lowering <b>albuminuria</b> levels, there is currently no evidence that low protein interventions correlate to improvement in kidney function. Among other measures, blood pressure control, specially with the use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-system, are the most common used therapies to control <b>albuminuria.</b>|$|E
50|$|Causes of <b>albuminuria</b> can be {{discriminated}} between by {{the amount}} of protein excreted.|$|E
50|$|The kidneys {{normally}} do not filter large molecules into the urine, so <b>albuminuria</b> {{can be an}} indicator of damage to the kidneys or excessive salt intake. It can also occur in patients with long-standing diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes. Recent international guidelines (KDIGO 2012) reclassified chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on cause, glomerular filtration rate category, and <b>albuminuria</b> category (A1,A2,A3).|$|E
5000|$|Kidney - the {{presence}} of leakage of protein into the urine (<b>albuminuria</b> or proteinuria), or reduced renal function.|$|E
50|$|<b>Albuminuria</b> is a {{pathological}} condition wherein the protein albumin is abnormally {{present in the}} urine. It {{is a type of}} proteinuria. Albumin is a major plasma protein (normally circulating in the blood); in healthy people, only trace amounts of it are present in urine, whereas larger amounts occur in the urine of patients with kidney disease. For a number of reasons, clinical terminology is changing to focus on <b>albuminuria</b> more than proteinuria.|$|E

50|$|Diagnosis of HN is {{made from}} a {{clinical}} history and biochemical investigations. Chronic hypertension with progressive kidney disease progresses {{over a long period}} of time. Damage to the glomeruli allows proteins that are usually too large to pass into the nephron to be filtered. This leads to an elevated concentration of albumin in the urine (<b>albuminuria).</b> This <b>albuminuria</b> usually does not cause symptoms but can be indicative of many kidney disorders. Protein in the urine (proteinuria) is best identified from a 24-hour urine collection.|$|E
50|$|Frederick William Pavy (29 May 1829 - 19 September 1911) was a British {{physician}} and physiologist and the discoverer of Pavy's disease, a cyclic or recurrent physiologic <b>albuminuria.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hermann Senator {{made several}} {{contributions}} in internal medicine, in particular, involving {{research in the}} field of nephrology. He was the author of influential works associated with diabetes and <b>albuminuria,</b> and is credited with disproving the once held belief that <b>albuminuria</b> was always a sign of primary kidney disease. His treatise on diseases of the kidneys, [...] "Die Erkrankungen der Nieren", was included in Nothnagel's textbook of special pathology and therapy. Senator was also the author of a significant study on fevers, titled [...] "Untersuchungen über den fieberhaften Process und seine Behandlung" [...] (Investigations of the febrile process and its treatment).|$|E
50|$|Also a urine {{dipstick}} {{test for}} proteinuria {{can give a}} rough estimate of <b>albuminuria.</b> This is because albumin {{is by far the}} dominant plasma protein, and bromphenol blue the agent used in the dipstick is specific to albumin.|$|E
50|$|Stage 1Slightly diminished function; kidney damage {{with normal}} or {{relatively}} high GFR (≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2) and persistent <b>albuminuria.</b> Kidney damage {{is defined as}} pathological abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging studies.|$|E
5000|$|Von Noorden made special {{researches}} involving <b>albuminuria</b> in health, metabolism {{disorders and}} its treatment, diabetes, {{diseases of the}} kidney, dietetics, etc., and wrote on these subjects, some of his books appearing in English. Among his assistants was the Austrian-American psychologist Rudolf von Urban.|$|E
5000|$|An albumin level {{above the}} upper limit values is called [...] "macroalbuminuria", or {{sometimes}} just <b>albuminuria.</b> Sometimes, {{the upper limit}} value is given as one less (such as 300 being given as 299) to mark that the higher value (here 300) is defined as macroalbuminuria.|$|E
50|$|Orthostatic {{proteinuria}} (synonyms: orthostatic <b>albuminuria,</b> postural proteinuria) is {{a benign}} condition. A change in renal hemodynamics, {{which in some}} otherwise normal individuals, causes protein (mostly albumin) to appear in urine {{when they are in}} the standing position. Urine formed when these individuals are lying down is protein-free.|$|E
50|$|The {{results of}} these tests are {{used to assess the}} {{excretory}} function of the kidneys. Staging of chronic kidney disease is based on categories of GFR as well as <b>albuminuria</b> and cause of kidney disease. Dosage of drugs that are excreted primarily via urine may need to be modified based on either GFR or creatinine clearance.|$|E
5000|$|With Marie François Xavier Bichat (1771-1802), Nysten {{performed}} pioneer {{experiments in}} cardiology, including studies involving {{the effects of}} galvanic current on the heart. In 1805 he studied silkworm diseases in southern France, and provided an early description of polyhedrosis. He also described symptoms associated with <b>albuminuria,</b> and in 1811 provided a scientific description of rigor mortis. The eponymous [...] "Nysten's Law" [...] defines the progressive states of cadaveric rigidity during rigor mortis.|$|E
50|$|In {{the healthy}} kidney, albumin's size and {{negative}} electric charge exclude it from excretion in the glomerulus. This {{is not always}} the case, as in some diseases including diabetic nephropathy, which can sometimes be a complication of uncontrolled or of longer term diabetes in which proteins can cross the glomerulus. The lost albumin can be detected by a simple urine test. Depending on the amount of albumin lost, a patient may have normal renal function, microalbuminuria, or <b>albuminuria.</b>|$|E
50|$|His {{reputation}} increased, and in 1807 {{he returned}} to Exeter, {{where he was a}} second time elected physician to the Devon and Exeter Hospital, and in 1812 was appointed physician to St. Thomas's Lunatic Asylum. In 1813 he published his well-known Observations on the Nature and Cure of Dropsies, London, 8vo, of which there are four editions, and which entitles its author to a position among medical discoverers. Dropsy is the morbid effusion of the serum of the blood into the cavities of the body and into the meshes of its tissues. It had been observed from the beginning of medicine, but up to the time of Richard Lower nothing was known of its morbid anatomy. He made the first step, which was the demonstration that dropsy of a limb always follows direct obstruction of its veins. Blackall's discovery came next, and was that dropsy is often associated with the presence of albumen in the urine. His treatise states clearly the relation between <b>albuminuria</b> and dropsy, and shows that he suspected that the kidneys were diseased in these cases. The further discovery of Richard Bright in 1836 of the constant relation between renal disease and <b>albuminuria</b> is based upon the observations first made by Blackall.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{considered}} to have abortifacient, antibacterial, anticholesterolemic, antiinflammatory, antispasmodic, diuretic, emetic, emollient, febrifuge, hypotensive, purgative, styptic, and tonic properties. Some components in the dried fruit showed antifertility action, haemostatic properties, anticancer, antitumor, antiobesity, antioxidation effects and had roles {{in the treatment of}} hypertension and haemorrhoids. The fruit should not be taken during pregnancy. The dried flower buds are considered to have different medicinal properties from the dried ripe fruit. Toxic effects may include nausea, dizziness, vomiting, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly with abnormal liver function, haematuria, <b>albuminuria,</b> somnolence, spasms and coma.|$|E
5000|$|Microalbuminuria (between 30 and 300 mg/24h, mg/l {{of urine}} or µg/mg of creatinine) {{can be a}} forerunner of {{diabetic}} nephropathy. The term <b>albuminuria</b> is now preferred in Nephrology since {{there is not a}} [...] "small albumin" [...] (microalbuminuria) or a [...] "big albumin" [...] (macroalbuminuria). A1 represents normal to mildly increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (<30 mg/g or < 3 mg/mmmol); A2 represents moderately increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (30-300 mg/g or 3-30 mg/mmmol, previously known as microalbuminuria); and A3 reflects severely increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio >300 mg/g or > 30 mg/mmol).|$|E
50|$|Acute proliferative {{glomerulonephritis}} is {{a disorder}} of the glomeruli (glomerulonephritis), or small {{blood vessels in}} the kidneys. It is a common complication of bacterial infections, typically skin infection by Streptococcus bacteria types 12, 4 and 1 (impetigo) but also after streptococcal pharyngitis, for which it is also known as postinfectious or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. It can be a risk factor for future <b>albuminuria.</b> In adults, the signs and symptoms of infection may still be present at the time when the kidney problems develop, and the terms infection-related glomerulonephritis or bacterial infection-related glomerulonephritis are also used. Acute glomerulonephritis resulted in 19,000 deaths in 2013 down from 24,000 deaths in 1990 worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Sigismond Jaccoud {{was born}} in 1830 in Geneva, where he went to school and was educated in music and the science of literature. In 1849 he went to Paris to study {{medicine}} - and supported himself in that city teaching music and literature. He became interne des hפpitaux in 1855. After graduation in 1859 he specialised in internal medicine and in 1860 defended his doctoral thesis, on the pathogenesis of <b>albuminuria.</b> In 1862 he became medecin des hopitaux, in 1863 professeur. In 1877 he was appointed professor of internal pathology at the medical faculty {{and member of the}} Académie Nationale de Médecine. In 1898 he became president of the Academy.|$|E

50|$|Perlecan {{levels are}} {{decreased}} in many disease states - e.g., diabetes, atherosclerosis and arthritis. Perlecan {{has an important}} role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. Decreased perlecan in the glomerular basement membrane has a central role in the development of diabetic <b>albuminuria.</b> Perlecan expression is down regulated by many atherogenic stimuli and thus Perlecan is thought to play a protective role in atherosclerosis. Diabetes and atherosclerosis are commonly associated syndromes. 80% of diabetes-associated deaths involve some form of atherosclerotic complication, and the basement membrane of endothelia has been implicated in the atherogenic process. Synthesis of heparan sulfate was shown to decrease in the arteries of diabetics and in arteries developing atherosclerotic lesions.|$|E
50|$|Serum albumin is {{produced}} by the liver, occurs dissolved in blood plasma and is the most abundant blood protein in mammals. Albumin is essential for maintaining the oncotic pressure needed for proper distribution of body fluids between blood vessels and body tissues; without albumin, the high pressure in the blood vessels would force more fluids out into the tissues. It also acts as a plasma carrier by non-specifically binding several hydrophobic steroid hormones and as a transport protein for hemin and fatty acids. Too {{much or too little}} circulating serum albumin may be harmful. Albumin in the urine usually denotes the presence of kidney disease. Occasionally albumin appears in the urine of normal persons following long standing (postural <b>albuminuria).</b>|$|E
50|$|Oral {{ingestion}} of hydrocarbons often {{is associated with}} symptoms of mucous membrane irritation, vomiting, and central nervous system depression. Cyanosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea may appear {{as a result of}} aspiration, with subsequent development of chemical pneumonitis. Other clinical findings include <b>albuminuria,</b> hematuria, hepatic enzyme derangement, and cardiac arrhythmias. Doses as low as 10 ml orally have been reported to be potentially fatal, whereas some patients have survived the {{ingestion of}} 60 ml of petroleum distillates. A history of coughing or choking in association with vomiting strongly suggests aspiration and hydrocarbon pneumonia. Hydrocarbon pneumonia is an acute hemorrhagic necrotizing disease that can develop within 24 h after the ingestion. Pneumonia may require several weeks for complete resolution.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{after taking}} his first degree he applied {{himself to the}} study of {{medicine}} at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and it was in its wards, while working as the clinical clerk of Dr. John Latham, that he made the observations on <b>albuminuria</b> which were afterwards stated and enlarged in his treatise on dropsies. In 1797 he settled in his native city, and on 1 June in that year was chosen physician to the Devon and Exeter Hospital. At this period, however, the medical practice of Exeter was engrossed by Dr. Hugh Downman, Dr. Bartholomew Parr, and Dr. George Daniell, and in 1801 Dr. Blackall resigned his appointment at Exeter, and settled at Totnes, where he became the physician of the district.|$|E
