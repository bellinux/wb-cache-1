40|$|The Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR-B), {{the second}} {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) to fly aboard a shuttle, was launched on October 5, 1984. One of the primary goals of the SIR-B experiment was to use multiple incidence <b>angle</b> <b>radar</b> images to distinguish different terrain types {{through the use of}} their characteristic backscatter curves. This goal was accomplished in several locations including the Chubut Province of southern Argentina. Four descending image acquisitions were collected providing a multiple incidence angle image set. The data were first used to assess stereo-radargrammetric techniques. A digital elevation model was produced using the optimum pair of multiple incidence angle images. This model was then used to determine the local incidence angle of each picture element to generate curves of relative brightness vs. incidence angle. Secondary image products were also generated using the multi-angle data. The results of this work indicate that: (1) various forest species and various structures of a single species may be discriminated using multiple incidence <b>angle</b> <b>radar</b> imagery, and (2) it is essential to consider the variation in backscatter due to a variable incidence angle when analyzing and comparing data collected at varying frequencies and polarizations...|$|E

40|$|An {{examination}} of the application of Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) techniques to real, multi-channel, medium grazing <b>angle,</b> <b>radar</b> sea clutter data is undertaken and the detection performance is quantified against simulated moving maritime surface targets. The application of sub-optimal STAP approaches to the maritime radar detection problem is shown to be complicated by non-stationarity of sea clutter and rapid variations of the sea clutter spectrum due to transient wave activity. Observed performance gains from maritime STAP are much more limited than those observed for Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) due to the inherent spectral width of sea clutter and the slow Doppler velocities of maritime targets.

A specifically adjusted vertical-profile-of-reflectivity (VPR) approach is introduced. The mean VPR is constructed based on the range–height indicator scans, {{and the effects of}} smoothing of brightband (BB) features with range are accounted for. A principal feature of the suggested QPE approach is the determination of the reflec-tivity BB boundaries and freezing-level heights on a beam-by-beam basis using the copolar correlation coefficient hv, which is routinely available from the X-band radar measurements. It is shown that this coefficient provides a robust discrimination among the regions of rain, melting hydrometeors, and snow. The freezing-level estimates made using hv were within 100 – 200 m from the corresponding estimates of the 0 ° isotherm heights from radiosonde soundings. The suggested VPR approach with the polarimetric deter-mination of the reflectivity BB boundaries was used for QPE during the wintertime deployment of the NOAA X-band radar as part of the 2006 Hydrometeorological Test Bed (HMT- 06) field experiment in the California Sierra Nevada foothills.

40|$|A {{series of}} poststorm surveys were {{conducted}} {{in the wake of}} hailstorms observed by the Colorado State University–University of Chicago–Illinois State Water Survey (CSU-CHILL) S-Band polarimetric radar. Information on hail characteristics (maximum diameter, building damage, apparent hailstone density, etc.) was solicited from the general-public storm observers that were contacted during the surveys; the locations of their observations were determined using GPS equipment. Low-elevation <b>angle</b> <b>radar</b> measurements of reflectivity, differential reflectivity Z DR, and linear depolarization ratio (LDR) were interpolated to the ground-observer locations. Relationships between the hail differential reflectivity parameter H DR and the observer-reported hail characteristics were examined. It was found that H DR thresholds of 21 and 30 dB were reasonably successful (critical success index values of � 0. 77) in respectively identifying regions where large (� 19 mm in diameter) and structurally damaging hail were observed. The LDR characteristics in the observed hail areas were also examined. Because of sensitivities to variations in the hailstone bulk ice density, degree of surface wetness, and shape irregularities, the basic correlation between LDR magnitude and hail diameter was poor. However, when the reported hail diameters exceeded � 25 mm, LDR levels below �� 24 dB were uncommon. 1...|$|E
