5|$|Hollywood, a {{northern}} district of Los Angeles, California, {{is one of}} the leaders in motion picture production. The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope. The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.|$|E
5|$|The chapter also {{examines}} celebrity {{endorsement of}} certain drugs, {{the extent to}} which claims in advertisements aimed at doctors are appropriately sourced, and whether direct-to-consumer advertising (currently permitted in the US and New Zealand) ought to be allowed. It discusses how PR firms promote stories from patients who complain in the media that certain drugs <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> available by the funder, which in the UK is the NHS and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Two breast-cancer patients who campaigned in the UK in 2006 for trastuzumab (Herceptin) to be available on the NHS were being handled by a law firm working for Roche, the drug's manufacturer. The historian Lisa Jardine, who was suffering from breast cancer, told the Guardian that she had been approached by a PR firm working for the company.|$|E

25|$|Very low {{voltages}} are inefficient {{since the}} lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long filaments for high voltages are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> with rated voltages over 300 volts. Some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.|$|E
25|$|A tooth (plural teeth) is a hard, calcified {{structure}} {{found in}} the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates and used to break down food. Some animals, particularly carnivores, also use teeth for hunting or for defensive purposes. The roots of teeth are covered by gums. Teeth <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> of bone, but rather of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness. The cellular tissues that ultimately become teeth originate from the embryonic germ layer, the ectoderm.|$|E

25|$|The immense {{industrial}} plantations {{of eucalyptus}} (originally intended to supply a hypothetical pulp mill) produce wood for export. This indigenous {{species of the}} Australian continent hinders the diversification of the undergrowth of the Kouilou region, whose soil is already sandy and poor. It follows a decrease in land reserved for agricultural activities. Active or disadvantaged local populations are forced to abandon artisanal activities and to look for salaried jobs in mining companies. The production of charcoal for cooking, agriculture, hunting and gathering to feed these populations that are urbanizing and whose relationship with their original natural environment fades, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> to reassure {{the future of the}} biodiversity of the region.|$|E
25|$|Teeth (singular tooth) {{are small}} whitish {{structures}} {{found in the}} jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates {{that are used to}} tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.|$|E

When Barry is evicted from his flat, he decides to take a job as a DJ on a cruise liner in July 1988. Colin is saddened to see him leave.

25|$|Wolverine's {{mutation}} also {{consists of}} animal-like adaptations of his body, including pronounced, and sharp fang-like canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants {{created by the}} Weapon X program, the claws are later revealed to be {{a natural part of}} his body. The claws <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> of keratin, as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone. Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that he feels a brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them.During a talk to Jubilee, Wolverine reveals that there are channels inside his forearms through which the claws move when he extrudes them, and that he unsheathes the claws a few times a day to keep the channels open, similar to pierced ears.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} Calormen and the Calormenes <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> clear during the Chronicles. According to the Narnian {{timeline}} published by Walter Hooper, Calormen {{was founded by}} Archen outlaws, who traveled over the Great Desert to the south some 24 years after Archenland's founding. In an alternative theory, Calormen was founded by people accidentally crossing into Calormen from our world through a Middle Eastern portal (similar to the English wardrobe in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe), which was subsequently lost or destroyed, preventing their return. The Calormenes speak a flowery version of the standard English favoured by both human and animal Narnians, which might support this argument; however, Jadis also speaks English. The reason for the ancient Persian, Moorish, Mughal, Indian and Ottoman Turkish aspects of Calormene culture, or the origin of their religion, was not satisfactorily explained, but stand in strong counterpoint to the largely European, Anglo and Greco-Roman (and Christian) aspects of Narnia and Archenland.|$|E
