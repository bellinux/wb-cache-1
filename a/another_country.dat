50|$|Although not {{specified}} in the Nationality Law, the application for renunciation can be easily refused in Macau if the applicant is not receiving <b>another</b> <b>country's</b> nationality or citizenship after renunciation. In Hong Kong, the Immigration Department also states that one is only eligible to file an application if he shows the need to renounce Chinese nationality prior to receiving citizenship in <b>another</b> foreign <b>country</b> (e.g. Japan or Singapore). Mainland China, however, {{does not require the}} applicant to become <b>another</b> <b>country's</b> citizenship after renunciation. Therefore, it's possible for a Chinese national with Mainland residency to become stateless after the renunciation of his Chinese nationality.|$|R

5|$|Australia's {{changing}} security {{environment will}} lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from <b>another</b> <b>country,</b> terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes {{that it needs to}} make a contribution to maintaining the rules based order globally. There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E
