25|$|Andhra is characterised <b>as</b> having <b>its</b> own <b>mother</b> <b>tongue,</b> and <b>its</b> {{territory}} {{has been}} equated with {{the extent of}} the Telugu language. The equivalence between the Telugu linguistic sphere and geographical boundaries of Andhra is also brought out in an eleventh century description of Andhra boundaries. Andhra, according to this text, was bounded in north by Mahendra mountain in the modern Ganjam District of Orissa and to the south by Kalahasti temple in Chittor District. But Andhra extended westwards as far as Srisailam in the Kurnool District, about halfway across the modern state. Page number-36. According to other sources in the early sixteenth century, the northern boundary is Simhachalam and the southern limit is Tirupati or Tirumala Hill of the Telugu Country.|$|R

5000|$|In February 2006, Universal Music {{produced}} the first commercially backed album of Pakistani American rapper, Bohemia. A Punjabi Christian, born in Karachi, schooled in Peshawar, {{and brought up}} in the working class minority communities of San Francisco, Bohemia’s music emerged from personal experiences, such as seeing his best friend murdered and several others sent to jail. Pesa Nasha Pyar (Punjabi for [...] "Money Drugs Love") was Bohemia’s second album and stood out as lyrically groundbreaking. With Universal’s distribution network, Bohemia found a ready market among Pakistanis, both in the diaspora and in Pakistan itself. With just under half the country speaking Punjabi <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> <b>tongue,</b> a rapper rhyming in the language dramatically expanded hip hop’s linguistic possibilities, as well as cultural and socioeconomic scope, in Pakistan. Bohemia’s Punjabi rap most strongly resonated with this segment of the population. His lyrics also lent themselves to the growing Punjabiyat (Punjabi-ness) movement in Pakistan, particularly in their hyper masculine narratives. If Eminem was accessible to those Pakistanis who could imagine themselves fashioned in his image, Bohemia was for those rising rappers in the country for whom Eminem was not relatable. With Bohemia’s introduction of Punjabi rap, the old English-language scene was no longer relevant and rappers who had performed in English with limited success now found themselves influenced by Bohemia drawing upon Punjabi street slang. In the initial years, Punjabi rap dominated the Pakistani hip hop scene with Jhelum-based Punjabi rapper Kasim Raja, Billy X, Waqas Ali Qadri and Imran Khan..|$|E

For ethnopolitical reasons - the municipality and the whole region were considered as being Slovenian - the municipality was renamed in 1896 and its administrative center was transferred to the village of Poggersdorf/Pokrče that was also nearer to the main regional road. In the course of the administrative reform of 1973, a part of the former municipality of Hörtendorf (Trdnja vas) was attached to it. In the last population census of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1910, about 59% {{of the population of the}} municipality of Pokrče (Poggersdorf) declared Slovenian being their language of every day public use, which leads to the conclusion that even a higher part had or considered Slovenian being <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|R

6000|$|The once {{universal}} {{practice of}} learning by rote, is daily falling more into discredit. All modern authorities condemn the old mechanical way of teaching the alphabet.

[...] And so throughout. The rote-system, like ether systems of its age, made more of the forms and symbols than of the things symbolised. To repeat the words correctly was everything; to understand their meaning nothing; and thus the spirit was sacrificed to the letter. It is at length perceived that, in this case as in others, such a result is not accidental but necessary--that in proportion as there is attention to the signs, there must be inattention to the things signified; or that, as Montaigne long ago said--Sçavoir par coeur n'est pas sçavoir.|$|R

This paper argues the need for an international variety of English to be taught in schools and universities in the Arab world. The international variety is defined as English that is understood by multilingual audience. It is a kind of English that is comprehensible outside the Arab world. The writer discusses the problem posed in adopting such a variety. The writer argues that what determines the use of English in Arab schools and universities should be the job, the hobby, or the field of study of students. English should be looked upon as a means of communicating and understanding each other in fields that require the uses of a language other than Arabic. The writer argues that the goal of teaching an international variety should not be acculturation so as to preserve the cultural identity of Arab speakers of English...|$|R
