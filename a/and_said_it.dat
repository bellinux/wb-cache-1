5|$|AI {{behavior}} in Halo Wars 2 drew some criticism. Some reviewers described the pathfinding of units as substandard, and others considered the enemy AI {{to be too}} easy and not very smart on the normal difficulty setting. IGN reviews editor Dan Stapleton disliked that bases had to placed in predetermined locations; he {{found it to be}} limiting <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> constrained build order freedom. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Fraser Brown was also concerned about the restrictions on base building initially, however he became fond of the idea after playing the game for some time.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{particularly}} {{criticized the}} Jesuits for, among other things, teaching ethics {{not as a}} science but {{as a guide to}} good manners and for their adoption of Probabilism as a moral guide.

As a result, the priests had no real idea of their duties towards society and God and had little inclination to study.

In La ciencia blancardina he continued his attack on these quacks while attacking clerics who worked as physicians without adequate medical education.|$|E

As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|When Harry Dean Stanton {{auditioned for}} Brett, he told Ridley Scott {{he was not}} a fan of science-fiction or horror films; Scott replied that he was not either, but {{expected}} Alien to do well.

Several of Brett's scenes were deleted from the original cut, including Ripley and Parker seeing his death and his cocooned corpse in the Alien's lair; they were included in the 2003 director's cut. According to writer Dan O'Bannon, the latter scene hinted that Brett's body was becoming an Alien incubator.|$|E

5|$|Shaw wrote Take a Life, {{his first}} play, in 1961. He {{directed}} {{a production of}} the show at London's Mermaid Theatre, where he also played the lead role of the Detective. That same year he played two lead roles in George Bernard Shaw plays at the Dublin Theatre Festival: Mrs. Warren's Profession and Candida. Around this time, he also wrote an outline for a television comedy series about four girls sharing a flat, inspired by his real-life daughter, who was in her early twenties {{and living in a}} flat with other girls her age. The series was submitted to the Granada Television company, which expressed interest in the show <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was one of two under consideration for television. The company ultimately chose the other show, the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging {{as she made her}} way through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the Young Turks' press conference, Taylor privately met Khánh at the latter's office. He complained about the {{dissolution}} of the HNC <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> did not accord with the values of the alliance and the loyalty Washington expected of Saigon. He added that the US could not cooperate with two governments at once: a military regime that held power while a civilian body took the responsibility. Khánh testily replied that Vietnam was not a satellite of the US and compared the situation to the US support of the successful coup against Diệm, saying that loyalty was meant to be reciprocated. Khánh had hinted that he felt the Americans were about to have him deposed like Diệm, who was then assassinated, but this rankled Taylor, who had argued against the regime change. Taylor then bemoaned Khánh, saying he had lost confidence in the Vietnamese officer, recommending Khánh resign and go into exile. He also said military supplies currently being shipped to Vietnam would be withheld after arriving in Saigon and that American help in planning and advising military operations would be suspended.|$|E
