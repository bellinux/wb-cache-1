40|$|From the {{filtered}} nasopharyngeal washings {{of patients}} in the first 36 hours of uncomplicated epidemic influenza and rarely in later stages of the disease, we have cultivated a minute bacilloid body, Bacterium pneumosintes, 0. 15 to 0. 3 microns in length, of constant cultural characters and capable of indefinite propagation on artificial media. This organism, not {{of the nature of}} ordinary bacteria, was also recovered in pure culture from the unfiltered and filtered lung tissue of rabbits and guinea pigs inoculated with unfiltered and filtered nasopharyngeal washings of early influenza cases, both from the first epidemic of 1918 – 19 and from the second one of 1920. The organism grows only under strictly anaerobic conditions, passes Berkefeld V and N filters, and withstands the action of sterile 50 percent glycerol for a period of months. It has been recovered from cultures contaminated with a variety of ordinary bacteria such as Bacillus pfeifferi, pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and has been experimentally cultivated in symbiosis with them. Similar cultivation of control materials uniformly failed to yield growths of this organism. The materials tested consisted of the unfiltered and filtered nasopharyngeal washings of persons free from influenza, some of whom were suffering from <b>acute</b> <b>coryza,</b> the lung tissue of normal rabbits and of rabbits with bacterial respiratory infections, and the uninoculated media. The intratracheal injection in rabbits and guinea pigs of mass cultures of this organism has induced effects on the blood and lungs of these animals which are not to be distinguished from those obtained with the nasopharyngeal secretions {{of patients in}} the early hours of epidemic influenza. From the pulmonary lesions thus induced the same organism has been recovered in pure culture, and has been found to cause similar lesions on subsequent animal passage. Its pathogenicity is not lost by prolonged artificial cultivation. Our experiments indicate that the cultivable bodies obtained directly from human nasopharyngeal washings and from affected rabbit lungs are strains of the same organism. This organism appears to be the source of the reactions which occur in experimental animals—rabbits and guinea pigs—as a result of the intratracheal injection of nasopharyngeal washings obtained during the early hours of uncomplicated epidemic influenza in man...|$|E
40|$|Why {{should a}} {{physician}} know about homeopathy? Homeopathy is used widely. In 1997, {{it was estimated}} that nearly 2. 5 mil-lion patients in the United States alone use complementary alternative med-icine (CAM) modalities. In European countries, the number of CAM users is much higher and growing rapidly. Currently, one to two out of three patients use CAM, and approximately 3. 4 % of those patients use homeo-pathy [1]. Some physicians use homeopathic remedies for defined disease entities or adopt the use of homeopathic treatment principles for the treat-ment of several conditions (i. e., <b>acute</b> pain [2], <b>coryza</b> [3], diarrhea [4], hay fever [5], asthma [6], and migraine [7]). In Europe, homeopathy treatments represent {{a substantial portion of the}} over-the-counter market. Indeed, European physicians seem more amenable to homeopathy. More than 10, 000 German and French physicians practice homeopathy [8]. On average, 30 % of referrals made to the homeopathic hos-pitals within the United Kingdom come directly from oncologists [9]. A sur-vey of 293 general practitioners in the Netherlands showed that 45 % believe that homeopathy is efficacious [10]. Worldwide, $ 1 billion per year is spent on homeopathic medications [11]. The effects of homeopathy can be long lasting; 1 year after seeing a homeopath, nearly 75 % of patients report marked or moderate improvements [12]...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the incidence {{and describe the}} aetiology of epistaxis in infants. Design: Population-based study including a retrospective hospital admission database analysis and a postal questionnaire to clinicians. Setting: Wales, United Kingdom. Methods: Cases of epistaxis over a 6 -year period (1999 – 2004) were identified from the Patient Episode Dataset for Wales (PEDW) and validated using clinical information to calculate the population-based incidence and ascertain the causes of epistaxis in infants in Wales. Results: 36 confirmed cases were identified over the 6 -year period giving an estimated annual incidence of epistaxis of 19. 3 (95 % CI 14. 0 to 26. 7) per 100 000 infants. The median age at admission was 12 weeks (interquartile range 4 – 33) (min 1 week, max 49 weeks). 23 of the infants had a recognised cause for their epistaxis (trauma (five), coagulation disorder (four), congenital anomaly (two), <b>acute</b> rhinitis or <b>coryza</b> (11), abusive smothering event (one)). No cause for the epistaxis was identified for 13 cases. Coagulation disorder was excluded in seven of these 13 infants but in the other six no {{attempt was made to}} exclude this disorder. Child abuse was suspected but excluded in four of the 13 cases. Conclusion: Hospital admission for epistaxis is a rare event. In the majority of cases in this study a simple explanation was available and proven physical abuse was rare. A bleeding disorder should always be considered and, if additional evidence suggests physical abuse, this must be excluded...|$|R
