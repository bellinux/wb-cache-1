5|$|Because of its stiffness, {{light weight}} and {{dimensional}} stability {{over a wide}} temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense <b>and</b> <b>aerospace</b> industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium. Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized. A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium. From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons. The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.|$|E

5|$|Early {{researchers}} tasted beryllium and {{its various}} compounds for sweetness {{in order to}} verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt {{should be made to}} ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear <b>and</b> <b>aerospace</b> industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.|$|E
