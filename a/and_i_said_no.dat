She has a really big instrument. I thought {{we had to do}} something together that works. ‘Candle: Coventry Carol’ in itself is an ancient song, and I thought it would lend itself to that. And then Tash was thinking she wanted to do a bawdy song. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no.</b> She wanted to do a bawdy British schoolboy read on a carol. And I said, “no, we’re not doing that, we’re not shocking grandma”. I came up with this idea of ‘Holly, Ivy and Rose’ and she really took to that idea. So in the end both of them are there. And I thought that was important because we all sing together." ...|$|E
2500|$|I told Foster I {{should hold}} {{him for the}} money, and the old man, Van Triplett, said we acted as if we could not trust him, and gave {{some of the money}} back, and then said he would give us a chance to win it , so Foster turned the right card and [...] started to give him the money, but said, ‘Supposing you had bet that in earnest, did you have the money to put up?’ Foster said, ‘No,’ and turning to me said, ‘You have the money,’ <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no,</b> I did not have any money; that he took it all, but he said, ‘You have some dust,’ and wanted me to get it just to show the old man that we had the money in case the bet had been a real one. Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old man {{said he did not know}} if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the old man, said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I made a noise it would not be well for me. I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E

He rather took to me when he came first, and used to say he should like to see me married, and that he'd marry me, whether the young woman I chose lived in his parish or no.

[...] Clinton initially turned Obama down, but he persisted. Some Democratic senators welcomed the idea of her leaving, having been allied with Obama during the campaign, and believing that Clinton had risked party disunity by keeping her candidacy going for so long.|$|R

60|$|The hearty laugh of my {{dear old}} {{grandmother}} brought me up, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more; coloring, I believe, a little, {{at my own}} folly.

60|$|Had {{all things}} gone as ordered, our {{arrival at the}} St. Leonards' on Friday {{afternoon}} would have been imposing. It was our entrance, so to speak, upon the local stage; and Robina had decided {{it was a case}} where small economies ought not to be considered. The livery stable proprietor had suggested a brougham, but that would have necessitated one of us riding outside. I explained to Robina that, in the country, this was usual; and Robina had replied that much depended upon first impressions. Dick would, in all probability, claim the place for himself; and, the moment we were started, stick a pipe in his mouth. She selected an open landau of quite an extraordinary size, painted yellow. It looked to me an object more appropriate to a Lord Mayor's show than to the requirements of a Christian family; but Robina seemed touchy on the subject, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more. It certainly was roomy. Old Glossop had turned it out well, with a pair of greys--seventeen hands, I judged them. The only thing that seemed wrong was the coachman. I can't explain why, but he struck me as the class of youth one associates with a milk-cart.|$|E

We were playing it at the {{beginning}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> those chords sound dead evil. And thats usually {{how we do it}} - just sitting around and nattering and thinking and jamming away, and someone says something like evil walks and thats it. Some crud just sent me a letter - addressed to Bon too - sending us these stupid things. Some people are sick. If they want to go God-bothering they should go God-bother the Pope. He needs it.

6000|$|Powell had not {{expected}} to see anybody. [...] "But," [...] he said to me, [...] "I knew very well there was an ear listening and an eye glued to the crack of a cabin door. Awful thought. And that door was {{in that part of}} the saloon remaining in the shadow of the other half of the curtain. I pointed at it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> suppose that old man inside saw me pointing. The captain had a wonderful self-command. You couldn't have guessed anything from his face. Well, it was perhaps more thoughtful than usual. And indeed this was something to think about. But I couldn't think steadily. My brain would give a sort of jerk and then go dead again. I had lost all notion of time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> might have been looking at the captain for days and months for all I knew before I heard him whisper to me fiercely: `Not a word!' This jerked me out of that trance <b>I</b> was in <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> `No! <b>No!</b> <b>I</b> didn't mean even you.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|After that Uncle William {{decided that}} it was {{necessary}} for me to marry in a way to restore our fortunes and he decided to offer me to a State Governor. He asked me if I had any choice of States, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no.</b> Of course I should not have wished to marry a state governor, but I knew my duty towards Uncle William and I said nothing. So Uncle got a map of the United States and he decided to marry me to the Governor of Texas. He told me that I could have two weeks to arrange my supply of household linen and my trousseau to take to Texas, and he wrote at once to the Governor. He showed me what he wrote {{and it was a very}} formal letter. I think that Uncle's mind gets more and more confused as to where he is and what he is and he wrote in quite the old strain and I noticed that he signed himself, [...] "Your brother, William." [...] Perhaps it was on that account that we had no answer to the letter. Uncle seemed to forget all about it very soon and I was glad that it was so, and that I had escaped going to the court of Texas.|$|E
60|$|This {{settled the}} {{matter for the}} present, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more. Neb was ordered to be in {{readiness}} for the next day; and at the appointed hour, I met the assembled party to take my leave, on this, my third departure {{from the roof of}} my fathers. It had been settled the Major and Emily were to remain at the farm until July, when they were to proceed to the Springs, {{for the benefit of the}} water, after living so long in a hot climate. I had passed an hour with my guardian alone, and he had no more to say, than to wish me well, and to bestow his blessing. I did not venture an offer to embrace Lucy. It was the first time we had parted without this token of affection; but I was shy, and I fancied she was cold. She offered me her hand, as frankly as ever, however, and I pressed it fervently, as I wished her adieu. As for Grace, she wept in my arms, just as she had always done, and the Major and Emily shook hands cordially with me, it being understood I should find them in New York, at my return. Rupert accompanied me down to the sloop.|$|E
6000|$|Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't {{natural for}} a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and out drops {{a little piece of}} paper with [...] "HALF-PAST TWO" [...] wrote on it with a pencil. I ransacked it, but couldn't find {{anything}} else. I couldn't make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no,</b> and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her [...] "no, only coarse-hand," [...] and then she said the paper warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the event}} [...] "F1 Rocks" [...] in 2009, Khoo {{said that he}} had a dispute with Lindsay Lohan, who hosted the event. According to Khoo, Lohan accused Khoo of trying to get between her and Samantha Ronson. Khoo later said, [...] "Lindsay Lohan once gestured me to go over to her. She {{eventually}} started screaming at me, saying that I was coming in between her and Samantha Ronson, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> 'Errrr <b>no,</b> why should I come in between a lesbian couple', she replied 'You're lying, I can tell from your eyes you're lying!' before Samantha told me to forget about it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Actually, I didn't kill {{more than}} four or five people in hand-to hand combat ... We'd face an enemy trench that we'd captured, and when we called out, [...] "Ni, Lai-Lai!"

2500|$|Lounes Matoub {{was born}} on 24 January 1956 {{in the village of}} Taourirt Moussa in Algerian Kabylie. [...] When he turned 9, he built his first guitar from an empty car oil can and {{composed}} his first songs as a teenager. His political and cultural identity was awakened by armed confrontations between Kabyles and government forces in 19631964. In 1968, the Algerian government introduced a policy of Arabization in the education system. Matoub reacted by skipping school; his memoirs recall: [...] "We had to give up Berber <b>and</b> reject French. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>no!</b> <b>I</b> played hooky in all my Arabic classes. Every class that I missed was an act of resistance, a slice of liberty conquered. My rejection was voluntary and purposeful." [...] By 1975, he had abandoned formal education. He left for France in search of work.|$|R

I saw the keen point flash towards me, and {{sprang to}} one side having a desire to fly, as, being unarmed except for my stick, I might have done without shame. But spring as I would I could not avoid the thrust altogether. It was aimed at my heart and it pierced the sleeve of my left arm, passing through the flesh--no more. Yet at the pain of that cut all thought of flight left me, and instead of it a cold anger filled me, causing me to wish to kill this man who had {{attacked}} me thus and unprovoked. In my hand was my stout oaken staff which I had cut myself {{on the banks of}} Hollow Hill, <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> would fight I must make such play with this as I might. It seems a poor weapon indeed to match against a Toledo blade in the hands of one who could handle it well, and yet there are virtues in a cudgel, for when a man sees himself threatened with it, he is likely to forget that he holds in his hand a more deadly weapon, and to take to the guarding of his own head in place of running his adversary through the body.|$|R

When in casual Standard English the oblique case is used, in the West Country dialect the object of many a verb takes the nominative case.
