40|$|International audienceThe ENTAM as the European Network of Testing {{stations}} of Agricultural Machines and equipment has settled {{up a new}} ENTAM Technical Working Group in order to draft a common methodology to test the <b>agricultural</b> <b>tyre</b> energy efficiency, in close cooperation {{with one of the}} biggest tyre manufacturer. The aim was to find a compromise between easiness and representativeness of the measurements, with reproducible records carried out on real agricultural fields, in standardized soil conditions. It is described a proposal for a dimensionless tyre performance index and a way to standardize the test methodology and the test devices...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{experimental}} {{determination of the}} force systems acting on free-rolling 7. 50 x 16 <b>agricultural</b> <b>tyres,</b> measured with a six-component suspension of the test wheel. Multivariate experimentation techniques were used involving five variables: slip angle, camber, vertical load, tyre pattern and land or furrow operation. The results are presented as three force and three moment components; other methods of represen-tation are discussed briefly. Although the side or cornering force depends on many factors, particularly the soil surface, and is therefore difficult to predict, {{it is suggested that}} the draught force (i. e. resistance in the direction of motion) can be expressed as a function of slip for all surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{provides}} an overview of the soil, its composition and attributes. Then, it briefly describes causes of soil solidification and methods of soil cultivation, which eliminate the unwanted soil solidification. This thesis also gives an overview of <b>agricultural</b> <b>tyres,</b> their composition and compression systems. Furthermore, it describes undercarriages of combine harvesters and their advantages and disadvantages. In the practical part of this thesis, there were done laboratory and field measurements of soil solidification after being run over by combine harvesters with different contents of grains in the grain hoppers and using the combine harvester inclination. Subsequently, the measurements were compared and evaluated in terms of changes in the soil porosity...|$|R

In the past, some United States contract manufacturing was done by Cooper Tire's Findlay, Ohio plant. Contract manufacture by Giti Tire includes production of up to 500,000 Nokian summer tyres with expansion up to 1.5 million tyres per year. Some Nokian <b>agricultural</b> and industrial <b>tyres</b> were made under contract by the Tofan Grup in Romania for two years until December 1999, when Nokian Tyres withdrew, citing quality standards. Contract manufacture {{of these types of}} heavy tyres was then undertaken by Michelin at its Polish plant in Stomil-Olsztyn from 2000 until 2005, when Nokian began to shift contract manufacture of industrial tyres to Bridgestone's factory in Bilbao, Spain and <b>agricultural</b> <b>tyres</b> to Balkrishna Tyres in Bhiwadi, India. With an increase in tyre demand as a result of improving economies, Nokian is considering increasing production as well as outsouring additional tyre manufacture in Asia.|$|R
40|$|Introducing loads {{onto the}} soil via {{pneumatic}} tyred equipment {{is the major}} cause of compaction of agricultural soils, which causes damage to the soil-water-air-plant system. The degree of soil compaction is largely influenced by the loads applied to the soil and resulting surface and subsurface pressure. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} in order to determine an effective method to measure the pressure distribution under a selection of pneumatic <b>agricultural</b> <b>tyres</b> on a hard surface and in the soil profile. As a result of this, it has been possible to evaluate the influence of tyre inflation pressure, load, ply rating and tread pattern on the resulting pressure. Also, the carcass stiffness of the tyres studied was determined and alternative methods to predict the carcass stiffness were evaluated and an improved technique was developed. Cont/d.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{compaction}} phenomenon of agricultural soil can be defi ned as an increase in its dry density, respectively as in reduction of its porosity, and it can result from any natural causes as: rainfall impact, soaking, internal water stress from soil, and other. An important role has the artifi cial compaction, which is generated by the contact with tyres or caterpillars of tractors and agricultural machines. In present, {{one of the most}} advanced methods for modelling the phenomenon of stresses propagation in agricultural soil is the Finite Element Method (FEM), which is a numerical method for obtaining approximate solutions of ordinary and partial diff erential equations of this distribution. In this paper, the soil has been idealised as an elastic-plastic material by Drucker-Prager yield criteria. Th is paper presents a model for prediction of the stress state in agricultural soil below <b>agricultural</b> <b>tyres</b> in the driving direction and perpendicular to the driving direction, which are diff erent from one another, using the Finite Element Method. General model of analysis was created using FEM, which allows the analysis of equivalent stress distribution and the tota...|$|R
40|$|European {{standards}} will increase agricultural vehicles’ speed up to 80 km/h on ordinary asphalt roads. Thus vehicle safety and cornering stability are becoming issues of fundamental importance. To {{address these issues}} at a design stage, mathematical models simulating the handling behaviour of agricultural vehicles are needed. For passenger cars, tyre model parameters used in such models are generally identified from indoor tests on a individual tyres. Size, dimension and amplitude of required forces make these experiments more challenging for <b>agricultural</b> <b>tyres</b> and thus they are generally not performed. The present paper presents a methodology to identify agricultural tyres’ handling characteristics based only on the measurements carried out on board vehicle (vehicle sideslip angle, yaw rate, lateral acceleration, speed and steer angle) during standard handling manoeuvres (step-steers, ramp-steers, sweep tests, etc.), instead than during indoor tests. In particular, MF-Tyre model parameters (including vertical load and pressure dependency) are identified by the developed algorithm, {{which is based on}} a constrained minimization approach. The proposed identification procedure was applied to the data collected on an instrumented high-range agricultural vehicle during a series of handling manoeuvres carried out at different inflation pressures...|$|R
40|$|For {{passenger}} cars, individual tyre model parameters, used in vehicle models able {{to simulate}} vehicle handling behavior, are traditionally derived from expensive component indoor laboratory tests {{as a result}} of an identification procedure minimizing the error with respect to force and slip measurements. Indoor experiments on <b>agricultural</b> <b>tyres</b> are instead more challenging and thus generally not performed due to tyre size and applied forces. However, the knowledge of their handling characteristics is becoming more and more important since in the next few years, all agricultural vehicles are expected to run on ordinary asphalt roads at a speed of 80 km/h. The present paper presents a methodology to identify agricultural tyres' handling characteristics based only on the measurements carried out on board vehicle (vehicle sideslip angle, yaw rate, lateral acceleration, speed and steer angle) during standard handling maneuvers (step-steers, J-turns, etc.), instead than during indoor tests. In particular, MF-Tyre model parameters (including vertical load and pressure dependency) are identified by the developed algorithm, which is based on a constrained minimization approach. The proposed identification procedure was applied to the data collected on an instrumented high-range agricultural vehicle during a series of handling maneuvers carried out at different inflation pressures.

40|$|Loading soil via {{pneumatic}} tyres {{is a major}} cause of compaction of agricultural soils, which causes damage to the soil-water-air-plant system. The loads applied to the soil and the resulting pressure influences the degree of soil compaction. This study was conducted to determine an effective method to measure the pressure distribution under a selection of pneumatic <b>agricultural</b> <b>tyres.</b> This was conducted initially on a non-deformable surface; a later study will consider pressures within the subsoil. From this the tyre carcass stiffness was determined and methods to predict carcass stiffness were evaluated. Tyre carcass stiffness is defined as an equivalent pressure resulting from the stiffness of the tyre carcass. In order to estimate the carcass stiffness of tyres a number of approaches were considered including: (i) footprint area, (ii) tyre load – deflection, (iii) pressure mapping and (iv) tyre manufacturer's specification methods. Carcass stiffness values obtained from the footprint area method gave results significantly lower (30 – 40 %) than those obtained using the pressure mapping system. The method based on the tyre load – deflection characteristics was found to give a better estimation of the tyre carcass stiffness of the smooth rather than the treaded tyre. The technique of using the tyre manufacturer's specification data, where the estimation of the tyre carcass stiffness was calculated using the theoretical load that the tyre could support at zero inflation pressure, produced estimates that were within ± 20 % of the mean carcass stiffness determined using the pressure mapping system...|$|R

40|$|A {{method used}} to measure the radial {{suspension}} properties of <b>agricultural</b> tractor <b>tyres</b> is described. The stiffness and damping of a range of tyres have been measured. The effects on tyre stiffness and damping coefficient of rolling speed, inflation pressure, load, amplitude, frequency of vibration, driving torque, surface type, tyre size, ply rating, construction, wear and age are reported. A relationship is developed which enables the stiffness of a rolling tyre to be estimated from the tyre size, age and inflation pressure. It is shown that this is a more accurate estimate of rolling tyre stiffness than measurement of the stiffness of a stationary tyre. The measured tyre characteristics are used to predict the vibration of a single degree of freedom system and of a four wheel tractor. Significant improvements in accuracy are found when the results are compared with those obtained using stationary tyre characteristics. The frequencies of the natural pitch and vertical modes of vibration are usually predicted to within ± 10 %. Predictions of rms acceleration levels are less accurate. Further improvements in modelling accuracy should be achieved by more accurate measurement and modelling of the suspension characteristics of the drive wheels in the longitudinal direction...|$|R
