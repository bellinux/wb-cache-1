In these works, Thompson became one of the writers who turned the derided crime genre into {{literature}} and art, featuring unreliable narrators, odd structure, and quasi-surrealistic inner narratives of the last thoughts of his dying or dead characters. A number of Thompson's books became popular films, including The Getaway and The Grifters.|$|E

Dewaere conveys a tragic dimension to his manic portrayal of a mediocre door-to-door salesman, at one point repeatedly bashing his head against a car in an effort to exorcise his angst and guilt.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{unreliable}} narrators {{often appear}} in detective novels and thrillers, where even a first-person narrator might hide essential information and deliberately mislead the reader {{in order to}} preserve the surprise ending. In some cases, the narrator describes himself or herself as doing things which seem questionable or discreditable, only to reveal in the end that such actions were not what they seemed (e.g. Alistair MacLean's The Golden Rendezvous and John Grisham's The Racketeer). Crime novelist Jim Thompson used the device of a narrator who is belatedly revealed to be psychotic and possibly delusional repeatedly in his books, most notably The Killer Inside Me, Savage Night, <b>A</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman, and Pop. 1280.|$|E

40|$|During one of Catherine’s hysteric fits, {{she cries}} out; “Why am I so changed? Why does my blood rush into <b>a</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> tumult at <b>a</b> few words?” This {{question}} sparks my analysis behind Catherine’s hysteria in Wuthering Heights. My thesis aims to answer not only {{why is she}} so changed, but how is her transformation articulated on both a personal and cultural level. Hysteria during the mid nineteenth century was a richly debated topic. There were two main theories {{on the origin of}} hysteria: one stressed the lack of internal control, while the other emphasized too much external control on female bodies. My analysis, deeply rooted in history, joins both of these medical theories by examining Catherine’s movements through place. Catherine moves from places where she is happy to environments that slowly start to constrain her actions and choices. In this movement between places, Catherine’s increasingly agitated movements convey her growing frustration, and her outsider status. Her frantic movements are often undercut by moments of stillness. Overtime, her placidity pervades the text making her physical and emotional wounds apparent. By understanding Catherine’s narrative, the reader is moved to see how hysteria can be <b>a</b> fleeting source <b>of</b> agency and <b>a</b> cultural imposition that engenders enduring trauma...|$|R

40|$|The author reviews some of {{the social}} and {{behavioral}} factors acting on the brain that influence health, illness, and death. Supported with data from several areas of research, his proposal for understanding health and illness provides both the concepts and the mechanisms for study-ing and explaining mind–body relationships. The brain is the body’s first line of defense against illness, and the mind is the emergent functioning of the brain. This mind–body approach incorporates ideas, belief systems, and hopes as well as biochemistry, physiology, and anatomy. Changing thoughts imply a changing brain and thus a changing biology and body. Belief systems provide a baseline for the functioning brain upon which other variables act and have their effects. The mind is its own place, and in itself Can make <b>a</b> Heav’n <b>of</b> <b>Hell,</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>of</b> Heav’n. —John Milton, Paradise Lost In 1948, the World Health Organization defined healthas the presence of well-being—physical, mental, andsocial—not as the absence of disease. The American Psychological Association amended its bylaws in 2001 to recognize “promoting health ” as one of its major missions (Thorn & Saab, 2001). In the past, the point of contact between psychology and health has sometimes been couched in economic terms: for instance, as in the title of one article, “The Impact of Psychological Interventions on Medical Cost Offset ” (Chiles, Lambert, & Hatch, 1999; see also Cummings, 1999). The dollar savings are impres-sive—up to 20 % in some situations—but the interventions are only rarely used (Sobel, 2000). Another focus has been on the contributions psychology can make to the prevention of substance abuse and other behavioral social issues suc...|$|R
