Among the conditions were that within five years, the municipality could {{demand that the}} line be extended to either Ljabru or Ljan. The concession was again considered on 2 November 1911, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> was decided that the concession would be removed if the line was not finished {{by the end of}} 1914. However, in November 1911, Oslo City Council postponed their permissions while the issue was again made subject to reports on the issue. The report suggested a different route, which ran via Lodalen and up Ekebergsletta at Ekeberg hovedgård. After negotiations, the city agreed to allow the line to follow Kongsveien.|$|E
5|$|Gregarious in nature, {{the pink}} whipray {{has been known}} to form large active and resting aggregations, and {{associate}} with other large ray species. It preys mainly on prawns, but also consumes other benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. This species is aplacental viviparous, in which the unborn young are nourished by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Across much of its range, substantial numbers of pink whiprays are caught incidentally by a variety of fishing gear and marketed for meat, skin, and cartilage. It is also of importance to ecotourism, being attracted to visitors with bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, due to its wide distribution that includes relatively protected areas, such as northern Australia. However, its population in Southeast Asia is likely declining under heavy fishing pressure, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> has been assessed as Vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|The {{zebra shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries across {{most of its}} range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat {{and low levels of}} dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that they are much less common now than in the past. They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered. Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> has been assessed as of Least Concern.|$|E

25|$|Eastern Orthodox {{tradition}} {{holds that}} the creation of Christian images dates back to the very early days of Christianity, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> has been a continuous tradition since then. Modern academic art history considers that, while images may have existed earlier, the tradition can only {{be traced back to the}} 3rd century, and the images that survive from Early Christian art were often very different from later ones. The icons of later centuries can be linked, often closely, to images from the 5th century onwards, though very few of these survive. There was enormous destruction of images during the Byzantine Iconoclasm of 726-842, although this did settle for good the question of the appropriateness of images. Since then icons have had a great continuity of style and subject; far greater than in the images of the Western church. At the same time there has been change and development.|$|E

The reviews were respectful, but the work did not catch the opera-going public's imagination, and the Royal Opera House's production was [...] "insultingly half-hearted" [...] according to Frogley. The piece was revived the following year, but was still not a great success. Vaughan Williams commented to Ursula, [...] "They don't like it, they won't like it, they don't want an opera with no heroine and no love duets—and I don't care, it's what I meant, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> is." ...|$|E

These also perfectly typify the Bourbon Street honky-tonks that Mr. Curtiz and his fine photographer, Russ Harlan, have beguilingly drenched with atmosphere. Matching, or balancing, the tunes are at least seven characterizations that supply the real backbone and {{tell the story of}} the picture. ... for Mr. Presley, in his third screen attempt, it's a pleasure to find him up to a little more than Bourbon Street shoutin' and wigglin'.

500|$|The regular Football League {{restarted}} in {{time for}} the 1946–47 season. Ramsey moved into club-owned lodgings in Southampton with a close friend from the army, Alf Freeman, an inside-forward who had also signed for the club. Ramsey started the season in the reserve team, selected at centre-forward, and scored in each of the first three games. After five matches, Dodgin and the club trainer Sydney Cann made a decision that changed the course of Ramsey's entire professional playing career: deciding that neither centre-half nor centre-forward truly suited him, they moved him to right-back. McKinstry calls this [...] "exactly the right place for Alf", citing Ramsey's tactical knowledge and fine passing. A close master-and-pupil relationship developed between Ramsey and Cann, who had played at full-back for Torquay United, Manchester City and Charlton Athletic. During training sessions, the two had long discussions about tactics and individual techniques. [...] wanted to learn about the game from top to bottom," [...] Cann recalled; [...] "I have never known anyone with the same quickness of learning as Alf Ramsey. He would never accept anything on its face value... He was the type of player who was a manager's dream because you could talk about a decision and he would accept it <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> was, in his game." ...|$|E

The lesbian implications of Dracula's Daughter were obvious from the start and were of great concern to the Production Code Administration. PCA head Breen took special notice of the scene between the Countess and her model, Lili, writing, [...] "This will need very careful handling to avoid any questionable flavor." [...] The day before the scene was to be shot, Universal's Harry Zehner asked Breen to read a draft of the scene. In response, Breen wrote: [...] "The present suggestion that...Lili poses in the nude will be changed. She will be posing her neck and shoulders, and there will be no suggestion that she undresses, and there will be no exposure of her person. It was also stated that the present incomplete sequence will be followed by a scene in which Lili is taken to a hospital <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> will be definitely established that she {{has been a}}ttacked by a vampire. The whole sequence will be treated in such a way as to avoid any suggestion of perverse sexual desire on the part of Marya or of an attempted sexual attack by her upon Lili." ...|$|E

500|$|The season {{also saw}} {{several of the}} show's cast write their own episodes. Series co-star Gillian Anderson {{directed}} and wrote her first episode of the series, [...] "all things". Anderson originally approached Carter about writing and directing an episode of the series during the sixth season. Anderson crafted a script that would see Scully pursuing a [...] "deeply personal X-File, one which in [...] is taken down a spiritual path when logic fails her". Anderson had only a rough outline of the script until one day she wrote {{a majority of the}} story in one sitting. She explained, [...] "A certain concept began to form, [...] I just wrote the entire outline for 'all things' right then <b>and</b> <b>there.</b> <b>It</b> all just kind of came together on the page". The next day, Anderson pitched the script to Carter, who approved of the [...] "personal and quiet" [...] characteristics of the story. In addition, series regular Davis wrote his only episode, [...] "En Ami". Davis approached Carter with his idea about Cigarette Smoking Man trying to seduce Scully with medical knowledge, and Carter, who was intrigued, responded positively to the idea. He assigned executive producer Spotnitz to work with Davis and craft a full-fledged script. The script went through many revisions. Because Cigarette Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully, Carter later referred to the [...] "En Ami" [...] as [...] "the creepiest episode of the year." ...|$|E
