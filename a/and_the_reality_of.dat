5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a subspecialty of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E

25|$|The Linwoods; or Sixty Years Since in America (1835) is an {{historical}} romance set during the American Revolution. Sedgwick uses a cosmopolitan framework {{to shed light}} on American character and national identity in the early republic by exploring America's relationship with Britain and France. The balance between American nationalism and cosmopolitanism is idealized in the novel through the character of the Marquis de Lafayette, as is the struggle between Old World notions of class <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> American democracy.|$|E
25|$|Mother tongue : The first {{language}} learned by a person, {{which may or}} may not still be used by that individual in adulthood, is a basic measure of a population's language. However, with the high number of mixed francophone-anglophone marriages <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> multilingualism in Montreal, this description does not give a true linguistic portrait of Quebec. It is, however, still essential, for example in order to calculate the assimilation rate.

25|$|In the 21st century, {{the city}} has been working on new {{projects}} to restore itself as the strategic capital within the country. Rapid urban growth, including the mass migration of peasants to the main cities, attracted by economic development, has led to the demand of numerous proposals to accommodate such growth. Barranquilla has always been famous for its chaotic urban planning, understandable given its spontaneous origin as a port <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> high administrative corruption which has hampered the channeling of resources for building an urban centre of greater structure and dimensions. The presentation of a new infrastructure, changes in local and regional administration, decentralization since 1991, international pressure to open markets, and competition between the other major Colombian cities will bring about considerable development in Barranquilla into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} learned initially of 47 deaths after {{a routine}} {{visit to the}} camp by the Swiss authorities as the protecting power in May; the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden announced this news to the House of Commons on 19 May 1944. Shortly after the announcement the Senior British Officer of the camp, Group Captain Herbert Massey, was repatriated to England due to ill health. Upon his return, he informed the Government about {{the circumstances of the}} escape <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the murder of the recaptured escapees. With the information received from Massey along with the official notification of the 50 deaths from the German Government, Eden updated Parliament on 23 June, promising that, {{at the end of the}} war, those responsible would be brought to exemplary justice.|$|E
25|$|Like Louverture, Jean-Baptiste Belley {{was also}} an active {{participant}} in the colony's insurrection. The portrait of Belley by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson depicts a man who encompasses the French view of its colonies. The portrait creates a stark dichotomy between the refinement of French Enlightenment thought <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the situation in Saint Domingue, through the bust of Raynald and the figure of Belley, respectively. While distinguished, the portrait still portrays a man trapped by the confines of race. Girodet's portrayal of the former National Convention deputy is telling of the French opinion of colonial citizens by emphasizing the subject's sexuality and including an earring. Both of these racially charged symbols reveal the desire to undermine the colony's attempts at independent legitimacy, as citizens of the colonies were not able to access the elite class of French Revolutionaries because of their race.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{publication}} of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, {{the position of the}} Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has slowly been refined. For about 100 years, there was no authoritative pronouncement on the subject, though many hostile comments were made by local church figures. In contrast with many Protestant objections, Catholic issues with evolutionary theory have {{had little to do with}} maintaining the literalism of the account in the Book of Genesis, and have always been concerned with the question of how man came to have a soul. Modern Creationism has had little Catholic support. In the 1950s, the Church's position was one of neutrality; by the late 20th century its position evolved to one of general acceptance in recent years. However, the church insists that the human soul was immediately infused by God, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> a single ancestor (commonly called monogenism) for the human race.|$|E
25|$|Central to {{the myth}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the West is the American cowboy. His real {{life was a}} hard one and {{revolved}} around two annual roundups, spring and fall, the subsequent drives to market, and the time off in the cattle towns spending his hard earned money on food, clothing, gambling, and prostitution. During winter, many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns, where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings. For young cowboys and buckaroos, working cattle {{was not just a}} job but also a lifestyle, one that was lived in the freedom of the outdoors and, most of the time, on horseback. On a long drive, there was usually one cowboy for each 250 head of cattle. Alcohol was everywhere in the West (outside Mormondom), but on the trail the cowboys were forbidden to drink it. Often, hired cowboys were trained and knowledgeable in their trade such as herding, ranching and protecting cattle. To protect their herd from wild animals, hostile Indians and rustlers, cowboys carried with them their iconic weaponry such as the Bowie knife, lasso, bullwhip, pistols, rifles and shotguns.|$|E
25|$|Born of an English tour of North America in 2001, the Churchill Cup of Rugby came to {{fruition}} in 2003, in Vancouver. The tournament arises {{out of a}} 5-year agreement between Rugby Canada, Rugby USA and the Rugby Football Union (England) to hold an annual rugby tournament in North America originally intended to be played between the nations Senior Men's and Women's sides. Canada will host the event from 2003 to 2005, in 2003 and 2004 the event was held in Edmonton, Alberta. While the US will {{have the option of}} picking up hosting {{the last two years of}} the tournament in 2006 and 2007, with the advent of the USA Sevens in San Diego <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> moving such an event, it is entirely likely that the event will remain in Canada, specifically Edmonton, through 2007. With respect to the Women's component, with Canada being awarded the 2006 Women's World Cup of Rugby, to be played in Edmonton and the Ottawa/Montreal region, it was felt that for 2005 and 2006 the Women's component should be removed, with the Women playing in the Canada Cup of Women's Rugby in Ottawa/Montreal in July 2005 and the Women's World Cup itself in September 2006 in Edmonton and Ottawa/Montreal.|$|E

500|$|... "Whale Whores" [...] {{addresses}} the controversies surrounding Japanese whaling, {{which had been}} a subject of considerable media attention around the time the South Park episode first aired. The episode is equally condemning of all sides involved in the matter, including the Japanese whalers themselves and the activists who fight against them. By having the Japanese attack the dolphins at the Denver Aquarium {{in the middle of}} a dolphin riding demonstration, it has been suggested the episode highlights the link between visiting dolphins at marine parks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> how aquatic wildlife are captured and slaughtered. [...] "Whale Whores" [...] is critical of the practice of whaling, as it displays primitive characteristics of the whalers.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian has praised Swift {{for writing}} about teenage years [...] "with {{a kind of}} wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia" [...] {{over the course of}} her first two albums. New York has remarked that many singer-songwriters have made great records as teens, but [...] "none made great records so {{explicitly}} about their teens". The magazine has also compared her work to Brian Wilson. In Fearless, Swift featured fairy tale imagery and explored the disconnect [...] "between fairy tales <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> love". Her later albums address more adult relationships. In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships, friendships, alienation, fame, and career ambitions. Swift frequently includes [...] "a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative".|$|E
500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the first {{generation}} of German sociologists formally introduced methodological anti-positivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural norms, values, symbols, and social processes viewed from a resolutely subjective perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify causal relationships of human [...] "social action"—especially among [...] "ideal types", or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena. As a non-positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as [...] "historical, invariant, or generalisable" [...] as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand Tönnies, theorized on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on [...] "Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft" [...] (lit. community and society). Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way ("pure sociology"), whereas the second empirically and inductively ("applied sociology").|$|E
