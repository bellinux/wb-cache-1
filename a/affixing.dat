5|$|Finally, in late 1229, Theodore began {{assembling}} {{his forces}} at Thessalonica—including {{a contingent of}} troops sent by Frederick II—for the projected final attack on Constantinople. As his troops marched east in spring 1230, he unexpectedly turned his army north and followed the Evros valley into Bulgaria. Theodore's motives for this sudden change are debated. Contemporary and later historians like Akropolites denounced this {{as a sign of}} Theodore's duplicity and treachery. A more likely suggestion is that Theodore, hitherto undefeated in battle, desired to check Bulgarian power and avoid the possibility of the Bulgarians striking in his rear while he was engaged in besieging Constantinople. Although caught by surprise, John Asen reacted rapidly. Allegedly <b>affixing</b> the text of the broken treaty to one of his spears as a flag, he rallied his troops and met Theodore in battle in April 1230. The ensuing Battle of Klokotnitsa was a crushing victory for the Bulgarian ruler, who took Theodore and many of his officers captive.|$|E

25|$|<b>Affixing</b> {{includes}} prefixing (adding {{before the}} base), and suffixing (adding after the base), {{as well as}} the much less common infixing (inside) and circumfixing (a combination of prefix and suffix).|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} types of <b>affixes,</b> namely prefixes (awalan), suffixes (akhiran), circumfixes (apitan) and infixes (sisipan). These <b>affixes</b> are {{categorised}} into noun <b>affixes,</b> verb <b>affixes,</b> and adjective <b>affixes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Joint <b>affixes</b> are the {{patterns}} which provide grammatical meaning references by forming complements or phrases.

None of the <b>affixes</b> which bring about the joint <b>affixes,</b> can correspond {{the function of the}} joint <b>affix</b> itself in terms of both syntax and semantic. The <b>affixes</b> realize a new function by unifying. As convenient to this usage seventeen <b>affix</b> patterns have been fixed in Turkish. Ten of them are used with verbs and seven of them are used with nouns. The joint <b>affixes</b> which are used with verbs constitute adverbial participle phrases. The joint <b>affixes</b> which are used with nouns have the function of forming definite/chain noun complement, reduplication or phrases with two case <b>affixes.</b> In this study, functions of joint <b>affixes</b> with regard to semantic and syntax have been examine...|$|R

50|$|Derivational <b>affixes</b> are {{attached}} to stems and serve to classify them. Together, stems and derivational <b>affixes</b> form themes, which can be further modified by inflectional and syntactic <b>affixes.</b> The stem rakh-, meaning laugh, may take the derivational <b>affix</b> -ohw and become rakhohw-, or laugh at. Thus, -ohw serves to create an impersonal transitive verb theme with rakh- as the stem. There are many derivational <b>affixes,</b> most of which correspond to a complicated set of rules: stems can belong to one of eleven categories that determines which set of derivational <b>affixes</b> it may take. Therefore, to form an impersonal transitive verb theme like rakhohw, for example, there are 10 other possible <b>affixes</b> that occur with stems from other categories. Furthermore, certain derivational <b>affixes</b> occur only when <b>affixed</b> to specific stems.|$|R

50|$|Inflectional <b>affixes</b> encode {{the subject}} and object of the theme. Wiyot makes a sharp {{distinction}} between definite and indefinite subjects, and each of these classes has {{its own set of}} inflectional <b>affixes.</b> Certain classes of Wiyot verbs can also take benefactive and instrumental <b>affixes.</b> The benefactive characterizes the verb as being done to a third person object for the benefit of a second object. Instrumental <b>affixes</b> convey that action is performed using a device of some kind. Instrumental and benefactive <b>affixes</b> directly encode for the subject of the verb and thus do not appear with inflectional <b>affixes</b> for subject. Therefore, the most inflectional <b>affixes</b> a verb can possibly take is three.Inflectional <b>affixes</b> can be either terminal or nonterminal in nature. Terminal <b>affixes,</b> when added to verb or noun themes, can complete words, while nonterminal <b>affixes</b> require additional affixation.The noun form rakhóhwalił, meaning he/she laughs at me, contains two inflectional <b>affixes</b> that modify the verb form rakhohw- shown above: -al is the nonterminal suffix that encodes a first person object, and -ił is the terminal suffix for a third person subject.|$|R

25|$|In England, the {{introduction}} of family names is generally attributed to {{the preparation of the}} Domesday Book in 1086, following the Norman conquest. Evidence indicates that surnames were first adopted among the feudal nobility and gentry, and only slowly spread to other parts of society. Some of the early Norman nobility who arrived in England during the Norman conquest differentiated themselves by <b>affixing</b> 'de' (of) before the name of their village in France. This is what is known as a territorial surname, a consequence of feudal landownership. In medieval times in France, such a name indicated lordship, or ownership, of the village. But some early Norman nobles in England chose to drop the French derivations and call themselves instead after their new English holdings.|$|E

25|$|Besides the {{administration}} of the oaths of office, there is no set formula for the swearing-in of a lieutenant governor-designate. Though there may therefore be variations to the following, the appointee will generally travel to the legislative assembly building in the provincial capital, where a guard of honour awaits to give a general salute. From there, the party is led by the speaker of the legislative assembly to the legislative chamber, wherein all justices of the province's superior court, members of the legislative assembly, and other guests are assembled. The governor general's commission for the lieutenant governor-designate is then read aloud, and the required oaths are administered to the appointee by either the governor general or a delegate thereof; the three oaths are: the Oath of Allegiance, the Oath of Office as lieutenant governor, and the oath as keeper of the province's great seal. With the <b>affixing</b> of their signature to these three solemn promises, the individual is officially the lieutenant governor, and at that moment the Viceregal Salute is played and a 15- is conducted outside. The lieutenant governor then receives the insignia of the province's order or orders. Since the appointment in 1956 of John J.

25|$|One form {{of fraud}} {{involves}} <b>affixing</b> counterfeit labels of expensive wines to bottles of less expensive wine. This practice became particularly prominent following {{the devastation of}} the phylloxera epidemic in the 19th century when the supply of expensive premium wine was scarce. At first, the label fraud mostly consisted of taking a wine from a region of lesser acclaim (such as Southwest France or Calabria in Italy) and then labeling the wine as if it came from more prestigious regions such as Bordeaux or Tuscany. To counter this type of fraud, governments developed extensive appellation systems and Protected Designation of Origin or (PDOs) that attempted to regulate wines labeled as coming from particular wine regions. Early attempts to protect {{the name of a}} wine region led to government declaration on the boundaries and wine permitted to carry the names of Chianti, Oporto and Tokaji. Today most major European wine producing countries have some appellation system of protected origins. The most well systems include the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) used in France, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) used in Italy, the Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) used in Portugal, and the Denominación de Origen (DO) system used in Spain. Producers who are registered in each appellation must abide by the appellation's rules, including exact percentage of grapes (often 100%) that must come from that region. Producers who fraudulently use grapes outside the region they are proclaiming on their wine labels can be caught by the appellation's authorities.|$|E
25|$|Tanala {{society was}} {{historically}} divided into nobles, free people and slaves. Although Tanala nobles (mpanjaka) ruled the commoners, they were assisted by an advisor (anakandriana) {{who was a}} commoner, and consulted the commoners' elders (zoky olo). The king was accountable to his people, who {{had the power to}} remove him from his position of leadership. In addition, members of Tanala communities regardless of class consulted ombiasy (wise men) of the Antemoro tribe who served as diviners, holders of arcane knowledge and advisers to the noble class across the island. Kings and their sons enjoyed certain privileges; only a king could carry a red parasol (a mark of nobility) and sat upon a throne made of several woven mats rolled together. Only he and his sons were allowed to wear silver bracelets around their wrists and ankles and silver necklaces, and these were only worn on festival days. When a nobleman fell sick, it was forbidden for anyone to enter the sick prince's home, and any medicines had to be slipped into the house by a messenger. The homes of nobles were distinguished by <b>affixing</b> zebu horns or crossed and carved wooden stakes in the shape of zebu horns to both ends of the roof peak. Nobles frequently married with powerful commoner families to establish political alliances for greater influence and the stability and security of their territory. After their death, relics (lambohamba) of nobles were sometimes kept and would be ritually bathed as part of an annual celebration held at a particular location in the Sandrananta valley.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a longstanding}} debate {{about how to}} {{appropriately}} model the combinability of <b>affixes,</b> especially English suffixes. One widely accepted principle {{is the notion of}} so-called selectional restrictions, i. e. grammatical requirements of particular <b>affixes.</b> For example, the suffix -ness can only combine with adjectival bases. Hay (2002) proposed a psycholinguistic approach to <b>affix</b> ordering now known as Complexity-Based Ordering (CBO), which claims that <b>affix</b> order is determined by the parsability of the <b>affixes,</b> i. e. more separable <b>affixes</b> can appear only outside of less separable <b>affixes.</b> Hay shows that this principle accounts for why many grammatical <b>affix</b> combinations are unattested. CBO has since been supported by research of derivational <b>affixes</b> (English prefixes, English suffixes and Russian suffixes). However, as a processing model, CBO should apply very broadly, and in this paper, I discuss some difficulties of reconciling CBO with inflectional <b>affixes.</b> I also examine combinations of Russian prefixes - which have some properties typical of inflection - and show, surprisingly, that they can be ordered with a significantly low number of cycles, as CBO predicts. I discuss alternatives to CBO that explain this phenomenon, and suggest future research to distinguish them...|$|R
