40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, {{conducted}} a study of past mine explosions to identify the ignition locations and ignition sources responsible for the most severe explosion events resulting in death. Since the Scotia disaster of 1976, many fatalities from underground coal mine explosions {{have been linked to}} nonpermissible electrical equipment ignition sources located in intake <b>air</b> <b>courses.</b> With few exceptions, explosion protected equipment is generally not required in intake <b>air</b> <b>courses</b> of gassy underground coal mines in the US. Cigarette lighters were another prevalent ignition source for fatal explosions ignited in intake <b>air</b> <b>courses.</b> Several mine rescue/ recovery teams have encountered electrical ignition hazards. The study provides evidence that intake <b>air</b> <b>courses</b> of gassy underground coal mines fit the description of certain Hazardous (classified) locations described in the US National Electrical Code 2. Class I Division 2 or Zone 2 explosion protection tech 2 may be used to design intake air equipment so that it does not present an ignition source under normal operation, before mine power is shut down in emergency situations.

That the fire originated from the furnace in the mine, taking effect on the wood brattice to the up-cast <b>air</b> <b>course</b> leading {{from the bottom of the}} shaft to the Head House.The jury regards the present system of mining in a large number of cases now working by shaft as insecure and unsafe to the miner, and would strongly recommend, in all cases where practicable, two places for ingress and egress and a more practical means of ventilation, thereby rendering greater security to the life of the miner under any similar accident.|$|E
5000|$|The Cambodian Air Force was reborn on June 8, 1971, when it {{was made}} a {{separated}} command from the Army and thus became the third independent branch of the FANK. This new status was later confirmed on December 15, when the AVNK officially {{changed its name to}} Khmer Air Force (French: Armée de l'air khmère; AAK), or KAF. Promoted to Colonel, So Satto remained {{at the helm of the}} new Khmer Air Force and immediately began implementing an expansion programme. To better coordinate USAF and VNAF air support, the KAF Command established that some month at Pochentong a Air Operations Centre (AOC) headed by Lt. Col. Norodom Baley, who had previously attended a tactical <b>air</b> <b>course</b> in West Germany during the early 1960s. Starting from scratch, the KAF received a new influx of US-made aircraft under the auspices of the American Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia (MEDTC) assistance program. Among the most effective additions were two Douglas AC-47D Spooky gunships turned over to Cambodia in June 1971, which were initially used for night surveillance and defense operations at Pochentong Airbase, in order to prevent further North Vietnamese [...] "Sapper" [...] attacks. [...] Chinese advisors and engineers from Taiwan also assisted the KAF ground technicians at Pochentong in the rebuilding of former AVNK airframes damaged in the earlier January raid, enabling some transport planes and helicopters to be repaired and returned quickly to flying condition.|$|E
30|$|The sensor {{location}} {{correction factor}} is mainly {{determined by the}} air velocity distribution at the measuring plane. Using a single correction factor for all the locations will produce certain errors in the calculation of the average air velocity from the sensor readings. An effective method for obtaining the appropriate sensor location correction factor is to measure the air velocity at the sensor location. Then determine the average air velocity to get the correction factor for the specific site before a sensor is mounted. However, airflow merging and splitting can affect the air velocity distribution significantly, and the measurements {{need to be made}} to update the correction factor if any <b>air</b> <b>course</b> changes occur upstream or downstream.|$|E

40|$|On June 1, 2004, the {{underground}} coal mine ventilation safety standards under the Code of Federal Regulations (Title 30, Part 75) became effective {{for the use}} of a conveyor belt entry as an intake <b>air</b> <b>course</b> to ventilate working sections. These standards, also known as the Belt Air Rule, contained a section which limited the air velocity in the conveyor belt entry to no greater than 500 feet per minute unless otherwise approved by the US Mine Safety and Health Administration in the fire suppression system section of a mine 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s ventilation plan. The Belt Air Rule included a requirement dictating compatibility of air velocity with fire suppression systems. The final rule of limiting air velocity in the belt entry was challenged in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The court granted that petition and vacated the requirement on the air velocity cap, according to MSHA. The removal of the air velocity cap from the final rule, paired with the compatibility requirement, led to a need for research on high air velocity 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s influence on fire suppression system performance in belt entries. Test data was needed that illustrated the relationship between fire suppression system performance and air velocity, especially with the increased use of wider belts in underground coal mines, so National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and MSHA collaborated to obtain the data. However, this work was initiated before the revised Belt Air Rule was promulgated on December 31, 2008, when 1000 fpm air velocity became a requirement. Four differen...|$|E
40|$|In This Chapter [Designing bleeder systems Examining and {{maintaining}} bleeder systems Evaluating bleeder system effectiveness] INTRODUCTION Bleeder systems are {{that part of}} the mine ventilation network used to ventilate pillared areas in underground coal mines. Pillared areas are those in which pillars have been wholly or partially removed, including the areas where coal has been extracted by longwall mining. Bleeder systems protect miners from the hazards associated with methane and other gases, dusts and fumes, and oxygen deficiency that may occur in these mined-out areas. Effective bleeder systems control the air passing through the area and continuously dilute and move any methane-air mixtures and other gases, dusts, and fumes from the worked-out area away from active workings and into a return <b>air</b> <b>course</b> or {{to the surface of the}} mine. A bleeder system includes the pillared area (including the internal airflow paths), bleeder entries, bleeder connections, and all associated ventilation control devices that control the air passing through the pillared area. Bleeder entries are special air courses designed and maintained as part of the mine ventilation system. [This chapter focuses on the design, examination, maintenance, and evaluation of bleeder systems in underground coal mines. ] The history of coal mine explosions in the United States is a reminder of the importance of adequate ventilation. Some of those disasters were the result of inadequately ventilated pillared areas. The importance of developing bleeder systems to ventilate these pillared areas and evaluating the bleeder system 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s effectiveness is reflected in present-day federal regulations. For more information on bleeder systems, see Tisdale [1996] and Urosek and Francart [2002]...|$|E
