40|$|Titanium (Ti) and its alloys may be {{processed}} via <b>advanced</b> <b>powder</b> manufacturing routes such as {{additive layer manufacturing}} (or 3 D printing) or metal injection moulding. This field is receiving increased attention from various manufacturing sectors including the medical devices sector. It is possible that advanced manufacturing techniques could replace the machining or casting of metal alloys {{in the manufacture of}} devices because of associated advantages that include design flexibility, reduced processing costs, reduced waste, and the opportunity to more easily manufacture complex or custom-shaped implants. The emerging advanced manufacturing approaches of metal injection moulding and additive layer manufacturing are receiving particular attention from the implant fabrication industry because they could overcome some of the difficulties associated with traditional implant fabrication techniques such as titanium casting. Using advanced manufacturing, it is also possible to produce more complex porous structures with improved mechanical performance, potentially matching the modulus of elasticity of local bone. While the economic and engineering potential of advanced manufacturing for the manufacture of musculo-skeletal implants is therefore clear, the impact on the biocompatibility of the materials has been less investigated.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the properties of high-energy ball-milled nanocrystalline aluminium powders and to determine the optimum milling time required to produce an <b>advanced</b> aluminium <b>powder</b> for selective laser melting (SLM). Previous research has indicated that powders suitable for SLM include milled nanocrystalline aluminium powders with an average grain size of 60 nm and good flowability (Carr index less than 15 %). This study employs advanced nanometrology methods and analytical techniques to investigate the powder morphology, phase identification, average grain size and flowability of ball-milled powders. Stearic acid is used to prevent excessive cold welding of the ball-milled powder and to reduce abrasion of the grinding bowl and balls. The results indicate that, whilst the average particle size achieves a steady state after 14 h of milling, the grain size continues to decrease as the milling time progressed (e. g. the transmission electron microscopy measured average grain size is 56 nm after 20 h of milling compared to 75 nm for 14 h of milling). The aluminium powders milled for 16 and 20 h exhibit good flow behaviour, achieving a Carr index of 13. 5 and 15. 8 %, respectively.

30|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s, {{awareness}} was growing in Malta and internationally {{that all was}} not well with the Temple sites. Regular site visits highlighted the fact that <b>advanced</b> <b>powdering</b> and flaking, as well as alveolar weathering {{of many of the}} Globigerina Limestone megaliths, and fissuring and formation of point-loads in load-bearing stones, were ongoing and were becoming serious concerns, culminating also in the destabilisation of both critical, and minor areas. It was also established that the sporadic interventions which until then had characterised attempts to preserve the sites were mostly futile; some, such as the pointing of fissures with cement, in themselves were accelerating the damage. Ponding inside the Temples was a regular occurrence over the years and loss of infill from the walls was practically continuous. Something needed to be done in a more holistic way. A multi-disciplinary joint project was set up between the Museums Department, 6 Malta, and the University of Florence, Italy, to survey and assess the megalithic monuments, including Ħaġar Qim and Tarxien. This project, which included site work was carried out over a few weeks in the spring or autumn of every year, took place between 1985 and 1991 [2 – 4]. This included detailed site surveys and condition assessments, and the photogrammetric and manual documentation of structural damage, including fissures and displacement of megaliths. Studies of the construction materials were also carried out, and included chemical, mineralogical, petrographical and physical characterisation of the stones and any soluble salts present [3, 4]. High concentrations of soluble salts were found in the Temple megaliths (up to 1.2 % for chlorides in the Tarxien Temples) and high concentrations of sulfates (a maximum of 0.8 % in samples from Tarxien) as well as high nitrate values (often over 200  ppm and in one case reaching over 700  ppm) [5].|$|R
