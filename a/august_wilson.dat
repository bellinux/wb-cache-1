5|$|Saint Paul is {{the birthplace}} of {{cartoonist}} Charles M. Schulz (Peanuts), who lived in Merriam Park from infancy until 1960. Schulz's Snoopy cartoon inspired giant, decorated Peanuts sculptures around the city, a Chamber of Commerce promotion in the late 1990s. Other notable residents include writer F.

5|$|One of {{the first}} major {{promoters}} of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and <b>August</b> <b>Wilson.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was part}} of the {{starting}} eleven in Stevenage's first ever League One fixture {{at the start of the}} 2011–12 season, playing the whole game as the club drew 0–0 at home to Exeter City. In Stevenage's next game, Wilson provided the assist for Stacy Long's goal in a 4–3 extra-time defeat to Peterborough United in the League Cup. He also assisted Craig Reid in the club's 3–1 away win at Bournemouth on 16 August 2011. Three days later, on 19 <b>August,</b> <b>Wilson</b> signed a contract extension at the club. He added to his two previous assists by assisting Craig Reid's first goal in the club's 4–2 home win against Rochdale on 3 September. Wilson scored his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 5–1 home win over Sheffield Wednesday, scoring Stevenage's fourth goal of the match just before half-time. In the same game, Wilson provided the run and pass to assist Darius Charles' second-half goal, Stevenage's fifth of the game. He added a second goal to his goal tally in Stevenage's League Trophy penalty loss against League Two side AFC Wimbledon — opening the scoring after seven minutes when Brett Johnson's clearance cannoned off of Wilson's leg and beat the stranded Seb Brown in the AFC Wimbledon goal. His fine form for the season continued, and he was pivotal in Stevenage's 2–1 home win against Sheffield United, assisting Mark Roberts' goal, before winning a penalty late-on, which was duly converted by Scott Laird. He also set-up Chris Beardsley's 38th-minute strike, to open the scoring, in an eventual 2–1 win against Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way. In the club's last game of 2011, on 31 December, Wilson scored the only goal of the game as Stevenage defeated Wycombe Wanderers 1–0 at Adams Park. The goal came in the 82nd minute of the match, with Wilson powerfully beating Nikki Bull from close-range following Luke Freeman's precise cross. He was also on hand to score two of Stevenage's five goals in a 5–1 victory against Rochdale at Spotland on 14 January 2012. Both of Wilson's goals came in the second-half; the first came shortly after the interval, when he ran onto Chris Beardsley's rolled pass to fire the ball into the net, with his second coming after he ran onto Mark Roberts' clearance to calmly beat Péter Kurucz in the Rochdale goal. Wilson scored one further goal during the campaign, scoring a diving header in injury-time in a 1–0 win over Oldham Athletic at Broadhall Way. It took Wilson's goal tally to six for the season, with the player being ever-present during the campaign under both Westley and new manager Gary Smith, playing in all 56 of the club's games, as Stevenage narrowly lost in the play-off semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 and 1997, Brustein was {{involved}} in an extended public debate – through their essays, speeches and personal appearances – with African-American playwright <b>August</b> <b>Wilson</b> about multiculturalism, color-blind casting, and other issues where race impacts on the craft and practice of theatre in America.|$|E
50|$|In March 2015, Gregory {{was cast}} in the Goodman Theatres revival of <b>August</b> <b>Wilsons</b> Two Trains Running {{in the role of}} Sterling, a role that earned legendary actor Laurence Fishburne a Tony Award in 1992.

25|$|The {{issue of}} whether to legalize jitneys has been {{considered}} several times by Pennsylvania's Public Utilitiy Commission since at least 1975. The thinking behind the proposal is that jitneys often service areas regular Yellow Cab drivers will not go, thus picking up slack in transportation needs. Famed Pittsburgh playwright <b>August</b> <b>Wilson</b> wrote a play called Jitney, {{which was published in}} 1982.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 20th century, American drama was {{dominated}} by the work of playwrights Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, {{as well as by the}} maturation of the American musical, which had found a way to integrate script, music and dance in such works as Oklahoma! and West Side Story. Later American playwrights of importance include Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, <b>August</b> <b>Wilson</b> and Tony Kushner.|$|E
25|$|Wilson, French and Murray {{crossed to}} France on 14 <b>August.</b> <b>Wilson</b> was sceptical of the German {{invasion}} of Belgium, {{feeling that it}} would be diverted to meet the French thrusts into Lorraine and the Ardennes. Reconnoitring the area with Harper in August 1913, Wilson had wanted to deploy the BEF just east of Namur. Although Wilson's prediction of the German advance was less prescient than Kitchener's, had this been done, it is possible that Anglo-French forces could have attacked north, threatening to cut off the German Armies moving westwards north of the Meuse.|$|E

25|$|Virginia Theatre – this 1,275 seat theatre was {{designed}} by Crane, Franzheim & Bettis {{as the home of}} the Theatre Guild in 1925. President Calvin Coolidge officially inaugurated the theatre by flipping a switch for electricity in Washington, D.C. The theatre was leased in 1943 as a radio station. The American National Theater and Academy (ANTA) purchased the theatre in 1950 and renamed it the ANTA Theatre. Previously called the ANTA Theatre, in 1981 the theatre was renamed the Virginia in honour of Virginia Binger. It was renamed by new owner Rocco Landesman in October 2005, in honor of playwright <b>August</b> <b>Wilson.</b>|$|E
25|$|Allen's {{first major}} {{performance}} came in 1951 while studying at the Tanglewood Music Festival's Berkshire Music Center. At Tanglewood, she {{was chosen by}} Leonard Bernstein to be the mezzo-soprano soloist in a presentation of his Jeremiah Symphony with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. She made her opera debut the following year as St. Theresa II in Virgil Thomson’s Four Saints in Three Acts at the <b>August</b> <b>Wilson</b> Theatre in a production mounted by the American National Theater and Academy; twenty-nine years later she would record the role of Commère for the same opera's first complete recording. In 1952 she won the Marian Anderson Award after winning its namesake's singing competition in Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|By <b>August</b> <b>Wilson</b> had two elite {{divisions}} {{under his}} command, 63rd (Royal Naval) Division and 9th (Scottish) Division, but resisted pressure from Haig to conduct another attack until after 1 September. Wilson {{was aware that}} the greater success of French attacks on the Somme was largely owed to more concentrated artillery fire, and that British attacks at High Wood and Guillemont (late July) were less successful. It was decided to use a short hurricane bombardment rather than a gas attack, and Wilson’s men experimented (in vain) with a flamethrower (in May he had been impressed by an explosive device, a sort of prototype Bangalore torpedo, to clear wire). Wilson was displeased at the poor state of air support but impressed by the early artillery sound-ranging device which he was shown. With Haig convinced {{he was going to}} “smash the Bosh on the Somme” in September, GHQ now postponed Wilson’s attack until October, and now wanted the whole of Vimy Ridge taken, which would mean a joint attack with XVII Corps. Some of Wilson’s artillery was moved down to the Somme. Wilson continued to work on air-artillery coordination and mining, but rejected a proposal to dig jumping-off trenches into No Mans Land, as this would give away the attack.|$|E
50|$|In <b>August</b> 2007, <b>Wilson</b> {{signed with}} VOO Wolves Verviers-Pepinster of Belgium for the 2007-08 season. In 27 games for Verviers-Pepinster, he {{averaged}} 17.6 points, 2.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.3 steals per game.|$|R

500|$|Eddie Fox, who {{had been}} Melbourne's captain for six of the last seven seasons, retired from {{football}} in late <b>August.</b> <b>Wilson</b> was named captain in his stead at what was a difficult time, the Redlegs having lost their last two matches. In his first game in charge, against North Melbourne, Wilson {{was said to have}} [...] "showed much judgment in disposing his men". Melbourne won the match four goals to two and Wilson also had a good individual game playing in a variety of positions. The Reds finished the season having won three of their four games under Wilson's captaincy, which was enough to finish third on the ladder, two wins away from Fitzroy in top spot.|$|E
500|$|Some early Scientology biographies {{present a}} fictitious family {{heritage}} for Hubbard. According to an account {{published in the}} Church of Scientology's Ability magazine in 1959, Hubbard was [...] "descended from Count de Loup who entered England with the Norman invasion and became {{the founder of the}} English de Wolfe family which emigrated to America in the 17th century. On his father's side, from the English Hubbards, who came to America in the 19th century." [...] The story went that Count de Loup (or de Loupe) was a French courtier who saved the King of France from an attack by a wolf; the grateful monarch bestowed the title of Count de Loupe, which was eventually anglicized to [...] "De Wolf", the name of Hubbard's maternal grandfather. No records exist to substantiate this story. Harry Ross Hubbard was an orphan, born Henry <b>August</b> <b>Wilson</b> in August 1886, who had been adopted by an Iowa farming couple by the name of Hubbard. The couple changed his given names to Harry Ross.|$|E
