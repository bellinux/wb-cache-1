25|$|Cancer cells exhibit greater ROS stress {{than normal}} cells do, {{partly due to}} oncogenic stimulation, {{increased}} metabolic activity and mitochondrial malfunction. ROS is <b>a</b> <b>double-edged</b> <b>sword.</b> On one hand, at low levels, ROS facilitates cancer cell survival since cell-cycle progression driven by growth factors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) require ROS for activation and chronic inflammation, a major mediator of cancer, is regulated by ROS. On the other hand, {{a high level of}} ROS can suppress tumor growth through the sustained activation of cell-cycle inhibitor and induction of cell death as well as senescence by damaging macromolecules. In fact, most of the chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells by augmenting ROS stress. The ability of cancer cells to distinguish between ROS as a survival or apoptotic signal is controlled by the dosage, duration, type, and site of ROS production. Modest levels of ROS are required for cancer cells to survive, whereas excessive levels kill them.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{spin-off}}, Bianca {{had fallen}} upon hard times, and accidentally got a visiting Ricky {{embroiled in a}} drugs heist. Despite talk of reconciling, Bianca opted to leave Ricky behind once again, leaving Liam in his care. The spin-off brought in various characters unrelated to the main serial, including Vince, Bianca's drug dealing boss played by Craig Charles, and Ricky's fiancée Cassie, played by Sally Ann Triplett. Both Ricky and Liam returned to the main serial as regular characters later that year, without Bianca. In an interview, Palmer discussed the spin-off and the reasons why {{she did not want}} to return to EastEnders: [...] "I have absolutely no desire to return to EastEnders. Not at all. In fact, I think that brief spin-off of a storyline for Ricky and Bianca was <b>a</b> <b>double-edged</b> <b>sword.</b> On one hand, I don't think we should ever have done it, it was a mistake on my behalf. But on the other, it convinced me that Bianca was someone that I did not want to see again. She was past history as far as I was concerned, I certainly learned that. Don't get me wrong, I had the time of my life when I was in EastEnders in the middle and late nineties and I worked with some terrific people both in front of and behind the camera. But that was then and this is now – the cast has nearly all changed and going back would be worse than foolish." [...] In August 2005, Palmer reiterated that she had no desire to return to EastEnders and branded the show [...] "rubbish".|$|E

In November 1998, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer had decided to leave EastEnders {{to spend more time with}} her family. The BBC said that Bianca would not be killed off, and a spokesman commented: [...] "Bianca has always been an amazingly powerful character and the door is open to her if she wants to return in the future. She has been fantastic in the years she has been in EastEnders and we will miss her." [...] Palmer was one of several high-profile EastEnders stars to announce their departures that year; McCutcheon and Kemp also decided to leave, and Gillian Taylforth left the serial in 1998 after 13 years playing Kathy Beale. The BBC said, [...] "no-one is bigger than the show, which is doing extremely well at the moment. We will send her off with all our very best wishes."

2500|$|UNITED KINGDOM: India-UK {{strategic}} {{relationship is}} hugely driven by commerce & trade, shared {{history and the}} Indian diaspora in the UK. The 1.5 million British Indian diaspora, representing 1.8% of the UK population, ensures representation of Indian interests in UK politics. Continuity in India-UK relations is compelled by business imperatives and British nostalgia for a bygone era where the sun never sets. Both India and the UK are influential members of the Commonwealth of Nations. India now has more people who speak or understand English language {{than any other country}} in the world. The legacy and dynamics of a colonial past, the British Raj, acts like <b>a</b> <b>double-edged</b> <b>sword</b> serving both as an asset and an inconvenient reminder in bilateral relations. Historians have noted that during the British Empire, [...] "evangelical influence drove British policy down a path that tended to minimize and denigrate the accomplishments of Indian civilization and to position itself as the negation of the earlier British Indomania that was nourished by belief in Indian wisdom." [...] Broken promises by the British government on Indian independence after World War One, the creation of contentious international borders which divided peoples (Partition of Bengal) and contiguous geographies (Partition of Punjab) and the exploitative nature of British colonial policies (India's contribution to the global economy fell from around 20% to less than 4% during the British administration), are the most conspicuous legacy of British imperial rule. India maintains that the Koh-i-Noor diamond was taken away illegally from India and that artefacts which were removed during colonial times should be returned. United Kingdom's influence in Asia was severely diminished after the end of the British Raj. British military presence in the Indian Ocean suffers from the combined effect of reduced blue-water capabilities of the Royal Navy and contested sovereignty over British territories in the Indian Ocean. The Chagos Archipelago sovereignty dispute with Mauritius, revelations of deceit and ongoing investigations into human rights violations caused by the forced eviction of Chagossians from the British Indian Ocean Territory by the United Kingdom, allegations of US Government extraordinary rendition and Black Sites on Diego Garcia and historic support among Asian countries for the decolonization process; render the islands unsuitable as a commercial launch-pad into Indian Ocean trade. United Kingdom is a P5 veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council (UNSC) albeit constrained by strategic subservience to the USA via the UK-US 'special relationship' and restrained by domestic politics (On 29 August 2013 a motion for military intervention in the Syrian civil war was defeated 285-272 in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom). France and Germany have eclipsed the influence of the United Kingdom within Europe (and in the USA). The peer-reviewed Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television published a study into BBC's coverage of South Asian geopolitics and economics from 1947 through 2008 which exposed pervasive Indophobic bias.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Eosinophils remain {{among the}} most enigmatic of cells, as our {{appreciation}} of their detrimental activities—e. g., asthma and allergic disease—far outweighs our understanding of their beneficial effects. Among the major secretory ef-fector proteins of eosinophils are the ribonucleases eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosino-phil cationic protein (ECP) in primates and their orthologs, the eosinophil-associated ribonucleases (EARs) in rodents. The rapid diversification ob-served among these ribonucleases suggested that the ultimate target(s) might be similarly efficient at generating sequence diversity while maintaining an unalterable susceptibility to ribonucleolytic cleav-age. This has prompted us to consider a role for these proteins and by extension, for eosinophils, in host defense against single-stranded RNA virus pathogens. We detail our studies of the antiviral activity of eosinophils and eosinophil ribonucleases against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in vitro and the related, natural rodent pathogen, pneumo-nia virus of mice (PVM), in vivo, and {{consider the possibility that}} antiviral host defense and the dys-regulated responses leading to asthma represent opposing sides of <b>an</b> eosinophil-mediated <b>double-edged</b> <b>sword.</b> J.
