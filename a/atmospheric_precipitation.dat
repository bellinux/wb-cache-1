40|$|Abstract: The climatic {{conditions}} in Samtskhe-Javakheti region {{differ from those}} in other regions of Georgia. The major reason for the diversified climate {{in the region is}} the nature of the underlying surface and altitude above from the sea level (900 - 3, 300 m), nature of the surface jointing, alteration of ridges and valleys, vegetation cover (forest, meadow, valley, water basins) causing unequal warming of the underlying surface and intensification of the circulation processes. The vegetation cover in the region is transformed intensely under the influence of the anthropogenic factors what drastically changes the {{climatic conditions}}. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>precipitations</b> are one of the climate-forming factors having its influence on the climate and determining the degree of humidification. The annual amount of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>precipitations</b> on the territory of Samtskhe-Javakheti varies between 400 and 1400 mm. It is minimal on Javakheti Plateau and Akhaltsikhe basin. The amount of precipitations on Javakheti Plateau first decreases and then, increases gradually at higher altitudes. In the basin of the river Paravani, at 1, 400 m asl, the amount of precipitations decreases by 6 - 17 mm on average after each 100 m altitude, while above 1400 m asl, increases first...|$|R

On the northern hemisphere such studies of the atmospheric part of the cycle are practically impossible due to the high emission rate of anthropogenic sulphur. Merely in remote areas of the world such as the Antarctic 34 S analyses can be used to identify the various sulphur sources (sea spray, biogenic und volcanic sources).

40|$|Following {{the global}} warming, in Kakheti Region, in East Georgia (by municipalities), the trends of changes (increase or decrease) in agro-climatic {{characteristics}} {{for the development}} of agricultural crops were identified. Such changes result in the prolonged vegetation period, increased sum of temperatures and mostly, decreased sum of precipitations. Based on the latter indicators, a trend of a decreasing index of the hydrothermal coefficient is observed evidencing more frequent droughts with low or moderate intensity. The data of the 60 -year-long period of meteorological observations (1949 – 2008) were divided into two 30 -year-long periods in order to compare them. It was found that in the second period (1979 – 2008), the indices of a hydrothermal coefficient in all municipalities (except Kvareli) are decreased in the active vegetation period (VI-VIII). The dynamics of the course of a hydrothermal coefficient is shown with trends. Based on the many-year meteorological observation data (1949 – 2008) in different municipalities, the sums of active annual temperatures (> 10  °C) and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>precipitations</b> were calculated. On the background of global warming, the repeated nature of droughts of different types was identified.

This depression is formed when the Black Sea's water temperature is higher than the surrounding continental ground's temperature. There are situations when the baric depression of the Black Sea occurs because of the consequences of the movement of another baric depression from the east of the Mediterranean Sea to its north-east side. Due to the high atmospheric pressure of the continental zone that's surrounding the Black Sea, the baric depression will get a retrograde movement, towards the north or northwest.

50|$|One of the {{alternative}} erosion mechanisms proposed is called haloclasty. Moisture on limestone will dissolve salts, which are then carried by percolating moisture into the spaces inside the porous limestone. When the moisture dries the salt crystallises, and the expanding crystals cause a fine layer of surface limestone to flake off. It is accepted by Schoch et al. that this mechanism is evident in many places on the Giza Plateau. One proponent of the haloclasty process is Dr James A. Harrell of the University of Toledo, who advocates that the deep erosion crevices were caused by the haloclasty process being driven by moisture in the sand that covered the carved rock {{for much of the}} time since it was exposed by quarrying. Lal Gauri et al. also favour the haloclasty process to explain the erosion features, but have theorised that the weathering was driven by moisture deriving from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>precipitation</b> such as dew.|$|E

Although this province constitutes only 1% of Iran’s land area, 10% of the fresh waters flow in it: two major rivers, Karoun and Zayandeh-Roud spring from ChB heights 6. The shape of mountains, the rate of <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>precipitation,</b> the height above sea level and the various climates in this province, all have brought about diverse intact landscapes 7. According to 2011 census, the population of this province is over 900,000 of which more than a half are settled in cities, and the others in villages and some are nomads 8. Due to the existence of the biggest tribal society, Bakhtiari tribe, and thereby historical nomads’ paths, there is an attractive realization of permanent and seasonal residences with specific manners, customs, cultures and local clothing given to this province by nomadic culture 10. Based on the latest national divisions, this province has 9 townships, 25 districts, 40 towns, 50 village units and 820 villages. The townships include Shahr-e Kord, Ardal, Boroujen, Ben, Saman, Farsan, Kouhrang, Kiar and Lordegan. ChB province is a mountainous region of which 76% is mountains and hills, the other 24% consists of alluvial plains and plateaus. The skirts of Zagros grant us so many treasures, picturesque and beautiful landscapes that many call ChB the heaven of nature lovers and tourists. Springs and rivers, sanctuaries like Qeisari, Sheida, Hellen, Sabz-Kouh, Tang-e-Sayyad and oak forests, the green gold of Zagros, with a diversity of more than 923 precious plant species 11, 294 animal species and unique perspectives are a little drop of this heaven.
