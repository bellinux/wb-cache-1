5|$|Back in the present, Chandler apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} she was {{referring}} to. The flashbacks continue to 1988; Ross and Chandler arrive for dinner {{to find that}} Monica has slimmed down, and Chandler now finds her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate Chandler for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 1992, Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old {{woman from}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, ordered a 49-cent {{cup of coffee}} from the drive-through window of a local McDonald's {{restaurant}} located at 5001 Gibson Boulevard Southeast. Liebeck was in the passenger's seat of a 1989 Ford Probe which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the coffee cup between her knees and pulled {{the far side of}} the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap. Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants; they absorbed the coffee and held it <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin,</b> scalding her thighs, buttocks, and groin.|$|E

60|$|He sat {{looking at}} her for a moment, leaning back in his chair, which he had pushed a few feet into the shadows. Her hair was glossy and splendid, and <b>against</b> it <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> seemed whiter and more {{delicate}} than ever. Her eyes were lustrous but plaintive, and with something of the child's fear of harm in them. She looked very young and very fragile to have been swayed through the years by an evil passion.|$|R

5000|$|Cooley {{suspected}} {{his second}} wife, Ella Mae Cooley (née Evans), 38, {{who had been}} a singer in his band before they married 15 years earlier, of repeatedly being unfaithful. In March 1961, she told a friend she had had an affair with Roy Rogers in 1952 or 1953. [...] She soon asked Cooley, who had had his own affairs, for a divorce. On March 23, Spade Cooley filed for divorce, citing [...] "incompatibility" [...] and seeking custody of their three children, Melody, Donnell Jr. and John. On April 26, 1961, Cooley was indicted by a Kern County grand jury for the murder of his wife on April 3 at the couple's Willow Springs ranch home. Cooley's then 14-year-old daughter, Melody, reportedly told the jury she watched in terror as her father beat her mother's head against the floor, stomped on her stomach, then crushed a lit cigarette <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> to see whether she was dead. Cooley claimed his wife had been injured by falling in the shower.|$|E

But she knew it was he before she heard him whisper: [...] "Nedda!" [...] and, clutching him by the sleeve, she drew him in and closed the door.

50|$|Agathe Cléry is a {{marketing}} {{manager for a}} line of cosmetics for people with pale skin. She is also racist, particularly towards black people. However, she is diagnosed with Addison's disease, which turns <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> dark.

50|$|Mary {{is shown}} {{lying in a}} blue robe with a white headdress on a timber bed with her head resting on a white pillow <b>against</b> a headboard. <b>Her</b> <b>skin</b> is thin and pallid, her hands clasped in prayer. She is {{surrounded}} by the twelve apostles who crowd around her bed. Peter is dressed in the white robes of a priest and holds a candle which in the then contemporary ritual will be handed to the dying woman. Above her Christ appears in a halo of light, holding his arms open to receive Mary's soul, while his palms are open to display the wounds sustained at Calvary. With this gesture, Christ identifies himself as both redeemer and conqueror of death.|$|R
50|$|After transforming, Adrianna gained {{physical}} abilities {{similar to}} her brother, husband, {{and the other}} Marvels. She is superhumanly strong and is easily capable of lifting far in excess of 100 tons, putting her {{on the same level}} as Supergirl, Power Girl, Mary Marvel, Donna Troy, Big Barda, and Wonder Woman. She is also incredibly durable and cannot be harmed by physical force unless the being she is engaged with is stronger than her. She is also totally bulletproof and bladed weapons shatter <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> She is superhumanly fast, capable of moving at speeds past Mach 10 on Earth. She also has far superior reflexes and agility when compared to normal humans, or even other superhumans. Isis is also able to mystically fly through the air at incredible speeds and can travel across and around the planet in minutes. Like the other Marvels, Isis possesses an immense degree of superhuman intelligence, allowing her to come up with solutions to complicated problems quickly. Unlike the other Marvels, Isis' powers focus on the control of nature. She has control over water, fire, earth, air and electricity and can control the weather and the lava within the Earth. These powers are tied to her emotions. When she cried, it began to rain and when she grew angry, enormous roses crushed the buildings around her. Simply put, Isis is nature and can control its every aspect. In addition to her manipulation of natural materials, Isis possesses the power of telekinesis, allowing her to lift objects, fire blasts of telekinetic force, and to create telekinetic shields. Isis' godly energies are able to heal nearly any wound that she has been inflicted (though she has died before) with surprising speed. Using a second amulet, Isis is able to achieve clairvoyance, and is able to see events happening in the present at remote locations. She cannot use this power to see into the past or the future, however. Due to her death and subsequent resurrection, Isis had a bit of trouble controlling her powers for a time. She stated that this was because Nature had deemed her a failed subject, but has since regained full control.|$|E

40|$|A 63 -yr-old {{housewife}} {{was referred}} in August 2001 with a 10 -yr history of gradually worsening breathlessness on exertion, cough and repeated respiratory tract infections. She had never smoked. She {{had been diagnosed}} with follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin 9 s lymphoma 10 yrs previously, which was treated with chemotherapy, including chlorambucil, vincristine and prednisolone, and subsequent radiotherapy for intra-abdominal recurrence. A year after the diagnosis of malignancy, she was seen in the local dermatology unit with a blistering eruption on her legs and oral mucosa, which was subsequently confirmed by skin biopsy and immunofluor-escence studies to be bullous pemphigoid. She developed muscle weakness due to myasthenia gravis 2 yrs later. There was no evidence of an associated thymoma. Both <b>her</b> muscle and <b>skin</b> disease were controlled with oral corticosteroids and azathioprine, along with pyridostigmine, for nearly 10 yrs. In April 2001, <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> disease was further evaluated because of persistent oral ulceration; a diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) was confirmed by presence of circulating antibodies to a variety of intra- and extracellular epidermal antigens, including bullous pemphigoid antigen (230 kD), envoplakin (210 kD) and periplakin (190 kD). Physical examination showed the presence of inspiratory crackles at lung bases; there was no cyanosis or clubbing. Serum autoantibodies were negative apart from those <b>against</b> <b>skin.</b> <b>Her</b> myasthenia gravis was under good control at the time of physical examination.

60|$|He {{was brought}} back to himself, however, by a sudden little ripple of quick {{feminine}} laughter. Aghast, he dropped the manuscript among the chessmen and stared in bewilderment round the room. It was as empty and as still as ever. Again he stretched his hand out to the romance, and again came that roguish burst of merriment. He {{looked up at the}} ceiling, back at the closed door, and round at the stiff folds of motionless tapestry. Of a sudden, however, he caught a quick shimmer from the corner of a high-backed bancal in front of him, and, shifting a pace or two to the side, saw a white slender hand, which held a mirror of polished silver {{in such a way that}} the concealed observer could see without being seen. He stood irresolute, uncertain whether to advance or to take no notice; but, even as he hesitated, the mirror was whipped in, and a tall and stately young lady swept out from behind the oaken screen, with a dancing light of mischief in her eyes. Alleyne started with astonishment as he recognized the very maiden who had suffered from his brother's violence in the forest. She no longer wore her gay riding-dress, however, but was attired in a long sweeping robe of black velvet of Bruges, with delicate tracery of white lace at neck and at wrist, scarce to be seen <b>against</b> <b>her</b> ivory <b>skin.</b> Beautiful as she had seemed to him before, the lithe charm of her figure and the proud, free grace of her bearing were enhanced now by the rich simplicity of her attire.|$|R

She {{was in no way}} striking; a typical, country-bred girl, with a fine digestion and an excellent conscience; if not very pretty, obviously good.
