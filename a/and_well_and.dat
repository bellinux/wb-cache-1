5|$|Marsden first {{arrives in}} Albert Square in March 2001, {{investigating}} Phil Mitchell's shooting {{in her first}} case as detective chief inspector. She identifies the five main suspects: Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) and Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). Marsden arrests Dan for the shooting, although he is later acquitted {{due to lack of}} evidence. Dan was set up by Phil but it was, in fact, Lisa who shot him. Marsden later arrests Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) for the attempted murder of her husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). Little Mo claims self-defence, since she has been a victim of domestic violence at the hands of Trevor. The trial ends, with Trevor's treatment of Little Mo revealed. In 2003, Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) visits Marsden with evidence that Phil killed his ex-girlfriend Lisa. Jill helps set up a honey-trap for Phil in order to obtain a confession from him, with PC Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) and DI Dominic Price (Paul Brennen), but it fails when Kate falls in love with Phil and Marsden fires her. Marsden arrests Phil, but with insufficient evidence and no confession he is released. It later emerges that Lisa is safe <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> Phil is innocent. Marsden later arrests Phil when Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) set him up in an armed robbery.|$|E

Also in 1973, the musical revue Jacques Brel is Alive <b>and</b> <b>Well</b> <b>and</b> Living in Paris opened in the State Theatre lobby.

After a heated argument Frank storms off, refusing {{to speak to}} Diane, but they manage to make peace by the time Frank leaves—Diane drives to the ferry and tearfully waves Frank goodbye. Diane returns for a short stint in 1994 to inform Pat that Frank is alive <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> has merely run away from Walford following a mental breakdown—Frank had visited Diane off-screen in France.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{was conducted}} by Norman Birkett KC, who could only argue that Nodder had abducted the child. Nodder chose not to testify at this hearing, leaving his defence counsel, led by Maurice Healy, to reiterate Nodder's claims that the girl had spent one night at his Peacehaven home before he had given the child two shillings and instructions {{as to how to}} travel to her aunt's Sheffield home, and that he had not seen her since. Healy further argued that Mona may still be found alive <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> that and no-one should speculate as to her fate.|$|E

Conrad is alive <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> explains that he initiated the game to get his brother to embrace life and not to end up like their father. Nicholas bursts into tears, relaxes, and begins to enjoy the party once his shock has dissipated. When he sees that Christine has left the party, he follows her outside to her cab. He asks her to dinner, and she offers to share a coffee with him before her flight takes her to her next game assignment in Australia.|$|E

25|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Marcellinus in his early life; records first mention his name in 454 when he rebelled against Western Emperor Valentinian III {{following}} his murder and assassination of Flavius Aëtius who was his friend. He was in Dalmatia {{at the time and}} it is believed to have held the title of Comes rei militaris according to the fasti. He was powerful enough to seize control of Dalmatia for himself and was presumably able to do this because he was commander of the troops there. He appears to have remained ruler of Dalmatia down to 468 and to have preserved his independence except for briefly accepting the authority of the Emperors Majorian and Anthemius. Sources claim he ruled justly <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> kept Dalmatia independent of the emperor and of barbarian rulers.|$|E
25|$|After {{nearly two}} months, {{at the end}} of November, the kidnappers {{contacted}} Granger, promising that the hostages were alive <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> demanding a ransom of 10 million dollars. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office had already announced that it was Her Majesty's Government's policy not to pay ransoms, but Granger agreed to find the money. According to the 2005 article in Kommersant, the management of state-owned telecommunications company Chechentelekom determined that the engineers were {{in the hands of the}} rogue Chechen commander and reputed organized crime figure Arbi Barayev; during the war with Russia, Barayev abducted a group of 29 Russian engineers near Grozny and later exchanged them for a large sum of money. According to the rumors, the company even took one of Barayev's deputies hostage and proposed exchanging him for the foreigners, yet Barayev declined and continued in demanding $10m for their release.|$|E
25|$|Pearce-Stevenson's {{mobile phone}} was used until mid-2011, {{communicating}} via text messages {{to give her}} family and friends the impression she was alive <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> to appeal for money. Her bank account was accessed until at least 2012 at locations in four states and territories. Over $90,000 was stolen through the account, including Centrelink family payments and other proceeds of fraud. A woman in a wheelchair, accompanied by a man, impersonated Pearce-Stevenson to staff at a credit union in June 2010 using her identity documents. Another woman impersonated her at a Centrelink office in South Australia the same year, using identity documents for Pearce-Stevenson and her daughter Khandalyce. The woman had her leg amputated {{as a result of a}} car rollover in 2008 in which Holdom was driving on the Stuart Highway north of Marla. Two of her children were killed in the crash.

25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

[...] The correct answer is [...] "He is alive <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> rules the world!" [...] causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm.

500|$|The mystery writer J.A.

Rita, Dexter's long-suffering wife who died a terrible death in a bathtub in last year's season finale, is alive <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> having a baby in Dexter Is Delicious. But my advice to readers is this: Don't quibble. Get over it. After all, fiction is an alternate universe to begin with, and Lindsay's dark, comedic fiction is an alternate universe once removed. Patrick McCann and Colin Wrinn were very upset about her death in Season 4 of the hit TV show, Dexter, but Colin Whelan did not care for her." ...|$|E
500|$|Six {{daughters were}} born to them: Lorenza ("Enchang"), Gregoria ("Goring"), Eugenia ("Nene"), Marcela ("Celing", named after her mother because they thought she would be their last child), Adela (who {{died at the age}} of three) and the youngest, Maria ("Maring", who was their last {{surviving}} child and died on July 6, 1995). Most of her daughters became teachers. Gregoria was the first Filipina to graduate from Oxford University. After the graduation of the three elder daughters, they were offered teaching positions. Lorenza was given an appointment to teach in Malate Catholic School. They so immersed themselves in their respective teaching careers that not one of them chose to be married. Marcella Agoncillo cared for all of her daughters until they reached maturity.

Hall reveals that {{he was working with}} Quinn all along, the two having attended college together where they had first designed the generator. However, Hall realized that he couldn't allow anyone to gain control of the generator's power, and so plans to let it destroy itself and Quinn's mansion. As this would kill the thousands of innocent people on the island, Coulson lets Hall fall into the gravitonium which catalyzes an anti-reaction to turn off the machine, apparently killing Hall in the process.|$|E

Australian LGBT website SameSame said the story had attracted attention from some media commentators, who called it [...] "an obvious ratings grab and an attempt to out-gay rival soap, Home and Away". However, script producer, Emma Steele defended the storyline and said {{that it is not a}} [...] "ploy to grab ratings". Steele said that she is [...] "particularly proud" [...] of the way Chris's storyline had been handled and she added [...] "It was something we wanted to do for a while because it's a story that affects so many people and in so many different ways.

Around the one minute mark, when the tempo of the song changes from a ballad to its original anthemic composition, a band stepped onstage from the shadows behind as well as dancers, who danced and created a party atmosphere.

Rintarō begins experimenting with , which begin to cause major differences in the timeline. Kurisu also manages to create a device to send a person's memories through the microwave, allowing that person to effectively leap into the past.|$|E
