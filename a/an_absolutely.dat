25|$|Duesberg {{argued in}} 1989 that a {{significant}} number of AIDS victims had died without proof of HIV infection. However, with the use of modern culture techniques and polymerase chain reaction testing, HIV can be demonstrated in virtually all patients with AIDS. Since AIDS is now defined partially by the presence of HIV, Duesberg claims it is impossible by definition to offer evidence that AIDS doesn't require HIV. However, the first definitions of AIDS mentioned no cause and the first AIDS diagnoses were made before HIV was discovered. The addition of HIV positivity to surveillance criteria as <b>an</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary condition for case reporting occurred only in 1993, after a scientific consensus was established that HIV caused AIDS.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, quantum mechanics—the physics of the extremely small—has revealed previously concealed aspects of events. Before that, Newtonian physics—the physics of everyday life—dominated. Taken in isolation (rather than as an approximation to quantum mechanics), Newtonian physics depicts a universe in which objects move in perfectly determined ways. At the scale where humans exist and interact with the universe, Newtonian mechanics remain useful, and make relatively accurate predictions (e.g. calculating the trajectory of a bullet). But whereas in theory, absolute knowledge of the forces accelerating a bullet would produce <b>an</b> <b>absolutely</b> accurate prediction of its path, modern quantum mechanics casts reasonable doubt on this main thesis of determinism.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Mickelson won the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial with a −14, {{one shot}} ahead of Tim Clark and Rod Pampling. Mickelson shot a first-round 65 {{to start off}} the tournament at −5. He ended the day tied with Brett Wetterich, two shots behind leader, Johnson Wagner. Mickelson shot a second round 68, and the third round 65, overall, being −12 {{for the first three}} rounds. On the final hole, after <b>an</b> <b>absolutely</b> horrendous tee shot, he was in thick rough with trees in his way. Many players would have punched out, and taken their chances at making par from the fairway with a good wedge shot. Instead, he pulled out a high-lofted wedge and hit his {{approach}} shot over a tree, landing on the green where he one-putted for the win.|$|E
25|$|We do not {{perceive}} by an immediate intuition that God exists, {{nor do we}} prove it a priori.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was the native {{land of the}} “growthmen.” Its leading light, Paul Samuelson, had {{published}} a pathbreaking undergraduate textbook, Economics: An Introductory Analysis. In the sixth edition of Economics, Samuelson (1964) added a “new chapter on the theory of growth.” Samuelson drew on the work on growth theory of his younger colleague Robert Solow (1956)—an indication that growthmanship was taking an analytical turn. The MIT economists were thus growthmen in two senses: in seeing growth as <b>an</b> <b>absolutely</b> central policy imperative and in seeing the theory of growth as a focus for economic research. What the MIT growthmen added was a distinctive style of analysis that {{made it easier to}} address the dominant policy concerns in tractable formal models. Solow’s (1956) model was the perfect exemplar of the MIT style. It provided the central framework for the subsequent developments in growth theory and secured MIT as {{the center of the universe}} in the golden age of growth theory in the 1960s (Boianovsky and Hoover 199–200).|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} the three heads of Keter, {{according}} to the kabbalists, has extremely different connotations from ascribing validity to any compound or plurality in God, even if the compound is viewed as unified. In Kabbalah, while God is <b>an</b> <b>absolutely</b> simple (non-compound), infinite Unity beyond grasp, as described in Jewish philosophy by Maimonides, through His Kabbalistic manifestations such as the Sephirot and the Shekhinah (Divine Presence), we relate to the living dynamic Divinity that emanates, enclothes, is revealed in, and incorporates, the multifarious spiritual and physical plurality of Creation within the Infinite Unity. Creation is plural, while God is Unity. Kabbalistic theology unites the two in the paradox of human versus Divine perspectives. The spiritual role of Judaism is to reach the level of perceiving {{the truth of the}} paradox, that all is One, spiritual and physical Creation being nullified into absolute Divine Monotheism. Ascribing any independent validity to the plural perspective is idolatry. Nonetheless, through the personalised aspects of God, revealing the concealed mystery from within the Divine Unity, man can perceive and relate to God, who otherwise would be unbridgably far, as the supernal Divine emanations are mirrored in the mystical Divine nature of man's soul.|$|E
