50|$|The Special Forces {{communications}} sergeant has {{to learn}} U.S. communication systems {{as well as those}} systems found throughout the world. He must incorporate this information and technology into his communications planning, and teach it to the other members of his ODA. Communications sergeants have a thorough grounding in communication basics, communications procedures, computer technology; assembly and systems applications.They must understand communication theory - how to install, operate and maintain radio systems across all bands. They must be able to make communications in voice to data, and to read voice and data radio nets by using computer systems and networks.Communications sergeants are experts in sending and receiving messages to link the SFODA with its command and control elements. They are familiar with antenna theory, radio wave propagation and how to teach it to others. Communications sergeants prepare the communications portion of area studies, briefbacks and operation plans and orders. They can recruit, organize, train and advise or command indigenous combat forces up to company size.The course provides training in computer <b>applications,</b> <b>satellite</b> radios and satellite and antenna theory and radio wave propagation. Soldiers learn how to construct field-expedient antennas, employing communications procedures and techniques and communicate throughout the HF, VHF and UHF spectrums, all culminating with a field training exercise.

40|$|Abstract — Real-time {{multimedia}} applications impose strict delay bounds and {{are sensitive}} to delay variations. Satellite link handover increases delay jitter and signaling overhead {{as well as the}} termination probability of ongoing connections. To satisfy the QoS requirements of multimedia <b>applications,</b> <b>satellite</b> routing protocols should consider link handovers and minimize their effect on the active connections. A new routing algorithm is proposed to reduce both the inter-satellite handover and ISL handover. Once a connection request arrives, the remaining coverage time of satellites is used in the deterministic UDL routing. In the probabilistic ISL routing, the propagation delay and existence probability of ISL links are considered to reduce the delay and ISL handover probability. The rerouting algorithm is called when link handover occurs. Experiments show that this routing algorithm results in small delay jitter, low rerouting frequency, and low rerouting processing overhead. I...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work we are {{interested}} on the derivation of power-based passivity properties for a certain class of non-linear mechanical systems. While for (non) -linear mechanical systems, it is of common use to adopt a storage function related to the system’s energy {{in order to show}} passivity and stabilize the system on a desired equilibrium point (e. g., IDA-PBC), we want here to obtain similar properties related to the system’s power. The motivation arises from the idea that in some engineering <b>applications</b> (<b>satellite</b> orbit motion, aircraft dynamic, etc [...] .) seems more sensible to cope with the power flowing into the system instead of the energy that for stabilization purposes, means to consider the systems’s equilibrium the state for which the energy flow-rate (i. e.,system’s power) is minimal.
