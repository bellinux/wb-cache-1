500|$|To avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised Hurst {{they would}} return the mules and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw. Hurst went to nearby Charleston, but the Cowboys showed up {{two days later}} without the mules, {{laughing}} at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst had printed and distributed a handbill in which he named Frank McLaury as specifically assisting with hiding the mules. He reprinted this in The Tombstone Epitaph on July 30, 1880. Virgil later said that McLaury had {{asked him if he}} had posted the handbills. When Virgil said he had not, McLaury said if Virgil had printed the handbills it was Frank's intention to kill Virgil. He warned Virgil, [...] "If you ever again follow us as close <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> then you will have to fight anyway." [...] This incident was the first run-in between the Clantons and McLaurys and the Earps.|$|E
500|$|In November 1863, {{when the}} {{military}} cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania was dedicated, Everett, by then widely renowned as the finest orator in the country, was invited to be the featured speaker. In his two-hour formal oration he compared the Battle of Gettysburg to battles of antiquity such as Marathon, and spoke about how opposing sides in previous civil wars (such as the War of the Roses and the Thirty Years' War) were able to reconcile their differences afterward. [...] Everett's oration {{was followed by the}} now far more famous Gettysburg Address of President Lincoln. For his part, Everett was deeply impressed by the concise speech and wrote to Lincoln noting [...] "I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> in two minutes." [...] In the 1864 election, Everett supported Lincoln, serving as a presidential elector from Massachusetts for the Republicans.|$|E
500|$|Cowboy Frank Patterson [...] "made {{some kind}} of a compromise" [...] with Captain Hurst, who persuaded the posse to withdraw, with the {{understanding}} that the mules would be returned. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Capt. Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the flyer in The Tombstone Epitaph, on July 30, 1880. Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst [...] "unmanly", [...] "a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar", and accused Hurst of stealing the mules himself. Capt. Hurst later cautioned Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan that the Cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him, [...] "If you ever again follow us as close <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> then you will have to fight anyway." [...] A month later, Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him if he ever followed them as he had done before, they would kill him.|$|E

[...] Petts then elaborated that the inspiration for the stained-glass image was a verse from the Gospel of Matthew: [...] "Truly, I say to you, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me."

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} FourFourTwo magazine, McManaman stated, [...] "I think I {{probably}} least enjoyed my time when Glenn Hoddle was the manager. But I wouldn't {{say he was}} necessarily the worst. He had his ways of training and ways of acting and all managers have different ways of doing things; it's the same with club managers. Sometimes when you join up with England and you don't play as often <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> under a certain other manager – then you'll think it's terrible. I loved going to play with England. For instance, I did {{get to go to}} the World Cup even though I only played for 17 minutes. That kind of experience leaves an indelible mark on your mind. So I don't really think of it in terms of [...] "worst"; but going to the World Cup and not playing much was a big thing for me, really, and that was under Glenn, of course." [...] Hoddle also notably arranged for McManaman to meet a disabled fan (and thus fulfill his lifelong wish of meeting McManaman) while the fan {{was on the verge of}} death, in 1997, to great media acclaim, though the story only broke a year after Hoddle had been sacked from the England job for alleged disparaging comments about disabled people.|$|E
2500|$|In 210, after Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu (who died {{of illness}} earlier that year) as the {{frontline}} commander of Sun Quan's forces, he passed by Lü Meng's garrison {{on his way}} to Lukou (陸口; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei). Lu Su had all along regarded Lü Meng with contempt, but someone told him, [...] "General Lü's fame and glory are increasing day by day. You shouldn't view him in the same light now <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> in the past. You should visit him soon." [...] Lu Su then headed to Lü Meng's camp. After some drinks, Lü Meng asked Lu Su, [...] "You've received an important appointment and you're going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?" [...] Lu Su lackadaisically replied, [...] "I'll adapt to the situation when the time comes." [...] Lü Meng then said, [...] "The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is nonetheless a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?" [...] Lü Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su {{on how to deal with}} Guan Yu. Lu Su left his seat, came closer to Lü Meng, placed his hand on his shoulder and said, [...] "Lü Ziming, I never knew you had such insights until I came here." [...] He also visited Lü Meng's mother and left after befriending Lü Meng.|$|E
2500|$|On {{obtaining the}} summit of the ridge the allied column found itself facing the French {{infantry}} line. The French guards rose and advanced towards the crest, whereupon the two forces confronted each other at a distance of 30 paces. The moment was immortalised by Lord Charles Hay of the 1st Regiment of Guards who later wrote that he stepped forward, took out a hip flask and drank with a flourish, shouting out to his opponent, [...] "We are the English Guards, and we hope you will stand till we come up to you, and not swim the Scheldt <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> the Main at Dettingen." [...] He then led his men in three cheers. Voltaire's version of this famous episode has become proverbial. He wrote: [...] "The English officers saluted the French by doffing their hats … [...] the French, returned the greeting. My Lord Charles Hai, captain in the English Guards, cried, 'Gentlemen of the French Guards, fire.' The Comte d'Auteroche, then lieutenant of Grenadiers, shouted, 'Gentlemen, we never fire first; fire yourselves.'" [...] The French were the first to fire, the volley was somewhat ineffective but threw the Third Guards into some confusion and wounded George Churchill, the commander of the guards brigade. Captain Lord Panmure led the unbroken companies of the Third Guards to the flank of the First Guards. Up to this point the British column had not fired a single musket shot, but now the allied infantry poured a devastating discharge into the French. The volley of musketry with the battalion guns delivering numerous rounds of grape-shot, swept away the front rank of the ten battalions of the French first line, killing and wounding between 700–800 men, breaking the Gardes Françaises, while the Gardes Suisses and the four battalions of the Brigade Aubeterre were driven back by the British advance.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} {{according}} to some authorities, Israel fought Sihon {{in the month of}} Elul, celebrated the Festival in Tishri, and after the Festival fought Og. The Midrash inferred this from the similarity of the expression in [...] "And you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents," [...] which speaks of an act that was to follow the celebration of a Festival, and the expression in [...] "and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people." [...] The Midrash inferred that God assembled the Amorites to deliver them into the Israelites' hands, as [...] says, [...] "and the Lord said to Moses: ‘Fear him not; for I have delivered him into your hand." [...] The Midrash taught that Moses was afraid, as he thought that perhaps the Israelites had committed a trespass in the war against Sihon, or had soiled themselves by the commission of some transgression. God reassured Moses that he need not fear, for the Israelites had shown themselves perfectly righteous. The Midrash taught that there was not a mighty man in the world more difficult to overcome than Og, as [...] says, [...] "only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim." [...] The Midrash told that Og had been the only survivor of the strong men whom Amraphel and his colleagues had slain, as may be inferred from [...] which reports that Amraphel [...] "smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim," [...] and one may read [...] to indicate that Og lived near Ashteroth. The Midrash taught that Og was the refuse among the Rephaim, like a hard olive that escapes being mashed in the olive press. The Midrash inferred this from [...] which reports that [...] "there came one who had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew," [...] and the Midrash identified the man who had escaped as Og, as [...] describes him as a remnant, saying, [...] "only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim." [...] The Midrash taught that Og intended that Abram should go out and be killed. God rewarded Og for delivering the message by allowing him to live all the years from Abraham to Moses, but God collected Og's debt to God for his evil intention toward Abraham by causing Og to fall by the hand of Abraham's descendants. On coming to make war with Og, Moses was afraid, thinking that he was only 120 years old, while Og was more than 500 years old, and if Og had not possessed some merit, he would not have lived all those years. So God told Moses (in the words of [...] ), [...] "fear him not; for I have delivered him into your land," [...] implying that Moses should slay Og with his own hand. The Midrash noted that in [...] God told Moses to [...] "do to him <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> to Sihon," [...] and [...] reports that the Israelites [...] "utterly destroyed them," [...] but [...] reports, [...] "All the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves." [...] The Midrash concluded that the Israelites utterly destroyed the people so as not to derive any benefit from them.|$|E
