The U.S. Supreme Court and many state supreme courts have affirmed {{the right of a}} lawyer to withhold information in such situations. Otherwise, it would be impossible for any criminal defendant to obtain a zealous defense.|$|E
25|$|Taqī al-Dīn {{tried to}} {{disprove}} the widely held belief that light is emitted by {{the eye and}} not the object that is being observed. He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars {{for us to see}} them while we <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> at them, because they are so far away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} {{is accused of}} having ignored warnings about fire safety in tower blocks. A former chief fire officer and secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety, Ronnie King, said ministers stonewalled requests for meetings and efforts to tighten rules. He said that the then–housing minister Gavin Barwell, refused requests for meetings. King said: “We have had replies, but the replies were {{to the effect that}} you have met my predecessor [...] and {{there were a number of}} matters that we are looking at and we <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> at it. (...) They always seem to need a significant loss of life before things are changed.” After six people were killed in the 2009 Lakanal House fire, the coroner made a series of safety recommendations for the government to consider, and the Department for Communities and Local Government agreed to hold a review in 2013. In March 2014, the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group sent a letter to then–Minister for Communities Stephen Williams, which said in part: [...] After further correspondence, Williams replied: [...] Jeremy Corbyn has called for sprinklers to be retrofitted in all high-rise social housing.|$|E

The shacks are going to ditch me or know the reason why. Three times the mighty {{overland}} stops for me at that station, and each time I elude the shacks and make the decks. But it is hopeless, for they have finally come to an understanding of the situation. I have taught them that they cannot guard the train from me. They must do something else.|$|E

6000|$|I {{have just}} come from you, my lady. Your voice is still in my [...] ears; your eyes <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> into mine, gravely yet half [...] smilingly, sweetly yet half provokingly. Oh, how dear and [...] human and girlish and queenly you are--half saint and half [...] very womanly woman! And how I love you with all there is of me [...] to love--heart and soul and brain, every fibre of body and [...] spirit thrilling to the wonder and marvel and miracle of it! [...] You do not know it, my sweet, and you must never know it. You [...] would not even wish to know it, for I am nothing to you but [...] one of many friends, coming into your life briefly and passing [...] out of it, of no more account to you than a sunshiny hour, a [...] bird's song, a {{bursting}} bud in your garden. But the hour and [...] the bird and the flower gave you a little delight in their [...] turn, and when you remembered them once before forgetting, [...] that was their reward and blessing. That is all I ask, dear [...] lady, and I ask that only in my own heart. I am content to [...] love you and be forgotten. It is sweeter to love you and be [...] forgotten {{than it would be}} to love any other woman and live in [...] her lifelong remembrance: so humble has love made me, sweet, [...] so great is my sense of my own unworthiness.|$|E
60|$|I {{do not see}} the Press Congress {{getting through}} such matters as these in a session of weeks or months. The idea the Germans betrayed at Brest, that things were going {{to be done in the}} Versailles fashion by great moustached heroes {{frowning}} and drawing lines with a large black soldierly thumbnail across maps, is--old-fashioned. They have made their eastern treaties, it is true, in this mode, but they <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> for some really responsible government to keep them now that they are made. From first to last clearly the main peace negotiations are going to follow unprecedented courses. This preliminary discussion of war aims by means of great public speeches, that has been getting more and more explicit now for many months, is quite unprecedented. Apparently all the broad preliminaries are to be stated and accepted in the sight of all mankind before even an armistice occurs on the main, the western front. The German diplomatists hate this process. So do a lot of ours. So do some of the diplomatic Frenchmen. The German junkers are dodging and lying, they are fighting desperately to keep back everything they possibly can for the bargaining and bullying and table-banging of the council chamber, but that way there is no peace. And when at last Germany says snip sufficiently to the Allies' snap, and the Peace Congress begins, it will almost certainly be as unprecedented as its prelude. Before it meets, the broad lines of the settlement will have been drawn plainly with the approval of the mass of mankind.|$|E
