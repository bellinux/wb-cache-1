5|$|The {{expedition}} was {{a private}} venture much like the Drake-Norris expedition, supported by limited assistance and subsidies from the crown. Its objective was to pillage Spanish and Portuguese ships within the Atlantic, off the Spanish coast or within the Caribbean {{and to make a}} profit from which the Queen's portion would <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large sum.|$|E
50|$|If E {{is a real}} vector {{bundle of}} rank n, then a choice of metric on E <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{reduction}} of the structure group to the orthogonal group O(n).

5|$|Surviving {{sources for}} Medieval Scotland {{are much more}} limited than for {{contemporaneous}} England. The only burgh for which there are sources pre-dating 1400 is Aberdeen. The only large body of sources to survive from before 1400 are the cartularies of monasteries. For education, outside of occasional references in documents concerned with other matters, they <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> handful of burgh records and monastic and episcopal registers.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's most {{important}} economic sector is manufacturing. Manufacturing consists largely {{of the production}} of specialist chemicals, health and pharmaceutical goods, scientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments. The largest exported goods are chemicals (34% of exported goods), machines/electronics (20.9%), and precision instruments/watches (16.9%). Exported services <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> third of exports. The service sector – especially banking and insurance, tourism, and international organisations – is another important industry for Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E

25|$|Accurately {{computing}} {{the rate}} of Lyman- escape {{and the effect of}} these photons on the 2s-1s transition. This requires solving a time-dependent radiative transfer equation.

25|$|This idea is disputed by the Dictionary of the Scots Language; and the {{occurrence}} in Gospatrick's Writ {{of the word}} wassenas 'dependants', thought {{to be from the}} same word gwas, is evidence against Jackson's theory.

25|$|Although {{a federal}} wealth tax is {{prohibited}} by the United States Constitution unless the receipts are {{distributed to the}} States by their populations, {{state and local government}} property tax <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wealth tax on real estate, and because capital gains are taxed on nominal instead of inflation-adjusted profits, the capital gains tax amounts to a wealth tax on the inflation rate.|$|E

25|$|Photomultiplier-amplified photocurrents can be {{electronically}} {{amplified by}} a high-input-impedance electronic amplifier (in the signal path {{subsequent to the}} photomultiplier), thus producing appreciable voltages even for nearly infinitesimally small photon fluxes. Photomultipliers offer the best possible opportunity to exceed the Johnson noise for many configurations.
