5|$|The work proved dangerous. By {{the end of}} the war, {{half the}} {{experienced}} chemists and metallurgists had to be removed from work with plutonium when unacceptably high levels of the element appeared in their urine. A minor fire at Los Alamos in January 1945 led to a fear that a fire in the plutonium laboratory might contaminate the whole town, and Groves authorized the construction of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>facility</b> for plutonium chemistry and metallurgy, which became known as the DP-site. The hemispheres for the first plutonium pit (or core) were produced and delivered on 2 July 1945. Three more hemispheres followed on 23 July and were delivered three days later.|$|E
5|$|Vestgrensa {{had served}} the area now served by Forskingsparken since {{the opening of}} the Sognsvann Line on 10 October 1934. In 1991, the Norwegian Parliament decided to build <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>facility</b> for Riks{{hospital}}et at Gaustad, and to serve the hospital by an extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line. Gaustad Station on the Holmenkoll Line of the rapid transit is located within a few hundred meters of the hospital. Vestgrensa was deemed too far away by planners, and a transfer station would need to be established between the light rail and the Sognsvann Line. At first, Blindern was considered, but instead it was later decided that there should be an all-new station.|$|E

5|$|By 1934, American Airlines began {{service to}} Roanoke, but they moved their {{operations}} to Lynchburg in 1937 {{due to the}} poor conditions in Roanoke. After American's withdrawal, city leaders determined <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>facility</b> needed to be constructed to replace the existing field. Originally privately operated, the city of Roanoke {{took control of the}} facility in 1937, after it purchased the original hangar, with Works Progress Administration funds paying the costs of paving the runways. After the airport was declared a national defense project, federal funds became available to complete the facility, and on December 15, 1941, it was officially dedicated. The airport was named Woodrum Field in honor of Clifton A. Woodrum, the congressional representative from Virginia's Sixth District, and after it reopened, American Airlines reestablished service to Roanoke Municipal Airport.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006, Manchester Phoenix {{were granted}} {{planning}} permission {{to construct a}} new rink in Altrincham. A few weeks later Cardiff Devils also received planning permission {{for the construction of}} a new rink. The Wales National Ice Rink was earmarked for demolition and a campaign for the council to provide <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>facility</b> proved successful. With both clubs confirming their intent to take part the following season, speculation began about the possible inclusion of a tenth team to replace London Racers. After the season was over, rumours about the possible admission of either Hull or Dundee became more and more widespread. On 22 June 2006, Hull Stingrays were formally elected into the Elite Ice Hockey League as the tenth active member.|$|E
5|$|Later on 2 May, {{the remains}} of Hitler, Braun, and two dogs (thought to be Blondi and her offspring, Wulf) were {{discovered}} in a shell crater by {{a unit of the}} Red Army intelligence agency SMERSH tasked with finding Hitler's body. Stalin was wary of believing Hitler was dead, and restricted the release of information to the public. The remains of Hitler and Braun were repeatedly buried and exhumed by SMERSH during the unit's relocation from Berlin to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>facility</b> in Magdeburg. The bodies, along with the charred remains of propaganda minister Goebbels, his wife Magda, and their six children, were buried in an unmarked grave beneath a paved section of the front courtyard.

5|$|Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the {{selfish and}} petulant {{head of a}} {{research}} team for Ryan Electrics. His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>facility</b> at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|City {{recreation}} facilities {{include two}} ice hockey arenas, a curling rink, an indoor swimming pool, an outdoor ice rink, and a speed skating oval. The South Peace Community Multiplex, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>facility</b> completed in 2010, boasts a pool, indoor rodeo grounds and ice rink. Voters approved building the Multiplex in a 2004 referendum which projected its cost at C$21.6 million. The project became controversial when construction began {{and the cost}} projection was raised to $35 million. The facility is located close to the city's exhibition grounds, away from residential uses. It features an indoor rodeo arena and a 4,000-seat convention centre/ice arena with skyboxes. Nearby Bear Mountain, located south of the city, provides over 20km (12mi) of snowshoeing and cross-country skiing trails, as well as areas for downhill skiing and about 500km (300mi) of trails for snowmobiles, mountain bikes, and all-terrain vehicles. The city was once home to a North American Hockey League team, the Dawson Creek Rage, beginning in the 2010–11 season until it ceased operations in 2012 due to financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|SCPA {{had three}} {{different}} homes {{in its first}} four years, including a makeshift campus in the Mount Adams neighborhood and another in Roselawn. In 1976, it occupied the Old Woodward High School building, {{on the site of}} one of the oldest public schools in the country. The school rose to national prominence in the 1980s, but was nearly closed in the 1990s following a series of scandals, leadership struggles, and an arson fire which destroyed the auditorium. Its reputation recovered {{in the years that followed}} and in 2009–10, the school was featured in the MTV reality series Taking the Stage, filmed at the school and featuring SCPA students. In 2010 SCPA combined with the Schiel Primary School for Arts Enrichment to create the first kindergarten through twelfth grade (about ages five to seventeen) arts school and first private sector/public arts school in the US. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>facility</b> in Over-the-Rhine was championed by the late Cincinnati Pops Maestro Erich Kunzel and funded through a unique public-private partnership that raised over $31million in private contributions to match public funding. The building features specialized facilities for the arts and three separate theaters and is the key to redevelopment plans for the area.|$|E
