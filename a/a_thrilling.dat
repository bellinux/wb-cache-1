5|$|Baltimore was far {{and away}} the most {{successful}} of any American CFL team on the field and off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 their first year. Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Stallions mostly with CFL veterans. As coach, he brought in Don Matthews, who had already played in two Grey Cups and won one. The result was a team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and became the first American team to qualify for the playoffs. They advanced {{all the way to the}} Grey Cup. In <b>a</b> <b>thrilling</b> match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated the Stallions on a last second field goal.

5|$|Crystal Palace {{began their}} first top flight {{campaign}} {{in almost a}} decade by re-signing Andy Gray from QPR for £500,000. In November, Palace hit the headlines when they signed Bristol Rovers goalkeeper Nigel Martyn for £1 million – a record for a goalkeeper in Britain. However, mixed form meant that the Eagles ended the season fifteenth after spending most {{of the first half}} in the top ten. But it was in the FA Cup that Palace really shone. After a succession of ties against lower division teams (Portsmouth, Huddersfield Town, Rochdale and Cambridge United), Palace reached the semi-finals, drawing the same Liverpool side that had beaten them 9–0 earlier in the season. The tie was played at Villa Park, and saw Liverpool score first and hold a seemingly comfortable 1–0 lead at half-time. However, Palace emerged from the half-time interval with a sense of purpose, and within a minute of the restart were level with Bright equalising. After going 2–1 up, they found themselves 3–2 down late in the match and were seemingly beaten. Then a late equaliser by Andy Gray took the game into extra-time, with the winner scored by Alan Pardew. The team secured <b>a</b> <b>thrilling</b> 4–3 victory {{and for the first time}} in their history, Palace were in the FA Cup Final.|$|E

5|$|Fowler's first {{involvement}} with the Liverpool first team came on 13 January 1993, {{when he was an}} unused substitute in an FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers. In the following close season, Fowler helped the England under-18 team win the 1993 European Championship, before making a scoring first-team debut in Liverpool's 3–1 win in a first round League Cup tie at Fulham on 22 September 1993. Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later, making him the fourth player in Liverpool's history to score five in a senior fixture. He scored his first league hat-trick against Southampton in only his fifth league game. His very first league goal for the Reds had come on 16 October 1993, when an 87th-minute equaliser at home to struggling Oldham Athletic saved the Reds from what would {{have been one of the}} biggest Premier League shocks of the season, with a last gasp own goal giving Liverpool a 2–1 win. He scored twice in <b>a</b> <b>thrilling</b> 3–3 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on 18 December.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw for}} {{the third round of}} the FA Cup saw Manchester United take on cup holders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in a repeat of the 1994 final. The outcome was the same: United {{dominated}} from the outset and Chelsea found themselves 3–0 down {{before the end of the}} first half. Cole and Sheringham added to the rout, before Graeme Le Saux and Gianluca Vialli added three between them for Chelsea to keep the score a competitive one. Many journalists and fans regarded the win as United's best of the season. Another five goals were dished out against Division Two outfit Walsall, and in the fifth round they were placed alongside Premiership strugglers, Barnsley, whom they had ripped apart in October. An error by Schmeichel allowed Barnsley to take the lead but Sheringham equalised four minutes later. A replay was needed, much to the discomfort of Ferguson, and in <b>a</b> <b>thrilling</b> cup tie, United were knocked out, putting the ultimate treble dream – comprising the UEFA Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup – on hold for another season.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{performances}} {{continued to}} follow in the 2011–12 season, with the club beginning the following season in commanding form, including beating Tottenham 5–1 at White Hart Lane and humbling Manchester United by a 6–1 scoreline in United's own stadium. Although the strong form waned halfway through the season, and City at one point fell eight points behind their arch rivals with only six games left to play, a slump by United allowed the blue side of Manchester to draw back level with two games to go, setting up <b>a</b> <b>thrilling</b> finale to the season with both teams going into the last day equal on points. Despite City only needing a home win against a team in the relegation zone, they fell a goal behind by the end of normal time, leading some of United's players to finish their game celebrating in the belief that they had won the league. Two goals in injury time – including one scored almost five minutes after normal time had elapsed – resulted in an almost-literal last-minute title victory, City's first in 44 years, and became only the fifth team to win the Premier League since its creation in 1992. In the aftermath that followed, the event was described by media sources from the UK and around the world as the greatest moment in Premier League history. The game was also notable for former player Joey Barton's sending off, where he committed three separate red card-able incidents on three different players in the space of only a couple of seconds, resulting in a 12-match ban.|$|E
