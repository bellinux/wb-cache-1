The CGDK was headed by Sihanouk, and functioned as a government-in-exile. The UN defeated <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> expel Democratic Kampuchea and admit the PRK, effectively confirming Sihanouk as Cambodia's internationally recognized head of state.|$|E
5|$|Although the DPP passed <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> ban all factions {{within the}} party in 2006, the dissent between former members of {{different}} factions was still present and {{was thought to be}} one of the factors that led to DPP's loss in the presidential election. Chai, along with Koo Kwang-ming emphasized the importance of consolidating the party's policy on independence, while Tsai Ing-wen focused on the cooperation of former factions and expansion of the party's support base.|$|E

5|$|Because Republicans {{controlled}} neither {{house of}} Congress, nor the Supreme Court, Breckinridge {{did not believe}} Lincoln's election was a mandate for secession. Ignoring James Murray Mason's contention that no Southerner should serve in Lincoln's cabinet, Breckinridge supported the appointment of Virginian Montgomery Blair as Postmaster General. He also voted against <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> remove {{the names of the}} senators from seceded states from the Senate roll.|$|E
5|$|Burnett's subversive {{activities}} did not {{go unnoticed}} by his colleagues in Congress. He was absent when the body reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, Indiana representative W.

After his {{conviction}} was finally affirmed, <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> expel Burton from the Senate was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections on May 22, 1906. Burton resigned from office on June 4, 1906, before the Senate could act.|$|E

5|$|In July 1861, Stevens {{secured the}} passage of an act to {{confiscate}} the property, including slaves, of certain rebels. In November 1861, Stevens introduced <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> emancipate all slaves; it was defeated. However, legislation did pass that abolished slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories. By March 1862, to Stevens's exasperation, the most Lincoln had publicly supported was gradual emancipation in the Border states, with the masters compensated by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Newsom also {{supported}} allowing restaurants to serve alcohol at their outdoor tables, banning tobacco advertisements {{visible from the}} streets, stiffer penalties for landlords, and <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> commend Colin Powell for raising money for youth programs that was defeated.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> this {{apparent}} inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand, {{still part}} of the colony of New South Wales, became a {{separate}} Colony of New Zealand on 1 July 1841. The colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first Parliament met in 1854. In 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing, gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy. (Control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s.) Following concerns that the South Island might form a separate colony, premier Alfred Domett moved <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> transfer the capital from Auckland to a locality near the Cook Strait. Wellington was chosen for its central location, with Parliament officially sitting there {{for the first time}} in 1865. As immigrant numbers increased, conflicts over land led to the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s and 1870s, resulting in the loss and confiscation of much Māori land.|$|E
5|$|The House {{resolution}} did {{not pass}} the Senate, nor did the Senate pass a resolution of their own, {{so there was no}} 2012 budget of record. The actual appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2012 included four continuing resolutions and three full-year appropriations bills enacted in November and December 2011, in accordance with the United States budget process. These appropriations were greatly affected by the Budget Control Act of 2011, passed in August 2011 as <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> the debt-ceiling crisis; it mandated budget cuts over a ten-year period beginning with Fiscal Year 2012.|$|E

5|$|Though the UN's primary mandate was peacekeeping, the {{division}} between the US and USSR often paralysed the organization, generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War. (A notable exception was a Security Council resolution in 1950 authorizing a US-led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea, passed {{in the absence of}} the USSR.) In 1947, the General Assembly approved <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> partition Palestine, approving the creation of the state of Israel. Two years later, Ralph Bunche, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict. In 1956, the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis; however, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country's revolution.|$|E

More than two hundred submissions were received and examined by the Society before a winner was selected. The entry created by Paul Hadley of Mooresville, Indiana, was ultimately chosen as the winner of the contest and the cash prize.|$|E

In the war's aftermath, Americans wanted to know why the U.S. seemed ill-prepared for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Barkley sponsored <b>a</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>to</b> create the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack and was chosen as chairman of the ten-person committee. The committee's report, delivered on July 20, 1946, exonerated Roosevelt of any blame for the attack and highlighted weaknesses in communications between branches of the U.S. armed forces, leading {{to the creation of the}} United States Department of Defense. Barkley also helped ensure U.S. participation in the United Nations and advocated approval of billions of dollars in loans to rebuild Europe.
