40|$|This work is {{the first}} to {{investigate}} simultaneously the occurrence of unconditional currency risk pricing and equity market segmentation in <b>Africa's</b> major stock markets. The multi-factor asset pricing theory provides the theoretical framework for our model. We find strong evidence suggesting that <b>Africa's</b> equity markets are partially segmented. However, we find insufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis that foreign exchange risk is not unconditionally priced in <b>Africa's</b> stock markets. This result is robust to alternative foreign exchange rate-adjusted return measures. These findings suggest that international investors can diversify into <b>Africa's</b> equity markets without worrying about unconditional risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

5|$|African {{elephants}} {{were listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2008, with no independent {{assessment of the}} conservation status of the two forms. In 1979, <b>Africa</b> had an estimated minimum population of 1.3million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0million. By 1989, the population {{was estimated to be}} 609,000; with 277,000 in Central <b>Africa,</b> 110,000 in eastern <b>Africa,</b> 204,000 in southern <b>Africa,</b> and 19,000 in western <b>Africa.</b> About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East <b>Africa.</b> After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern <b>Africa</b> were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South <b>Africa.</b> Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern <b>Africa</b> were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%. Due to the vast areas involved, assessing the total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork. The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012.|$|E
5|$|All {{populations are}} migratory, and most birds winter in <b>Africa</b> {{south of the}} Sahara, {{with just a few}} records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North <b>Africa,</b> whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East <b>Africa.</b> Some Asian birds may {{therefore}} cross 100° of longitude on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern <b>Africa,</b> although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West <b>Africa</b> may be wintering birds of this subspecies or C. e. meridionalis. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent tracking data has revealed that European nightjars have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial <b>Africa</b> where they have to cross several ecological barriers (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar stop-over sites as do other European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.|$|E

5|$|Before 1928 {{the only}} flag that had {{official}} {{status in the}} Union of South <b>Africa</b> was the United Kingdom's Union Jack as South <b>Africa</b> {{was part of the}} British Empire. The South <b>Africa</b> Red Ensign was used as an unofficial flag. In 1925, discussion rose about creating a new flag for South <b>Africa</b> as many descendants of Boers found the Union Jack unacceptable after the Boer War. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted South <b>Africa</b> legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted the Union Jack in the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South <b>Africa</b> and a badge of the Union Jack in the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with the hoist on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the First World War, Rhodesia's white {{population}} was split between the Unionists, for amalgamation into the Union of South <b>Africa,</b> and the Responsible Government Association, for independence. While the RGA was led by Coghlan, the Union Party's leader was Herbert Longden, another lawyer from Bulawayo. Longden, like the British Government, believed Rhodesia lacked the population and resources for an independent state. For Britain, union with South <b>Africa</b> would mean avoiding having to buy out the BSAC, leaving the burden on South <b>Africa</b> instead. After the war, Coghlan noted that the new Secretary of State, Winston Churchill, was determined to achieve the amalgamation of Southern Rhodesia with South <b>Africa.</b> For its part, the BSAC encouraged the Unionists, expecting that it would get a better price for its assets from South <b>Africa</b> than from Southern Rhodesia. Other major corporations were also pro union, since South <b>Africa</b> would be able to provide cheap labour from the south. These interests controlled the local press and were thus highly influential in the debate. With General Smuts, a skillful statesman, also {{on the side of the}} Unionists, it seemed unlikely that Coghlan would dissuade the electorate from entering into the Union.|$|E
