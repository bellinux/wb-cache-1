50|$|A {{thin layer}} of grease made for this {{application}} {{can be applied to}} the ground glass surfaces to be connected, and the inner joint is inserted into the outer joint such that the ground glass surfaces of each are next to each other to make the connection. In addition to making a leak-tight connection, the grease lets two joints be later separated more easily. A potential drawback of such grease is that if used on laboratory glassware for a long time in high-temperature applications (such as for continuous distillation), the grease may eventually contaminate the chemicals. Also, reagents may react with the grease, especially under vacuum. For these reasons, it is advisable to apply a light ring of grease at the fat end of the taper and not its tip, to keep it from inside the glassware. If the grease smears over the entire taper surface on mating, too much was used. Using greases specifically designed for this purpose is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> as these are often better at sealing under vacuum, thicker and so less likely to flow out of the taper, become fluidic at higher temperatures than Vaseline (a common substitute) and are more chemically inert than other substitutes.|$|E

The best way to find out is to visit them or contact them by phone or email. • Purchasing crates and getting pets used to them: Most [...] "pet friendly" [...] establishments require that animals are crated when they arrive, and those that may welcome pets and their owners during an emergency will likely require a crate as well. Furthermore, a crate is a safe place for pets to sleep in, and make transporting easier. Owners may get their pets used to crating by using them during car rides or by having their pets sleep in them when visiting relatives or friends. • Relying on a neighbor: It is possible that due to a disaster or emergency owners may be unable to return home to care for their pets. During these types of situations it’s helpful to have a neighbor or friend care for their animals. It’s important to ensure that this temporary caretaker is someone who their pet is familiar with, and that they are left with detailed instructions for proper care. Owners may want to consider leaving a signed authorization for veterinary care, as well as financial limits to the procedures.• Preparing evacuation kits for pets: They should include food, water, medicine, vaccination and health records, a current photo and information about pet insurance if applicable. Ideally, a worn article of clothing belonging to the owner should be included to comfort the pet. They should also feature a pet first aid kit (They are available for purchase online, and veterinarians may advise on what their contents should be) and extra gear such as an extra collar, leash, feeder, etc. that might be forgotten or lost during an emergency. Include a flashlight, can opener and duct tape.

This is sometimes referred to as thinning the chain. While neither burn-in nor thinning are mandatory practices, they both reduce the amount of data saved from a MCMC run. In this chapter, we outline a way of determining in advance the number of iterations needed for a given level of precision in a MCMC algorithm...|$|E

Work by Berry, Walsh, Vickery and Greig has painted a vivid picture of the mechanisms through which elite women in particular sought out metropolitan suppliers.

This paper explores these questions by mapping the metropolitan shopping habits of two elite families with estates in rural Warwickshire and houses in London: the Leighs of Stoneleigh Abbey and Newdigates of Arbury Hall. I argue that London retailers were both local and metropolitan – geographies of elite shopping being linked to the London residence and to key retail locations – and that men and women had different shopping geographies in part because of their different engagements in and with London. ...|$|R

From problems in physics or chemistry to questions in social sciences, Percolation Theory offers an unified method to approach the problems in a systematic way. Thus, the paper examines the assumption that knowledge defines a network inside the brain, where sites are knowledge bricks that are connected (or not-connected) by p-efficient binds.
