5|$|Dylan {{introduced}} a literary element to rock through {{his fascination with}} the Surrealists and the French Symbolists, and his immersion in the New York City art scene of the early 1960s. The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doors,</b> Steppenwolf and the Ides of March, were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture. Dylan also {{led the way in}} blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock groups such as the Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles. In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies inspired those of Yes, and British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention, who emphasised instrumental virtuosity. Some of these artists, such as the Incredible String Band and Shirley and Dolly Collins, would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and early music.|$|E
5|$|Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a {{warm summer}} day in Brooklyn, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, was taking her two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to Rockaway Beach. Having paid the {{necessary}} fare, {{they were on the}} platform at the East New York station of the LIRR on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began to move again, two men raced for the train, and one made it without incident, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, {{with the help of a}} platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train's crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained fireworks. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking of those on the platform caused a tall, coin-operated scale to topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No one was hurt enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly, {{lightning}} {{struck the}} hotel and the lights of both the hallway and elevator flickered out. A ghostly wind blows through a window and the reflection of riders in the elevator became distorted. With another blast, the elevator rumbled and shook and with a final blast of lightning the electrified reflection disappeared, leaving only {{the image of the}} empty elevator in the mirror <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> closed.|$|E

25|$|Downtown's Majestic Ventura Theater is {{an early}} 20th-century landmark. A venue for concerts, it has seen {{performances}} from legendary artists such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Doors,</b> Pearl Jam, Van Halen, X, Ray Charles, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Social Distortion, Bad Religion, Fugazi, Incubus, Tom Petty, They Might Be Giants, and Johnny Cash, {{as well as some}} of the city's most successful homegrown artists like KYLE, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Army of Freshmen.|$|E
25|$|John and Juan hide in {{the animal}} coach of a train. It stops {{to pick up the}} tyrannical Governor Don Jaime, who is fleeing (with a small fortune) from the revolutionary forces {{belonging}} to Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. As the train is ambushed, John, as a test of Juan's loyalty, lets him choose between shooting the Governor and accepting a bribe from him. Juan kills Jaime, also stealing the Governor's spoils. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> to the coach open, Juan is greeted by a large crowd and again unexpectedly hailed as a great hero of the revolution, the money taken away by revolutionary General Santerna.|$|E
25|$|At 15:36, flight {{dispatcher}} J. Coleman presented the load sheet to Key whose request for engine start clearance was granted three minutes later. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> {{were about to}} close, Coleman asked Key to accommodate a BEA flight crew that had to collect a Merchantman aircraft from Brussels. The additional weight of the three crew members necessitated the removal of a quantity of mail and freight from the Trident to ensure its total weight (less fuel) did not exceed the permitted maximum of 41,730kg. This was exceeded by 24kg, but as there had been considerable fuel burnoff between startup and takeoff, the total aircraft weight (including fuel) was within the maximum permitted take-off weight.|$|E

Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed {{down the stairs to the}} pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.|$|E
25|$|By the 1900s {{the whole}} line was under {{pressure}} from overcrowding. The populations of areas along the line, particularly at Hornsey, Highgate, Muswell Hill, and Finchley, had increased considerably with the rapid Victorian expansion of London, but the GNR service had not been expanded to cope. The line was also congested with goods traffic, mostly coal and building materials. By 1903 the morning trains from Barnet were full {{by the time they}} arrived at East Finchley. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of the compartments in the carriages were in those days locked with aid of a simple square key, some passengers took to purchasing these keys from local ironmongers, and locking the doors from the inside. It was not unknown for harsh words and even, on odd occasions, for blows to be exchanged.|$|E
25|$|The {{electric}} guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix (a veteran of many American {{rhythm and blues}} and soul groups from the early-mid-1960s) and his power trios, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Band of Gypsys, has had broad and lasting influence {{on the development of}} blues rock, especially for guitarists. Eric Clapton was another guitarist with a lasting influence on the genre; his work in the 1960s and 1970s with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, The Yardbirds, supergroups Blind Faith, Cream and Derek and the Dominos, and an extensive solo career has been seminal in bringing blues rock into the mainstream. By this time, American acts such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Doors</b> and Janis Joplin further introduced mainstream audiences to the genre. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd is known for incorporating a mixture of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock into his guitar work. Gilmour, who has received universal acclaim (from both critics and fans alike) for his guitar work, has described Hendrix as a huge inspiration for his style of playing.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} fourteen, Shanina, {{against her}} parents' wishes, walked [...] across the taiga to the rail station and {{travelled}} to Arkhangelsk to study at the college there (the trek was later attested by Shanina's school teacher Alexander Makaryin). Shanina left home with little money and almost no possessions; and {{before moving to the}} college dormitory she lived with her elder brother Fyodor. Later in her combat diary Shanina would recall Arkhangelsk's stadium Dinamo, and the cinemas, Ars and Pobeda. Shanina's friend Anna Samsonova remembered that Roza sometimes returned from her friends in Ustyansky District to her college dormitory between 2:00 and 3:00 am. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were locked by that time, the other students tied several bedsheets together to help Roza climb into her room. In 1938, Shanina {{became a member of the}} Soviet youth movement Komsomol.|$|E
500|$|Industrial music {{drew from}} {{a broad range of}} predecessors. Alexei Monroe argues that Kraftwerk were {{particularly}} significant in the development of industrial music, as the [...] "first successful artists to incorporate representations of industrial sounds into nonacademic electronic music." [...] Industrial music was created originally by using mechanical and electric machinery, and later advanced synthesizers, samplers and electronic percussion as the technology developed. Monroe also argues for Suicide as an influential contemporary of the industrial musicians. Groups cited as inspirational by the founders of industrial music include The Velvet Underground, Joy Division, and Martin Denny. Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle had a cassette library including recordings by the Master Musicians of Jajouka, Kraftwerk, Charles Manson, and William S. Burroughs. P-Orridge also credited 1960s rock such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Doors,</b> Pearls Before Swine, The Fugs, Captain Beefheart, and Frank Zappa in a 1979 interview.|$|E
500|$|Ian, Rachel and Geraldine join Rebecca and Carl. Geraldine {{says that}} the room is {{normally}} locked, but Rebecca rebukes her. Stuart rejoins the group after using the toilet. As the group talk, Mark and his wife, Liz, enter the bedroom, unaware of the people hiding in the wardrobe. The pair talk candidly before beginning foreplay and lying down on the bed. Geraldine shouts to alert them, {{and those in the}} wardrobe pretend they did not hear Mark and Liz's conversation. Mark and Liz reluctantly enter the wardrobe. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> close, Rachel's boyfriend Lee enters the room, but as the wardrobe has become more cramped, Stuart and Lee hide under the bed and Ian moves to the en suite bathroom. Stuart and Carl argue, and it is revealed that Carl has a fear of intimacy. When [...] "Stinky" [...] John enters the room, both those in the wardrobe and under the bed claim there is no room, so he hides behind a curtain. Jeremy enters the room and tells Rebecca he is going to pick up another guest from the train station, but as he turns to leave he mistakenly calls her [...] "Rachel". Andrew, Rebecca's father, enters and becomes annoyed when he sees people hiding in different places. He forces Jeremy, Stuart, Lee and Stinky John into the wardrobe with everyone else and follows them in.|$|E

2500|$|The {{television}} series The Dukes of Hazzard (1979–1985) featured an orange 1969 Dodge Charger that was named The General Lee. [...] "The General" [...] sported the Confederate battle flag {{painted on the}} roof and the words [...] "GENERAL LEE" [...] over each door. The windows were always open, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were supposedly welded shut for racing, and the actors would do a window slide to get in and out. The number [...] "01" [...] is painted on both doors. Also, when the horn button was pressed, it played the first 12 notes from the de facto Confederate States anthem [...] "Dixie". The car performed spectacular jumps in almost every episode, and the show's popularity produced consumer interest in the car.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the 69 Eyes' music {{style was}} of glam metal {{influenced}} by acts such as Mötley Crüe and Hanoi Rocks. However, {{they began to}} incorporate more influence from gothic rock bands such as The Mission, The Cult, [...] The Sisters of Mercy and The Lords of the New Church. Their sound {{was described as a}} mix of the gloominess of gothic rock with guitar-powered rock 'n' roll. Their music continued to show further influence from other rock artists such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Doors,</b> Elvis Presley, and Billy Idol as well as vampire films and literature. The term [...] "goth 'n roll" [...] is used by fans to describe their style. [...] They are often described as a dark rock band, a term which the band has embraced. In recent times, with the release of Back in Blood, The 69 Eyes have moved back to a more guitar-based sound, although gothic imagery and lyrical themes remain forefront in their style.|$|E
2500|$|... "La Onda" [...] was a {{literary}} {{consequence of the}} introduction of Anglophone Rock Music to the culturally conservative, socially rigid Mexican society of the 1960s. In the event, the cultural (generational) non-conformity inherent {{to the music of}} bands and singers such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Doors,</b> The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin, gave form (thought and action) to the cultural, societal, and generational discontents of Mexican young people — from every Mexican social class — to openly rebel against limiting tradition. Consequent to that great foreign-culture influence, the Mexican Middle class began to intellectually, then culturally, associate with the Hippie social movements of the U.S. and Europe. Mexican artists subsequently developed a national counter culture, based upon an amalgamation of foreign and domestic rock music, literature, language, and fashion, an example of which was the rock concert Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro (11 September 1971); a time that Prof. Eric Zolov said [...] "was a new transnational and trans-cultural era".|$|E
