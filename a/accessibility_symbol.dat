In the years to follow, this symbol was adopted in a great many nations by organizations for the disabled and, in some countries, it even enjoys copyright protection. In 1972, the European Council, made up of eight countries comprising Italy, issued a declaration expressing its support in favour of the use of the International <b>Accessibility</b> <b>Symbol</b> (as it is officially called), and passed a resolution to this effect. In Italy the "Regulation for the implementation of art. 27 of Law no. 118 of 1971 ", shows this symbol (measuring 10 x 11 cm), with a blue background and the figure and borders in white. In some European countries, this symbol is used to indicate specific measures taken in favour of people with physical and motor disabilities, while specific symbols have been studied to indicate places and equipment designed for those with sight and hearing impairments. Such a requirement stems from having used the initial symbol as an all-comprehensive indication, thus creating confusion among users...|$|E
5000|$|Preformed {{thermoplastic}} pavement markings (sometime called [...] "tape", {{but not to}} {{be confused}} with preformed polymer tape) are thermoplastic cut into the final shapes by the manufacturers and ready to position onto an asphalt or concrete pavement surface. Preformed thermoplastics are put into place on the road surface and applied using a propane heat torch. Some models require heating the road surface prior to the placement of the preformed thermoplastics. These markings are used primarily because of their durability and cost-effective service life. Since the plastics are melted into the surface, they are not easily damaged by the snowplows. Typically, the preformed thermoplastic markings can last 3 to 6 years. The most common applications of preformed thermoplastic pavement markings are found at intersections as transverse markings such as stop lines, legends, crosswalks, arrows, bike lane <b>symbols,</b> and <b>accessibility</b> <b>symbols.</b>|$|R
