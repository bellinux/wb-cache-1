5|$|Due to her 2000 injury, Carter lost {{considerable}} mobility in {{her right}} arm, and required <b>an</b> <b>elbow</b> reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine, and nine operations were required to treat the elbow. After her comeback in 2008, she played for the Dandenong Rangers in the Australian Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League (WNWBL), the team she had played for before her injury. That year she received a player award from the Dandenong Rangers and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in her 1-point disability classification in the WNWBL and {{was named to the}} league's All Star Five.

The cut was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with <b>an</b> <b>elbow</b> and since the fight did not go past four rounds, the fight was ruled a no contest.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 2012, Cain {{agreed to}} a five-year {{contract}} extension worth a guaranteed $112.5 million through 2017 with an option for 2018, at the time surpassing Kevin Brown for the largest deal for a right-handed pitcher. Cain earned a $5 million signing bonus, and earned $20 million each season from 2013–17. His $21 million option for 2018 would vest automatically {{if he was not}} on the disabled list to <b>an</b> <b>elbow</b> or shoulder injury in 2017 and if he reached 400 innings in 2016 and 2017 combined. If the option failed to vest, the Giants could either pick up the $21 million option or pay a $7.5 million buyout. Cain was scheduled to become a free agent after the 2012 season.|$|E

5|$|Sandoval {{made the}} Giants' Opening Day roster out of spring {{training}} in 2009 as the Giants' starting third baseman and backup catcher. He served as a personal catcher for Zito {{at the beginning of}} the year. On May 12, Sandoval hit his first walk-off home run against Joe Beimel to beat the Washington Nationals 97. Following <b>an</b> <b>elbow</b> injury to Sandoval in May, the Giants called up Eli Whiteside to serve as the backup catcher on May 24; since then, Sandoval has not been used at all as a catcher. After 73 games played, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler wrote that Sandoval had made the most impressive transition from the Giants farm system since 1986 when Will Clark and Robby Thompson were rookies.|$|E
5|$|Although in 2008 Baseball America {{projected}} Venable as an {{every day}} starter for the Padres in 2010, some experts questioned {{whether he would}} be a long-term solution in center field for the team. Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run of the season in his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw <b>an</b> <b>elbow</b> while being tagged out. In 2009, he posted 12 home runs and tallied 38 runs batted in (RBI), while defensively 493.2 of his 643 innings were spent in right field and only 117 in center field.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{became a}} free agent {{after the end of the}} season, but was offered {{arbitration}} from the Padres. The Tampa Bay Rays expressed interest in signing Barrett, even though the signing would involve trading the Padres a future second round draft pick as compensation. Barrett accepted the Padres' arbitration offer on December 7. The Padres placed Barrett on the disabled list on April 8, 2008, after he sustained <b>an</b> <b>elbow</b> injury. The team later activated him on May 25, after he had recovered, and completed a minor league rehabilitation assignment. On July 2, 2008, Barrett was rushed to the hospital after fouling a pitch off his face. He required surgery to repair the damage, and had been placed on the disabled list for the second time in 2008. The Padres waived Barrett on October 11, after he previously expressed interest in testing the free-agent market.|$|E

5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and {{her right arm}} became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her elbow to rupture. Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required <b>an</b> <b>elbow</b> reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs as {{the seventh}} seed, the Canucks {{went on a}} run to the Stanley Cup Finals. In the seventh game of the opening round series against the Calgary Flames, Bure scored {{one of the most}} {{significant}} and well-known goals in Canucks' history. After receiving a breakaway pass from defenceman Jeff Brown, he deked and scored on Flames' goalie Mike Vernon in the second overtime to win the series. In game two of the second round against the Dallas Stars, Bure knocked enforcer Shane Churla to the ice with <b>an</b> <b>elbow</b> to the jaw. He also scored two goals in the game to help Vancouver to a 3–0 win. Although Bure was not initially penalized for the play, he was later fined $500 by the league. He recorded six goals and eight points in five games against the Dallas Stars, and against the Toronto Maple Leafs the following round scored four goals and six points in five games.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season with Buffalo, 2011–12, Regehr led the Sabres with 172 hits and {{finished}} second with 112 blocked shots. His one-goal on the season ended another lengthy scoring drought that lasted nearly 11 months. His tenure with the Sabres ended 21 games into the 2012–13 season. In {{the final year of}} his contract and with Buffalo out of playoff contention, he was dealt to the Los Angeles Kings on April 1, 2013, in exchange for two second round draft picks. The Kings acquired Regehr to add a veteran presence and aid the team's penalty kill. He appeared in 41 games during the season, split between the two teams, and recorded four assists. Shortly after the Kings reached the third round of the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Regehr and the team agreed to a two-year, $6 million contract extension. After the Kings were eliminated from the post-season by the Chicago Blackhawks, Kings' coach Darryl Sutter revealed he had played the entire playoffs with <b>an</b> <b>elbow</b> injury that required off-season surgery to repair.|$|E
