5|$|Adult common loons {{have few}} predators, {{although}} bald eagles will attack incubating birds. Attacks by sharks in winter {{have also been}} recorded. When a predator approaches (either the loon's nest or the loon itself), the common loon sometimes attacks the predator by rushing <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks either at the predator's abdomen or the back of its head or neck.|$|E
5|$|As the day progresses, Rick's son Carl (Chandler Riggs) becomes {{restless and}} sneaks {{into the barn}} to observe Randall; Randall tries to {{convince}} Carl to release him. Shane discovers Carl's presence and scolds him. Outside, Carol (Melissa McBride) attempts to cheer Carl up by reminding him Sophia is in heaven, but he lashes out at her. Carl ends up taking a gun from Daryl's stash and heading into the nearby swamp alone. He finds a walker half-stuck in mud, and taunts it by throwing rocks <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> then moves in close to shoot it in the head. The walker suddenly frees one of its legs and lurches forward; Carl panics and drops the gun before running back to camp, not telling anyone what happened. Meanwhile, Beth (Emily Kinney) has since recovered from her earlier suicide attempt. When Glenn (Steven Yeun) comes {{to check on her}} condition, Hershel (Scott Wilson) gives him a family heirloom representing his approval of Glenn's relationship with his daughter Maggie (Lauren Cohan).|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sens≈ç-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E

5|$|Mulder {{brings the}} device to the Lone Gunmen, who tell him it is {{emitting}} some kind of signal. Mulder contacts Scully, who is growing increasingly paranoid. Hearing possible clicks while {{on the phone with}} Mulder, she frantically searches her hotel room for monitoring devices. When Mulder knocks at her door, Scully fires her weapon <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> runs off. Mulder believes her to be suffering from paranoid psychosis. The Lone Gunmen believe {{the device to}} be some sort of subliminal mind control device. Mulder was not affected due to his color blindness. The police find a body they believe to be that of Scully, but Mulder confirms that it is not her. Mulder is unable to contact Scully's mother, leading him to go to her house. He finds Scully there, who aims a gun at him. Scully claims Mulder never trusted her and blames him for her abduction and her sister's murder. Scully's mother calms her down, and she is hospitalized.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, the Americans {{spotted a}} large house in Yorktown. Believing that Cornwallis might be {{stationed}} there, they aimed <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> quickly destroyed it. Cornwallis sank {{more than a}} dozen of his ships in the harbor. The French began to fire at the British ships and scored a hit on the British HMS Charon, which caught fire, and in turn set two or three other ships on fire. Cornwallis received word from Clinton that the British fleet was to depart on October 12, however Cornwallis responded by saying {{that he would not be}} able to hold out for long.|$|E
5|$|The group finds {{a supply}} store {{with food and}} scout the area for aliens. Finding none, they load the food into the truck. Hal is {{attacked}} by a Skitter. Tom fires <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> his son runs away. A Mech is alerted and comes after Tom. Hal stops it by firing at it. It then runs after Hal. Tom puts C-4 in a shopping cart and wheels it next to the Mech, killing it. The Skitter comes after Tom, but Dai shoots it. The alien dies slowly after its gun wound and the group observes it before it dies.|$|E

25|$|During the First World War, Scarborough {{was used}} for British {{propaganda}} purposes after the bombardment of the town by two warships of the German Empire, SMS Derfflinger and SMS Von der Tann, on 16 December 1914. The raid killed 19 people and damaged the castle's keep, barracks and curtain walls. The castle was severely damaged by the hail of 500shells directed <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> the town. The barracks were demolished due to the extensive damage wrought by the bombardment. In the Second World War, the castle served as a secret listening post.|$|E

25|$|It {{will be a}} win-at-all costs approach. We're {{going to}} go out and give 110 per cent-over four days of every Shield game. If you give 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball I think I can hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn. It's my first shot <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> I will be listening to a lot of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.|$|E
500|$|David Silverman {{states that}} Itchy and Scratchy {{cartoons}} are [...] "an ironic commentary on cartoon mayhem {{in the sense}} that it's taken to a more realistic level. The kids on The Simpsons are laughing <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> we're laughing too, but part of what you're laughing at is the over-the-top excessiveness of the violence." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Dunder Mifflin office, Charles asks Jim (John Krasinski) for a [...] "rundown" [...] of {{his client}} information. Jim {{does not know}} what a rundown is, but is too embarrassed to ask because he has been making such a poor {{impression}} with Charles. Jim spends much of the day {{trying to figure out what}} a rundown is, making several failed attempts to figure it out by chatting vaguely about it with Charles and other coworkers. When he finally finishes what he believes is a rundown, Charles does not look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> simply asks Jim to fax it to everyone on the distribution list. Jim {{does not know what}} the distribution list is either, but rather than asking Charles, he simply faxes the rundown to his father.|$|E

500|$|Nirvana {{originally}} wanted Kevin Kerslake, who {{had directed}} the videos for the band's singles [...] "Come as You Are", [...] "Lithium", [...] "In Bloom", and [...] "Sliver", {{to direct the}} [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] music video. Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed. Corbijn said, [...] "But then I looked <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> I thought that actually it was pretty good. I was very amazed by somebody writing a song and having those ideas as precise as he did." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{just sort}} of sits there with her {{cigarette}} and her hair, and she would pull stuff‚Äî these very disparate elements‚Äî and put them together into this ensemble, and you'd go, [...] "Come on, Pat, you can't wear that with that." [...] She'd say, [...] "Eh, just try it on." [...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, but it works on so many different levels‚Äî and it allows you to figure out who the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> you go, [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E
500|$|An {{animated}} {{music video}} was produced for [...] "Hello Sunshine", directed by Pete Fowler, Neil McFarland and Passion Pictures and featuring Fowler's cartoon drawings. The video {{begins with the}} sun rising over a country landscape. A small, blue, 'Hello Sunshine' winged horse flies across the sky and is watched by a man holding a 1:16 scale model kit for the same horse. The picture of the horse on the box flies away as he looks <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> lands on one of five hot air balloons flown by cartoon representations of the Super Furry Animals. The video cuts to a brief shot of a man staring through a shop window at an advertising display featuring models of the 'Hello Sunshine' horse before we see Gruff Rhys coming across a huge statue of the same horse in his car.|$|E

500|$|Over {{time the}} mill's {{machinery}} was updated: in 1868 the existing wire machine {{was replaced with}} a silk dressing machine; a corn screen was installed in 1871; an oatmeal plant was added in 1880; the water wheel was replaced with an American-built water-powered [...] "Victor" [...] turbine in 1887; and in 1889 the plant was converted from millstones to roller milling, {{making it one of}} the earliest conversions in Tasmania. This last change, to roller milling, was recorded by Monds as driven by public demand for the whiter flour that process produced. Monds' oldest son took over office management of the mill in 1882 and Monds moved to Launceston in 1888 leaving the mill's management to his sons. The mill was the scene of the town's first telephones when they were installed <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> adjacent Hawthorn Villa in 1893.|$|E
500|$|Wizards & Warriors III {{received}} {{praise from}} Retro Gamer magazine in September2010, {{as part of}} its retrospective on the Wizards & Warriors series. They said that the third installment was the best game in the series as well as developer Ste Pickford's personal favorite, {{despite the fact that it}} did not sell as well as its predecessor Ironsword. Developer Ste Pickford said: [...] "Wizards & WarriorsIII was more like a game that I really wanted to make. IronSword was pretty much a straight sequel for a game dropped in our lap; we look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> tried to make a new version with some improvements." [...] Pickford added that, while he could have done better with both Ironsword and Wizards & WarriorsIII, he wished he would have been able to see the latter to its completion.|$|E
500|$|For {{its fourth}} album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp {{producer}} Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986) featured Stipe's vocals {{closer to the}} forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, [...] "Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> I think that shows up in the projection of his voice." [...] The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and eventually peaked at number 21 on the Billboard album chart. The single [...] "Fall on Me" [...] also picked up support on commercial radio. The album was the band's first to be certified gold for selling 500,000 copies. While American college radio remained R.E.M.'s core support, the band was beginning to chart hits on mainstream rock formats; however, the music still encountered resistance from Top 40 radio.|$|E
