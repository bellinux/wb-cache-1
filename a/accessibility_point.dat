However, from the UI <b>accessibility</b> <b>point</b> of view, these technologies pose new challenges that the Web Accessibility Initiative of the W 3 C is trying to solve through the use of a standard specification for Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA). Currently, the introduction of properties defined in WAI-ARIA is being done in an ad-hoc manner due to the lack of models, methodologies and tools to support the design of accessible RIA UIs. In this paper we propose a semantic approach to deal with this modeling issue by extending the RUX-Method, a model-based method to build RIA UIs. The approach includes the validation process of the accessibility issues at two different levels: the UI structure and the interactions behavior...|$|E

In this framework, showing local accessibility of the higher level, abstracted model is equivalent to showing local accessibility of the, more detailed, lower level model. Given an affine control system and a smooth surjective map, we present a canonical construction for extracting an affine control system describing the trajectories of the abstracted variables. We then obtain conditions on the abstraction maps that render the original and abstracted system equivalent from a local <b>accessibility</b> <b>point</b> of view. Such consistent hierarchies of accessibility preserving abstractions of nonlinear control systems are then considered for various classes of affine control systems including linear, bilinear, drift free, and strict feedback systems...|$|E

The acceptable level difference from <b>accessibility</b> <b>point</b> {{of view is}} defined in both national and international building regulations and standards; it couldn’t be more than 2 cm. Level-differences exceeding this value must be eliminated or bridged as it happens usually with ramps. In case of level differences smaller than 6 – 8 cm a regularly designed ramp occupies significant floor space; its length is about one meter. An’ adequately short’ ramp may and from many points of view should have higher gradient than 8 % prescribed as maximum in building regulations.

40|$|Abstract. Semantic Web {{applications}} {{take off}} is being slower than expected, {{at least with}} respect to “real-world ” applications and users. One {{of the main reasons}} for this lack of adoption is that most Semantic Web user interfaces are still immature from the usability and <b>accessibility</b> <b>points</b> of view. This is due to the novelty of these technologies, but this also motivates the exploration of alternative interaction paradigms, different from the "traditional " Web or Desktop applications ones. Our proposal is realized in the Rhizomer platform, which explores the possibilities of the object-action interaction paradigm at the Web scale. This paradigm is well suited for heterogeneous resource spaces such as those common in the Semantic Web. Resources, described by metadata, correspond to the objects in the paradigm. Semantic web services, which are dynamically associated to these objects, correspond to the actions. The platform is being put into practice {{in the context of a}} research project in order to build an open application for media distribution based on Semantic Web technologies. Moreover, its usability and accessibility have been evaluated in this real setting and compared to similar systems...|$|R

30|$|The second {{exception}} {{is related to}} the spending per child in ECEC. When modelled in combination with GDP per capita, the effect of this variable keeps its significance, but the main effect of GDP per capita becomes not significant. When we checked the interaction term to understand better what this result meant, we found that the interaction of spending per child and GDP per capita has also a negative effect. This implies that in countries with a higher spending per child in ECEC, childcare becomes even more accessible if the GDP per capita in that country is on the lower side. Similar to the explanation for teachers’ salaries, we argue that if a country invests more on ECEC despite financial hardships, perceived accessibility of childcare increases significantly. These results are very encouraging to argue that ECEC should be prioritised even in times of austerity. From the <b>accessibility</b> <b>point</b> of view, these results demonstrate that investment pays off.|$|E
40|$|Property {{values are}} {{affected}} by the properties ’ physical, accessibility and environmental features. Railway stations function as nodes in transport networks and places in an urban environment. They have accessibility and environmental impacts, which contribute to property value. The literature on the effects of railway stations on property value is mixed in its finding in respect to impact magnitude and direction, ranging from a negative to an insignificant or a positive impact. This paper attempts to explain the variation in the findings by meta-analytical procedures. Generally the variations are attributed to the nature of data, particular spatial characteristics, temporal effects and methodology. The data can vary in relation to the type of property under study. Some indication is found to support the assertion that commercial properties enjoy a higher positive impact compared to residential properties. Commuter railway stations have a consistently higher positive impact on the property value compared to light and heavy railway/Metro stations. The inclusion of other accessibility variables (such as highways) in the models reduces the level of reported railway station impact. However this effect becomes insignificant for properties within a quarter-mile of the station, leaving the railway station as a major <b>accessibility</b> <b>point.</b> Ou...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a tool for {{airports}} to evaluate the impact of new routes on their connectivity to the network. Even if the choice to open new routes is to carriers, airports and regional governments have some tools to promote desirable connections to be offered toward specific destination. The analysis employs an innovative methodology, called simulated annealing, to verify the existence of subsystems, or modules, of high interconnectivity within the European aviation network. The single modules are intended to group together airports with very strong links between {{them in terms of}} exchanged seats, while being more weakly connected {{to the rest of the}} network. Our hypothesis is that the most desirable new routes, from the <b>accessibility</b> <b>point</b> of view, are to important airports belonging to other modules. The lower the interchange between the modules of the two airports to be connected, the higher the connectivity. To test this hypothesis we consider 467 European airports with at least one scheduled flight in autumn 2007. After classifying each airport into modules, we show that the greater improvements in accessibility, measured as the average number of steps to reach any other airport in the network, occur when new routes are offered to relevant airports of relatively unconnected modules. network modularity, new routes, connectivity...|$|E

In the {{stressful}} society we live in today these kinds of resorts have once again become very popular and now local entrepreneurs want to build a spa at the top of Vitberget, the highest point in Skellefteå. The entrance will consist of a tunnel through the mountain, an elevator and a skywalk that leads into the spa. This might pose a problem for people with phobias of tight spaces and/ or heights. Accessibility is much more than just easy access and contrasting markings. This study examines chosen phobias from an <b>accessibility</b> <b>point</b> of view. Research shows that humans are strongly affected by their physical environment. Color, form, light and materials evoke different feelings and associations. Four people with phobia of tight spaces and/ or heights are interviewed in this study to find a suitable design for their needs. The informants, with some help from the interview questions and pictures of different tunnels, elevators and skywalks, get to describe a good design based on their phobia and personal preferences. This information is then compared to research done in this area. Sketches based on empiric and theoretic information are then discussed with one of the informants and this leads up to the final design proposal. The conclusions drawn from theoretical and empirical information are that light is very important and that tight, dark spaces are regarded as uncomfortable. Inputs from nature like wood, vegetation and water seems to be calming, while metal and raw concrete can be discouraging. The fear of being trapped is strong and information about what awaits you can facilitate your walk along the entrance way. The tunnel, the elevator and the skywalk can be designed to fit people with phobia of tight spaces and/ or heights and this can contribute to a better architecture for everybody.

Road network selection for smaller scales forms a prerequisite for all other generalization operators and is thus a fundamental operation in the overall process of topographic map and database production. The objective {{of this paper was}} to develop an algorithm for automated road network selection from a large-scale (1 : 10, 000) to a medium-scale database (1 : 50, 000). The project was pursued in collaboration with swisstopo, the national mapping agency of Switzerland. Three algorithms (a stroke-based, a mesh-based, and a combined stroke-mesh algorithm) were implemented from the literature and analyzed using swisstopo’s large-scale TLM 3 D spatial database, with requirements set forth by expert cartographers. Initial experiments showed that the combination algorithm performed best, yet still it could not meet all requirements. Therefore, extensions to the basic stroke-mesh algorithm were developed, significantly improving the selection result with real-world, large test databases. Three extensions introduce modifications to the stroke-mesh combination algorithm. Furthermore, two extensions include external feature classes, ensuring <b>accessibility</b> of <b>points</b> of interest and appropriate network density representation in settlement areas, respectively.
