5|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with <b>aphonia</b> or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves may {{be injured}} {{as a result}} of trauma, during surgery, {{as a result of}} tumour spread, or due to other means. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves can result in a weakened voice (hoarseness) or loss of voice (<b>aphonia)</b> and cause problems in the respiratory tract. Injury to the nerve may paralyze the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle on the same side. This is the sole muscle responsible for opening the vocal cords, and paralysis may cause difficulty breathing (dyspnea) during physical activity. Injury to both the right and left nerve may result in more serious damage, such as the inability to speak. Additional problems may emerge during healing, as nerve fibres that re-anastamose may result in vocal cord motion impairment, uncoordinated movements of the vocal cord.|$|E
5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (<b>aphonia).</b> In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
25|$|Dora is the {{pseudonym}} {{given by}} Sigmund Freud {{to a patient}} whom he diagnosed with hysteria, and treated for about eleven weeks in 1900. Her most manifest hysterical symptom was <b>aphonia,</b> or loss of voice.

The same review concluded that acupuncture {{can be considered}} inherently safe when practiced by properly trained practitioners, but the review also stated {{there is a need}} to find effective strategies to minimize the health risks. Between 1999 and 2010, the Republic of Korean-literature contained reports of 1104 adverse events. Between the 1980s and 2002, the Japanese-language literature contained reports of 150 adverse events.|$|E
25|$|Because PPS can fatigue facial muscles, {{as well as}} cause {{dysphagia}} (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking) or <b>aphonia</b> (inability {{to produce}} speech), persons with PPS may become malnourished due to difficulty eating. Compensatory routines can help relieve these symptoms such as eating smaller portions {{at a time and}} sitting down whilst eating. PPS with respiratory involvement requires special management such as breathing exercises, chest percussion with a stethoscope on regular occasions for observation of the disease and management of secretions. Failure to properly assess PPS with respiratory involvement can increase the risk of missing aspiration pneumonia (an infection of the lower respiratory tract) in an individual. Severe cases may require permanent ventilation or tracheostomy. Sleep apnoea may also occur. Other management strategies that may lead to improvement include smoking cessation, treatment of other respiratory diseases and vaccination against respiratory infections such as influenza.|$|E
25|$|HA is a bulky, {{negatively}} charged glycosaminoglycan, whose strong affinity with water procures HA its viscoelastic and shock absorbing properties essential to vocal biomechanics. Viscosity and elasticity {{are critical to}} voice production. Chan, Gray and Titze, quantified the effect of HA on both the viscosity and the elasticity of vocal folds (VF) by comparing the properties of tissues with and without HA. The results showed that removal of HA decreased the stiffness of VF {{by an average of}} 35%, but increased their dynamic viscosity by an average of 70% at frequencies higher than 1Hz. Newborns have been shown to cry an average of 6.7 hours per day during the first 3 months, with a sustained pitch of 400–600Hz, and a mean duration per day of 2 hours. Similar treatment on adult VF would quickly result in edema, and subsequently <b>aphonia.</b> Schweinfurth and al. presented the hypothesis that high hyaluronic acid content and distribution in newborn VF is directly associated with newborn crying endurance. These differences in newborn vocal fold composition would also be responsible for newborns inability to articulate sounds, besides the fact that their lamina propria is a uniform structure with no vocal ligament. The layered structure necessary for phonation will start to develop during the infancy and until the adolescence.|$|E
50|$|Injuries {{are often}} the cause of <b>aphonia.</b> Minor {{injuries}} can affect {{the second and third}} dorsal area in such a manner that the lymph patches concerned with coordination become either atrophic or relatively nonfunctioning. Tracheotomy can also cause <b>aphonia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Aphonia</b> {{is defined}} as the {{inability}} to produce voiced sound. A primary cause of <b>aphonia</b> is bilateral disruption of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which supplies nearly all the muscles in the larynx. Damage to the nerve {{may be the result of}} surgery (e.g., thyroidectomy) or a tumor.|$|E

50|$|Different subtypes {{of vocal}} cord {{dysfunction}} {{are characterized by}} additional symptoms. For instance, momentary <b>aphonia</b> {{can be caused by}} laryngospasm, an involuntary spasm of the vocal cords and a strained or hoarse voice may be perceived when the vocal cord dysfunction occurs during speech, resulting in spasmodic dysphonia.|$|E
5000|$|All {{of these}} muscles receive their {{innervation}} from the recurrent laryngeal nerve {{which is a}} branch of the vagus nerve (CN X).

50|$|Psychogenic <b>aphonia</b> {{is often}} seen in {{patients}} with underlying psychological problems. Laryngeal examination will usually show bowed vocal folds that fail to adduct to the midline during phonation. However, the vocal folds will adduct when the patient is asked to cough.

She was diagnosed Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles, in the Houston Methodist Hospital.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aphonia</b> Recordings is an {{independent}} record label founded by Ben L. Robertson and Andrew Senna in Seattle, Washington in 2006. Mostly regarded as an outlet for digital releases of experimental and ambient music it also has released more pop oriented artists such as Desolation Wilderness and Slim Twig, {{both of which have}} gone on to sign with major labels. They continue {{to be one of the}} few active experimental labels in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

50|$|Any {{injury or}} {{condition}} that prevents the vocal cords, the paired bands of muscle tissue positioned over the trachea, from coming together and vibrating {{will have the}} potential to make a person unable to speak. When a person prepares to speak, the vocal folds come together over the trachea and vibrate due to the airflow from the lungs. This mechanism produces the sound of the voice. If the vocal folds cannot meet together to vibrate, sound will not be produced. <b>Aphonia</b> can also be caused by and is often accompanied by fear.|$|E
5000|$|A mute of malice is a {{defendant}} {{in a criminal case}} who willfully chooses not to speak, as opposed to one who does not speak because he is physically or psychologically unable to do so (see <b>aphonia</b> and muteness, respectively). In British jurisprudence, a separate trial is held before the main trial to determine whether the defendant is mute of malice or mute due to [...] "visitation of God." [...] In the past, if he was found by the jury to be mute of malice, he would be tortured until he spoke or died.|$|E
50|$|Inflammation {{occurs in}} the laryngeal, {{tracheal}} and bronchial cartilages. Both of these sites are involved in 10% of persons with RP at presentation and 50% {{over the course of}} this autoimmune disease, and is more common among females. The involvement of the laryngotracheobronchial cartilages may be severe and life-threatening; it causes one-third of all deaths among persons with RP.Laryngeal chondritis is manifested as pain above the thyroid gland and, more importantly, as dysphonia with a hoarse voice or transient <b>aphonia.</b> Because this disease is relapsing, recurrent laryngeal inflammation may result in laryngomalacia or permanent laryngeal stenosis with inspiratory dyspnea that may require emergency tracheotomy as a temporary or permanent measure.|$|E
50|$|Through {{organizing}} {{live performances}} for their artist's the label continues {{not only to}} distribute music but provide a venue for it as well. Not long after its formation, <b>Aphonia</b> Recordings became an organizational member of Gallery 1412, a non-profit corporation operating in Seattle's Central District. The label, {{as a member of}} the organization, held well over 20 showcases, benefits and shows at the venue. The label has made live recordings of the shows available through a podcast, mainly created and written by Senna. However, this limited format has given way to more substantive explorations of particular artists through narrative storytelling and interpretive analysis of the artist's work.|$|E

It continued to be extremely popular. One story has it that a coal miner with <b>aphonia</b> who visited Coney Island in 1948 had not spoken in years prior to the visit, but screamed while going down the Cyclone's first drop and said [...] "I feel sick" [...] as his train returned to the station.

50|$|Symptoms {{typically}} develop within 30 {{minutes of}} ingestion, {{but may be}} delayed by up to four hours; however, if the dose is fatal, symptoms are usually present within 17 minutes of ingestion. Paresthesia of the lips and tongue is followed by developing paresthesia in the extremities, hypersalivation, sweating, headache, weakness, lethargy, incoordination, tremor, paralysis, cyanosis, <b>aphonia,</b> dysphagia, and seizures. The gastrointestinal symptoms are often severe and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain; death is usually secondary to respiratory failure. There is increasing respiratory distress, speech is affected, and the victim usually exhibits dyspnea, cyanosis, mydriasis, and hypotension. Paralysis increases, and convulsions, mental impairment, and cardiac arrhythmia may occur. The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious {{and in some cases}} completely lucid until shortly before death, which generally occurs within 4 to 6 hours (range ~20 minutes to ~8 hours). However, some victims enter a coma.|$|E
50|$|Voice {{disorders}} {{range from}} <b>aphonia</b> (loss of phonation) to dysphonia, {{which may be}} phonatory and/or resonance disorders. Phonatory characteristics could include breathiness, hoarseness, harshness, intermittency, pitch, etc. Resonance characteristics refer to overuse or underuse of the resonance chambers resulting in hypernasality or hyponasality. Several examples of voice problems are vocal chord nodules or polyps, vocal chord paralysis, paradoxical vocal fold movement, and spasmodic dysphonia. Vocal chord nodules and polyps are different phenomena, but both {{may be caused by}} vocal abuse, and both may take the form of growths, bumps, or swelling on the vocal chords. Vocal fold paralysis is the inability to move {{one or both of the}} vocal chords, which results in difficulties with voice and perhaps swallowing. Paradoxical vocal fold movement occurs when the vocal chords close when they should actually be open. Spasmodic dysphonia is caused by strained vocal chord movement, which results in awkward voice problems, such as jerkiness or quavering.|$|E
