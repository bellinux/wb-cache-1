5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have to sit and stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E
5|$|Radford took {{command of}} the Aviation Training Division in Washington, D.C. on 1 December 1941, seven days before the attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II. He was {{appointed}} as Director of Aviation Training for both the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Bureau of Navigation; the double appointment helped to centralize training coordination for all naval aviators. With the U.S. mobilizing for war, Radford's office worked long hours {{six days a week}} in an effort to build up the necessary training infrastructure as quickly as possible. For several months, this around-the-clock work took up all of his time, and he later noted that walking to work was his only form of exercise for several months. During this time, he impressed colleagues with <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> no-nonsense approach to work, while maintaining a demeanor that made him easy to work for. He was promoted to captain soon after.|$|E

In particular, they refer to the work of Francis Galton, who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.|$|E
