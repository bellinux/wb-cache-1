40|$|As Rose (2006) {{discusses}} in {{the lead}} article, two camps can be identified {{in the field of}} gesture research: those who believe that gesticulation enhances communication by providing extra information to the listener, {{and on the other hand}} those who believe that gesticulation is not communicative, but rather that it facilitates speaker-internal word finding processes. I review a number of key studies relevant for this controversy, and conclude that the available empirical evidence is supporting the notion that gesture is a communicative device which can compensate for problems in speech by providing information in gesture.

Antibody specificity was confirmed by the capacity to recognize soluble and insolubilized FVIII and to neutralize FVIII cofactor activity in FX activation. Epitope mapping was carried out using a competition ELISA in which affinity-purified human antibodies inhibited the binding of labeled monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, a single region of the A 3 domain of the FVIII light chain was recognized by the antibodies, while the reactivity toward heavy chain epitopes differed from one antibody preparation to the other. Sera or IgG fractions of the serum before immunoadsorption over insolubilized FVIII did not bind to FVIII. The IgG fraction that was not retained on the FVIII immunosorbent contained IgG that bound to the variable part of anti-FVIII mouse monoclonal antibodies and inhibited the binding of labeled FVIII; in addition, the IgG fraction inhibited the binding of affinity-purified human antibodies to FVIII, thereby strongly suggesting the presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies.

They were produced spontaneously in broth, and higher titres were produced by induction with ultraviolet (u. v.) radiation. These bacteriocins {{are divided into}} eight subgroups by their spectrum of activity and resistant mutants of indicator strains. Group B bacteriocins are not active on serratias. Their action is restricted to escherichias, hafnias and aerobacters. Mutant bacteria resistant {{to any one of}} these B agents are resistant to all other B bacteriocins.

40|$|Antibodies {{that are}} able to {{catalyze}} the antigen for which they are specific <b>are</b> <b>produced</b> <b>spontaneously</b> by the immune system. Catalytic immunoglobulins (Igs) both of the IgM and IgG isotypes have been detected in the serum of healthy donors, where they have been proposed to participate in the removal of metabolic waste and in the defense of the organism against invading pathogens. Conversely, antigen-specific hydrolytic IgG have been reported in a number of inflammatory, autoimmune and neoplastic disorders: their pathogenic effects have been demonstrated occasionally. The pathophysiological relevance of catalytic antibodies thus remains an elusive issue. Through the description of the pro-coagulation factor VIII as a model target antigen for catalytic antibodies, we propose that catalytic antibodies have either a beneficial or a deleterious role depending on the physiopathological context. Physiology thus relies on a delicate equilibrium between the levels of soluble target antigen and that of antigen-specific hydrolyzing immunoglobulins. Indeed, in patients with hemophilia A, in whom endogenous factor VIII is deficient or missing and exogenous factor VIII needs to be administered to treat hemorrhagic events, the development of factor VIII-hydrolyzing IgG that inactivate the therapeutically administered factor VIII, may reveal deleterious. In contrast, in a situation in which excess factor VIII may be detrimental and lead to excessive coagulation, disseminated thrombosis and organ ischemia, as seen in severe sepsis, our recent data suggest that the presence of factor VIII-hydrolyzing IgG may be beneficial to the patient...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a simple system without a cavity {{exhibits}} optical bistability with no hysteresis but with symmetry-breaking or pitchfork bifurcation. The optical system is composed of a cell containing atoms with spin in the ground state, a λ/ 8 plate and a mirror, and an incident light beam linearly polarized and nearly resonant with the atomic absorption line. The system has a positive-feedback loop for the rotation of polarization through competitive optical pumping by σ± circularly polarized components.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} {{the hypothesis that}} tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has {{a pivotal role in}} the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, based on in vitro observations that in RA synovial joint cell cultures removal of TNF-alpha, inhibited other potentially pathogenic cytokines such as the equally proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 (IL- 1) and the macrophage activating factor, GM-CSF. Here we describe that in both rheumatoid (RA) and osteoarthritic (OA) synovial cultures there is a homeostatic mechanism to regulate the activities of TNF-alpha. This concept is based on several observations. First in these synovial joint cell cultures the substantial discrepancy between the levels of bioactive and immunoreactive TNF-alpha indicates the presence of an inhibitor. Second, TNF binding proteins <b>are</b> <b>produced</b> <b>spontaneously,</b> which are the soluble variants of surface p 75 and p 55 TNF receptor. The amount of soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-R) produced varied between cultures; p 75 sTNF-R was more abundant than p 55 sTNF-R (as detected by ELISA), and both were produced at higher levels by RA synovial joint cells in culture, compared to OA cultures. These TNF binding proteins act as endogenous inhibitors of TNF-alpha, since blocking their activity in synovial joint cell culture supernatants with MoAb to p 55 and p 75 sTNF-R enhanced their cytotoxic activity in the TNF bioassay. The regulation of production of these sTNF-R in synovial joint cell cultures is important as the balance between TNF-alpha and sTNF-R production may determine the outcome of the inflammatory process...|$|E
40|$|Children’s {{speech sound}} {{development}} is assessed by comparing speech production to typical development of speech sounds {{based on a}} child’s age and developmental profile. One widely-used method of sampling is to elicit a single word sample along with connected speech. Words that <b>are</b> <b>produced</b> <b>spontaneously</b> rather than imitated may give a more accurate indication of a child’s speech development. A published word complexity measure {{can be used to}} score later-developing speech sounds and more complex word patterns. There is a need for a screening word list that is quick to administer and reliably differentiates children with typically developing speech from children with patterns of delayed/disordered speech. The aim was to identify a short word list based on word complexity which could be spontaneously named by most typically developing children aged 3; 00 to 5; 05 years. One hundred and five children between 3; 00 and 5; 05 years old from three local authority nursery schools took part in the study. Items from a published speech assessment were modified and extended to include a range of phonemic targets in different word positions in 78 monosyllabic and polysyllabic words. The 78 words were ranked both by phonemic/phonetic complexity as measured by word complexity and by ease of spontaneous production. The 10 most complex words (hereafter the Triage 10) were named spontaneously by more than 90 % of the children. There {{was no significant difference between}} the complexity measures for 5 identified age groups when the data were examined in 6 month groups. A qualitative analysis revealed 8 children with profiles of phonological delay or disorder. When these children were considered separately, there was a statistically significant difference (p< 0. 005) between the mean word complexity measure of the group compared to the mean for the remaining children in all other age groups. The Triage 10 words reliably differentiated children with typically developing speech from those with delayed or disordered speech patterns. The Triage 10 words can be used as a screening tool for triage and general assessment and has potential for monitoring progress during intervention.

40|$|The {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans (abbreviated as C. elegans below) {{has several}} advantages {{as a model}} organism for studying the nervous system. 　First, its nervous system is very simple. C. elegans has 959 cells, of which 302 are neurons that constitute the nervous system. Second, the complete structure of the nervous system, the identity of each neuron and the connections by chemical synapses and gap junctions, has been determined by electron microscopic analysis of the serial sections of worm body. Third, genetic methods are available. Mutants can be isolated easily after mutagenesis of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites. Furthermore, males <b>are</b> <b>produced</b> <b>spontaneously</b> among the progeny of hermaphrodites at a low frequency by X chromosome non-disjunction. Males can mate with hermaphrodites and therefore {{can be used for}} mapping mutations. Fourth, it is possible to kill specific neurons by laser ablation under a light microscope. This technique is useful in determining the role of each type of neuron. The functions of the nervous system can be studied genetically by isolating and characterizing mutants that are abnormal in various behaviors. Mutants of C. elegans that are abnormal in locomotion, egg-laying, pharyngeal pumping, chemotaxis, defecation etc. have been isolated and characterized in the past over 20 years. However, in C. elegans, functions of the nervous system can be studied also by a specific aspect of post-embryonic development, i. e., regulation of dauer larva formation. The dauer larva is a special third-stage larva produced under harsh conditions. The life cycle of C. elegans takes three and a half days at 20 2 ̆ 7 C. After hatching, C. elegans usually passes through 4 larval stages called L 1, L 2, L 3 and L 4, before becoming an adult worm. However, if there are little food and much pheromone (due to overcrowding) around the worm, it becomes a dauer larva instead of an L 3 larva. Temperature is another factor that modifies the decision between dauer and L 3. At a high temperature more dauer larvae tend to be formed than at a low temperature. The dauer larva has a characteristic dark, thin body. It does not feed, because its mouth is closed. It can survive up to three months, and when it encounters food, it molts and goes into the L 4 larval stage. The two main environmental cues for the dauer/L 3 decision, namely food and pheromone, seem to be sensed by the nervous system. C. elegans has a pair of sensory organs called amphids in the head. It is known that if we kill two types of sensory neurons (ADF and ASI) in the amphids of wild type worms, they become dauer larvae at a certain probability even under non-dauer-forming conditions. The probability increases to nearly 100...|$|E
40|$|Looking across human {{societies}} reveals regularities in the languages that people speak and the concepts that they use. One explanation {{that has been}} proposed for these “cultural universals ” is differences in {{the ease with which}} people learn particular languages and concepts. A difference in learnability means that languages and concepts possessing a particular property {{are more likely to be}} accurately transmitted from one generation of learners to the next. Intuitively, this difference could allow languages and concepts that are more learnable to become more prevalent after multiple generations of cultural transmission. If this is the case, the prevalence of languages and concepts with particular properties can be explained simply by demonstrating empirically that they are more learnable. We evaluate this argument using mathematical analysis and behavioral experiments. Specifically, we provide two counter-examples that show how greater learnability need not result in a property becoming prevalent. First, more learnable languages and concepts can nonetheless be less likely to <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> <b>spontaneously</b> as a result of transmission failures. We simulated cultural transmission in the laboratory to show that this can occur for memory of distinctive items: these items are more likely to be remembered, but not generated spontaneousl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{metabolism}} of amine-containing drugs by cytochrome P 450 enzymes (P 450 s) {{is prone}} to form a nitrosoalkane metabolic intermediate (MI), which subsequently coordinates to the heme iron of a P 450, to produce a metabolic-intermediate complex (MIC). This type of P 450 inhibition, referred to as mechanism-based inactivation (MBI), presents a serious concern in drug discovery processes. We applied density functional theory (DFT) to the reaction between N-methylhydroxylamine (NMH) and the compound I reactive species of P 450, {{in an effort to}} elucidate the mechanism of the putative final step of the MI formation in the alkylamine metabolism. Our DFT calculations show that H-abstraction from the hydroxyl group of NMH is the most favorable pathway via which the nitrosoalkane intermediate <b>is</b> <b>produced</b> <b>spontaneously.</b> H-abstraction from the N–H bond was slightly less favorable. In contrast, N-oxidation and H-abstraction from the C–H bond of the methyl group had much higher energy barriers. Hence, if the conversion of NMH to nitrosoalkane is catalyzed by a P 450, the reaction should proceed preferentially via H-abstraction, either from the O–H bond or from the N–H bond. Our theoretical analysis of the interaction between the MI and pentacoordinate heme moieties provide...|$|R

Low Temperature Physics, 41 (10), 788 - 800. doi: 10. 1063 / 1. 4932353 Vortex gyrotropic motion in thin ferromagnetic nanodisks of elliptical shape is described {{here for a}} pure vortex state and for a situation with thermal fluctuations. The system is analyzed using numerical simulations of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations, including the demagnetization field calculated with a Green's function approach for thin film problems. At finite temperature the thermalized dynamics is found using a second order Heun algorithm for a magnetic Langevin equation based on the LLG equations. The vortex state is stable only within a limited range of ellipticity, outside of which a quasi-single-domain becomes the preferred minimum energy state. A vortex is found to move in an elliptical potential, whose force constants along the principal axes are determined numerically. The eccentricity of vortex motion {{is directly related to}} the force constants. Elliptical vortex motion <b>is</b> <b>produced</b> <b>spontaneously</b> by thermal fluctuations. The vortex position and velocity distributions in thermal equilibrium are Boltzmann distributions. The results show that vortex motion in elliptical disks can be described by a Thiele equation.
