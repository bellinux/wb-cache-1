60|$|Only see, my dear Kikaccio, to what my thick-and-thin espousal of your genius exposes me at {{the hands}} of an unknown American female. Guileless, stupid, muddled, distracted, well-meaning, but {{slightly}} hypocritical American female!--Don't return, of course, the letter. I haven't seen the little cochonnerie I wrote about you, bothered, preoccupied with other work, more and more incapable of writing that sort of thing gracefully and properly--in the muddle and confusion of my coming abroad; and I hope you haven't, by the trop bons soins of McIlvaine, seen it either. But I bless it in that through arousing the American female my clumsy 'critique' has given me the occasion to salutarvi tutti. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill or in the vale? I give it up, only pressing you all to my bosom wherever you are. Trilby goes on with a life and charm and loveability that gild the whole day one reads her. It's most delightfully and vividly talked! And then drawn!--no, it isn't fair. Well, I'm in Venice and you're not--so you've not got quite everything. It has been cold and wet; but Italy is always Italy--and the only thing really to be depended on quand même. I hope you have not returned to Hampstead, if you have returned, without tying your legs somewhere or other to Bayswater. I hope that everything has been well with you all--you yourself most well. It makes me homesick to write to you--but it {{is the only thing that}} does. I trust fame and flattery and flowers flow in upon you with the revolving Harpers.... Write me a word--tell me you don't hate me. I seem to remember rather disagreeably what I wrote about you.|$|E
