Jaffe had quit his job at RKO Pictures to make the film. Hays summoned the pair to his office <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cease production as they were causing needless headaches for the studios. Germany had threatened to seize all the properties of the Hollywood producers in Germany and ban the import of any future American films.|$|E

On December 22, 1769, a fellow hunter and he were captured by {{a party of}} Shawnees, who confiscated all of their skins <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> leave and never return. The Shawnees had not signed the Stanwix treaty, and since they regarded Kentucky as their hunting ground, they considered white hunters there to be poachers. Boone, however, continued hunting and exploring Kentucky until his return to North Carolina in 1771, and returned to hunt there again {{in the autumn of}} 1772.|$|E

He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water.

In response, the camp's commander arranged to have the leaders of the protest, three men, removed to Fort Stanton, which also housed enemy aliens.

Uwilingiyimana's house was further guarded by five Ghanaian U.N. troops, who were stationed outside. Inside the house, the family was protected by the Rwandan presidential guard, but between 6:55 and 7:15 am the presidential guard surrounded the U.N. troops <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> lay down their arms.

In her hand she claimed to have a telegram from President Harding offering to work to end the private police in West Virginia if they returned home. When Keeney demanded to see the telegram and Mother Jones refused he denounced her as a ‘fake’. Because she refused to show anyone the telegram she was suspected of having fabricated the story. Mother Jones not only refused to allow anyone to read the document, the President’s secretary denied ever having sent one. After she fled the camp she reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown.|$|E

25|$|When the United States became {{involved}} in World War II, many families of Japanese descent were moved from San Diego and other West Coast cities to internment camps in Arizona and other inland locations. Many of these Japanese-American children were patrons of the library. Breed noticed that before the children {{were sent to the}} camps, their behavior and manners had changed; the formerly outgoing and enthusiastic learners had become sullen and withdrawn. When the day came for the children's departure, many of them came to the library to return their library cards and to say goodbye to Breed. She gave the children self-addressed stamped postcards <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> write to her and to tell her what they needed.

25|$|Efforts to {{calm the}} crowd were made by Azerbaijani figures such as {{secretary}} of the city party committee Bayramova and poet Bakhtiyar Vahabzadeh, who addressed the crowd atop a platform. V. Huseinov, the director of the Institute of Political Education in Azerbaijan, also attempted {{to calm the}}m by assuring them that Karabakh would remain within the republic and that the refugees stories were false. He in turn was heckled with insults and forced to step down. Jahangir Muslimzade, Sumgait's first secretary, spoke to the crowd, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> allow Armenians to leave of their own accord. But according to witnesses, this message served to agitate the crowd. Shortly after his speech, at around 6:30 pm, Muslimzade was handed a flag of the Azerbaijan SSR and soon found himself leading the crowd. According to Muslimzade, he was attempting to lead the crowd away from the Armenian district and toward the sea, but many Armenians saw this act as implicating him as a leader of the riot. The crowd, in any case, dispersed and several groups made for the Armenian district.|$|E
25|$|Zaken, in {{the second}} tank, tried to reach his company commanders on the radio, but got no reply. He called the crewmen and told and learned {{that many of the}} commanders were either dead or wounded. He told them to keep moving {{to get out of the}} ambush and fire all weapons. The {{battalion}} made it to the square at the end of the streets and lined up facing the sources of fire. One tank commander Captain Menashe Goldblatt, who had been hit in the shoulder and lost his consciousness, recovered and was asked by Zaken to go from tank to tank and talk to the crews. He found that many of the commanders were either dead or wounded, and that many of the men were in shock. He appointed gunners and loaders as tank commanders, assigned them fire sectors <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> switch their radio frequency from the company frequency to the battalion frequency so that they could speak directly to Zaken. One tank commander was not wounded but refused to take his head out of the turret and Goldblatt warned him that he would personally fire a shell at him if he didn't start functioning.|$|E

When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{mentions}} that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons {{as they had}} been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.|$|E
