Developed in the 1960s to assess 'willpower' and self-control in preschoolers, the marshmallow test consists of placing a single marshmallow in front of a child and informing them that they will be left <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> for some duration. The child is told that if the marshmallow remains uneaten when the experimenter returns, they will be awarded a second marshmallow, both of which can then be eaten.|$|E
25|$|Doug Walters {{went to the}} wicket when Australia's total {{stood at}} 4/192 just before tea and played his shots to such telling effect that, by the time stumps arrived, he had scored 103...He opened the dressing-room door, expecting a flood of {{congratulations}} from his fellow players on the brilliance of his stroke play. His team mates, however, had anticipated Walters' expectations and were hidden in the shower room. Ian Chappell, the Aussie skipper, was <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> hunched over a newspaper crossword. Chappell looked up as Walters entered, well ahead of his fellow batsmen. 'What {{the hell are you}} doing back here? I told you not to get out tonight'...|$|E

He said that the fellow was spying round as a {{preliminary}} move. To-day he trumps up an obviously false excuse for getting into the house. Was he left <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> at all?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want no thanks," [...] he answered, almost roughly. [...] "I want to {{know that}} I was {{justified}} in what I did.

25|$|Following {{an intense}} quarrel over her behavior, Piaf left Louis Dupont (Marcelle's father) taking Mômone and Marcelle with her. The three {{stayed at the}} Hôtel Au Clair de Lune, Rue André-Antoine. During this time, Marcelle was often left <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> while Piaf and Mômone {{were out on the}} streets or at the club singing. Dupont {{eventually}} came and took Marcelle away, saying that if Édith wanted the child, she must come home. Like her own mother, Piaf decided not to come home, though she did pay for childcare. Marcelle died of meningitis at age two. It is rumored that Piaf slept with a man to pay for Marcelle's funeral.|$|E
25|$|The bullet {{which killed}} Chevenix hit the gong (as {{the door to}} the study was open), which made Susan think that she heard the first gong (dinner was usually served after the valet would strike the gong 2 times), and it was Ms Lingard who smashed the mirror and made the whole affair look like suicide. She blew a paper bag to fake a shot. Poirot claims to suspect Ruth because he {{suspected}} Ms Lingard would rescue her daughter and confess, and he had no evidence against Ms Lingard. After everyone leaves and Ms Lingard stays <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> she asks Poirot not to tell Ruth that she is her real mother. Poirot agrees as Ms Lingard is terminally ill, and does not reveal anything to Ruth who wonders why Ms Lingard committed the murder.|$|E
25|$|In this book, Draco is, for {{the first}} time since being {{introduced}} in the series, portrayed as having considerable initiative, ingenuity, and perseverance. However, unlike Harry, who always relies on his friends' support and help, Draco mostly works <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> of Requirement, refusing to confide in or involve his own circle of friends, whom he treats more as underlings. This, and the realisation of what he is ultimately expected to do, nearly drives him to a nervous breakdown. When Harry walks in on Malfoy crying in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, Draco attempts to cast the Cruciatus Curse. Harry is faster to the draw with an obscure Sectumsempra spell that he learned from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince's book. The spell cuts deep gashes into Malfoy's face and chest, resulting in severe blood loss. Snape, alerted by Myrtle's screams, swiftly arrives and heals Draco's cuts, then takes him to the hospital wing.|$|E

500|$|Adiseshan and {{the police}} order Sivaji to unlock his laptop. When Sivaji refuses, Adiseshan assaults him, leaving him for dead. To cover this up, Adiseshan {{and the police}} organise for thugs to shoot at the police van that will carry Sivaji's body, making it look like murder by a third party. Sivaji, however, is faking; he was {{informed}} of the plans to kill him by a sympathetic police constable prior to the interrogation. Left <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> he electrifies himself. Sivaji's friend Dr. Chezhian, Tamizhselvi and Arivu intercept the police van after being informed by Sivaji through a MMS and replace Sivaji's body with a dummy before the thugs open fire. While everyone thinks that Sivaji is dead, Chezhian revives him using a defibrillator. Following Sivaji's [...] "death", Adiseshan and the CBI still try to open Sivaji's laptop by trying to fool the voice-detection program; they fail and all the data in the laptop is erased.|$|E

The clip was filmed in an abandoned warehouse or a polygon where the inside temperature was of 6°C. About the video, Stan particularly confessed that [...] " [...] is very dinamic and colored, {{the way that the}} life of a pop artist looks like." [...] The clip commences with Stan standing on a pickup, with fellow background dancers being present inside the car. Following their leaving, she looks from above at a partying crowd in a hall, which appears to be halfway filled with water, while sporting pink and red clothing. Subsequently, Stan is displayed dressing a pink fur coat and pants, while walking in the surroundings and finally discovering Mohombi. Following this, he provides his singing part when flirting with Stan, with her dancing around him. Following this, the crowd is once again shown dancing together to the song, and the clip closes with Stan being left <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Scenes interspersed through the main video show her posing in front of a blue wall or her lying atop the pickup car, with her head being placed on a golden purse.
