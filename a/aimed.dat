40|$|Recently we have {{demonstrated}} that anthocyanins from fruits of Vitis coignetiae Pulliat (<b>AIMs)</b> have anticancer effects. Here, we investigate the effects of <b>AIMs</b> on cell proliferation and invasion as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which {{have been linked to}} cancer metastasis in human uterine cervical cancer HeLa cells. <b>AIMs</b> inhibited the invasion of HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner. <b>AIMs</b> inhibited MMP- 9 expression in a dose-dependent manner. <b>AIMs</b> inhibited the motility of HeLa cells in a wound healing test. <b>AIMs</b> still suppressed NF-κB activation induced by TNF. <b>AIMs</b> also inhibited EMT in HeLa cells. <b>AIMs</b> suppressed vimentin, N-cadherin, and β-catenin expression and induced E-cadherin. <b>AIMs</b> also suppressed expression of β-catenin and Snail, which was regulated by GSK- 3. These effects of <b>AIMs</b> were also limited in the HeLa cells treated with TNF. In conclusion, this study indicates that <b>AIMs</b> have anticancer effects by suppressing NF-κB-regulated genes and EMT, which relates to suppression of IκBα phosphorylation and GSK- 3 activity, respectively. However, the effects of <b>AIMs</b> were attenuated in the TNF-high condition...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe mouse macrophage-derived {{apoptosis}} inhibitor of macrophage (<b>AIM),</b> {{which is}} incorporated into adipocytes and induces lipolysis by suppressing fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity, possesses three potential N-glycosylation sites. Inactivation of N-glycosylation sites revealed that mouse <b>AIM</b> contains two N-glycans {{in the first}} and second scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains, and that depletion of N-glycans decreased <b>AIM</b> secretion from producing cells. Interestingly, the lack of N-glycans increased <b>AIM</b> lipolytic activity through enhancing <b>AIM</b> incorporation into adipocytes. Although human <b>AIM</b> contains no N-glycan, attachment of N-glycans increased <b>AIM</b> secretion. Thus, the N-glycosylation plays important roles in the secretion and lipolytic function of <b>AIM.</b> Structured summary of protein interactionsAIM physically interacts with FAS by anti tag coimmunoprecipitation (View interaction...|$|R
