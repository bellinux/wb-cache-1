50|$|<b>Acetryptine</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} W-2965-A), {{also known as}} 5-acetyltryptamine (5-AT), is a drug {{described}} as an antihypertensive agent which was never marketed. Structurally, <b>acetryptine</b> is a substituted tryptamine, and {{is closely related to}} other substituted tryptamines like serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). It was developed in the early 1960s. The binding of <b>acetryptine</b> to serotonin receptors {{does not seem to have}} been well-investigated, although it was assessed at the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D receptors and found to bind to them with high affinity. The drug may also act as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI); specifically, as an inhibitor of MAO-A.|$|E
