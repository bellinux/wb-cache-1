5|$|On 19 May 2008, Sabina was {{released}} from court without a full psychiatric evaluation having pleaded guilty to trespass on the motorway and hitting a police officer. The court sentenced her to one day in custody which she had been deemed to have served having spent a full night in police custody. Leaving court she began to wander the streets of Stoke-on-Trent, seemingly attempting to reach her sister in hospital, carrying her possessions in <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> bag given to her by police.|$|E
5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.|$|E

50|$|Cars {{supplied}} to Yonezawa {{appeared in a}} blue box with {{a photo of the}} model (NSU Club 2010). Normal Sablon Cars also appeared in <b>a</b> rather strange <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> carriage with open sides and the model being supported within the <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> on <b>a</b> piece of cardboard. This whole assembly was put into an unmarked cardboard box. Others were in <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> flexible <b>plastic</b> container.|$|R

25|$|Jo-Han promo boxes took {{a variety}} of forms. One of the most often seen in the early 1960s was a red, white and blue striped box with <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> window {{in the shape of}} a car body. Later, X-El Products boxes, like later MPC ones, were simple white boxes with names stamped on the end flaps.|$|E
25|$|British {{military}} helicopters {{flew over}} the crash site, pointing out large pieces of wreckage to the search parties. Private helicopters, equipped with thermographic cameras, were drafted in to survey the heavily wooded areas surrounding Lockerbie. Within hours of the crash, photographs of the area taken by a French satellite were delivered to the investigators. High-resolution photographs from spy satellites were also provided by the United States Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Every item picked up was tagged, placed in <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> bag, labelled and taken to the gymnasium of a local school, where everything was X-rayed and checked for explosive residue with a gas chromatograph, after which the information was entered into the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System.|$|E
25|$|Some bands use small notebooks, {{also known}} as a dot book or drill book, which they hang about their necks, on the drum harness, or around the waist. These contain pages of drill charts, which often either give a picture or list {{coordinates}} that band members use to find 'pages' or 'sets' on the field. Coordinates are normally listed in 8-to-5 steps off the front sideline and front and back hashes, along with the number of 8-5 steps off of the yardline listed on each page. Some bands are even using small plastic pouches that hang about their neck on an adjustable strap, which has a zipper pocket for holding drill, flags to mark sets, and a pencil. There is also <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> window in front to display the current part of drill being worked on at that point in time.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of an}} {{endoscope}} {{to release}} the carpal tunnel was first described in 1989 by Okutsu et al. Here <b>a</b> flexible <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> tube was used with a standard endoscope to identify the transverse carpal ligament and release it with a retrograde knife.|$|R

5000|$|The club promo CD is {{a limited}} edition of 300 (making it the rarest of any Soundgarden release) and was {{packaged}} in <b>a</b> <b>clear,</b> soft <b>plastic</b> sleeve sealed with a large red sticker that doubles as the [...] "liner notes".|$|R
500|$|As part of Record Store Day 2014 a 12" [...] picture disc of the US Mix of {{the album}} was released. Side A {{featured}} a mix of the Revol cover overlaid with the Jesus image from the CD. Side B was a white label image. The album was housed in <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> sleeve. 1500 copies were pressed.|$|E
500|$|The lyric [...] "shake {{it like a}} Polaroid picture", {{along with}} the song's {{commercial}} success, helped to revitalize the Polaroid Corporation. Because current Polaroid film is sealed behind <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> window, casually waving the picture {{has no effect on}} the film's development. Vigorously shaking the film may actually distort the image by causing the film to separate prematurely and creating blobs in the final image. Nevertheless, Polaroid sought to capitalize on the allusion, hiring Ryan Berger of the Euro RSCG advertising agency. Polaroid sponsored parties for OutKast, where Euro RSCG distributed Polaroid cameras.|$|E
500|$|By 1985 {{the band}} were playing {{regularly}} around Melbourne and soon released a 10-track demo composed of selections from their recordings followed by their début single, [...] "Defecate on My Face" [...] (1986), a 7" [...] vinyl record packaged in a 12" [...] sleeve with all four sides glued shut. This song {{is also found}} (but is unlisted) on the EP Form and Meaning Reach Ultimate Communion as a country version. Their next single, [...] "40 Years – Then Death" [...] (1987), was released on transparent vinyl in <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> sleeve with no cover art or labels. This Is Serious Mum's first radio-friendly single, despite the obscure packaging, was received well.|$|E

The police made an appeal to retailers who may have sold five or more in the time period.|$|R

50|$|Close {{contact with}} an {{enclosed}} inert gas is lethal, but released into the open air, it quickly disperses, and is safe for others. It is neither flammable nor explosive. Humphry's book describes close contact with the gas achieved by enclosing the head in <b>a</b> strong, <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> bag, secured around the neck, with the inert gas fed into the bag by plastic tubing.|$|R
500|$|The {{packaging}} {{was praised}} by PopMatters, {{insisting that the}} box set is [...] "very nicely packaged, in a swanky fold-out digipak with <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> slipcase. The 72-page accompanying booklet is outstanding, with extensive liner notes, loads of photos, and many memories from the band members." [...] USA Today related: [...] " [...] {{a combination of the}} metal grinders' best-known tracks, with live and studio rarities plus 17 DVD selections. A deluxe edition ($100) adds a live disc and a few souvenir extras." [...] Soundtrack to the Apocalypse was produced by Matt Hyde, Dino Paredes, Rick Rubin, D. Sardy, and Andy Wallace and was executively produced by Nick John and Rick Sales. The film on the fourth disc was directed by Di Puglia, Gerard. The set includes many Slayer tracks since 1986 with several rarities and b-sides, and includes a remastered DVD of live performances spanning 20 years. A fifth disc was released with fourteen more tracks than the set's standard edition. The bonus live tracks were recorded at The Grove In Anaheim, California, on May 2, 2002, several months following the return of original drummer Dave Lombardo. The extra tracks are packaged in a [...] "blood pack" [...] sleeve, which is decorated with faux blood and skulls.|$|E
500|$|The 1953 {{season began}} with a 27–0 win over the Green Bay Packers in which Graham passed for 292yards and ran for two touchdowns. It {{was the first of}} 11 {{straight}} victories for the Browns, whose only loss came in the final game of the season to the Philadelphia Eagles. Near {{the end of the season}} in a game against the 49ers, Graham took a forearm to the face from Art Michalik that opened a gash on his chin requiring 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> face mask, and he came back into the game; the injury helped inspire the development of the modern face mask. Despite an 11–1 record, Cleveland lost in the championship game for the third year in a row, falling to the Detroit Lions 17–16. Two of Graham's passes were intercepted. He said after the game that he wanted to [...] "jump off a building" [...] for letting his teammates down. [...] "I was the main factor in losing", he said. [...] "If I had played my usual game, we would have won." [...] Still, Graham finished the season as the NFL's leading passer and again won the Most Valuable Player award.|$|E

2500|$|A {{compact disc}} {{comprises}} a 120nbsp&mm aluminized disc coated with <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> coating, with spiral track, approximately 5nbsp&km in length, which is optically scanned by a laser of wavelength ~0.8 μm, {{at a constant}} speed of ~1.25nbsp&m/s. [...] For achieving this constant speed, rotation of the disc is varied from ~8 rev/s while scanning at the inner portion of the track to ~3.5 rev/s at the outer portion. [...] Pits and lands are the depressions (0.12 μm deep) and flat segments constituting the binary data along the track (0.6 μm width).|$|E
2500|$|In a {{move away}} from the bold colors of the iMac and in a return to the styling of the {{traditional}} mouse design, in 2000 Apple discontinued the USB mouse and introduced the all-black Pro Mouse. A similar design to the ADB II mouse, the black Apple Pro Mouse was surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> shell. After taking years of criticism for their continuation of the one-button mouse, Apple effectively flipped the design of a [...] "normal" [...] mouse upside-down, with the sleekly featureless appearance that resulted inspiring its jocular appellation as [...] "the first 0-button mouse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{models of}} IBM Executives and Selectrics {{replaced}} inked fabric ribbons with [...] "carbon film" [...] ribbons {{that had a}} dry black or colored powder on <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> tape. These could be used only once, but later models used a cartridge that was simple to replace. A side effect of this technology was that the text typed on the machine could be easily read from the used ribbon, raising issues where the machines were used for preparing classified documents (ribbons had to be accounted for to ensure that typists did not carry them from the facility).|$|E

2500|$|At 3:14p.m., Gelhaus fired eight {{shots at}} Lopez from his department-issued 9mm handgun. The deputies {{broadcast}} [...] "shots fired" [...] to dispatch at 3:14:17p.m., indicating the total time from initial contact {{to the shooting}} was seventeen seconds. Seven bullets hit Andy within six seconds. Two of the shots delivered fatal wounds, with one round hitting Lopez on his side while he was turning to face the police, at least four entering from the rear, according to an autopsy. The deputies then immediately handcuffed Lopez. When Lopez was searched after the shooting, he was also found to have <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> pistol in his waistband. He was pronounced dead on the scene. Lopez {{was found to be}} under the influence of marijuana after an autopsy.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, in a November 15, 1953 {{game against}} the 49ers, Otto Graham took an elbow from linebacker Art Michalik that put a gash on his face {{requiring}} 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> mask and he was sent back on the field. While the use of face masks was not unheard-of – Y.A. Tittle was using one that season as he nursed a fractured cheekbone – the injury contributed to their development. Brown is often credited with inventing and patenting the single-bar face mask. Riddell, a sports equipment manufacturer, claims the [...] "bar tubular" [...] mask was invented by G.E. Morgan for Graham in 1955, although {{by the end of}} that year many players were already wearing some form of face protection.|$|E
2500|$|Pucci {{would end}} up {{designing}} six complete collections for Braniff hostesses, pilots and ground crew between 1965 and 1974. A mark of his impact was that by 1968 Barbie had versions of all of his first four uniforms. These avant-garde creations were designed as individual components to be added or removed as weather dictated. The uniforms included turtlenecks, T-shirts, crop jackets, and culottes. Among the more unusual innovations was a [...] "bubble helmet" [...] – <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> hood worn by flight attendants between terminal building and aircraft to protect their hairdos from rain and the blast of jet engines. There were two designs of the [...] "bubble helmet" [...] that was dubbed RainDome by Braniff and Bola and Space Helmet by Emilio Pucci. [...] The first edition, called a Bola, was a zippered version that ran {{down the center of}} the helmet and the second was a snap together version in place of the zipper called Space Helmet. Pucci incorporated Girard's [...] "BI" [...] logo into some of his prints.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{built its}} own {{multi-track}} magnetic storage device, the VidiLoop, {{based on a}} two-foot loop of computer tape in <b>a</b> thick <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> housing. On the Chiron I, it was used solely for title storage. It was also used on a few early Chiron IIs, but due to increased storage requirements it was replaced by Shugart SA901 8" [...] floppy drives {{as soon as they}} were available.|$|R

The pasta is set in a drying tank under specific conditions of heat, moisture, and time {{depending on the type of}} pasta. The dried pasta is then packaged: Fresh pasta is sealed in <b>a</b> <b>clear,</b> airtight <b>plastic</b> container with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> or cardboard packages.|$|R
