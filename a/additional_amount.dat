It has a radius more than double that of Earth, but a higher density, suggesting a mainly rocky composition with around 5–20% ices by mass.

5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the <b>additional</b> <b>amount</b> is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E

A total of NOK 451 million was invested, but was 'geared' by borrowing an <b>additional</b> <b>amount</b> corresponding to ten times the investment, so that - in reality - the municipalities were actually investing between NOK 4 and 5 billion.

25|$|Aerobic diving {{capacity}} {{is limited by}} available oxygen and {{the rate at which}} it is consumed. Diving mammals and birds have a considerably greater blood volume than terrestrial animals of similar size, and in addition have a far greater concentration of haemoglobin and myoglobin, and this haemoglobin and myoglobin is also capable of carrying a higher oxygen load. During diving, the haematocrit and haemoglobin are temporarily increased by reflex splenic contraction, which discharges a large <b>additional</b> <b>amount</b> of red blood cells. The brain tissue of diving mammals also contains higher levels of neuroglobin and cytoglobin than terrestrial animals.|$|E
25|$|Introducing {{the term}} 'low entropy' for {{valuable}} natural resources, and the term 'high entropy' for valueless waste and pollution, Georgescu explains {{that all the}} economic process does from a physical {{point of view is}} to irreversibly transform low entropy into high entropy, thereby providing a flow of natural resources for people to live on. The irreversibility of this economic process is the reason why natural resources are scarce: Recycling of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources plus an <b>additional</b> <b>amount</b> of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as waste heat (according to the entropy law).|$|E
