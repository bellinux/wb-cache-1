Most streams in the Rondout Creek basin left damage due to fast-moving waters, including heavy damage near Ellenville. Damage in New York was largely limited {{to an area}} between Port Jervis and Poughkeepsie. Several bridges were destroyed along the Bash Bish Brook, and portions of U.S. Route 209 were flooded.

5|$|Interacting {{with the}} monsoon, Linfa brought heavy {{rainfall}} {{across much of}} the Philippines for several days, causing flooding and landslides that resulted in traffic accidents and power outages. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198houses and destroyed another seven, causing ₱214.6 million ($4.8 million USD) in damage. The storm briefly threatened Taiwan, prompting warnings and restricted ferry travel. Over China, Linfa produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds that wrecked 288homes.

5|$|Taking {{a similar}} path to Hurricane Fifi four years prior, Greta {{threatened}} {{to reproduce the}} devastating effects of the catastrophic storm; however, damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared. In Honduras, about 1,200homes were damaged, about half of which in towns along the coastline. The storm damaged about 75% of the houses on Roatán along the offshore Bay Islands, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> death in the country. In the Belize Barrier Reef, Greta downed trees and produced high waves, while on the mainland, there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge. In Dangriga where it made landfall, the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125houses and the primary hospital. In Belize City, a tornado flipped over a truck and damaged four houses. Damage in Belize was estimated at $25million (1978USD), and there were four deaths.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not making}} {{landfall}} on North Carolina, its {{close proximity to}} land caused extensive damage across the US East Coast. Strong winds resulted in widespread power outages, cutting telecommunications along the coast. A weather station in Wilmington, North Carolina reported a wind gust of 135mph (215km/h), setting a new record for fastest wind gust reported there. Though mostly concentrated in North Carolina, rainfall was widespread, reaching {{as far north as}} Maine. In the United States, damages reached $11.2million <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> indirect death. After impacting the US, Helene produced strong winds and heavy rain across much of Atlantic Canada. In Cape Breton Island on Nova Scotia, the storm was considered the worst in at least 21years. Power outages cut most communications from the island to the mainland, and property damage in Sydney, Nova Scotia totaled to C$100,000. At Helene's landfall in Newfoundland, strong gusts peaking at 82mph (132km/h) in Naval Station Argentia were reported, and loss of power severed communications. Damage across there totaled to at least C$100,000. Total damages associated with Helene in the United States and Canada amounted to $11.4million, making Helene the costliest storm of the season.|$|E
5|$|While {{paralleling}} {{the southeastern}} United States, Helene produced a peak storm surge of 6ft (1.8m) near Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina. A station in Wilmington reported sustained winds of 88mph (142km/h) and a peak gust of 135mph (220km/h), exceeding {{the previous record}} for measured wind speed there by a wide margin. At Cape Fear, winds were estimated at 125mph (200km/h), with gusts as high as 160mph (260km/h). Rainfall from Helene peaked at 8.29in (211mm) in Wilmington International Airport, although rainfall spread {{as far north as}} New England.

The Act also permitted a branch to the proposed Inverness & Perth Junction Railway at Grantown-on-Spey.
