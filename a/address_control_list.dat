40|$|A {{significant}} component representing {{network security}} is access <b>control</b> <b>list</b> inspects values of every packet’s field {{and come to}} a decision how to implement the network policy. Real-life access <b>control</b> <b>list</b> are naturally four dimensional over fields of four packets such as: IP address of source, destination, port number of destination and type of protocol. In several access <b>control</b> <b>list,</b> the source and destination port number fields make use of a range field constraint while the internet protocol address of source and destination and protocol type fields make use of a prefix or else ternary field constraint. Compression of access <b>control</b> <b>lists</b> is functional for system management of network and optimization for the reason that diminishing large access <b>control</b> <b>lists</b> rule sets to a great extent reduces the difficulty of supervising and optimizing configurations of network. Due to an augment in Internet applications besides enhancement in identified vulnerabilities and attacks, compression <b>lists</b> of access <b>control</b> may perhaps sanction users with outsized access <b>control</b> <b>lists</b> to make use of such devices and moreover this may develop into an increasingly critical concern intended for several users. An algorithm of polynomial time optimal was proposed for the weighted one-dimensional prefix compression problem of Access <b>control</b> <b>lists</b> by means of dynamic programming...|$|R
40|$|Some {{problems}} in configurations of network devices {{are difficult to}} identify. Access <b>control</b> <b>lists</b> present {{an important part of}} many configurations. Conflicts among rules of an access <b>control</b> <b>list</b> can cause holes in security policy or quality of service. In this paper we focus on identifying and classifying conflicts among rules of an access <b>control</b> <b>list.</b> Discovering all possible types of conflicts is not a trivial task. We present optimized algorithm for complete access <b>control</b> <b>list</b> analysis using tries, based on existing research by Baboescu and Varghese. The tool for detecting conflicts among access <b>control</b> <b>list</b> rules of one given Cisco, HP or Juniper device using tries based algorithm has been implemented. Bit vectors in tries use WAH compression method to reduce memory consumption. Implemented tool was tested for correctness and performance. The hypothesis that this solution would make the analysis of access lists significantly faster has been proven...|$|R

50|$|On {{some types}} of {{proprietary}} computer-hardware (in particular routers and switches), an access <b>control</b> <b>list</b> provides rules that are applied to port numbers or IP addresses that are available on a host or other layer 3, each {{with a list of}} hosts and/or networks permitted to use the service. Although it is additionally possible to configure access <b>control</b> <b>lists</b> based on network domain names, this is a questionable idea because individual TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers do not contain domain names. Consequently, the device enforcing the access <b>control</b> <b>list</b> must separately resolve names to numeric addresses. This presents an additional attack surface for an attacker who is seeking to compromise security of the system which the access <b>control</b> <b>list</b> is protecting. Both individual servers as well as routers can have network ACLs. Access <b>control</b> <b>lists</b> can generally be configured to control both inbound and outbound traffic, and in this context they are similar to firewalls. Like firewalls, ACLs could be subject to security regulations and standards such as PCI DSS.|$|R
