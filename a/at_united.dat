5|$|In May 1906, {{while still}} serving his ban, Meredith moved to Manchester United. He joined on a free {{transfer}} {{and received a}} £500 signing-on fee from United; Manchester City reluctantly accepted the transfer as they had previously signed an undertaking promising Meredith a benefit match, and {{he was willing to}} forego on the agreement if the club instead granted his transfer.

5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music was the 18th overall LP Charles had recorded.

The other half was recorded on February 15 of that same year <b>at</b> <b>United</b> Recording Studios in Hollywood, California.
