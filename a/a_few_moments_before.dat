25|$|Bryant {{then went}} to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the self loading rifle. He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and sat there for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>before</b> getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E
25|$|On July 18, 2006, Varitek {{played his}} 991st game at catcher for the Boston Red Sox, {{breaking}} Carlton Fisk's club record. That game was a home game vs. Kansas City, during which Varitek's achievement was recognized before {{the bottom of}} the 5th inning (after the game was official and couldn't be cancelled due to weather). Varitek received a standing ovation from the sellout crowd at Fenway Park for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>before</b> play resumed. On July 31, 2006, Varitek was injured rounding the bases in a 9–8 victory over the Cleveland Indians (his 1000th career game as catcher), but said he believed the initial injury to the knee occurred while he was blocking home plate to make the tag against the Angels Mike Napoli on July 29, 2006. He had surgery on August 3, 2006, to repair torn cartilage in his left knee. Varitek returned to the Red Sox lineup on September 4, following a short rehabilitation assignment in Pawtucket.|$|E

25|$|Day Five (17 March): Much {{rested on}} the {{shoulders}} of Randall and Amiss, but after playing one of his best knocks against Australia, Amiss lost concentration and fell to the part-time medium pace of Chappell for 64. By this time, Randall was well beyond his century, his first in Tests, and looked capable of winning the match if he was well supported at the other end. With his total on 161, Randall was given out to a catch by Marsh, but Marsh indicated that he didn't take the ball cleanly, so the Australians recalled the batsman. After a promising half century partnership with Greig had hauled England to within 117 runs of an improbable victory, Randall fell to a brilliant one handed catch by Cosier from the spin of O'Keeffe. He made 174 off 353 balls in a marathon 446 minutes. With the breach made, Lillee returned to attack the tail and although England continued to fight, the wickets tumbled at regular intervals. Finally, Lillee trapped Alan Knott on the crease with a fast, straight delivery to earn an lbw decision and victory for his country. It took <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>before</b> it was realised that the winning margin of 45 runs was exactly the same as it had been 100 years before. Randall received the man of the match award, ahead of Lillee (who took eleven wickets for the match) and Marsh.|$|E
500|$|The race {{took place}} in the {{afternoon}} from 14:00 CET (UTC+1), in dry and sunny weather. Villeneuve started the race in pole position, with Schumacher in second. Just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>before</b> the start of the race, a blue liquid came out of Villeneuve's Williams. However, this did not influence his car during the race. Schumacher's getaway at the start was better than Villeneuve's and he had taken the lead {{by the time they reached}} the first corner.

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1863, the 1st Kentucky Brigade formed a part of General Braxton Bragg's counteroffensive against Union Major General William Rosecrans in Chattanooga, Tennessee. At 9:30 am on September 20, 1863, the {{divisions}} of Generals Breckinridge and Patrick Cleburne were ordered to move forward. Helm's brigade and the others in Breckinridge's division drove into the Federals' left. General Cleburne's division, which was intended to strike {{near the center of}} the line, was delayed by heavy fire from Union soldiers, leaving the left flank unguarded. Repeated attempts to overwhelm the Federals were in vain, though some of Helm's Kentuckians and Alabamans managed to reach within [...] of the Federal line. In less than an hour of the order given to advance, fully one third of the Orphan Brigade had been lost. While the remainder of Helm's men clashed with the Union line, a sharpshooter from the 15th Kentucky Union Infantry shot Helm in the chest. Bleeding profusely, he remained in the saddle <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>before</b> toppling to the ground. After being carried off the battlefield, Helm's surgeons concluded that his wounds would be fatal. Helm clung to life for several hours. Knowing that his health was deteriorating, he asked who had won the battle. When assured that the Confederates had carried the day, he muttered: [...] "Victory!, Victory!, Victory!". On September 21, 1863, Gen. Helm succumbed to his wounds.|$|E
500|$|At the 48th Grammy Awards, held on February8,2006, Carey was {{nominated}} for eight awards—the most she had ever received in one night. That night, Carey returned to the Grammy stage {{for the first time}} since 1996. Her performance opened with a pre-taped video in which she discussed the importance of God and religion in her life. Carey then came to the stage, dressed in a white Chanel gown, and sang a shortened version of [...] "We Belong Together". Next, Carey's pastor Clarence Keaton read a Bible passage to open Carey's performance of [...] "Fly Like a Bird", as he did in the studio recording of the song. Midway through the song, a black temporary wall was removed, revealing a large choir who joined Carey for the song's gospel climax. The performance earned the night's only standing ovation, prompting Teri Hatcher, who was presenting the next award, to exclaim, [...] "It's like we've all just been saved!" [...] Carey's performance earned rave reviews from critics. Gary Susman from Entertainment Weekly called Carey the [...] "comeback queen", noting that her voice [...] "soar into the rafters like only Carey's can." [...] Carey included [...] "We Belong Together" [...] on both succeeding tours following its release, the Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours. On the former, the song was featured as the encore number, with Carey re-entering the arenas in a form fitting beige evening gown. Backed by three background vocalists, Trey Lorenz, Sherry Tatum, and MaryAnn Tatum, Carey began the song as confetti dropped the arena rafters. According to Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News, the performance was [...] "a major accomplishment", and the highlight of the show, and found Carey re-connect with the audience in ways that she was unable throughout most of the show. Similarly, during her Angel's Advocate Tour, the song was placed as one of the final numbers on the set-list. Dressed in a black Herve Leger gown, Carey introduced the song as the Billboards [...] "song of the decade", and thanked the audience for making it her 16th number-one single in the United States. Following the song's completion, Carey exited the arena for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> <b>before</b> returning to perform [...] "Hero" [...] as the encore.|$|E

2500|$|The US also favoured the Poseidon, {{although}} for more technical reasons. They felt {{that while the}} decoy approach was useful against near-term ABMs deployed by the USSR, that it was considerably less useful against [...] "point defence" [...] type interceptors. This is because the decoys are so much lighter than warheads; when they started to hit the upper atmosphere the decoys would slow more than the warheads and thus [...] "declutter", allowing the warheads to be attacked. This would require a much faster-reacting system than a long-range interceptor, one that could safely wait until only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>before</b> detonation, but this {{was by no means}} impossible and was part of the US's own ABM systems.|$|E
2500|$|... "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" [...] was {{confirmed}} {{to be the}} opener, followed by [...] "Jam", a dance sequence referred to as [...] "The Drill" [...] leading into [...] "They Don't Care About Us", [...] "Human Nature", and [...] "Smooth Criminal". The show would open with a video sequence referred to as [...] "Glimpses and Flashes", followed by a large space suit with video imagery wrapping around it appearing before the audience, referred to as [...] "Light Man". Then, various parts of Light Man would open up to reveal Jackson, who would jump out and stand still for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>before</b> starting the show. The performances of [...] "Smooth Criminal", [...] "Thriller", and [...] "Earth Song" [...] would feature 3D vignettes featuring Jackson, most of which would involve Michael {{coming out of the}} videos and onto the stage. Michael would occasionally replace [...] "Human Nature" [...] and [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] with [...] "Stranger in Moscow" [...] and [...] "You Rock My World", respectively.|$|E

60|$|Lowiny was {{far from}} disagreeable in person, and had the {{advantage}} of being youthful in appearance, as well as in fact.
