The earlier conservative governments had been considered pointedly pro-Israel (especially during the mid-1960s with the Six-Day War), which had resulted in a number of Arab states breaking off diplomatic relations to West Germany.

However, Hopkins' students returned to the Naval Academy the following year, yet again to root against Navy, this time supporting Lehigh.|$|E
40|$|Aims: <b>Attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> {{sexuality}} {{of individuals}} with intellectual disability (ID) {{have the capacity to}} enhance or inhibit the sexual autonomy, safety and psychological well-being {{of individuals with}} ID. Based on recommendations from previous research, this study examined community <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> sexuality of individuals with ID, and the relationship between these attitudes and biological sex. It was expected that females would have more positive attitudes than males. Gender ideology, comprising participant’s <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> appropriate social roles, responsibilities and rights of women and men, was hypothesised to mediate this relationship. Method: Three hundred and three participants responded to abbreviated versions of the Attitudes to Sexuality Questionnaire (Individuals with an Intellectual Disability [ASQ-ID]) and the Hypergender Ideology Scale (HGIS).   Results: Community <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> sexuality of individuals with ID were generally positive.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA), with biological sex as the independent variable and scores on the ASQ-ID as the dependent variable found biological sex differences in attitudes. Males displayed less positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> sexuality of individuals with ID than females. Additionally, paired sample t-tests found differences between <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> men and women with ID, with all participants displaying less positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> women with ID on the sexual rights and non-reproductive sexual behaviours sub-scales. Finally, a multiple hierarchical regression found that gender ideology mediated the relationship between biological sex and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> sexuality of individuals with ID.   Conclusions:  Findings suggest that <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> sexuality of individuals with ID are influenced by gender ideology. Implications for individuals with intellectual disability and for selection of predictor variables in future research are discussed...|$|R

In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> Western powers. Molotov, {{at the direction of}} the Soviet government, condemned the Marshall Plan as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other Eastern Bloc nations, initiated {{what is known as the}} Molotov Plan. The plan created several bilateral relations between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA).|$|E

The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E
5|$|Sing's marksmanship at Gallipoli saw him dubbed 'The Assassin' or 'The Murderer' by his comrades. He {{reportedly}} {{acquired the}} latter nickname {{due to his}} callous <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> enemy. By early September 1915, he had taken 119 kills, according to Brigadier-General Granville Ryrie, commanding officer of the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade. Regimental records list Sing as having taken 150 confirmed kills, but on 23 October 1915, General William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC forces, issued an order complimenting him on his 201 unconfirmed kills. Historian Bob Courtney noted that an official kill was recorded only if the spotter saw the target fall. If the first shot missed the target, it was very risky {{to take a second}} shot, as this could give away the sniper team's position.|$|E

The leadership of the Republika Srpska has opposed this transfer as a loss of autonomy. Bosnia's chances of joining NATO may depend on Serbia's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> alliance, since the leadership of Republika Srpska might be reluctant to go against Serbian interests. In October 2017, the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska passed a nonbinding resolution opposing NATO membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|A leading {{member of}} the Yorkshire team which {{achieved}} {{a high level of}} success in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a fast bowler. Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver off spin in addition to his pace bowling. This proved so effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, his perceived poor <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented him playing more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he broke down in his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the Royal Air Force, he died of pneumonia on active service in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> Jews {{had its roots}} in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding {{in a sense of}} duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over the conduct of the war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E

5|$|Battles are turn-based, with random {{encounters}} {{taking place}} while exploring dungeons. At {{the end of}} a successful battle, experience points, money, and items are obtained. Experience points are shared by Nakajima and Yumiko; by gaining enough experience points, their levels raise, and they are given one ability point each, which can be given to one of five character attributes: strength, intelligence, attack, dexterity, and luck. During battles, the player can try to persuade enemy demons to join them, in exchange for magnetite, money, or items. The player can keep seven demons at a time, of which up to four can be summoned at the same time; summoned demons aid the player in battles with physical and magic attacks, but cost money to summon, and consume magnetite as the player walks around. The demons' <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full. Demons do not level up; instead, the player can create stronger demons by visiting a special location and fusing two of their allied demons together into a new one.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{has eight}} chapters, narrated {{by each of}} the three main {{characters}} in turn. Davidson narrates chapters 1, 4, and 7; Selver narrates chapters 2, 6, and 8; and Lyubov narrates chapters 3 and 5. This alternation emphasizes both the differences between the characters and their isolation within their societies. Lyubov and Davidson's chapters are narrated from a limited omniscient point of view, making their chapters seem like internal monologues. Davidson's belief in the inferiority of the Athsheans and his adversarial <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> planet are directly presented to the reader, along with Lyubov's struggle to do his job dispassionately while following his personal morality. In contrast, Selver's chapters are written from a truly omniscient point of view, allowing Le Guin to give the reader information about the planet and its people. Selver has no extensive monologues; instead, several other Athsheans also feature prominently in his chapters.|$|E
5|$|The scale, and {{associated}} {{high number of}} casualties, of the war produced an entirely new <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> commemoration of war dead. Previous to World War I, individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers. However, the war required mobilisation of {{a significant percentage of}} the population, either as volunteers or through conscription. An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, even if they were low-ranking members of the military. A committee under Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries. Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions. Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses, it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks.|$|E

5|$|Upon death, Avatar Roku was reincarnated and Aang was born, {{and later}} raised by Monk Gyatso, a senior monk at the Southern Air Temple {{and friend of}} the late Avatar Roku. Even prior to {{learning}} he was the Avatar, Aang distinguished himself by {{becoming one of the}} youngest Airbending Masters in history by inventing a new technique. As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples. Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among icebergs, where he remained suspended for a century.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, after {{retiring}} from her NUGMW post, Bondfield founded the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She studied labour {{conditions in the}} United States and Mexico during 1938, and toured the US and Canada after the outbreak of war in 1939, as a lecturer for the British Information Services. Her <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> war was different from her semi-pacifist stance of 1914; she actively supported the government and, in 1941, published a booklet, Why Labour Fights. Her main wartime activity was leading {{an investigation by the}} Hygiene Committee of the Women's Group on Public Welfare, into the problems that arose from the large-scale evacuation into the countryside of city children. The group's findings were published in 1943, as Our Towns: a Close-up; the report gave many people their first understanding of the extent of inner-city poverty. Suggested solutions included nursery education, a minimum wage, child allowances and a national health service. The report was reprinted several times, and was instrumental in developing support for the social reforms introduced by the Labour government that took office in 1945. Among Bondfield's other wartime activities, in 1944 she helped to launch a national drive for the appointment of more women police officers.|$|E
5|$|The report {{calculated}} the costs at 8.7 million kronor which corresponds in today's money to around $70 million (as of 2011), spent over a total construction schedule of one four-year period and two three-year periods. The cost was still considerably {{lower than that}} of many of the recently built or modernised fortifications on the continent; Belgium had spent the equivalent of 62 million kronor on the fortified positions of Liège and Namur along the Meuse while Romania had spent 63 million kronor to strengthen the defence of Bucharest and 16 million kronor on fortifications along the Siret River. In 1899, Rappe proposed to the Riksdagin line with the plans of the Fortification Committeethat construction of already existing fortificatory works in Sweden would commence, while the question on Boden would be postponed to the next year. The plan gained support from the first chamber but not from the second chamber, but when put to a joint vote of both chambers, the proposition passed. Even though the result did not really mean anything concrete for the possible construction in Boden, it was considered a great success for that question as well. During the last years of the century, the Riksdag's general <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> army became more positive, most likely due to the increased Russification of Finland, increased tension in the Union between Sweden and Norway, and rumors that the Russian sawfilers that worked in Sweden also worked for the Okhrana, the secret Russian police.|$|E

In view of this, schools and teachers should be aware of the risk of increasing students’ anxiety when implementing the graduation benchmark requirement.|$|R
