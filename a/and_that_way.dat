500|$|In January 2006, Underoath {{entered the}} studio to record their fifth album, Define the Great Line; the title is {{presented}} upon the theory of an individual having [...] "to find that line <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to live your life." [...] The band had been writing for the album {{two weeks after the}} release of They're Only Chasing Safety. Matt Goldman, who produced albums for Copeland and Norma Jean, and Adam Dutkiewicz, guitarist for Killswitch Engage, enlisted as producers. Chamberlain noted that the vocals for the album would sound less like an imitation of former vocalist Taylor, but more like the vocals of Chamberlain's former band. The lyrics were also meaningful to Chamberlain because they had been written about [...] "things that have molded him into who he is today".|$|E
500|$|Preliminary {{designer}} Dick Scherrer requested possible shapes {{upon which}} he could base his low radar cross-section (RCS) design. He was introduced to Denys Overholser, who recommended an aircraft with flat surfaces. Overholser later recounted his discussion with Sherrer: [...] "When Dick Scherrer asked me ... I said 'Well, it's simple, you just {{make it out of}} flat surfaces, and tilt those flat surfaces over, sweeping the edges away from the radar view angle, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> you basically cause the energy to reflect away from the radar.'" [...] Scherrer subsequently drew a preliminary low-RCS aircraft with faceted surfaces. At the same time, Overholser hired mathematician Bill Schroeder, with whom he had a prior working relationship – in fact, it was Schroeder who trained Overholser on mathematics relating to stealth aircraft. Kenneth Watson was hired as the senior lead aircraft designer.|$|E

500|$|On March 15, 2012, Rihanna {{explained}} her {{collaboration with}} Brown to Ryan Seacrest during his morning show: [...] "The first song that came about was 'Birthday Cake'. I mean, {{we ended up}} recording {{them at the same}} time and executing them together. But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses. Busta Rhymes released his own freestyle to the song along with rapper Reek da Villian.|$|E
500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect for myself <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's always a little bit confusing. The {{best thing to do is}} just to ignore the fact, I think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E

[...] "There was no other (casting) choice" [...] for Mrs. Shaw, said co-producer Jen Small, who had previously worked with Kane on the 1998 PBS film The First Seven Years.

2500|$|According to Richard Pipes, {{violence}} was implicit in Marxism itself. He {{has argued that}} terror inevitably resulted from what Lenin saw as a Marxist belief that human lives are expendable {{in the cause of}} building Communism. He quoted Marx: [...] "The present generation resembles the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It must not only conquer a new world, it must also perish {{in order to make a}} room for the people who are fit for a new world." [...] In 1848 Marx, commenting on a failed Vienna Uprising, wrote: [...] "there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> is revolutionary terror." [...] Edvard Radzinsky noted that Joseph Stalin wrote a nota bene: [...] "Terror is the quickest way to new society" [...] aside of the above quote in Kautsky's book, Terrorism and Communism.|$|E
