His Kanune Raya, or [...] "Code of the Rayas", reformed the law governing levies and taxes to be paid by the rayas, raising their status above serfdom to the extent that Christian serfs would migrate to Turkish territories to benefit from the reforms. The Sultan also played a role in protecting the Jewish subjects of his empire for centuries to come. In late 1553 or 1554, on the suggestion of his favorite doctor and dentist, the Spanish Jew Moses Hamon, the Sultan issued a firman (...) formally denouncing blood libels against the Jews. Furthermore, Suleiman enacted new criminal and police legislation, prescribing a set of fines for specific offenses, as well as reducing the instances requiring death or mutilation. In the area of taxation, taxes were levied on various goods and produce, including animals, mines, profits of trade, and import-export duties.

Without uncertainty, the unilateral investment tax is welfare-neutral: costless but ineffective divestment. With uncertainty, the regional investment choice affects global fuel usage, and correspondingly the optimal regional fuel policy contains a investment tax in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>taxes</b> on deposit supply and consumption. Even absent terms-of-trade effects, the optimal unilateral investment tax is a non-marginal fraction of the perceived climate disutility for a region of any size.

40|$|The {{prices for}} natural gas and {{oil-based}} products have risen significantly in recent years, making it more costly for U. S. -based manufacturers to be profitable and compete globally. A poll taken {{at a recent meeting}} of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) board of directors revealed that 93 percent of directors from small and medium manufacturing companies believe that higher energy prices are having a negative impact on their bottom line. Furthermore, according to a 2006 report from the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the domestic environment for manufacturers is dominated by concerns about rising external costs that make manufacturing from a U. S. base difficult. With the cost of oil at or near historic all-time highs, energy efficiency has quickly moved to top priority when analyzing potential savings in manufacturing facilities. The industrial sector currently accounts for about one-third of all U. S. energy consumption at an annual cost of more than $ 120 billion. NAM says that external outlays related to energy prices (in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>taxes,</b> litigation, health care, and regulation) have added 22. 4 percent to production costs. In addition, according to one analysis, ?deregulation, security concerns, and a fragile transmission infrastructure are increasing energy price volatility, with negative financial impact on some companies. Those that more tightly control and aggressively reduce energy consumption can minimize exposure to such volatility. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on tax assignment in decentralized countries. Ideally, own-source revenues should be sufficient to enable at least the richest subnational governments to finance from their own resources all locally-provided services that primarily benefit local residents. Subnational taxes should also not unduly distort the allocation of resources. Most importantly, {{to the extent possible}} subnational governments should be accountable at the margin for financing the expenditures for which they are responsible. Although reality in most countries inevitably falls far short of these ideals, nonetheless there are several taxes that subnational governments in developing countries could use to help ensure that decentralization yields more of the benefits it appears to promise in theory. At the local level, such taxes include property taxes and, especially for larger cities, perhaps also a limited and well-designed local business tax. At the regional level, in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>taxes</b> on vehicles, governments in some countries may be able to utilize any or all of the following [...] a payroll tax; a simple surcharge on the central personal income tax; and a sales tax, in some cases perhaps taking the form of a well-designed regional value-added tax. The"best"package for any particular country or subnational government is likely to be not only context-specific and path-dependent, but also highly sensitive to the balance struck between different political and economic factors and interests.

40|$|Funding {{for schools}} {{of all kinds}} was largely market-based until the Civil War. Par-ents in New York and other {{northern}} states continued to pay tuition, or rate bills, in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>taxes</b> to support common schools. Previous research relied on aggregate state-level data to estimate the amount of funding from public and nonpublic sources for common schools, while existing case studies of local school practices focus exclu-sively on Massachusetts or on urban locations and thus on exceptions to the rule. This study looks at local practices of school funding for multiple types of schools in one unexceptional rural town in western New York from 1815 to 1850. The results reveal considerable in-state variation {{in the proportion of}} public and private funding for common schools that is otherwise obscured by state-level data. The proportion of school funds that came from tuition was much higher for rural areas than for urban areas. The article also compares tuition funding for common schools with that for other types of market-based schooling, including two local venture schools and one local academy. The results show that, although tuition prices for academies and venture schools were predictably higher than for common schools, the overall structure of school funding for rural common schools and academies was more similar than different in New York in the antebellum era. In 1835, after 20 years of public funding for common schools in New York State, the small town of Lima supported a lively local education market. This market included at least two venture schools operated by independent teach...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis {{is the issue}} of procedure of social security insurance and allowance for state employment policy collection, procedure for debt recovery and securing of claims by all available legal means and evaluation of impacts on social situation of individuals. Social security insurance is, in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>taxes,</b> fees and custom duties, a revenue of state budget. It is based on the solidarity principle: young people help with their payments to the elderly, healthy people help ill people and people in a difficult life situation. The solidarity principle works reliably in all developed countries of the world. By collecting social security insurance, the State creates financial resources for implementation of fundamental social rights, which are guaranteed by international conventions and the Constitution of the Czech Republic, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. The main objective of this thesis is, based on interviews with payers of insurance premiums and document analysis, in the first part to make a survey of impact of recovery of claims in conducted execution proceedings into social situation of clients of District Social Security Administration Office in Strakonice and in the second part to determine to what extent the forced recovery of lawful duty has a share in deterioration of life situation of individuals. To achieve the defined goal I have chosen a method of document analysis, content analysis technique and secondary data analysis. As an additional method I used interviewing, the method of semi-structured interview. In order to obtain as much information about this topic as possible, I used qualitative research to collect primary data. The target group consisted of payers or former payers of insurance premiums who are also debtors of District Social Security Administration Office in Strakonice and whose insurance premium debt and penalty was recovered by administrative or judicial enforcement. Objective of the thesis has been achieved. Results of the research will raise awareness of the studied issues and may be used in practice during operation of executions in the district Social Security Administration offices...|$|E
