The system examined consisted of a main-group <b>alkyl</b> <b>compound</b> (a p block element such as gallium or aluminum) complexed with various organic di-imines.

Our research during January-July, 2006, was geared towards understanding the factors leading to the multi-chromic nature of the complexes. The main possibilities put forth initially considered (a) the chiral nature of the main group metal, (b) possible reduction of the metal to a lower-valent, radical state, (c) the nature of the ligand(s) attached to the main group metal, and (d) possible degradation products of the ligand leading to highly-colored products.

These different linear versus branched perfluoroalkyl/perhydroalkyl thermodynamic property trends between semiempirical and ab initio/DFT methods were evident in both gas and aqueous phase calculations. Comparison of experimentally determined thermodynamic properties for several classes of linear and branched alkanes and alcohols with values calculated at the PM 6 and B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) levels of theory supported the well known findings that such DFT and HF approaches incorrectly predict branched <b>alkyl</b> <b>compounds</b> will be less thermodynamically stable than linear isomers.

40|$|In Chapter One, {{the sodium}} salt of tris (2 -oxo- 1 -t-butylimidazolyl) hydroborate, [To^But]Na, as an [O_ 3] donor ligand has been prepared. The yield for this {{reaction}} was low {{because there is a}} significant amount of side product in which the double bond of the oxoimidazole starting material is reduced. Treatment of sodium borohydride with bezannulated oxoimidazole at high temperature leads to the generation of the {{sodium salt of}} tris (2 -oxo- 1 -R-methylbenimidazolyl) hydroborate in high yield, [To^RBenz]Na. These ligands have been prepared with different alkyl substituents, methyl, t-butyl and adamantyl, to achieve the desired steric environment. Furthermore, these benzannulated ligand have been used to synthesize a series [To^RBenz]Tl complexes, which exist as a discrete mononuclear complexes in the solid state. Finally, [To^RBenz]Tl complexes are more pyramidal than the sulfur counterpart, [Tm^RBenz]Tl, but less pyramidal than those in the tris (pyrazolyl) hydroborato counterpart, [Tp^R,R]]Tl. In Chapter Two, the properties of [To^R] ligands have been evaluated versus related L_ 2 X ligands. [To^R] ligands are substantially more sterically demanding than the corresponding [Tm^R] sulfur donor ligand and related [O_ 3] donor ligands. However, electronically, the [To^R] ligands exhibit weaker electron donating properties than other L_ 2 X type ligands. Finally, the coordination chemistry of [To^R] ligands with various metal compounds has been briefly investigated. The synthesis of a new class of bidentate ligands has been detailed in Chapter Three. Namely the bis(2 -oxo- 1 -t-butylimidazolyl) hydroborato and bis (2 -oxo- 1 -alkylbenzimidazolyl) hydroborato, [Bo^But] and [Bo^RBenz], have been synthesized via the reaction of MBH_ 4 with two equivalents of the respective 2 -imidazolone. Chelation of [Bo^But] and [Bo^MeBenz] to a metal center results in a flexible 8 -membered ring that is capable of adopting a "boat-like" conformation that allows for secondary M—H—B interactions. Chapter Four describes the synthesis of [Bo^RBenz]_ 2 Zr(CH_ 2 Ph) _ 2 and [To^RBenz]Zr(CH_ 2 Ph) _ 3 with different alkyl substituents. Treatment of [To^ButBenz]Zr(CH_ 2 Ph) _ 3 with ([PhNHMe_ 2][B{C_ 6 F_ 5 }_ 4]) in a coordinating solvent, Et_ 2 O, generates {[To^ButBenz]Zr(CH 2 Ph) _ 2 (OEt_ 2) }{B(C_ 6 F_ 5) _ 4 } which exhibit a very low activity for ethylene polymerization. However, a coordinatively unsaturated cationic zirconium alkyl complex was obtained by the treatment of ([PhNHMe_ 2][B{C_ 6 F_ 5 }_ 4]) with [To^ButBenz]Zr(CH_ 2 Ph) _ 3 or [To^AdBenz]Zr(CH_ 2 Ph) _ 3 which generate [To^ButBenz]Zr(CH_ 2 Ph) _ 2 [B(C_ 6 F_ 5) _ 4 or [To^AdBenz]Zr(CH_ 2 Ph) _ 2 [B(C_ 6 F_ 5) _ 4], respectively. Moderate activity for ethylene polymerization was obtained for t-butyl while high activity was obtained for the adamantyl derivatives. Finally, Chapter Five describes the synthesis of new oxygen-rich ligands, namely tris (2 -pyridonyl) methane, [Tpom^R]H. They are obtained via the reaction of 2 -pyridones with CHX_ 3 and K_ 2 CO_ 3 in the presence of [Bu^n _ 4 N]Br, followed by acid-catalyzed isomerization with camphorsulfonic acid. These compounds provide access to a new class of L_ 3 X alkyl ligands that feature oxygen donors and are capable of forming metallacarbatranes, as exemplified by [Κ^ 4 -Tpom^But]ZnOC 6 H 4 Bu^t.
