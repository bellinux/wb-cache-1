40|$|BACKGROUND: Challenges {{remain to}} find ways to support {{patients}} with depression who have low levels of physical activity (PA) to overcome perceived barriers and enhance the perceived value of PA for preventing future relapse. There is an evidence-base for behavioural activation (BA) for depression, which focuses on supporting patients to restore activities that have been avoided, but practitioners have no specific training in promoting PA. We aimed to design and evaluate an integrated BA and PA (BAcPAc) practitioner-led, written, self-help intervention to enhance both physical and mental health. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is informed by the Medical Research Council Complex Intervention Framework and describes a protocol for a pilot phase II randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the feasibility and acceptability of the trial methods to inform a definitive phase III RCT. Following development of the <b>augmented</b> <b>written</b> self-help intervention (BAcPAc) incorporating behavioural activation with physical activity promotion, depressed adults are randomised to receive up to 12 sessions over a maximum of 4  months of either BAcPAc or behavioural activation alone within a written self-help format, which represents treatment as usual. The study is located within two 'Improving Access to Psychological Therapies' services in South West England, with both written self-help interventions supported by mental health paraprofessionals. Measures assessed at 4, 9, and 12  month follow-up include the following: CIS-R, PHQ- 9, accelerometer recorded (4  months only) and self-reported PA, body mass index, blood pressure, Insomnia Severity Index, quality of life, and health and social care service use. Process evaluation will include analysis of recorded support sessions and patient and practitioner interviews. At the time of writing the study has recruited 60 patients. DISCUSSION: The feasibility outcomes will inform a definitive RCT to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the <b>augmented</b> BAcPAc <b>written</b> self-help intervention to reduce depression and depressive relapse, and bring about improvements across a range of physical health outcomes.

40|$|Introduction: Surge {{capacity}} for optimization {{of access to}} hospital beds is a limiting factor in response to catastrophic events. Medical facilities, communication tools, manpower, and resource reserves exist to respond to these events. However, these factors may not be optimally functioning to generate an effective and efficient surge response. The objective was to improve the function of these factors. Methods: Regional healthcare facilities and supporting local emergency response agencies developed a coalition (the Healthcare Facilities Partnership of South Central Pennsylvania; HCFP¬SCPA) to increase regional surge capacity and emergency preparedness for healthcare facilities. The coalition focused on 6 objectives: (1) increase awareness of capabilities and assets, (2) develop and pilot test advanced planning and exercising of plans in the region, (3) <b>augment</b> <b>written</b> medical mutual aid agreements, (4) develop and strengthen partnership relationships, (5) ensure National Incident Management System compliance, and (6) develop and test a plan for effective utilization of volunteer healthcare professionals. Results: In comparison to baseline measurements, the coalition improved existing areas covered under all 6 objectives documented during a 24 -month evaluation period. Enhanced communications between the hospital coalition, and real-time exercises, were used to provide evidence of improved preparedness for putative mass casualty incidents. Conclusion: The HCFP-SCPA successfully increased preparedness and surge capacity through a partnership of regional healthcare facilities and emergency response agencies...|$|R

We developed an educational pedagogy to aid in critical thinking for graduate and undergraduate nursing students in clinical areas that can replace or <b>augment</b> <b>written</b> care plans. Methods: Evaluate {{the effectiveness of the}} new ABC’s pedagogy (A=Anatomy/physiology, B=Best care, C=Complications, D=Drugs, E=Evidence based practice) for clinical teaching, using a 5 point Likert scale, for both graduate and undergraduate students and faculty through course evaluations. Results: Total undergraduate students (N = 37) evaluated the ABC’s pedagogy as follows; 98 % rated as excellent and 2 % very good.  For graduate students (N= 8) 88 % rated the ABC’s as excellent and 12 % very good. Staff nurses and advanced practice nurse preceptors (N = 17) rated the pedagogy as 88 % excellent, 6 % very good, and 6 % neither good nor bad. Conclusions: The use of the ABC’s pedagogy in clinical care is a way to evaluate undergraduate and graduate students’ critical thinking, and to facilitate learning during practicum.  It offers a systematic approach to replace written care plans includes the major benefit of real-time questions/answers between the professor/preceptor and students and incorporates evidence-based practice into individualized patient care. The ABC’s are one way to better prepare nursing students in areas of communication, critical thinking, providing care in clinical experiences, discussion of ethical and professional issues, as well as affording one-on-one time with the clinical preceptor/professor and promoting exponential learning in a pre- and post-conference environment. </p...|$|R

Additionally, a Paired Samples t-test was used so as to compare differences within each group. The results obtained from the post-test demonstrated that there was a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of the type of treatment, which signifies that portfolios had a statistically significant effect on promoting writing performance and its sub skills in ESP classes.

However, an analysis of its suitability for specification of heterogeneous schema mappings reveals that weaving models lack support for mapping rules and, therefore, cannot prevent mapping specifications which are semantically meaningless, wrong or disallowed.

It is based on introduction of weaving metamodels <b>augmented</b> with constraints <b>written</b> in OCL.

40|$|International audience—In shared-memory {{multicore}} architectures, {{handling a}} write cache operation {{is more complicated}} than in single-processor systems. A cache line may be present in more than one private L 1 cache. Any cache willing to write this line must inform all the other sharers. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a cache coherence protocol for multicore architectures. At present, directory based protocols are popular cache coherence protocols in both industry and academic domains because of their reduced coherence traffic compared to snooping protocols, at the expense of an indirection. The write policy – write through or write back – is crucial in the protocol design. The write-through policy reduces the bandwidth because it <b>augments</b> the <b>write</b> traffic in the interconnection network, and also augments the energy consumption. However, it can efficiently solve the false sharing problem via write updates. In this paper, we introduce a new way to reduce the write traffic of a write-through coherence protocol by combining write-through coherence with a write-back policy for non coherent lines. The baseline write-through used as reference is a scalable hybrid invalidate/update protocol. Simulation results show that with our enhanced protocol, we can reduce at least by 50 % the write traffic in the interconnection network, and gain up to 20 % performance compared with the baseline write-through protocol...|$|R
