5|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} {{can result in}} severe motor speech disorders; {{dysarthria}} {{is the most common}} such disorder, accounting for roughly a third of all cases. Depending on the stage of recovery, AAC intervention may involve identifying consistent communication signals, the facilitation of reliable yes/no responses to questions, and the ability to express basic needs and answer questions. Individuals who do not recover natural speech to a degree sufficient to meet their communication needs typically suffer from severe impairments related to cognition. Difficulties with memory and learning new skills may influence AAC choices; well-established competencies such as spelling may be more effective than AAC systems that require navigation through multiple pages to <b>access</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members of their social networks. Men are also likely to <b>access</b> <b>information</b> about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them said they had heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them said they had learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E
5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily <b>access</b> <b>information.</b> A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} period of power outage was {{a major problem for}} the residents in Broome. Residents had to wait for days for the power supply to be restored. As all of the distribution lines were above ground, Broome was particularly vulnerable to power outages during cyclones. Linesmen from Western Power were called in from afar to inspect all high voltage distribution lines before these could be re-energised. Western Power inspectors were also flown in from around the state to commence disconnections of properties suspected to have suffered water intrusion. These properties had to be tested before having supply reconnected. The majority of residential properties had power restored back on 30 April, 11days after Rosita struck. Television and radio were limited to transmissions from Perth, and this proved difficult to <b>access</b> <b>information</b> about any available supplies in the town. People had difficulties purchasing food and supplies because supermarkets were closed or had no power and there was no fresh produce arriving. However, power was restored {{a few days after the}} cyclone hit. There were only minor interruptions to the water and sewerage infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|The {{space station}} {{is divided into}} {{multiple}} sections connected by trams and elevators. Each section is composed {{of a set of}} rooms and corridors separated by doors. Some doors require certain actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For example, some doors require a keycard or a numbered entry code, while others need to be cut with a variety of welding torches or hacked using an electronic device. The player may also encounter computer terminals {{that can be used to}} <b>access</b> <b>information</b> or trigger in-game actions like disabling security cameras or manipulating the space station's air-purification mechanism. The game features an automap to help players navigate the different areas of the game. To save their progress, players need to locate a terminal in the game and manually insert Amanda's access card in it. If Amanda dies, the player will need to start the game again from the last saved point. In addition to the campaign mode, Alien: Isolation features a separate game mode, called Survivor Mode, that focuses on short, player-versus-alien scenarios. In each scenario, the player needs to complete a set of objectives while avoiding the alien under a time limit.|$|E

40|$|Section 39 (1) of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria {{guarantees}} {{freedom of}} expression, {{including the right}} to receive and impart information. Also, the domestication of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights' makes the Charter's protections for <b>access</b> to <b>information</b> part of Nigerian law. Indeed, sections 39 (3) and 45 (1) of the Constitution permit restrictions on <b>access</b> to <b>information,</b> but only by 'law that is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society'. Unfortunately, <b>access</b> to <b>information</b> in Nigeria is heavily circumscribed by statutes that confer absolute powers on the executive to classify information to protect vague 'national security' interests inconsistently with what is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society. Underlying this problem are a colonial legacy of administrative secrecy that disdains disclosure of official information and clumsy constitutional rights provisions that accentuate security restrictions rather than the right to information. Using democratic theory as an analytical tool, this thesis advocates for the right of <b>access</b> to <b>information</b> as not just a constitutional value, but also a minimum requirement for the functioning of a democratic society. In so doing, it aims to curtail abuse of executive powers under national security laws that permit limitations on <b>access</b> to <b>information.</b> The thesis uses African human rights standards of reasonableness to evaluate how national security laws that limit <b>access</b> to <b>information</b> measure against constitutional standards of reasonableness and justifiability in a democratic society. The thesis finds that constitutional protection and jurisprudential recognition of the right of <b>access</b> to <b>information</b> in Nigeria do not comply with minimum international law requirements. The thesis ultimately suggests that limitation of <b>access</b> to <b>information</b> on grounds of national security must be in the public interest. In striking a balance between <b>access</b> to <b>information</b> and national security, it recommends a sufficient legislative description of 'national security' and clear constitutional framework for <b>access</b> to <b>information,</b> subject to restrictions only where harm to national security is demonstrably greater than <b>access</b> to <b>information...</b>|$|R

25|$|According to Kelly's theory, {{the manner}} of {{accessing}} stored information would depend on whether the culture was mobile or more settled.

Kelly has observed similar techniques within the modern Australian Aborigines, who use features on the landscape as visual cues to retrieve information.
