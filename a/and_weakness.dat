5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E

5|$|A host of {{different}} animals, including snapping turtles, snake {{species such as}} Nerodia sipedon and Thamnophis sirtalis, muskrats, striped skunks, foxes, dogs, and raccoons prey upon the bog turtle. In addition, leeches (Placobdella multilineata and P. parasitica) and parasitic flies (Cistudinomyia cistudinis) plague some individuals, causing blood loss <b>and</b> <b>weakness.</b> Their shells offer little protection from predators. The bog turtle's main defense when threatened by an animal is to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.|$|E
5|$|All {{octopuses}} are venomous, {{but only}} a few species pose a significant threat to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus Hapalochlaena, which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that can last for over a month even if treated correctly, and the bite of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> persisting for up to a week even if treated.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E

5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|The process upon being branded is {{a painful}} {{experience}} for the person as the body would either accept the seal or reject it. Once one's body accepts the seal, they can assume its First Level where the seal spreads from its point of application across the user's body, increasing their chakra supply and their physical abilities in the process. When the seal is deactivated, the user is left exhausted, having expended all their energy during its use. The Second Level of the Cursed Seal is achieved by allowing the seal to engulf the users entire body, ultimately causing the person to transform into a personalized parody of Sage Mode with various strengths <b>and</b> <b>weakness.</b> The means to achieve the Second Level is by being given a drug and entering a state of lifelessness.|$|E

The majority of the Finnish labor movement supported Finland's independence. The Finnish Bolsheviks, influential though few in number, favoured annexation of Finland by Russia. The question of annexation, in the aftermath of World War I, was resolved by the defeat of Red Finland <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> of Russia.|$|E

40|$|The article {{provides}} {{an inventory of}} the strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> of small firms in a dynamic context. To do this it considers verbal accounts of the processes of innovation and diffusion, as well as quantitative studies testing cause-effect relations. ft consider both economic and noneconomic factors, concerning issues of motivation, perception and knowledge. First an overall summary is given {{of the characteristics of}} small business compared with large business, as a basis for an assessment of strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses.</b> Perhaps the most important characteristic of small business is its diversity, and the article gives the conditions and sources of it. Other core characteristics are small scale, personality and independence of the small firm. From these, derived characteristics, strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> <b>and</b> core strategies can be inferred. From the perspective of the firm, strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> are subsequently analysed for the successive stages of innovation: invention, development, tooling/production, introduction to practice/market. Strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> in diffusion are analysed for the successive stages in the adoption process, as proposed by Rogers. Reference is made to theory and to empirical studies from the literature and from research by the present author...|$|R
