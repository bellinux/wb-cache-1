While suggesting that errors of the second type would be easier to catch if author citations were included, Rosenberg conceded that this might not be practical due to space limitations.

40|$|Although qubits are {{the leading}} {{candidate}} for the basic elements in a quantum computer, {{there are also a}} range of reasons to consider using higher dimensional qudits or quantum continuous variables (QCVs). In this paper we use a general `quantum variable' formalism to propose a method of quantum computation in which <b>ancillas</b> are used to mediate gates on a well-isolated `quantum memory' register and which may be applied to the setting of qubits, qudits (for $d> 2 $) or QCVs. More specifically, we present a model in which universal quantum computation may be implemented on a register using only: repeated applications of a single fixed two-body ancilla-register interaction gate, <b>ancillas</b> prepared in a single state, and local measurements of these <b>ancillas.</b> In order to maintain determinism in the computation, adaptive measurements via a classical-feedforward of measurement outcomes are used, with the method similar to that in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). We show that our model has the same hybrid quantum-classical processing advantages as MBQC, including the power to implement any Clifford circuit in essentially one layer of quantum computation. In some physical settings, high-quality measurements of the <b>ancillas</b> may be highly challenging or not possible, and hence we also present a globally unitary model which replaces the need for measurements of the <b>ancillas</b> with the requirement for <b>ancillas</b> to be prepared in states from a fixed orthonormal basis. Finally, we discuss settings in which these models may be of practical interest. Comment: Final version. Minor updates from v...|$|R

2500|$|In {{examining}} the female role designations of Plautus's plays, Z.M. Packman {{found that they}} are not as stable as their male counterparts: a senex will usually remain a senex {{for the duration of the}} play but designations like matrona, mulier, or uxor at times seem interchangeable. Most free adult women, married or widowed, appear in scene headings as mulier, simply translated as [...] "woman". But in Plautus' Stichus the two young women are referred to as sorores, later mulieres, and then matronae, all of which have different meanings and connotations. Although there are these discrepancies, Packman tries to give a pattern to the female role designations of Plautus. Mulier is typically given to a woman of citizen class and of marriageable age or who has already been married. [...] Unmarried citizen-class girls, regardless of sexual experience, were designated virgo. <b>Ancilla</b> was the term used for female household slaves, with Anus reserved for the elderly household slaves.

60|$|The plain marked 355 feet (as ascertained by the {{barometer}} and by angular measurement) is {{a continuation}} of the above-mentioned 330 feet plain: it extends in a N.W. direction along the southern shores of the estuary. It is capped by gravel, which in most parts is covered by a thin bed of sandy earth, and is scooped out by many flat-bottomed valleys. It appears to the eye quite level, but in proceeding in a S.S.W. course, towards an escarpment distant about six miles, and likewise ranging across the country in a N.W. line, it was found to rise at first insensibly, and then for the last half-mile, sensibly, close up {{to the base of the}} escarpment: at this point it was 463 feet in height, showing a rise of 108 feet in the six miles. On this 355-463 feet plain, I found several shells of Mytilus Magellanicus and of a Mytilus, which Mr. Sowerby informs me is yet unnamed, though well-known as recent on this coast; Patella deaurita; Fusus, I believe, Magellanicus, but the specimen has been lost; and at the distance of four miles from the coast, at the height of about four hundred feet, there were fragments of the same Patella and of a Voluta (apparently V. <b>ancilla)</b> partially embedded in the superficial sandy earth. All these shells had the same ancient appearance with those from the foregoing localities. As the tides along this part of the coast rise at the Syzygal period forty feet, and therefore form a well-marked beach-line, I particularly looked out for ridges in crossing this plain, which, as we have seen, rises 108 feet in about six miles, but I could not see any traces of such. The next highest plain is 710 feet above the sea; it is very narrow, but level, and is capped with gravel; it abuts to the foot of the 840 feet plain. This summit-plain extends as far as the eye can range, both inland along the southern side of the valley of the Santa Cruz, and southward along the Atlantic.|$|E
