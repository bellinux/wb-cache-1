5|$|In this clause the adverbial, helehgüjgeer 'without saying ' must {{precede the}} predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order to}} avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself derived from a verb and hence an üünijg preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also cases in which the <b>adverb</b> must immediately precede the predicate.|$|E
5|$|Negation is {{done with}} the <b>adverb</b> not, which precedes the main verb and follows an {{auxiliary}} verb. A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E
5|$|Some {{adjectives}} are inflected for {{degree of}} comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, {{the boy is}} smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the <b>adverb</b> more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy. There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common {{at the expense of}} the inflected form.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about {{the manner in which}} it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the <b>adverb</b> quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in modern}} colloquial English almost any <b>adverb</b> {{may be found}} in this {{syntactic}} position, especially when the <b>adverb</b> and the verb form a close syntactic unit (really-pull, not-split).|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} verbal {{compounding}} {{is not as}} productive in Warndarang {{as it is in}} surrounding languages, though it does occur, usually when an <b>adverb</b> is added {{to the beginning of the}} main verb of the verbal complex. These are distinguished from simple juxtaposition (in which the <b>adverb</b> would not be part of the verbal complex) in that prefixes such as the negative gu- precede the <b>adverb.</b>|$|E
50|$|In essence, {{there are}} four main types of adverb: <b>adverbs</b> of time (danes (today), večno (perpetually)), <b>adverbs</b> of place (domov (towards home, homewards)), <b>adverbs</b> of manner (grdo (uglily), povsem (entirely)) and <b>adverbs</b> of cause and reason (nalašč (on purpose)).|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} strict {{three-way}} distinction among <b>adverbs</b> that specify the frequency or quantity of multiple events. It {{is argued that}} {{the distribution of the}} three classes of <b>adverbs</b> in Hungarian largely follows from independent factors, and it is dictated by basic semantic properties of the <b>adverbs.</b> One group of <b>adverbs,</b> that of <b>adverbs</b> of quantification, shares the distribution of comparable (non-adverbial) quantificational expressions. Thus syntactic positions occupied by these <b>adverbs</b> are determined by general considerations, and no adverb-specific assumptions are necessary...|$|R

H 577 P CBS 2016 Sun 143 pagesThis {{dissertation}} {{conducts a}} semantic study to {{three pairs of}} quantifying <b>adverbs,</b> or <b>adverbs</b> of quantification, in Mandarin Chinese, including Yizhi and Zong(shi), Changchang and Wangwang, and Ouer and Youshi. These <b>adverbs</b> are previously categorized as temporal <b>adverbs</b> or frequency <b>adverbs.</b> Based on data from CCL and BCC, {{we have found that}} not all of the readings of these <b>adverbs</b> are correlated with time or frequency and some of them should be considered as the atemporal reading (de Swart 1993). Various solutions have been proposed in order to give a unified account to the temporal and atemporal readings of these <b>adverbs.</b> The main problem of those proposals is that little {{attention has been paid to}} the internal variations among these <b>adverbs.</b> We propose that quantifying <b>adverbs</b> in Mandarin Chinese could be further sub-categorized into two types according to their essential meanings. The first type is temporal or frequency <b>adverbs,</b> including Yizhi, Changchang and Ouer. They are used to quantify the event in the sentence and denote a quantity of time length or frequency. The other type is probability <b>adverbs,</b> including Zong(shi), Wangwang and Youshi. The main function of this type is to give a probability judgment. As for Zong(shi) and Wangwang, they denote that the relevant probability has surpassed a baseline probability. The baseline can be either objective or subjective (determined by the speaker). With regard to Youshi, the baseline is close to 0. It means that the relevant probability should be at least above 0, thus giving rise to an existential reading. In addition to the semantic distinctions of these two types, syntactic distributions are also discussed. It is proved that frequency <b>adverbs</b> and probability <b>adverbs</b> occupy different positions in the clause, thus forming another distinction - objective <b>adverbs</b> and subjective <b>adverbs.</b> Several criteria are developed to analyze the syntactic behaviors, including their linear order with negation, modals, other <b>adverbs</b> or adjuncts, as well as other distributions and relative order of co-occurrence. It is shown that subjective <b>adverbs</b> can only precede negation, modals, other <b>adverbs</b> or adjuncts, while objective <b>adverbs</b> are relatively free in such distributions. Therefore, we propose that subjective <b>adverbs</b> actually take scope over IP and represent speaker's commitment to the truth of the proposition, and thus should be categorized as epistemic <b>adverbs</b> or speaker-oriented <b>adverbs</b> (Ernst 2007, 2009), whereas objective <b>adverbs</b> should be regarded as modifiers or adjuncts of VP with the function of restricting the predicate. The data show that subjective <b>adverbs</b> are always incompatible with non-veridical contexts. Based on Giannakidou's (non) veridical theory, it is argued that the incompatibility is attributed to the semantic clash of subjective <b>adverbs</b> and non-veridicality.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the acquisition of}} <b>adverbs</b> in a Czech monolingual boy from speech onset until age 6. This study {{is based on an}} analysis of authentic material: a corpus of transcriptions of audio recordings of the child in verbal interaction with adults, and diary records. The acquisition sequence and adverbial type frequency were analysed. The boy acquired <b>adverbs</b> of place first; although direction was acquired before location, location became more frequent. <b>Adverbs</b> relating to time were developed second, and location in time and repetition were the most frequent temporal aspects. <b>Adverbs</b> of degree followed; <b>adverbs</b> related to high degree were more frequently expressed than <b>adverbs</b> related to low degree. <b>Adverbs</b> of manner appeared last, in which <b>adverbs</b> related to a broader evaluative sense prevailed. <b>Adverbs</b> related to cause were manifested mostly by the interrogative proč / why. Interrelation between the acquisition of nominal and verbal categories was found: when the child acquired the category of nominal case and was able to use the construction of preposition + noun, the percentage of <b>adverbs</b> of place decreased. When he acquired the verbal aspect, the percentage of <b>adverbs</b> related to time decreased...|$|R

30|$|One {{possible}} {{account for}} the deficiency of this line of research on <b>adverbs</b> {{may lie in the}} different derivational methods of <b>adverbs.</b> To many typologists, the most familiar languages are Indo-European languages. In these languages, most <b>adverbs</b> are derived from adjectives through a morphological process. Therefore, <b>adverbs</b> are recognized as an open-class item, which could be highly productive. This proliferative feature of <b>adverbs</b> in Indo-European languages makes it quite an obstacle to conduct large-scale cross-linguistic comparisons. Besides, this regularity also makes this topic theoretically uninteresting. However, <b>adverbs</b> in Chinese are quite opposite. Due to the lack of morphological change, <b>adverbs</b> in Chinese are more prone to be deemed as close-class or at least half-open half-close items. Besides, the multifunctionality of the frequently used Chinese <b>adverbs</b> is highly irregular which makes it also a very intriguing research topic.|$|R
50|$|As in English, <b>adverbs</b> in French {{are used}} to modify {{adjective}}s, other <b>adverbs,</b> verbs, or clauses. Most <b>adverbs</b> are derived from an adjective by adding the suffix -ment to its feminine form (-ment {{is analogous to the}} English suffix -ly), though some <b>adverbs</b> are derived irregularly and others do not derive from adjectives at all.|$|R
50|$|Genitive, {{ablative}} and comitative suffixes may {{be followed}} by other case suffixes.Some <b>adverbs</b> can take case suffixes: locative (optionally for <b>adverbs</b> of place), dative (with the sense 'to', optionally for <b>adverbs</b> of place, obligatory for <b>adverbs</b> of time), or ablative (obligatory for both if the meaning is 'from, since'). <b>Adverbs</b> of manner cannot take case suffixes - this distinguishes them from nouns that express similar meanings (as these nouns must agree in case with the nouns they modify).|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{conceived}} as a comparative analysis of adjectives and <b>adverbs</b> in English. We are to focus on two major properties, ‘grade’ and ‘modification’, that apply to adjectives {{as well as to}} <b>adverbs.</b> As concerns grade, the main distinction between <b>adverbs</b> and adjectives is a matter of function. Adjectives modify nouns whereas <b>adverbs</b> modify other categories. Most adjectives can function as predicative complement as well as noun modifier, but <b>adverbs</b> do not normally occur in this function...|$|R
5000|$|Flat <b>adverbs</b> {{were once}} quite common {{but have been}} largely {{replaced}} by their -ly counterparts.

30|$|This {{study is}} one of three paralleled {{research}} projects on Chinese multifunctional <b>adverbs</b> in the cross-linguistic perspective. The three independent studies are about repetitive <b>adverbs</b> (hai, zai and you), additive <b>adverbs</b> (都 dou ‘all’ and 也 ye ‘also’) and restrictive <b>adverbs</b> (就 jiu ‘just, at once’, 才 cai ‘only, not until’, 剛 gang ‘just, as soon as’ and 將 jiang ‘be about to, merely’), respectively. In the following, we will introduce the criterion and procedure in identifying these <b>adverbs</b> as the research objects.|$|R
25|$|In a {{negative}} comparison, the <b>adverb</b> az ("less") is needed; the object still takes the ablative; daha {{can still be}} used as well.|$|E
