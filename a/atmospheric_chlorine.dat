We conducted studies under Mars conditions using halite (NaCl) alone, soil simulants consisting of silica (SiO 2), Fe 2 O 3,Al 2 O 3, and TiO 2.

During May–June, 2007, Cl 2 levels ranged from below detection (∼ 2 ppt) to 30 ppt. Elevated Cl 2 was associated with high HNO 3 (40 to 120 ppt) in polluted continental outflow transported in the marine boundary layer (MBL) to the site. Lower Cl 2 was observed in recently subsided air masses with multiday free tropospheric oceanic trajectories and in air containing Saharan dust. Model simulations show that the observations of elevated Cl 2 in polluted marine air are consistent with initiation of Cl chemistry by OH + HCl and subsequent heterogeneous, autocatalytic Cl cycling involving marine aerosols.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the Montreal {{protocol}} and its amendments and adjustmentsin reducing the stratospheric chlorine loading, due to the long <b>atmospheric</b> lifetimeof <b>chlorine</b> source gases, the Antarctic ozone hole will continue to occur for decades(WMO, 2014). The ozone hole arises from ozone destruction driven by elevated levelsof ozone destroying (“active”) chlorine in Antarctic spring. The established picture ofthe development of the ozone hole is that high levels of active chlorine are maintainedin Antarctic spring by a competition between chlorine deactivation through gas-phaseformation of ClONO 2 and HCl and activation of ClONO 2 and HCl by heterogeneousreactions (Solomon et al., 2014, 2015). In the core of vortex for ozone hole conditionsin the lower stratosphere (i. e. 16 - 18 km or 100 - 70 hPa) formation of ClONO 2 isof minor importance and the formation of HCl by reaction of Cl with CH 4 and CH 2 Ocannot lead to deactivation because it is balanced by immediate reactivation in effectivereaction cycles involving the heterogeneous reaction HCl+HOCl. For the (observed) complete activation of stratospheric chlorine the production of HOCl via HO 2 + ClO,with the HO 2 resulting from CH 2 O photolysis, is essential. These results are key forassessing the impact of changes of the future stratospheric composition on the recoveryof Antarctic ozone. Our simulations indicate that future increased methane concentrationswill not lead to enhanced chlorine deactivation and that extreme ozone destructionto levels below 0. 1 ppm will occur until mid-century.

40|$|So {{how quickly}} will the ozone hole recover? This {{depends on how}} quickly the {{chlorine}} content (Cl 2) of the atmosphere will decline. The ozone hole forms over the Antarctic each southern spring (September and October). The extremely small ozone amounts in the ozone hole are there because of chemical reactions of ozone with chlorine. This chlorine originates largely from industrially produced chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) compounds. An international agreement, the Montreal Protocol, is drastically {{reducing the amount of}} chlorine-containing compounds that we are releasing into the atmosphere. To be able to attribute changes in stratospheric ozone to changes in chlorine we need to know the distribution of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>chlorine.</b> However, {{due to a lack of}} continuous observations of all the key chlorine gases, producing a continuous time series of stratospheric chlorine has not been achieved to date. We have for the first time devised a technique to make a 17 -year time series for stratospheric chlorine that uses the long time series of HCl observations made from several space borne instruments and a neural network. The neural networks allow us to both inter-calibrate the various HCl instruments and to infer the total amount of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>chlorine</b> from HCl.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the 248 nm photodissociation of methyl hypochlorite (CH 3 OCl), a molecule {{that serves as}} an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>chlorine</b> reservoir. The data show that the primary photodissociation channel is cleavage of the O-Cl bond to produce Cl atoms and CH 3 O radicals, a result consistent with the direct dissociation mechanism found by other computational and experimental studies of alkyl hypohalites.

The model of atmospheric dispersion of mercury presented at the second conference "Mercury in the environment - Identification of risks for human health" [in Polish] has been developed in two main directions: (i) additional reactions in the aqueous and gaseous phases (including mercury reactions with bromine, reduction of elemental mercury in the aqueous phase) were included (ii) new input data were generated (e. g. <b>atmospheric</b> concentration of <b>chlorine</b> compounds, emission data).

In particular, the existence of a significant ClOOCl absorption band longwards of 420 nm is not supported by our observations.

40|$|The middle {{atmosphere}} {{is rich in}} its variety of particulate matter, which ranges from meteorite debris, to sulfate aerosols, to polar stratospheric ice clouds. Volcanic eruptions strongly perturb the stratospheric sulfate (Junge) layer. High-altitude 'noctilucent' ice clouds condense at the summer mesopause. The properties of these particles, including their composition, sizes, and geographical distribution, are discussed, and their global effects, including chemical, radiative, and climatic roles, are reviewed. Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are composed of water and nitric acid {{in the form of}} micron-sized ice crystals. These particles catalyze reactions of chlorine compounds that 'activate' otherwise inert chlorine reservoirs, leading to severe ozone depletions in the southern polar stratosphere during austral spring. PSCs also modify the composition of the polar stratosphere through complex physiocochemical processes, including dehydration and denitrification, and the conversion of reactive nitrogen oxides into nitric acid. If water vapor and nitric acid concentrations are enhanced by high-altitude aircraft activity, the frequency, geographical range, and duration of PSCs might increase accordingly, thus enhancing the destruction of the ozone layer (which would be naturally limited in geographical extent by the same factors that confine the ozone hole to high latitudes in winter). The stratospheric sulfate aerosol layer reflects solar radiation and increases the planetary albedo, thereby cooling the surface and possibly altering the climate. Major volcanic eruptions, which increase the sulfate aerosol burden by a factor of 100 or more, may cause significant global climate anomalies. Sulfate aerosols might also be capable of activating stratospheric chlorine reservoirs on a global scale (unlike PCSs, which represent a localized polar winter phenomenon), although existing evidence suggests relatively minor perturbations in chlorine chemistry.

Chlorine radicals can interact with hydroperoxy (HO x) radicals and nitrogen oxides (NO x) to alter the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. They are known to rapidly oxidize a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in the atmosphere, yet little is known about secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from chlorine-initiated photooxidation and its atmospheric implications. Environmental chamber experiments were carried out under low-NO x conditions with isoprene and chlorine as primary VOC and oxidant sources. Upon complete isoprene consumption, observed SOA yields ranged from 7 to 36  %, decreasing with extended photooxidation and SOA aging. Formation of particulate organochloride was observed. A high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer was used to determine the molecular composition of gas-phase species using iodide–water and hydronium–water cluster ionization. Multi-generational chemistry was observed, including ions consistent with hydroperoxides, chloroalkyl hydroperoxides, isoprene-derived epoxydiol (IEPOX), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), evident of secondary OH production and resulting chemistry from Cl-initiated reactions.

40|$|Since the mid eighties of {{the past}} century, an almost {{complete}} destruction {{of the ozone layer}} above the Antarctic in springtime (and to a lesser extent also above the Arctic) is observed, which is caused by the release of atomic chlorine and bromine from anthropogenic halogen compounds. Due to the fast phase out of the production of CFCs, the increase of the stratospheric chlorine loading could be slowed down, and the recovery of the ozone layer is expected around the year 2050. However, the impacts on atmospheric chemistry, the climate and the biosphere are considerable. By differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) various molecules with characteristic absorption spectra can be detected simultaneously in the atmosphere, among them also many halogen compounds. In this thesis, measurements of the satellite spectrometers GOME and SCIAMACHY were evaluated for the <b>atmospheric</b> trace gas <b>chlorine</b> dioxide (OClO) and analysed with respect to their relevance for the polar stratospheric ozone chemistry. OClO is an important indicator for stratospheric chlorine activation, the conversion of the mainly anthropogenic chlorine from its ozone- inert reservoir compounds into ozone destroying (active) species. This activation of chlorine takes place by heterogeneous reactions on polar stratospheric clouds, which may be formed under the extremely cold stratospheric temperatures prevailing in polar nights. In this thesis, measurements of the OClO column density by GOME and SCIAMACHY during the polar winters 1995 - 2005 are quantitatively related to the meteorological conditions, the effect on the ozone column and the interaction with other stratospheric trace gases. The measurements by SCIAMACHY in the limb geometry can be inverted to vertical profiles by calculation of the radiative transfer, which increases the information content with respect to a measurement of the column density essentially.

40|$|Time {{series of}} total column abundances of {{hydrogen}} chloride (HCl), chlorine nitrate (ClONO 2), and hydrogen fluoride (HF) were determined from ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra recorded at 17 sites {{belonging to the}} Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) and located between 80. 05 ° N and 77. 82 ° S. By providing such a near-global overview on ground-based measurements {{of the two major}} stratospheric chlorine reservoir species, HCl and ClONO 2, the present study is able to confirm the decrease of the <b>atmospheric</b> inorganic <b>chlorine</b> abundance during the last few years. This decrease is expected following the 1987 Montreal Protocol and its amendments and adjustments, where restrictions and a subsequent phase-out of the prominent anthropogenic chlorine source gases (solvents, chlorofluorocarbons) were agreed upon to enable a stabilisation and recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer. The atmospheric fluorine content is expected to be influenced by the Montreal Protocol, too, because most of the banned anthropogenic gases also represent important fluorine sources. But many of the substitutes to the banned gases also contain fluorine so that the HF total column abundance is expected to have continued to increase during the last few years. The measurements are compared with calculations from five different models: the two-dimensional Bremen model, the two chemistry-transport models KASIMA and SLIMCAT, and the two chemistry-climate models EMAC and SOCOL. Thereby, the ability of the models to reproduce the absolute total column amounts, the seasonal cycles, and the temporal evolution found in the FTIR measurements is investigated and inter-compared. This is especially interesting because the models have different architectures. The overall agreement between the measurements and models for the total column abundances and the seasonal cycles is good. Linear trends of HCl, ClONO 2, and HF are calculated from both measurement and model time series data, with a focus on the time range 2000 – 2009. This period is chosen because from most of the measurement sites taking part in this study, data are available during these years. The precision of the trends is estimated with the bootstrap resampling method. The sensitivity of the trend results with respect to the fitting function, the time of year chosen and time series length is investigated, as well as a bias due to the irregular sampling of the measurements. The measurements and model results investigated here agree qualitatively on a decrease of the chlorine species by around 1 % yr − 1. The models simulate an increase of HF of around 1 % yr − 1. This also agrees well with most of the measurements, but some of the FTIR series in the Northern Hemisphere show a stabilisation or even a decrease in the last few years. In general, for all three gases, the measured trends vary more strongly with latitude and hemisphere than the modelled trends. Relative to the FTIR measurements, the models tend to underestimate the decreasing chlorine trends and to overestimate the fluorine increase in the Northern Hemisphere. At most sites, the models simulate a stronger decrease of ClONO 2 than of HCl. In the FTIR measurements, this difference between the trends of HCl and ClONO 2 depends strongly on latitude, especially in the Northern Hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|Since {{publication}} of the 1998 UNEP Assessment, there has been continued rapid expansion {{of the literature on}} UV-B radiation. Many measurements have demonstrated the inverse relationship between column ozone amount and UV radiation, and in a few cases long-term increases due to ozone decreases have been identified. The quantity, quality and availability of ground-based UV measurements relevant to assessing the environmental impacts of ozone changes continue to improve. Recent studies have contributed to delineating regional and temporal differences due to aerosols, clouds, and ozone. Improvements in radiative transfer modelling capability now enable more accurate characterization of clouds, snow-cover, and topographical effects. A standardized scale for reporting UV to the public has gained wide acceptance. There has been increased use of satellite data to estimate geographic variability and trends in UV. Progress has been made in assessing the utility of satellite retrievals of UV radiation by comparison with measurements at the Earth's surface. Global climatologies of UV radiation are now available on the Internet. Anthropogenic aerosols play a more important role in attenuating UV irradiances than has been assumed previously, and this will have implications for the accuracy of UV retrievals from satellite data. Progress has been made inferring historical levels of UV radiation using measurements of ozone (from satellites or from ground-based networks) in conjunction with measurements of total solar radiation obtained from extensive meteorological networks. We cannot yet be sure whether global ozone has reached a minimum. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>chlorine</b> concentrations are beginning to decrease. However, bromine concentrations are still increasing. While these halogen concentrations remain high, the ozone layer remains vulnerable to further depletion from events such as volcanic eruptions that inject material into the stratosphere. Interactions between global warming and ozone depletion could delay ozone recovery by several years, and this topic remains an area of intense research interest. Future changes in greenhouse gases will affect the future evolution of ozone through chemical, radiative, and dynamic processes. In this highly coupled system, an evaluation of the relative importance of these processes is difficult; studies are ongoing. A reliable assessment of these effects on total column ozone is limited by uncertainties in lower stratospheric response to these changes. At several sites, changes in UV differ from those expected from ozone changes alone, possibly as a result of long-term changes in aerosols, snow cover, or clouds. This indicates a possible interaction between climate change and UV radiation. Cloud reflectance measured by satellite has shown a long-term increase at some locations, especially in the Antarctic region, but also in Central Europe, which would tend to reduce the UV radiation. Even with the expected decreases in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>chlorine,</b> it will be several years before the beginning of an ozone recovery can be unambiguously identified at individual locations. Because UV-B is more variable than ozone, any identification of its recovery would be further delayed.

Both of these heterogeneous reactions proceed at the liquid/vapor interface by an S N 2 mechanism where the nucleophile is chloride ion formed from the ionization of HCl on the aqueous surface.

Though both nitrogen oxychloride products are produced by S N 2 reactions, the N 2 O 5 mechanism is unusual in that the electrophilic N atom to be attacked oscillates between the two normally equivalent NO 2 groups. Chloride ion is found to react with N 2 O 5 less efficiently than with N 2 O 4. The simulations provide an explanation for this.

40|$|A {{capillary}} flow gas viscometer {{has been used}} to measure the shear viscosities of the hydrofluoroalkanes HFC 134 a, HCFC 123, HCFC 124 and the ternary blend MP 39, at pressures up to 0. 1 MPa relative to a nitrogen standard. Having applied small correction factors to the measured flow time data, the resultant viscosities are compared to those obtained by other workers (where possible) using alternative techniques. We calculate self diffusion coefficients and hard sphere collision diameters for the molecules within the rigorous Chapman-Enskog kinetic theory of gases, and calculate optimum well depths of the intermolecular interactions using the Extended Law of Corresponding States. The use of a Stockmayer potential energy function by other workers is discussed and within this, the Mason-Monchick approximation is applied to calculate the percentage effect of the dipole moment on the collision integral. In order to assess the affect to the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>chlorine</b> loading of the hydrochlorofluorocarbons measured above (HCFC 123. HCFC 124 and HCFC 22 in MP 39) as well as other halocarbons currentiy in use, two globally averaged mass balance models have been developed on a workstation spreadsheet to assess the future chlorine and bromine levels in the atmosphere and the sensitivity of those loadings to possible forcing factors. These models use production, growth, lifetime and concentration data for fourteen chlorocarbons and three bromocarbons and allow for characteristic emission profiles according to the use to which the halocarbon is applied. Current international agreement, ie. Montreal Protocol 3, is used as a reference level (in most cases), and the models have been used to assess tiiose scenarios which most influence the peak level of chlorine and bromine attained, when that peak occurs and the period of time before 'safe' levels are reached.

40|$|The Specified Dynamics {{version of}} the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM) and the Goddard Space Flight Center {{two-dimensional}} (GSFC 2 -D) models are used to investigate the effect of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) on the atmosphere over the 1960 – 2010 time period. The Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation for Aviation Safety (NAIRAS) computation of the GCR-caused ionization rates are used in these simulations. GCR-caused maximum NO x increases of 4 – 15  % are computed in the Southern polar troposphere with associated ozone increases of 1 – 2  %. NO x increases of [*]∼[*] 1 – 6  % are calculated for the lower stratosphere with associated ozone decreases of 0. 2 – 1  %. The primary impact of GCRs on ozone was due to their production of NO x. The impact of GCRs varies with the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>chlorine</b> loading, sulfate aerosol loading, and solar cycle variation. Because of the interference between the NO x and ClO x ozone loss cycles (e. g., the ClO + NO 2 + M [*]→[*] ClONO 2 + M reaction) and {{the change in the}} importance of ClO x in the ozone budget, GCRs cause larger atmospheric impacts with less chlorine loading. GCRs also cause larger atmospheric impacts with less sulfate aerosol loading and for years closer to solar minimum. GCR-caused decreases of annual average global total ozone (AAGTO) were computed to be 0. 2  % or less with GCR-caused column ozone increases between 1000 and 100  hPa of 0. 08  % or less and GCR-caused column ozone decreases between 100 and 1  hPa of 0. 23  % or less. Although these computed ozone impacts are small, GCRs provide a natural influence on ozone and need to be quantified over long time periods. This result serves as a lower limit because of the use of the ionization model NAIRAS/HZETRN which underestimates the ion production by neglecting electromagnetic and muon branches of the cosmic ray induced cascade. This will be corrected in future works...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{trend of}} the atmospheric carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) burden has been retrieved from high spectral resolution infrared solar absorption spectra recorded between January 1999 and June 2011. The observations were made with a Fourier transform spectrometer at the northern mid-latitude, high altitude Jungfraujoch station in Switzerland (46. 5 °N latitude, 8. 0 °E longitude, 3580 m altitude). Total columns were derived from spectrometric analysis of the strong CCl 4 ν 3 band at 794 cm- 1, accounting for all interfering molecules (e. g., H 2 O, CO 2, O 3, and a dozen weakly absorbing gases). A significant improvement in the fitting residuals and in the retrieved CCl 4 columns was obtained by taking into account line mixing in a strong interfering CO 2 Q branch. This procedure had never been implemented in remote sensing CCl 4 retrievals though its importance was noted in earlier studies. A fit to the CCl 4 daily mean total column time series returns a statistically-significant long-term trend of (- 1. 49 ± 0. 08 x 1013 molec. /cm 2) /yr, 2 -σ. This corresponds to an annual decrease of (- 1. 31 ± 0. 07) pptv for the mean free tropospheric volume mixing ratio. Furthermore, the total column data set reveals a weak seasonal cycle with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 4. 5 %, with minimum and maximum values occurring in mid-February and mid-September, respectively. This small seasonal modulation is attributed primarily to the residual influence of tropopause height changes throughout the year. The negative {{trend of the}} CCl 4 loading reflects the continued impact of the regulations implemented by the Montreal Protocol and its strengthening amendments and adjustments. Despite this statistically significant decrease, the CCl 4 molecule currently remains an important contributor to the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>chlorine</b> budget, and thus deserves further monitoring, to ensure continued compliance with these strengthenings, globally. Our present findings are briefly discussed with respect to recent relevant CCl 4 investigations at the ground and from space. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{in detail the}} instrumentation and calibrations used in the ALE, GAGE and AGAGE experiments and present {{a history of the}} majority of the anthropogenic ozone- depleting and climate-forcing gases in air based on these experiments. Beginning in 1978, these three successive automated high frequency in-situ experiments have documented the long-term behavior of the measured concentrations of these gases over the past twenty years, and show both the evolution of latitudinal gradients and the high frequency variability due to sources and circulation. We provide estimates of the long-term trends in total chlorine contained in long- lived halocarbons involved in ozone depletion. We summarize interpretations of these measurements using inverse methods to determine trace gas lifetimes and emissions. Finally, we provide a combined observational and modeled reconstruction of the evolution of chlorocarbons by latitude in the atmosphere over the past sixty years which can be used as boundary conditions for interpreting trapped air in glaciers and oceanic measurements of chlorocarbon tracers of the deep oceanic circulation. Some specific conclusions are: (a) International compliance with the Montreal Protocol is so far resulting in chlorofluorocarbon and chlorocarbon mole fractions comparable to target levels, (b) Mole fractions of total chlorine contained in long-lived halocarbons (CCl 2 F 2, CCl 3 F, CH 3 CCl 3, CCl 4, CHClF 2, CCl 2 FCClF 2, CH 3 Cl, CH 2 Cl 2, CHCl 3, CCl 2 =CCl 2) in the lower troposphere reached maximum values of about 3. 6 ppb in 1993 and are beginning to slowly decrease in the global lower atmosphere, (c) The chlorofluorocarbons have atmospheric lifetimes consistent with destruction in the stratosphere being their principal removal mechanism, (d) Multi-annual variations in chlorofluorocarbon and chlorocarbon emissions deduced from ALUGAGWAGAGE data are consistent approximately with variations estimated independently from industrial production and sales data where available (CCl 2 F 2 (CFC- 12) and CCl 2 FCClF 2 (CFC- 113) show the greatest discrepancies), (e) The mole fractions of the hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, which are replacing the regulated halocarbons, are rising very rapidly in the atmosphere but, with the exception of the much longer manufactured CHClF 2 (HCFC- 22), they are not yet at levels sufficient to contribute significantly to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>chlorine</b> loading. These replacement species could in the future provide independent estimates of the global weighted-average OH concentration provided their industrial emissions are accurately documented, (f) In the future, analysis of pollution events measured using high frequency in-situ measurements of chlorofluorocarbons and their replacements may enable emission estimates at the regional level which, together with industrial end-use data, are of sufficient accuracy to be capable of identifying regional non-compliance with the Montreal Protocol...|$|E
