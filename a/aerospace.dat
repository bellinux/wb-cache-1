5|$|He {{accepted}} a teaching {{position in the}} Department of <b>Aerospace</b> Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, having decided on Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater, Purdue, because it had a small <b>aerospace</b> department; he hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only the USC master's degree. He began the work while stationed at Edwards years before, and finally completed it after Apollo11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight. The official job title he received at Cincinnati was University Professor of <b>Aerospace</b> Engineering. After teaching for eight years, he resigned in 1979 without explaining his reason for leaving.|$|E

5|$|In March 1996, British <b>Aerospace</b> {{promoted}} {{the option of}} establishing a production line to manufacture new-build Nimrod MRA4 aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the refurbishment of existing airframes, this was reportedly motivated by service concerns regarding attrition rates of the existing aircraft. It was also announced that preliminary talks had been conducted with the South African Air Force on the topic of the Nimrod 2000; British <b>Aerospace</b> were also considering the merits of using a newly developed variant of the General Electric CF34 turbofan powerplant, which General Electric had formally proposed the specific use of to power the type. In June 1996, British <b>Aerospace</b> announced that it had partnered with McDonnell Douglas to market new-build Nimrod 2000s to the export market; it has been claimed that this move was in response to scepticism from the MoD over the prospects of export sales for the type. British <b>Aerospace</b> argued that the Nimrod 2000's selection would give it entry to the global maritime patrol aircraft market.|$|E
