5|$|A. ocellatus is {{native to}} Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and French Guiana, and occurs in the Amazon River basin, along the Amazon, Içá, Negro, Solimões, and Ucayali River systems, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> the Approuague and Oyapock River drainages. In its natural environment, the species {{typically}} occurs in slow-moving white-water habitats, and has been observed sheltering under submerged branches. Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a byproduct of the ornamental fish trade. The species is limited in its distribution by its intolerance of cooler water temperatures, the lower lethal limit for the species is 12.9°C (55.22°F).|$|E

5|$|According to Ottfried Neubecker, the bey of Tunis {{also had}} his own flag.

5|$|Additional collections, then still {{believed}} to be T.toomansis, were made from South Australia in 1952, again on dead cones of unspecified Banksia, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> 1956 on dead cones of Banksia marginata. In 1957 and 1958, R. W. G. Dennis redescribed the species, and after consultation with Canadian mycologist James Walton Groves, who had earlier completed a monograph on the genus Tympanis, transferred the taxon to the genus Encoelia (family Sclerotiniaceae). Encoelia species are small, tough, brownish discomycetes that typically grow in clusters on hardwood or woody substrates. Because the original collections were incomplete and certain microscopic features inadequately described, various collections made from Australia were presumed to be variations of the original 1887 collection.|$|E

5|$|After {{the cinema}} closed, it was {{purchased}} by Develop UK, and several {{attempts were made to}} turn the building into a Wetherspoons pub. However these were rejected by the council twice, once in the initial planning application, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> a subsequent appeal. The application was denied due to the moratorium on new food and drink licences in Withington, part of the town's unitary development plan. In 2002 the building {{was purchased by}} Arrows International.

These plans were withdrawn as they were seen as overdeveloping the site.|$|E

Hitler did not want to run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E

5|$|Films of {{the time}} {{typically}} used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War.

An alternative appears in Disney's animated Fantasia (1940), in its The Rite of Spring sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time) <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> Karel Zeman's Cesta do praveku (1955;Journey to the Beginning of Time) Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.|$|E
