40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{seismology}} is to understand the behaviour of the earth’s movements during the occurrence of an earthquake. This research focuses on the recovery of better estimation of the true ground displacements as the tilt components are inherent in recorded <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> <b>histories.</b> The raw <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> recorded in seismograms of the near field earthquake are contaminated by the effects of tilt <b>time</b> <b>histories.</b> The effects of tilt <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> cause non–zero baseline errors in seismic records thereby providing offset in the ground velocity although the final velocity never ends to zero and ground displacement diverges from the constant value. To perform baseline corrections it is therefore necessary to remove the tilt and noise components. Tilt separation was undertaken using a model designated the Tilt Separation – Independent Component Analysis (TS-ICA) model, and an enhanced version of the Extended Generalised Beta Distribution (EGBD) model. Several source distributions such as Normal, Gaussian, Non-Gaussian, Sub and Super Gaussian and skewed distribution with zero kurtosis has been modelled using EGBD and separated using EGBD-ICA.

40|$|The {{time varying}} {{forces in the}} ground generates {{earthquake}} loads and the pattern of load specified as a time history of ground excitation is the most accurate means of representing earthquake actions. The difficulty with carrying out analysis procedures to compute the responses of a structure {{for this type of}} load is that the form of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> <b>history</b> is to be clearly known.

40|$|Abstract Displacement {{response}} spectra defined up to {{long periods}} {{are needed for}} the design of large structures and to design structures according to displacement-based methods. The spectra can theoretically be retrieved in the near field of large earthquakes from accelerations recorded by modern strong-motion accelerometers. Difficulties exist due to instrumental limitations: long-period noise that contaminates the <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> and record of the tilt simultaneously to the translational accelerations. Original in this work, the effect of the instrument’s permanent tilt is investigated, and the improvement of the spectra at long periods, when the residual tilt is removed from accelerations recorded by modern strong-motion seismometers, is checked against 1 Hz Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. Records of five strong-motion accelerometers situated in the near field of the Mw 6. 8 Japanese 2007 Niigata-ken Chuetsu-Oki earthquake are analyzed in terms of Fourier content and displacement response spectra and are then compared to their closest 1 Hz GPS data. The results show that the uncorrected <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> histor-ies, obtained by simply removing the preevent mean from the raw accelerations recorded by modern strong-motion seismometers, provide reliable displacement response spectra at periods over 20 s.

40|$|Due to world-wide {{reports and}} {{evidence}} that modern public structures can undergo perceivable motion {{as a result}} of rhythmic crowd excitation, the present study investigated the effects of structural vibration on ground reaction forces (GRFs) and the potential use of this data in structural engineering design. GRF data of several human subjects were measured on a fully instrumented grandstand whose motion can be controlled to simulate a vibrating seating deck. Subjects were requested to stand on a vibrating deck and give feedback on their state of comfort. At the same time, GRFs generated during standing on the vibrating deck, as well as the motion of the deck were recorded. Tests results indicate that there is a relationship between the state of comfort and GRFs generated during standing on the vibrating deck. In particular, it is confirmed that the human state of comfort can be related to the root mean square (RMS) of the normalized GRF time history - the normalized foot point <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> <b>history.</b> This is a new approach to the evaluation of human sensitivity to vibration motion, which is effectively based on the <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> <b>history</b> of the actual subject. The new approach based on the acceleration of the actual subject is shown to be more reliable than the traditional approach based on the acceleration of the supporting structure. Finally, the relationship presented here means that after calibration against the subjective responses, GRF data has a potential for use as an objective measure of the human state of comfort and thereby eliminate the subjective element associated with human judgment of his or her state of comfort. Alternatively, the calibrated GRF data can be used to supplement and validate responses obtained as subjective feedback from humans regarding their own state of comfort. © 2009 Society for Experimental Mechanics Inc...|$|E
