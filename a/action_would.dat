5|$|Besides the {{meetings}} at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, negotiations also involved helicopter travel by government representatives to the areas under militant control near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The government had indicated that stronger military <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be implemented if the talks failed.|$|E
5|$|After a touch-line {{argument}} with then-club captain Gareth Owen, Gannon gave a forthright interview explaining that disciplinary <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be taken, and Owen would be stripped of the captaincy. Owen, who was later {{released by the}} club, did not play another game for County. Meanwhile, Gannon was left threatening police action over a strong challenge that left Stockport striker Matty McNeil unconscious and in hospital.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, a Nazi {{task force}} assaults the Natural History Museum in London, {{which has been}} overrun by monsters. Later <b>action</b> <b>would</b> have {{involved}} {{the discovery of a}} secret chamber beneath the museum. This episode was written by Mark Gatiss and planned to air in the fourth series of Doctor Who, but was replaced by The Fires of Pompeii. Elements of the story were later reused in Steven Moffat's The Big Bang, the finale of Series 5.|$|E

5|$|In October 2017, the BBC {{announced}} that Shada, the Fourth Doctor serial from 1979, which was never completed owing to industrial <b>action,</b> <b>would</b> be released as a digital download, on DVD and Blu-Ray, with newly animated footage and new cast audio recordings (featuring the surviving original cast) {{combined with the}} existing live-action footage.|$|E
5|$|My factual {{position}} in the case {{as well as in}} the world of science of today does not permit me to enter the case against the Food and Drug Administration, since such <b>action</b> <b>would,</b> in my mind, imply admission of the authority of this special branch of the government to pass judgment on primordial, pre-atomic cosmic orgone energy. I, therefore, rest the case in full confidence in your hands.|$|E
5|$|Nine months later, in March 2010, Al-Islam {{published}} an apology to the Roman Catholic Church and Christians for the article. The public apology was {{posted on the}} website of its publisher. Pakiam accepted the apology and said that no further legal <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be taken against the magazine or its publishers.|$|E

5|$|O'Regan {{said that}} Australian players were not {{prepared}} for playing cricket in Asia, as they {{were not aware of}} the dangers of bookmakers and betting on the Indian subcontinent. He recommended that every new player should be warned of the dangers of becoming involved with bookmakers, and the penalties that it entails. The ICC announced that no further <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be taken against Waugh and Warne as they could not be tried twice for the same offence.|$|E
5|$|The <b>action</b> <b>would</b> prove {{controversial}} in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander of Experiment, had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley {{had tried to}} insist on surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought the situation was hopeless due to {{the sheer number of}} pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to strike the colors.|$|E
5|$|Written by Alan Drury, {{the scripts}} were {{commissioned}} on 2 April 1979 for this four-part story. The story {{was set in}} the Victorian era and the entire <b>action</b> <b>would</b> take place in and around a vicarage. The vicar has recently died and fake spiritualists are exploiting the widow. The first episode would open with a seance during which the TARDIS would arrive. On 19 September 1979, the story was accepted subject to alterations.|$|E

UEFA confirmed that no <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be taken against the referee, concluding that he made the correct judgement.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the action}} the Tripolitanians had lost their three largest vessels and {{suffered}} heavy casualties, while the Sardinians only had two dead and five wounded. Later in the day while Sivori was making preparations for another attack on the city, a Dutch brig sailed out of port saluting him and signaling that it wished to communicate with him. Upon contacting the squadron, the brig's captain sent Sivori the congratulatory remarks of the British consul at Tripoli. The Sardinian commander sent the Dutch vessel back into port with a message to Karamanli that if he did not commence negotiations, further military <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be taken against the city. Rather than suffer continued action from the Sardinians, Karamanli acceded to the Sardinian requests and sent an envoy out to the Sardinian squadron.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an <b>action</b> <b>would</b> certainly backfire.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his best course of <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{attempted}} {{to defend the}} company against a takeover, commissioning a report from McKinsey & Company on the future outlook of the company. This course of <b>action</b> <b>would</b> ultimately prove futile and Trafalgar House would launch a successful bid for the company, beginning on 30 June 1971. Smallpeice accepted an increased bid from Trafalgar House {{at the end of}} July, and would go on to preside over the last board meeting of Cunard as an independent company on 25 August 1971, 93 years after its incorporation.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) {{requested}} {{the intervention of}} the International Association of Athletics Federations and the IOC; the samples were jointly reexamined by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the IOC Sub-Commission on Doping and Biochemistry of Sport. In January 2003, the OCA announced that the IOC Medical Director had cleared Sunita of the doping charge and that appropriate <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be taken against the AGDCC. Both of Sunita's medals were reinstated on February 4, 2003, in a ceremony attended by the Secretary General of OCA Randhir Singh {{and the president of the}} IOA Suresh Kalmadi.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} {{criminal investigation}} {{focused on the}} illegal factory itself. Almost all factories and homes in the area were illegal and unauthorised, and do not follow building codes and sanctions. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be taken against {{the owners of the}} factory and house, and Superintendent of Police of South 24 Parganas S. N. Gupta said that the owners of the building would be arrested. Investigation has shown that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) issued notices to the building on three separate occasions, in 1988, 1989, and 1992, yet took no further action. It has been shown, however, that the KMC also approved trade licences for two businesses to operate from the building. The owner of the building, Khurshid Alam, has had a police complaint filed against him by the fire department for illegal construction charges. Mohammed Sagir Ahmed and Mohammed Asif, the owners of Tenex Exports, also face related charges. Both investigations are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes <b>action</b> <b>would</b> be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, on other occasions, the problem would simply be ignored. The royal eyres, courts which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. The power of royal sheriffs also declined during Henry's reign. They were now often lesser men appointed by the exchequer, rather than coming from important local families, and they focused on generating revenue for the King. Their robust attempts to enforce fines and collect debts generated much unpopularity among the lower classes. Unlike his father, Henry did not exploit the large debts that the barons frequently owed to the Crown, and was slow to collect any sums of money due to him.|$|E
