25|$|A 12 April report {{prepared}} by NISA estimated the total release of iodine-131 was 130PBq and caesium-137 at 6.1PBq. On 23 April the NSC updated its release estimates, {{but it did}} not reestimate the total release, instead indicating that 154TBq of <b>air</b> <b>release</b> were occurring daily as of 5 April.|$|E
25|$|Rutan {{was also}} working with t/Space in the mid-2000s on the {{development}} of an air launched, two-stage-to-orbit, manned spacecraft.

25|$|A later, 12 April 2011, NISA and NSC report {{estimated}} the total <b>air</b> <b>release</b> of iodine-131 at 130PBq and 150PBq, respectively – about 30grams. However, on 23 April, the NSC revised its original estimates of iodine-131 released. The NSC did not estimate the total release size based upon these updated numbers, but estimated {{a release of}} 0.14TBq per hour on 5 April.|$|E

25|$|Surfactants {{are used}} to modify the {{characteristics}} of both foam and non-foam polyurethane polymers. They {{take the form of}} polydimethylsiloxane-polyoxyalkylene block copolymers, silicone oils, nonylphenol ethoxylates, and other organic compounds. In foams, they {{are used to}} emulsify the liquid components, regulate cell size, and stabilize the cell structure to prevent collapse and sub-surface voids. In non-foam applications they are used as <b>air</b> <b>release</b> and antifoaming agents, as wetting agents, and are used to eliminate surface defects such as pin holes, orange peel, and sink marks.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{releases}} of radioactive nuclides have been iodine and caesium; strontium and plutonium {{have also been}} found. These elements have been released into the air via steam; and into the water leaking into groundwater or the ocean. The expert who prepared a frequently cited Austrian Meteorological Service report asserted that the [...] "Chernobyl accident emitted much more radioactivity and a wider diversity of radioactive elements than Fukushima Daiichi has so far, but it was iodine and caesium that caused most of the health risk – especially outside the immediate area of the Chernobyl plant." [...] Iodine-131 has a half-life of 8days while caesium-137 has a half-life of over 30 years. The IAEA has developed a method that weighs the [...] "radiological equivalence" [...] for different elements. TEPCO has published estimates using a simple-sum methodology, [...] TEPCO has not released a total water and <b>air</b> <b>release</b> estimate.|$|E

50|$|Fine bubble {{diffusers}} {{have largely}} replaced coarse bubble diffusers and mechanical aerators {{in most of}} the developed world and in much of the developing world. The exception would be in secondary treatment phases, such as activated sludge processing tanks, where 85 to 90 percent of any remaining solid materials (floating on the surface) are removed through settling or biological processes. The biological process uses air to encourage bacterial growth that would consume many of these waste materials, such as phosphorus and nitrogen that are dissolved in the wastewater. The larger <b>air</b> <b>release</b> openings of a coarse bubble diffuser helps to facilitate a higher oxygen transfer rate and bacterial growth. One disadvantage of using fine bubble diffusers in activated sludge tanks is the tendency of floc (particle) clogging the small <b>air</b> <b>release</b> holes.|$|E
