5|$|Lipids are {{the most}} diverse group of biochemicals. Their main {{structural}} uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or {{as a source of}} energy. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.|$|E

25|$|The first organisms were {{self-replicating}} iron-rich clays which {{fixed carbon}} dioxide into oxalic and other dicarboxylic acids. This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then {{evolved into the}} sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. If biosynthesis recapitulates biopoiesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases. Furthermore the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> by polynucleotides.|$|E
25|$|Lymph vessels called lacteals {{are in the}} {{beginning}} of the gastrointestinal tract, predominantly in the small intestine. While most other nutrients absorbed by the small intestine are passed on to the portal venous system to drain via the portal vein into the liver for processing, fats (lipids) are passed on to the lymphatic system to be transported to the blood circulation via the thoracic duct. (There are exceptions, for example medium-chain triglycerides are fatty <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> of glycerol that passively diffuse from the GI tract to the portal system.) The enriched lymph originating in the lymphatics of the small intestine is called chyle. The nutrients that are released to the circulatory system are processed by the liver, having passed through the systemic circulation.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Wijnberg {{and colleagues}} {{reported}} {{the presence of}} several structurally related antifungal compounds called benzoxepines in the latex of Mycena galopus. One of these compounds, 6-hydroxypterulone, is a derivative of pterulone, a potent antifungal metabolite first isolated from submerged cultures of Pterula species in 1997. The antifungal activity of pterulone is based on selective inhibition of the NADH dehydrogenase enzyme of the electron transport chain. A 2008 publication reported that fatty <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> of benzoxepine serve as precursors to wound-activated chemical defense. When the fruit body is injured and the latex is exposed, an esterase enzyme (an enzyme that splits esters into an acid and an alcohol in a chemical reaction with water called hydrolysis) presumably cleaves the inactive esterified benzoxepines into their active forms, where they can help defend the mushroom against yeasts and parasitic fungi. In nature, the mushroom is rarely attacked by parasitic fungi, however, it is prone to infection by the [...] "bonnet mold" [...] Spinellus fusiger, which is insensitive to the benzoxepines of M.galopus. In an English field study, where the two fungi M.galopus and Marasmius androsaceus made up over 99% of the fruit bodies in a site under Sitka spruce, the fungivorous collembolan arthropod Onychiurus latus preferred to graze on the mycelium of M.androsaceus. This selective grazing influences the vertical distribution of the two fungi in the field.|$|E
