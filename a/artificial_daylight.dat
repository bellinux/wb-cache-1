This paper presents a method for linking <b>artificial</b> lighting with <b>daylight</b> over a whole building in real time, through a single sensor system. 	By placing a camera {{on the top of}} a building, it is possible to capture a digital image of the sky at regular intervals.

Using that information we can reconstruct any sky condition and predict/simulate the amount of available daylight at any point within a building. By utilizing a database management system, where all the simulation information is stored, we can obtain the simulated daylight levels for each point within a building, for the current sky conditions.

50|$|Besides being {{a unique}} collaboratived {{work of the}} world's {{foremost}} science fiction authors of the late 20th century, the Murasaki anthology tells several valuable lessons. First, it demonstrates how difficult {{it would be to}} find planets that could be truly colonized by humans. Genji and Chujo both are as terrestrial planets as one could reasonably expect to find, but the relatively minor deviations of their masses from Earth standard result in an atmospheric pressure gradient where unaided breathing is possible only at some places, even though the composition of gases is right for humans. Very few items from the alien biosphere can be safely eaten and/or provide nourishment. The intensity and spectral composition of the sunlight is wrong for humans. As a result, humans must bring their own food or produce it in artificial environments, and exposure to <b>artificial</b> earthly <b>daylight</b> is required to maintain physical and mental health. On Genji the gravity (although only half again as high as on Earth) is an inescapable factor that confers both acute and chronic physical risk, and appears to promote dysthymia. In summary this illustrates that even on the most Earth-like planets that might eventually be found, only outposts (but no actual colonies) will be feasible.|$|R
40|$|By {{the rise}} of {{concerns}} for global warming, reducing emissions via lowering energy consumption has become a necessity in every sector and the lighting sector is no exception. However, it should not come {{at the cost of}} lighting quality and user comfort which is a common practice in today’s lighting design and energy reduction initiatives. The “energy reduction” view should change toward “value driven optimization” in which energy reduction is balanced against lighting quality and user comfort for optimization of the total value of the building. As the use of IT technology grows in lighting design, constant reviews of the software tools are necessary in order to evaluate their performance and ability to design value driven lighting. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} compare different lighting simulation tools with respect to their ability to simulate lighting quality both <b>artificial</b> and <b>daylight.</b> The indicators for the comparison are defined based upon findings from another project “criteria for good lighting quality” that is currently being conducted at the same university.

40|$|Abstract: In recent years, {{fluorescent}} lamp dimming controls {{are an integral}} part of <b>daylight</b> <b>artificial</b> light integrated schemes intended for realization of energy savings. However, dimming, like any lighting option, presents its own particular challenges and potential tradeoffs. In view of this, the present manuscript depicts the preliminary work progress carried out to arrive at a comprehensive idea on dimming implications on key factors: electrical characteristics, photometric distributions of lighting systems and influence on quality as well as quantity of visual environment. The objective is to experimentally establish the acceptable range of dimming control voltage that would satisfy both electrical and photometric performance of luminaire. The vital part of the paper is devoted towards presentation of measurement results. For the experimental analysis, three representative samples of different commercial analog 1 - 10 VDC electronic dimmable ballasts and fluorescent fixtures are compared and evaluated over their control voltage dimming range...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find an {{appropriate}} sky model for further development of an <b>artificial</b> <b>daylight</b> solution. The current concept for the <b>artificial</b> <b>daylight</b> solution, developed at Philips Research, contains a skylight with a static sky view. To make this concept more realistic and appealing Philips is interested in investigating how to convert the current skylight solution to one that provides ‘daylight’ dynamics. These dynamics should mimic the real changes in the position of the sun in the sky and should change the lighting in the room accordingly. To implement appropriate dynamics two models widely used in literature for the luminance values of the sky over daytime were studied and based on those models two additional, simplified models for the sky luminance were developed. One of the simplified models used a homogeneous luminance value, whereas the other interpolated the luminance linearly between a minimum and maximum value. The two models from literature and the two simplified versions were implemented in Matlab and their effect on the illumination in a real room was rendered in images. For the renderings HDR environmental maps of the skies were made and used as the light source for a 3 D scene. Three different scenes all of the same room with a view outside were used: one contained only windows, one only skylights and the third one contained both. The renderings were compared in two experiments: the first experiment determined which model performed best in terms of realism and appeal of the daylight, and the second experiment determined which time of day was most realistic and appealing. The results of the experiments showed that overall the models from literature performed best, while the simplified linear model performed worst. However, for the scene with only skylights there was no significant difference between the simplified models and the models from literature, and so the simplified models were considered as realistic and appealing as the more complicated ones. The results of the second experiment showed that somehow the earliest time of the day was preferred over noon and later times of the day. From the results it can be concluded that a simplified sky model can equally well be used in an <b>artificial</b> <b>daylight</b> solution than a more complex model from literature, but only for a scene with only skylights. When there is a view to the sky near the horizon the simplified models scored significantly worse than those from literature. So, because Philips Research currently develops an artificial skylight solution the author advices to use a simple model of the sky luminance and to examine more complicated alternative models only when needed for window-type of artificial lighting solutions.
