5|$|There were {{numerous}} proposals {{at the time}} to build an electric <b>aerial</b> <b>tramway,</b> with one such line to go down the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and would hang from steel rails fixed to 6 metre high steel and iron posts positioned in 10–15 metre intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.|$|E
5|$|When {{the station}} opened in 1989, daily {{ridership}} on the Roosevelt Island Tramway, an <b>aerial</b> <b>tramway</b> that also connects Roosevelt Island to Manhattan, decreased sharply, from 5,500 daily riders in 1989 to 3,000 by 1993. In 2008, the station saw about 5,900 daily riders, compared to 3,000 for the tram, which had maintained steady ridership. Over {{the next eight}} years, the station experienced additional ridership growth. In 2016, an average of 6,630 daily riders used the station on an average weekday. This amounted to 2,110,471 total riders entering the station in 2016.|$|E

50|$|The German {{engineering}} firm of Adolf Bleichert & Co. {{was founded in}} 1874 and began to build bicable <b>aerial</b> <b>tramways</b> for mining in the Ruhr Valley. With important patents, and dozens of working systems in Europe, Bleichert dominated the global industry, later licensing its designs and manufacturing techniques to Trenton Iron Works, New Jersey, USA which built systems across America. Adolf Bleichert & Co. went on to build hundreds of <b>aerial</b> <b>tramways</b> around the world: from Alaska to Argentina, Australia and Spitsbergen. The Bleichert company also built hundreds of <b>aerial</b> <b>tramways</b> for both the Imperial German Army and the Wehrmacht.|$|R

The Roosevelt Island Tramway in New York City and the Portland Aerial Tram are examples where this technology has been successfully adapted for public transport purposes. In comparison to gondola lifts, <b>aerial</b> <b>tramways</b> provide lower line capacities, higher wait times and are unable to turn corners.|$|R

25|$|Vulkan {{and four}} German {{construction}} companies issued tenders {{for construction of}} the separation and briquette plants; as Vulkan offered the second-cheapest bid it was selected. Installations started in July 1909, but work progressed slowly, {{in part because of}} the slow progress of the foundation work. This was partially accelerated with workforce from Christiania (Oslo), but they were again hindered because local lumber could not be used for the scaffolding. There was not sand of the necessary quality for concrete in the immediate area, so an <b>aerial</b> <b>tramway</b> was constructed to from Bjørnevatn to Sandneselva.|$|E
25|$|Another company, TRAMMET, {{operates}} the city's two modern tram networks, known as Trambaix and Trambesòs.

The Funicular de Tibidabo climbs the Tibidabo hill, {{as does the}} Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC). The Funicular de Montjuïc (TMB) climbs the Montjuïc hill.

25|$|To {{build the}} final {{passenger}} tramway {{it was first}} necessary to construct a freight tramway to carry materials. Carrying cement and materials by backpack, four dozen men completed the formidable task in December. Construction of the tramway continued through the winter, with almost all the work, pouring 32 carloads of cement, assembling 232 tons of steel and four miles (6km) of cable, done by hand. It was considered an outstanding engineering feat of the period. On June 28, 1938, after nine months of construction and {{one year after the}} passage of legislation, North America’s first <b>aerial</b> <b>tramway</b> was dedicated.|$|E
