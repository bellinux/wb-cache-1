Such information may be e.g. an alert signal triggered when someone or something has breached <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> on a factory floor. While traditional safety solutions rely on dedicated communication lines connecting machinery and control systems via special relays, openSAFETY does not need any extra cables reserved for safety-related information.

According to international standards the safety related systems are categorized according to their Safety Integrity Lev-els or Performance Levels, depending on their reliability parameters.

The method(s) based on the required availability of the system. The paper presents some practical examples of systems of categories B, 1 and 3, respectively.

40|$|Workplace {{accidents}} involving machines are relevant for their magnitude and their impacts on worker health. Despite consolidated critical statements, explanation centered on errors of operators remains predominant with industry professionals, hampering preventive measures and {{the improvement of}} production-system reliability. Several initiatives were adopted by enforcement agencies in partnership with universities to stimulate production and diffusion of analysis methodologies with a systemic approach. Starting from one accident case that occurred with a worker who operated a brake-clutch type mechanical press, the article explores cognitive aspects {{and the existence of}} traps in the operation of this machine. It deals with a large-sized press that, despite being endowed with <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> in areas of access to the pressing zone, did not meet legal requirements. The safety devices gave rise to an illusion of safety, permitting activation of the machine when a worker was still found within the operational zone. Preventive interventions must stimulate the tailoring of systems to the characteristics of workers, minimizing the creation of traps and encouraging safety policies and practices that replace judgments of behaviors that participate in accidents by analyses of reasons that lead workers to act in that manner...|$|E

40|$|Advances in {{the usage}} of {{computer}} imaging, communication technologies and the successful development of new techniques for precision agriculture have facilitated a smart-digital revolution in row crop agriculture in recent years. The use of a yield monitor, variable rate application (VRA) for fertilizer and herbicides, soil property maps and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology has enabled the development of computer generated prescription maps for farm management. All these technologies are changing agricultural practices from simple mechanical operations to automated operations implemented by robotic-based systems. The automation of individual crop plant care in vegetable crop fields has increased its practical feasibility and improved efficiency and economic benefit. A systems-based approach is a key feature in the mechanization engineering design via the incorporation of precision sensing techniques. The objective {{of this study was}} to design sensing capabilities for Implementation to measure plant spacing under different test conditions (California, USA and Andalucía, Spain). Three different optical sensors were used: <b>an</b> optical <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> transmitter and receiver (880 nm), a LiDAR sensor (905 nm), and an RGB camera. An active photoelectric transmission sensor, which contained 3 pairs of optical <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> transmitters and receivers, evaluated the interruption by the tomato stem of the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> between the two devices, and was recorded simultaneously in real-time by a high-speed embedded control system.

Additionally, a RGB spatial mosaicked image was used to adjust the data from the light beam and LiDAR sensor and obtain combined information (RGBD where D is for distance).
