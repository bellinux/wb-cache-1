5|$|Like her {{predecessor}} Rudd, Gillard {{had said}} that health is <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> her agenda. She announced during the 2010 election, {{that there would be}} an increase of 270 placements for emergency doctors and nurses and 3,000 extra nursing scholarships over the following 10 years. She also said mental health would be <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> her second term, with a $277million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups. As the election delivered a hung parliament, a $1.8billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its limited}} release, English-language copies of Panzer Dragoon Saga are rare and sell for high prices. It {{has not been}} re-released. In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn emulation is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it <b>a</b> <b>priority.</b> <b>In</b> the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, which would make porting the game difficult.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Senegal {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on tourism early in its history. The results were promising, and developing the industry further became <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> the country's 4th Economic and Social Plan (19731977). Casamance subsequently became the main tourist destination in the country. Already having been described in the 19th century by Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe {{as a kind of}} Brazil in Africa, Carabane seemed well-placed to attract visitors in search of exoticism as well as vacationers seeking sandy beaches and kite surfing.|$|E

5|$|The {{support of}} missionary work was also <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century. The first General Assembly {{requested}} {{that each of}} the four synods appoint and support two missionaries. Presbyterians took leading roles in creating early local and independent mission societies, including the New York Missionary Society (1796), the Northern Berkshire and Columbia Missionary Societies (1797), the Missionary Society of Connecticut (1798), the Massachusetts Missionary Society (1799), and the Boston Female Society for Missionary Purposes (1800). The first denominational missions agency was the Standing Committee on Mission, which was created in 1802 to coordinate efforts with individual presbyteries and the European missionary societies. The work of the committee was expanded in 1816, becoming the Board of Missions.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1374, Louis granted various {{concessions}} to the Polish nobility by the Privilege of Koszyce, {{in exchange for their}} promise that a daughter of his would succeed him and that he, Elizabeth or his mother could indicate which one. In Hungary, he focused on the centralization of power as means of ensuring that his daughters' rights would be respected. Securing marriage to one of the princesses was <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> European royal courts. Mary was scarcely one year old when she was promised to Sigismund of Luxembourg. In 1374, Catherine was betrothed to Louis of France, but died towards the end of 1378. The same year, Hedwig, promised to William of Austria in a sponsalia de futuro, left her mother's court and moved to Vienna, where she spent the next two years. The Polish lords swore to uphold Mary's rights in 1379, while Sigismund received this recognition three years later. Elizabeth was present, along with her husband and mother-in-law, at a meeting in Zólyom on 12 February 1380, whereby Hungarian lords confirmed Hedwig's Austrian match; this indicates that Louis may have intended to leave Hungary to Hedwig and William.|$|E
5|$|Research is <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> {{terms of}} {{improving}} women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women {{and those that}} differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E

5|$|The gray wolf's {{range in}} the Soviet Union {{encompassed}} nearly the entire territory of the country, being absent only on the Solovetsky Islands, Franz-Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya, and the Karagin, Commander and Shantar Islands. The species was exterminated twice in Crimea, once after the Russian Civil War, and again after World War II. Following the two world wars, Soviet wolf populations peaked twice. 30,000 wolves were harvested annually out of a population of 200,000 during the 1940s, with 40,000–50,000 harvested during peak years. Soviet wolf populations reached a low around 1970, disappearing over much of European Russia. The population increased again by 1980 to about 75,000, with 32,000 being killed in 1979. Wolf populations in northern inner Mongolia declined during the 1940s, primarily because of poaching of gazelles, the wolf's main prey. In British-ruled India, wolves were heavily persecuted because of their attacks on sheep, goats and children. In 1876, 2,825 wolves were bountied in the North-Western Provinces (NWP) and Bihar. By the 1920s, wolf extermination remained <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> <b>in</b> the NWP and Awadh. Overall, over 100,000 wolves were killed for bounties in British India between 1871 and 1916.|$|E
