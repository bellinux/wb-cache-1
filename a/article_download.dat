40|$|ABSTRACT. Managing The Ohio State University Libraries ' {{collection}} of chemistry journals within OhioLINK's consortial environment mixes objective assessment with engaging the chemistry faculty and the consortium. Basing collection decisions on hard facts has the immediate goal of cost-effectiveness. The most effective technique is a mediated three-party dialogue {{of the library}} managers, the chemistry faculty, and the consortium with the long-term goal of reforming scholarly communication. Many methods to assess electronic journals are available, such as <b>article</b> <b>download</b> statistics, impact factors, Eigenfactors, cost per article and cost per citation data, and engaging faculty input. The reality, however, is that high subscription costs do not diminish the importance of chemistry journals to the faculty. Assessment of consortial electronic journal subscription packages is crucial to managing collection content effectively, but library managers and chemistry faculty often disagree about the appropriate assessment method. The most effective approach {{is a combination of}} several assessment methods coupled with clear and open communication of the facts. Communicating the results of the assessment techniques is more than a matter of giving the faculty the bad news. The most effective and credible assessment methodology always includes communicating faculty input to the consortium. Difficult decisions are easier to make, announce, and live with when all stakeholders openly share information...|$|E
40|$|Background : {{the aim of}} {{the article}} is to conduct an {{overview}} of the impact of OA on the medical articles based on 3 -part categorization. Methods : Data were identified by a search strategy with eight combinations of keywords (open access, citation impact, citation advantage, citation count, <b>article</b> <b>download,</b> article usage, social media attention, altmetrics) and searched in three diﬀerent databases. Results : the analysis was conducted on 107 studies dealing with citations, downloads and social impact. Sixty-seven of them simply employed the counting citations to OA and non-OA articles; nineteen articles compared the downloads and citations counts; and twenty-one articles investigated the social impact of OA articles. Twenty-five articles investigated the citations, download counts, and social impact of medical articles. Conclusions : The studies investigating the citation impact mostly showed citation advantages. Those that employed citation and download counts of medical articles using randomized controlled trials showed that OA articles were downloaded significantly more frequently, but found no evidence of a citation advantage for open access articles. The citation advantage from open access might be caused by other factors. Results of the studies comparing the social media attention and citations/downloads of the medical articles are often diametrically opposed. </p...|$|E

40|$|Important {{emerging}} {{measures of}} academic impact are <b>article</b> <b>download</b> and citation rates. Yet {{little is known}} about the influences on these and ways in which academics might manage this approach to dissemination. Three groups of papers by academics in a center for speech-language-science (available through a university repository) were compared. The first group of target papers were blogged, and the blogs were systematically tweeted. The second group of connected control papers were nonblogged papers that we carefully matched for author, topic, and year of publication. The third group were papers by different staff members on a variety of topics—Unrelated Control Papers. The results suggest an effect of social media on download rate, which was limited not just to Target Papers but also generalized to Connected Control Papers. Unrelated Control Papers showed no increase over the same amount of time (main effect of time, F(1, 27) [*]=[*] 55. 6, p[*]<[*]. 001); Significant Group×Time Interaction, F(2, 27) [*]=[*] 7. 9, p[*]=[*]. 002). The effect on citation rates was less clear but followed the same trend. The only predictor of the 2015 citation rate was downloads after blogging (r[*]=[*] 0. 450, p[*]=[*]. 012).

40|$|Correlation between <b>article</b> <b>download</b> and {{citation}} {{figures for}} highly accessed articles from five open access oncology journals Carsten Nieder 1, 2 *, Astrid Dalhaug 1, 2 and Gro Aandahl 1 Different approaches can be chosen {{to quantify the}} impact and merits of scientific oncology publications. These include source of publication (including journal reputation and impact factor), whether or not articles are cited by others, and access/download figures. When relying on citation counts, one needs to obtain access to citation databases and has to consider that results differ from one database to another. Accumulation of citations takes time and their dynamics might differ from journal to journal and topic to topic. Therefore, we wanted to evaluate the correlation between citation and download figures, hypothesising that articles with fewer downloads also accumulate fewer citations. Typically, publishers provide download figures together with the article. We extracted and analysed the 50 most viewed articles from 5 different open access oncology journals. For each of the 5 journals and also all journals combined, correlation between number of accesses and citations was limited (r = 0. 01 - 0. 30). Considerable variations were also observed when analyses were restricted to specific article types such as reviews only (r = 0. 21) or case reports only (r = 0. 53). Even if year of publication was taken into account, high correlation coefficients were the exception from the rule. In conclusion, downloads are not a universal surrogate for citation figures...|$|E

30|$|Comparable {{to other}} medical specialties, {{the field of}} {{oncology}} has developed rapidly over the last decades. The number of scientific publications continues to increase, {{and so does the}} number of available publication channels and methods. Open access journals have gained increasing popularity, but traditional well established high impact journals continue to attract important research and landmark clinical trials (Young et al. 2008;Stringer et al. 2008). Such research is likely to accumulate a high number of citations in the years to follow (Owlia et al. 2011). We have recently analysed pattern of citation for different fields of oncology in order to identify research mainstreams and advances, and to review the most influential preclinical and clinical developments (Nieder, 2012;Nieder et al. 2012 b; 2012 a). Citation figures might be obtained from different sources, with known inconsistency from one to another (Durieux & Gevenois, 2010). Previous studies suggested more or less strong correlations between <b>article</b> <b>download</b> and citation figures for several areas of scientific research (Watson, 2009;Schloegl & Gorraiz, 2010). We hypothesised that oncology might follow the same traits and that frequently downloaded articles eventually also accumulate more citations than less frequently viewed articles. If true, download figures obtained from a journal's homepage might be less error prone and earlier available than citation counts, which often peak after considerable lag time. Initially we looked at the first author's own open access publications from the time period 2006 – 2011. For 12 articles with available access figures, a high correlation coefficient was identified (r[*]=[*] 0.87, p[*]<[*] 0.001) and therefore we decided to embark on a larger and more detailed analysis, which included several open access journals covering either all aspects or specific areas of cancer research and treatment.|$|E

Clinical Nurse Specialists working {{across a variety of}} fields are playing an increasingly important role in the care of such patients, but there is limited knowledge {{of the extent to which}} their interventions are cost-effective. Objectives: To present results from a systematic review of the international evidence on the costs, resource use and cost-effectiveness of Clinical Nurse Specialist–led interventions for patients with palliative care needs, defined as seriously ill patients and those with advanced disease or frailty who are unlikely to be cured, recover or stabilize. Design: Systematic review following PRISMA methodology. Data sources: Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library up to 2015. Studies focusing on the outcomes of Clinical Nurse Specialist interventions for patients with palliative care needs, and including at least one economic outcome, were considered. The quality of studies was assessed using tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Results: A total of 79 papers were included: 37 randomized controlled trials, 22 quasi-experimental studies, 7 service evaluations and other studies, and 13 economic analyses. The studies included a wide variety of interventions including clinical, support and education, as well as care coordination activities. The quality of the studies varied greatly. Conclusion: Clinical Nurse Specialist interventions may be effective in reducing specific resource use such as hospitalizations/re-hospitalizations/admissions, length of stay and health care costs. There is mixed evidence regarding their cost-effectiveness. Future studies should ensure that Clinical Nurse Specialists’ roles and activities are clearly described and evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Objective – To test a {{new model}} formeasuring journal impact by using {{principles}} of social networking. Research questions are as follows: 1. Can valid networks of journal relationships be derived from reader <b>article</b> <b>download</b> patterns registered in a digital library’s server logs? 2. Can social network metrics of journal impact validly be calculated from the structure of such networks? 3. If so, how do the resulting journal impact rankings relate to the ISI impact factor (IF) ? Design – Bibliometric, social network centrality analysis Setting – Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), New Mexico Subjects – 40, 847 full‐text articles downloaded from a large digital library by 1, 858 unique users over a 6 month period. Methods – Full‐text article downloads from a large digital library for a six‐month period were examined using social networking analysis methods. ISSNs for journals in which the retrieved articles were published were paired based upon the proximity of use by the same user, based on the supposition that proximal downloads are related in some way. Reader‐Generated Networks (RGNs) were then tested for small‐world characteristics. The resulting RGN data were then compared with Author‐Generated Networks (AGNs) for the same journals indexed in the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) annual impact factor (IF) rankings, in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) database. Next, {{a sample of the}} AGN‐derived pairings was examined by a team of 22 scientists, who were asked to rate the strength of relationships between journals on a five‐point scale. Centrality ratings were calculated for the AGN and RGN sets of journals, {{as well as for the}} ISI IF. Main results – Closeness and centrality rankings for the ISI IF and the AGN metrics were low, but significant, suggesting that centrality metrics are an acceptable impact metric. Comparison between the RGN and ISI IF data found marked differences, with RGN mirroring local population needs to a much higher degree, and with a nonsignificant correlation between the ISI IF and RGN ranking, while AGN and RGN centrality rankings show significant centrality and closeness and betweenness correlations. RGN network ranking identified highly localized foci of interest for the LANL, as well as “interest‐bridging” subject areas pointing to possible emerging interests among the scientists. Conclusion – The study results appear to successfully demonstrate an alternative to existing journal impact ranking that can more validly and accurately reflect thepractices of a local community. The authors suggest that the social network‐derived methodology for identification of impact rankings avoids biases intrinsic to ISI IF as a result of frequentist metrics collected from ag lobal user group. Although the authors resist the idea of generalizability due to the local nature of their data, they suggest that the methodology can be successfully used in other settings, and for a more global community. Finally, the authors propose the automated creation of an open‐source RGN whose data could be localized for smaller communities, with potentially large implications for the existing publishing industry...|$|E
