5|$|The new Indian River Inlet Bridge {{opened to}} {{southbound}} traffic on January 20, 2012. Delaware Governor Jack Markell, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, and DelDOT Secretary Shailen Bhatt rode {{in the first}} car <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> On January 30, 2012, one northbound lane of the new bridge opened. On May 6, 2012, the Indian River Inlet Bridge was officially dedicated in a public ceremony in which visitors were able to walk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> All remaining lanes of the four-lane bridge {{as well as its}} pedestrian and bicycle walkway opened that day.|$|E
5|$|Originally, a toll {{was paid}} for each {{direction}} of travel with sets of toll booths on both carriageways. In 1997, the northbound toll was doubled (from 40p to 80p) and the southbound toll abolished on the presumption that almost all traffic makes a return journey <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> and that {{the removal of the}} southbound toll would result in a reduction of congestion without reducing revenue.|$|E
50|$|The project also {{included}} a pedestrian walkway to provide foot traffic access <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> {{features}} - besides its striking architecture - {{a dynamic}} lighting design {{that is based}} on subtle colours that flow <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge's</b> spine, symbolising <b>the</b> connecting nature of <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and <b>the</b> energy that the capital city Abu Dhabi radiates.|$|R

5|$|The initial toll {{for cars}} was 3s (15p) {{for a single}} journey <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> or 4/6 (22½p) for a return, while for lorries it was 14s (70p) and £1 respectively. The Saltash Ferry closed, but the Torpoint Ferry {{remained}} in operation; management of the ferry and the bridge is shared so the two crossings are not in direct competition with each other.|$|E
5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that this bridge was used by George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under construction and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull helping their horses <b>across.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State authorities would not go through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, a new {{railroad}} {{bridge was}} constructed {{adjacent to the}} Long Bridge {{as part of a}} plan to strengthen the logistics of the Army of the Potomac as it operated in northern Virginia. An extension of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, the bridge would be used until {{the turn of the century}} before being replaced. Owing to the weight of the railroad and the weak strength of the bridge, no locomotives were allowed on the bridge. Prior to crossing the Potomac, the train would detach its locomotive and be pulled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> by a team of horses.|$|E

5|$|Old Gotham, {{the section}} of Gotham City which will become the Arkham City prison, is not yet walled off and has slums, low buildings, a {{shopping}} mall and docks (where Penguin's ship, the Final Offer, is moored). On the Final Offer, Penguin has added a casino, a fighting pit and a sales floor with weapons and ammunition. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> from Old Gotham is New Gotham, a modern metropolitan area filled with towering skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|On November 27, 1998, King County Metro driver Mark McLaughlin, {{the driver}} of a {{southbound}} route 359 Express articulated bus, {{was shot and killed}} by a passenger, Silas Cool, while driving <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> Cool then shot himself as the bus veered across two lanes of traffic and plunged off the bridge's eastern side onto the roof of an apartment building below. Herman Liebelt, a passenger on the bus, later died of injuries he sustained in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Past NY182, I-190 {{turns to}} the northwest, {{skirting}} the northeastern edge of Niagara Falls and roughly paralleling NY265 to the east. In Lewiston, the expressway meets NY31 at exit24 southwest of the large Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant reservoir. I-190 continues onward, crossing the canal between the reservoir and the power plant on a small dam also used by NY265. The freeway then interchanges with NY265, the Niagara Scenic Parkway, and NY104 at the expansive exit25 before curving {{to the west and}} terminating at the approach to the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in Queenston, Ontario, the roadway becomes Highway405.|$|E

Although it was beset by early problems {{and had to be}} closed for a month three weeks after it opened, it {{has become one of the}} UK's most popular attractions, with 800,000 visitors a year. The Serpentine Gallery nearby is also on the south bank and the Serpentine Sackler Gallery opened in 2013 is located in a former 1805 gunpowder store, five minutes walk from the Serpentine Gallery <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1950s Chelsea Bridge {{became a}} {{favourite}} meeting place for motorcyclists, who would race <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> on Friday nights. On 17 October 1970 a serious confrontation {{took place on}} Chelsea Bridge between the Essex and Chelsea chapters of the Hells Angels, and rival motorcycle gangs the Road Rats, Nightingales, Windsor Angels and Jokers. Around 50 people {{took part in the}} fight; weapons used included motorcycle chains, flick knives and at least one spiked flail. One member of the Jokers was shot with a sawn-off shotgun and fatally wounded, and 20 of those present were sentenced to between one and twelve years imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Hands Across Hawthorne was a rally {{held at the}} Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011. The {{demonstration}} was {{in response}} to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been holding hands while walking <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> According to the couple and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, a nonprofit organization that supports the LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area.|$|E

Mercer, on orders from Washington, moved his column to the right in order to hit the British before they could confront Washington's main army. Mercer moved towards Mawhood's rear but when he realized {{he would not be}} able to cut off Mawhood in time, he decided to join Sullivan. When Mawhood learned that Mercer was in his rear and moving to join Sullivan, Mawhood detached part of the 55th Regiment to join the 40th Regiment in the town and then moved the rest of the 55th, the 17th, fifty cavalry and two artillery pieces to attack Mercer.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll collection system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Steiger {{made his}} film debut in Fred Zinnemann's Teresa in 1951, and {{subsequently}} appeared in {{films such as}} The Big Knife (1955), Oklahoma! (1955), <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bridge</b> (1957) and Al Capone (1959). After Steiger's performance in The Pawnbroker in 1964, in which he played an embittered Jewish Holocaust survivor working as a pawnbroker in New York City, he portrayed an opportunistic Russian politician in David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965). In the Heat of the Night (1967) won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger, who was lauded for his performance as a Mississippi police chief who learns to respect an African-American officer (Poitier) as they search for a killer. The following year, he played a serial killer of many guises in No Way to Treat a Lady.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{advanced}} {{across the}} river and established two bridgeheads. The first was <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{on the main road}} near Khirbet Hadrah (also referred to as Khurbet Hadra) and the second was at Sheik Muanis, near the mouth of the river. These operations had two aims– to gain territory and discourage the Ottoman Eighth Army from transferring troops into the Judean Hills to reinforce the Seventh Army. After successful actions by the New Zealand Mounted Brigade, two infantry battalions of the 54th (East Anglian) Division held these two bridgeheads on the northern bank until they were attacked by overwhelming forces on 25 November. The 3rd and 7th Divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army had driven in the bridgeheads and restored the tactical situation.|$|E

After a group of crazies destroy it, the group returns to the street and {{encounters}} Cabbie, who offers to take them <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> When Cabbie reveals that he has the secret tape (having traded it to Romero earlier for his hat), the President demands it, but Snake keeps it.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45 on 25 November an Ottoman cavalry patrol near Khurbet Hadrah was chased {{off by a}} {{troop of}} 3rd Squadron Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment. Within an hour, the Ottoman 3rd and 7th Divisions {{launched}} a heavy attack on the squadron, which withdrew to a prearranged line. Just 30minutes later another withdrawal was forced. At about 08:00 infantry units of the 54th (East Anglian) Division at Khurbet Hadrah were ordered back across the river. It was an extremely difficult operation as the bridge was now being swept by enemy fire and continuously shelled by artillery. Some individuals succeeded in crossing the bridge; some swam the river and some drowned. Once the infantry were clear, the 3rd Squadron, Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment followed them <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> The 11th (North Auckland) Squadron (Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment) covered them with two Vickers guns at great cost, continuing to hold the bridge until 11:00, when they withdrew.|$|E
