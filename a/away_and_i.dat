Farouk Abdulhak remains wanted for the rape and murder of Martine Vik Magnussen. Farouk Abdulhak has known {{for the past eight years}} now that he is wanted for the rape and murder of Magnussen. There have been {{extensive}} diplomatic efforts made over this time to return him to the UK, to no avail. This anniversary should serve as a further reminder that he cannot put this behind him, it will not go <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> appeal to him and those close to him to advise him to return to the UK to stand trial.|$|E

500|$|The {{first episode}} of the season, [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today", {{gathered}} 10.6 million viewers, whereas the second part gathered only 9.4 million viewers. On May 19, 2002, the series finale, [...] "The Truth", aired, and the Fox Broadcasting Company confirmed that The X-Files was not being renewed for a tenth season. When talking about {{the beginning of the}} ninth season, Chris Carter said, [...] "We lost our audience on the first episode. It's like the audience had gone <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back." [...] "The Truth" [...] received the highest Nielsen household rating and viewership numbers of the season. It earned a 7.5 rating and gathered 13.25 million viewers in the United States. The loss of viewers resulted in this season seeing a 30 percent ratings drop when compared to the eighth season.|$|E

The ninth {{season was}} the 63rd most-watched {{show for the}} 2001–02 season, tying its season two rank. On May 19, 2002, the finale aired and the Fox network confirmed that The X-Files was over. When talking about {{the beginning of the}} ninth season, Carter said [...] "We lost our audience on the first episode. It's like the audience had gone <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back." [...] While news outlets cited declining ratings because of lackluster stories and poor writing, The X-Files production crew blamed September 11 terrorist attacks as the main factor. At the end of 2002, The X-Files had become the longest-running consecutive science fiction series ever on U.S. broadcast television. This record was later surpassed by Stargate SG-1 in 2007 and Smallville in 2011.|$|E
500|$|... "Nothing Important Happened Today, Part 1" [...] {{earned a}} Nielsen {{household}} rating of 6.5 share, {{meaning that it}} was seen by 6.5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 10.6 million viewers and ranked number 55 for the week ending November 11 and subsequently became the second most watched episode of the ninth season behind the series finale [...] "The Truth".

500|$|By {{the time}} of the Maharishi's death in 2008, more than 5 million people had learned Transcendental Meditation, and his {{worldwide}} movement was valued in the billions of dollars. The ashram, built on land belonging to the Rajaji National Park, was reclaimed by the government in the mid-1990s after the lease expired in 1981, and fell into disrepair. After the Maharishi died, McCartney said: [...] "my memories of him will only be joyful ones. He was a great man who worked tirelessly {{for the people of the}} world and the cause of unity". Starr said in 2008, [...] "I feel so blessed I met the Maharishi– he gave me a mantra that no one can take <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> still use it". In 2009, McCartney, Starr, Donovan, and Horn reunited at a concert held at New York's Radio City Music Hall to benefit the David Lynch Foundation, which funds the teaching of Transcendental Meditation in schools. A 2008 article in Rolling Stone magazine reported Yoko Ono as saying: [...] "John would have been the first one now, if he had been here, to recognize and acknowledge what Maharishi has done for the world and appreciate it". Author Gary Tillery wrote in 2010 that Lennon [...] "benefited from the experience" [...] and [...] "for the rest of his life he often turned to meditation to restore himself and improve his creativity." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Subway" [...] {{was shot}} by Alex Zakrzewski, the series' regular {{director}} of photography. The episode was staged so that Pembleton is initially keeping his distance from Lange, but gradually moves closer and closer as they begin to bond, {{and by the end}} is sitting next to him and holding his hand. Accordingly, the initial scenes included wider shots with Braugher and D'Onofrio on the outer edges of the frame, but later scenes included more close-ups of the two sitting together. Although Homicide: Life on the Street typically employs a number of back-and-forth whip pan-style cuts, Fleder asked that the style be modified for this episode. In earlier scenes, Fleder asked for wider long shots {{to create a sense of}} setting within the subway station, and as the episode progressed and the story became more intense, he then allowed more close-ups and whip pans. This led to disagreements on the set between Fleder and Zakrzewski, who felt Fleder was trying to being too disruptive and difficult. Fleder said of his behavior, [...] "I have to admit, I'm not the most charming guy on the set. I'm just not. When I'm on the set, I'm very focused and my humor goes <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> become not so charming." [...] After the episode was complete, Fleder said that he and Zakrzewski settled their differences and were both happy with the final result.|$|E
500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed <b>away.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> hate to say this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fix a Heart" [...] is a pop piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is composed in the key of C major and has a tempo of 54 beats per minute. Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain". The track {{has been described by}} some critics and the singer herself as a break-up song, which is demonstrated in the chorus, [...] "Baby, I just ran out of bandaids / I don't even know where to start / 'Cause you can bandage the damage / You never really can fix a heart". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never really can fix a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I think every time you get your heart broken, there's a little piece of it that chips <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't think you ever get that piece back. But I think you're able to bandage it with time and with new people and other things that make you happy".|$|E

Then I ask you to {{put your finger on}} a shell. The odds that your choice contains a pea are , agreed? Then I simply lift up an empty shell from the remaining other two. As I can (and will) do this regardless of what you've chosen, we've learned nothing to allow us to revise the odds on the shell under your finger." [...] She also proposed a similar simulation with three playing cards.|$|E
2500|$|Kudrow {{was cast}} {{to play the}} role of Roz Doyle in Frasier, but the role was re-cast with Peri Gilpin during the filming of the pilot episode. Kudrow said in 2000 that when rehearsals started, [...] "I knew it wasn't working. I could feel it all {{slipping}} <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was panicking, which only made things worse". Her first recurring television role was Ursula Buffay, the eccentric waitress on the NBC sitcom Mad About You. Kudrow would reprise the character on the NBC sitcom Friends, in which Kudrow co-starred as massage therapist Phoebe Buffay, Ursula's twin sister.|$|E
2500|$|Zilch bassist Paul Raven said [...] "I saw him a {{few days}} before he passed <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had no {{indication}} from him that anything was wrong other than that he was exhausted", but commented that hide was [...] "under a lot of stress", due to the recording schedule for the Ja, Zoo album. He went on to question the ultimate degree of hide's involvement in the finished record, remarking that only three songs had been completed before he died. However, hide's brother and manager stated in his 2010 book that six songs were completed by the time of his death. This is supported by the fact that I.N.A is credited with additional arrangement on four of the album's ten tracks.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{none of the}} parties, {{save for}} perhaps Gene Clark, seemed willing to {{contribute}} their best material to the album, instead holding back their finest songs for their own individual solo projects. [...] This has been confirmed by Hillman, who told author John Einarson [...] "I'll be honest, I contributed my worst material because I {{was getting ready to}} do a solo record, Slipping <b>Away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was saving all my good stuff and contributed this throwaway stuff that was awful. Crosby's stuff was sketchy and Roger had 'Born To Rock & Roll', which was terrible, yuck." [...] McGuinn also supported the suggestion that some band members had held back their best material, although he added [...] "I don't think I was guilty of that. I gave them my best stuff at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|After filming Cobra, {{the cast}} of The Hooded Falcon sailed for France to be fitted for costumes. After three months, they {{returned}} to the United States, where Valentino's new beard, which he had grown for the film, caused a sensation. [...] "I opened once a paper and I tell you what was in. It was Rudolph Valentino with a beard upon his chin. My heart stopped off from beating and I fainted dead <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never want to come to life until the judgement day," [...] was soon printed in Photoplay. The cast and crew left for Hollywood to begin preparations for the film, but much of the budget was taken up during preproduction. Due to the Valentinos' lavish spending on costumes and sets, Ritz-Carlton terminated the deal with the couple, effectively ending Valentino's contract with Ritz-Carlton.|$|E
2500|$|A third enemy plane {{appeared}} in my ‘10 o’clock’, {{from the right}} to the left: in simple words, almost in the opposite direction. [...] The first MiG zoomed <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> engaged the afterburner to get in an attack position against this new enemy. [...] I reared up my aircraft in a 45 degree angle, inside his turn. [...] He was turning to the left, so I pulled the stick and barrel-rolled to the right. [...] Thanks to this maneuver, I found myself above him, half upside down. [...] I held it until the MiG finished his turn, calculating the time so that, if I could keep on turning behind him, I would get on his tail, with a deflection angle of 20 degrees, {{at a distance of}} 1,500 yards. [...] That was exactly what happened. [...] He never saw me. [...] Behind and lower than him, I could clearly see his silhouette against the sun when I launched two Sidewinders. One of them impacted and tore apart his right wing.|$|E

2500|$|On April 13, Lincoln invited Stanton, Grant {{and their}} wives to join him at Ford's Theatre the next evening. Lincoln had invited Stanton {{to go with him}} to the theatre several times, invitations Stanton {{routinely}} rejected. Further, neither of Stanton or Grant's wives would go unless the other went. The Grants used a visit to their children in New Jersey as their excuse. Finally, Lincoln decided to go to the theatre with Major Henry Rathbone and his betrothed. Stanton retired home that night after visiting a bedridden Secretary Seward. He went to bed at about 10 pm. Soon after, he heard Ellen yell from downstairs: [...] "Mr. Seward is murdered!" [...] Stanton rushed downstairs. Upon hearing that Lincoln, too, might be dead, Stanton grew intensely animated. He wanted to leave immediately. He was cautioned: [...] "You mustn't go out ... As I came up to the house I saw a man behind the tree-box, but he ran <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did not follow him." [...] Stanton paid little mind to the man; he found a taxi and went to Seward's home.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} test of the series he was {{dismissed}} for 26 again chasing a wide one when looking set also after 4 centuries were scored by England batsmen in the innings at Lord's, he then scored a hundred in the second innings when England were looking to accelerate. Pietersen posted his highest score of 226 in the second Test at Headingley (it was scored in 262 balls, with 24 fours and 2 sixes), surpassing his previous best of 158 which he had achieved three times. With this score, Pietersen moved ahead of Everton Weekes and Viv Richards to be the batsman with the second-highest run-total out of his first 25 Tests (behind Don Bradman). It is also the highest Test score for England since Graham Gooch scored 333 against India in 1990. This innings subjected the West Indies to an innings and 283 runs defeat, their largest against any team. Pietersen, the Man of the Match, said, [...] "I believe the recipe for success is hard work. I've been criticised for throwing my wicket <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{tried to make it}} count here".|$|E
2500|$|As {{the nineties}} progressed, Harper {{maintained}} her role and by 1996, {{was one of}} only three remaining cast members of the original 16, alongside screen son, Karl Burnett (Nick Harrison) and Angela Dotchin (Kirsty Knight). Dotchin departed two years later, leaving only the Harrison family as the remaining original cast. Several months later, Harper quit the role after falling in love with a man she met at a fancy dress party. Harper was pleased to be in a relationship upon leaving the show due to Jenny's constant thoroughfare of poor romances. The character of Jenny's best friend, Marj Brasch (Elizabeth McRae) was reintroduced to the soap in her final episodes as a means of writing her out. Shortly after quitting Harper realized the extent of how happy she was, stating, [...] "The week I finished I was on my bike cycling <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'Oh, I have no lines to learn, how wonderful'." [...] Following Jenny's departure in August 1998, only one original cast member remained on the show, being that of her son Nick. Harper reprised the role in 2002 for her onscreen son's wedding.|$|E
