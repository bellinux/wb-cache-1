5|$|New Moon set {{records as}} the biggest midnight opening in {{domestic}} (United States and Canada) box office history, grossing an estimated $26.3 million in 3,514 theaters. The record was previously held by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which grossed $22.2 million domestically during its midnight premiere. In 2010, the following sequel, , broke New Moons record with $30 million in over 4,000 theaters but surpassed by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, which made $43.5 million in 2011. The film grossed $72.7 million on its opening day domestically, becoming the biggest single-day opening in domestic history, beating The Dark Knights $67.2 million. This opening strongly contributed to <b>another</b> <b>record</b> — {{the first time that}} the Top 10 films at the domestic box office had a combined gross of over $100 million in a single day. The record was later broken in 2011 by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, which made $91.1 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in North America on May 24, 1989, in 2,327 theaters, earning $29,355,021 in its opening weekend. This was the third-highest opening weekend of 1989, behind Ghostbusters II and Batman. Its opening day gross of $11,181,429 {{was the first time}} a film had made over $10million on its first day. It broke the record for the best six-day performance, with almost $47million, added <b>another</b> <b>record</b> with $77million after twelve days, and $100million in nineteen days. It grossed $195.7million {{by the end of the}} year and $475 million worldwide by March 1990. In France, the film broke a record by selling a million admissions within two and a half weeks.|$|E
5|$|The team {{remained}} at Olympic Park {{until the end}} of the 2000 season, when it was decided that due to attracting larger home crowds which were now averaging 14,622 spectators, they decided to relocate to the much larger capacity Docklands Stadium for the following season. However, due to Docklands stadium being primarily suited to AFL games and in addition the AFL and stadium management being reluctant to reconfigure the seating for Rugby League games and coupled with the team missing the finals that year, crowd numbers declined and it was decided to move the team back to Olympic Park. Docklands stadium was still used by the Storm for home finals until 2010 and this allowed a home final attendance record of 33,427 to be set in 2007 in the Preliminary Final against Parramatta. As the finals are now played at AAMI Park, this is <b>another</b> <b>record</b> that currently cannot be broken.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Paramore holding {{electric}} guitars, heading towards {{the side of}} a bridge. They begin smashing clocks with guitars on a roadside, and a title screen appears, announcing that the band broke the record of smashing 30 clocks with guitars— at a time of 31.33 seconds. The camera shifts to a room where the group attempts to catch flying feathers; Davis breaks the record of catching the most (18) feathers in 30 s. The next scene shows the group wearing eye goggles, in a room with white walls, destroying vinyl records in several ways—such as ripping them, stepping on them or punching them. The band breaks <b>another</b> <b>record,</b> after smashing 58 vinyl records in a minute, the highest number of broken records for that time. While the band is destroying more records, York makes a record as an individual by spinning a record on his finger for 32.81 s—the least time ever for that accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|The {{wind power}} {{industry}} set new records in 2014 – more than 50 GW of new capacity was installed. <b>Another</b> <b>record</b> breaking year occurred in 2015, with 22% annual market growth {{resulting in the}} 60 GW mark being passed. In 2015, close to half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America. This was largely from new construction in China and India. Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) figures show that 2015 recorded an increase of installed capacity of more than 63 GW, taking the total installed wind energy capacity to 432.9 GW, up from 74 GW in 2006. In terms of economic value, the wind energy sector {{has become one of}} the important players in the energy markets, with the total investments reaching bn (bn), an increase of 4% over 2014.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing <b>another</b> <b>record</b> for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

5|$|With the {{departure}} of Moore, Lynott decided to expand the line-up with two guitarists, and recruited two new members to complete a tour of Germany in May 1974. These were ex-Atomic Rooster and Hard Stuff guitarist John Cann, and Berlin-born Andy Gee, who had played with Peter Bardens and Ellis. It soon emerged that this lineup would be a temporary one, as Lynott and Cann did not get on well personally, and Gee was under contract to <b>another</b> <b>record</b> label. The tour was ended early when a disillusioned Downey quit the band {{and had to be}} begged to reconsider, at a time when Thin Lizzy's contract with Decca was coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|Chosen to {{represent}} the OHL in the 2008 ADT Canada-Russia Challenge in November, Hodgson recorded a hat-trick and added an assist {{in the first of}} two games against Russia; he was chosen as game MVP. He went on to complete the month of November with 27 points in 13 games to be named OHL Player of the Month. Hodgson had also been chosen as the OHL Player of the Week for the week ending on November 9 after scoring nine points in three games. After a second Player of the Week recognition, scoring seven points in three games for the week ending February 1, 2009, Hodgson participated in the 2009 OHL All-Star Classic. Joined by teammates Matt Duchene, Evgeny Grachev and Thomas McCollum for the Eastern Conference, Hodgson received player of the game honours after a five-point effort in an 11–6 win. He recorded a hat-trick, along with Western Conference representative Justin DiBenedetto, to tie Scott Barney, who first scored three goals in 1999, for the OHL All-Star Game record. Hodgson's five points also tied the All-Star Game record for most points (shared by five others). He recorded <b>another</b> <b>record</b> later in the month with a 23-game point-scoring streak, registering 17 goals, 23 assists and 40 points in that span. The streak was both a Battalion club record and OHL season-high.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in draft history the first three draft picks were all freshmen. The Chicago Bulls used the first overall pick to draft Chicago native Derrick Rose from the University of Memphis, who later {{went on to win the}} NBA Rookie of the Year Award, making him the first player to be drafted first overall and to win Rookie of the Year since LeBron James in 2003. The Miami Heat used the second pick to draft Michael Beasley from Kansas State University, and the Minnesota Timberwolves used the third pick to draft O. J. Mayo from University of Southern California. With five players taken in the draft, the University of Kansas tied University of Connecticut (2006) and University of Florida (2007) for the record with the most players {{selected}} in the first two rounds of an NBA draft. <b>Another</b> <b>record</b> was set when twelve freshmen were drafted, ten of whom were drafted in the first round.

5|$|The 2012 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the final}} year in a consecutive string of three very active seasons, {{although many of the}} storms were weak. It is tied with 1887, 1995, 2010, and 2011 for having the third-most named storms on record. It was also the third-costliest season, behind 2005 and 2017. The season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit the period during each year in which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. However, Alberto, the first system of the year, developed on May19 – the earliest date of formation since Tropical Storm Ana in 2003. A second tropical cyclone, Beryl, developed later that month. This was the first occurrence of two pre-season named storms in the Atlantic basin since 1951. It moved ashore in North Florida on May29 with winds of 65mph (100km/h), making it the strongest pre-season storm to make landfall in the Atlantic basin. This season marked the first time since 2009 where no tropical cyclones formed in July. <b>Another</b> <b>record</b> was set by Hurricane Nadine later in the season; the system became the fourth-longest-lived tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic, with a total duration of 22.25days. The final storm to form, Tony, dissipated on October25 – however, Hurricane Sandy, which formed before Tony, became extratropical on October 29.|$|E
5|$|In the 1933 season, when Yorkshire {{won their}} third {{consecutive}} County Championship, Verity took 190wickets {{at an average}} of 13.43 to be fifth in the national averages; in eight matches he took 10 or more wickets, and achieved five wickets in an innings 18times. In seven consecutive innings, he secured a total of 50wickets, becoming only the third player to achieve this feat in first-class cricket. He also scored over 600runs in the season, his highest aggregate to date, including three fifties – his first in English first-class cricket. Verity represented the Players against the Gentlemen and played in the first two of three Tests against the West Indies, taking four for 45 in the first match and capturing seven wickets {{at an average of}} 21.85 in the series. He was left out of the final game in favour of Charles Marriott, but in two other games against the tourists, Verity took a total of 22 wickets. Against Essex, Verity achieved <b>another</b> <b>record</b> by taking 17wickets in a single day's play, the second of three players to achieve this feat, on a pitch damaged by rain. In contrast, against Surrey, Yorkshire conceded 560runs and Verity, frustrated at the lack of a declaration, first bowled extremely negatively and then bowled two underarm deliveries that the umpire called no ball as Verity had not informed the batsmen of his intention. This was an unusually public reaction for Verity and his captain ordered him to resume normal bowling. At the end of the season, an MCC team toured India and played Tests there for the first time. Jardine was chosen as captain, and Verity was the only other player from the Bodyline series to tour, although others declined an invitation.|$|E
