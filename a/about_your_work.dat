500|$|In 1942, Pittsburgh artist J. Howard Miller {{was hired}} by Westinghouse Electric's {{internal}} War Production Coordinating Committee, through an advertising agency, to create a series of posters to display to the company's workers. The intent of the poster project was to raise worker morale, to reduce absenteeism, to direct workers' questions to management, and to lower the likelihood of labor unrest or a factory strike. Each {{of the more than}} 42 posters designed by Miller was displayed in the factory for two weeks, then replaced by the next one in the series. Most of the posters featured men; they emphasized traditional roles for men and women. One of the posters pictured a smiling male manager with the words [...] "Any Questions <b>About</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Work?...</b> Ask your Supervisor." ...|$|E

After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>work.</b> It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E

In 2006, the theme "Latinos in Missouri: Beyond Borders" explored {{the extent to which}} the flow of people, goods and information is changing our notions of what constitutes a border. The conference in 2007, "Latinos in Missouri: Everyone Together - Todos Juntos," underlined the need for all stakeholders - regardless of who they are or where they come from - to engage themselves in the process of integrating everyone into their communities. The 2008 conference, "Latinos in Missouri: Uniting Cultures - Uniendo Culturas," focused on how the Latino population is becoming part of U. S. culture. The abstracts included in this book are a reflection of the discussions that were held during these three events. They provide a diverse array of resources for community groups, access to information for researchers and connections to those who share similar interests in understanding and affecting the changes happening in our communities.
