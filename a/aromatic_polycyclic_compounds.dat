In 2007, Environment Canada completed a study that shows high deformity rates in fish embryos exposed to the oil sands. [...] David W. Schindler, a limnologist from the University of Alberta, co-authored a study on Alberta's oil sands' contribution of <b>aromatic</b> <b>polycyclic</b> <b>compounds,</b> some of which are known carcinogens, to the Athabasca River and its tributaries. [...] Scientists, local doctors, and residents supported a letter sent to the Prime Minister in September 2010 calling for an independent study of Lake Athabasca (which is downstream of the oil sands) to be initiated due to the rise of deformities and tumors found in fish caught there.|$|E

Humic acids are {{generally}} <b>aromatic</b> <b>polycyclic</b> <b>compounds,</b> which contain phenolic and carboxylic functional groups on their sidechains.

40|$|The {{composition}} of the organic matter collected on legs 10 to 15 of the DSDP (Deep Sea Drilling Project) is described. Distributions of various alkanes, carboxylic acids, steroids and terpenoids, isoprenoid ketones and olefins, and <b>aromatic</b> <b>polycyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> are given. Samples analyzed had terrigenous clay components, with variable organic carbon contents and thus diverse solvent soluble matter. The distribution patterns for the various compound series monitored were of marine derivation, with the terrigenous components superimposed. Diagenesis of steroids appeared to proceed via both stanones and stanols to their respective steranes. Degradative processes were observed to be operative: oxidative products, mainly ketones derived from steroids and phytol, were identified, probably due to microbial alteration prior to or during sedimentation. Loss of alkane and fatty acid C preferences and presence of polycyclic aromatics evinced maturation. Results indicate that the accumulation, degradation, diagenesis and maturation of organic matter occurs in various steps in the deep sea environment...|$|E

The theory has been tested for a number of <b>polycyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbon (PAHs) in single- and multi-plateau temperature-programmed gas chromatography with SE- 52 as the stationary phase.

40|$|The Diploma thesis {{deals with}} humic acids {{and their ability}} to adsorb metal ions on their surface. Humic acids are <b>aromatic</b> <b>polycyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> which contain {{carboxylic}} and fenolic functional groups on their sidechains. Thanks to these functional groups humic acids can form complexes with metal ions of different stability and assist the partial immobilization of pollutants in the nature. In this thesis, the sorption of Pb 2 + and Zn 2 + ions on humic acids was studied by relatively new electroanalytic method called galvanostatic stripping chronopotentiometry. Experimental data were described by Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms. The results show that the amount of examined metal ions increases with their increasing concentration. Furthermore it was determined that Pb 2 + ions are adsorbed better on humic acids than Zn 2 + ions. Both metals are adsorbed better from solution containing only one metal ion than in presence of four metals at the same time (Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb) where the sorption of these metals is not influenced by the presence of other metals...|$|E

A novel –RHA activity was identified in the crude extract of Novosphingobium sp.

The coding gene was expressed inEscherichia coli, strain BL 21 (DE 3), and the recombinant protein, rRHA-P, was purified and characterizedas an inverting monomeric glycosidase of ca. 120 kDa belonging to the GH 106 family. A biochemical char-acterization of this enzyme using pNPR as substrate was performed, which showed that rRHA-P had amoderate tolerance to organic solvents, a significant thermal stability up to 45 ◦C and a catalytic efficiency,at pH 6. 9, significantly higher than other bacterial -RHAs described in literature. Moreover, rRHA-P wasable to hydrolyze natural glycosylated flavonoids (naringin, rutin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone) con-taining -l-rhamnose bound to -d-glucose with either - 1, 2 or - 1, 6 glycosidic linkages.
