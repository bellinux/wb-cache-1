500|$|A similar {{phenomenon}} to {{a weather}} front is the dry line, {{which is the}} boundary between air masses with significant moisture differences. [...] When the westerlies increase {{on the north side}} of surface highs, areas of lowered pressure will form downwind of north–south oriented mountain chains, leading to the formation of a lee trough. [...] Near the surface during daylight hours, warm moist air is denser than dry air of greater temperature, and thus the warm moist air wedges under the drier <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cold front. [...] At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the dry air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front. [...] A weaker form of the dry line seen more commonly is the lee trough, which displays weaker differences in moisture. [...] When moisture pools along the boundary during the warm season, it can be the focus of diurnal thunderstorms.|$|E

In February 1965, Clapton quit the Yardbirds and Page was formally offered his spot, but unwilling to give up his lucrative career as a session musician and worried about his health under touring conditions, he suggested his friend Jeff Beck. On 16 May 1966, drummer Keith Moon, bass player John Paul Jones, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, Beck and Page recorded [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] in London's IBC Studios.

He can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact.|$|E

In the film she played a woman [...] "hardened by life's cruelties and a grief that will not fade." [...] It also co-starred a young Joanne Woodward {{in one of her}} early roles. In an article he wrote for Life magazine Williams discussed why he chose her for the part:"Anna and I had both cherished the dream that her appearance in the part I created for her in The Fugitive Kind would be her greatest triumph to date...

2500|$|Development of {{the film}} that would {{come to be called}} Zootopia began when Byron Howard pitched six story ideas to Disney Animation chief {{creative}} officer and executive producer John Lasseter, of which three involved animal characters: an all-animal adaptation of The Three Musketeers, a 1960s-themed story about a [...] "mad doctor cat...who turned children into animals," [...] and a [...] "bounty hunter pug in space." [...] The common thread running through these ideas was that Howard wanted to do a film similar to Disney’s Robin Hood, which also featured animals in anthropomorphic roles. [...] According to Howard, Zootopia emerged from his desire to create something different from other animal anthropomorphic films, where animals either live in the natural world or in the human world. His concept, in which animals live in a modern world designed by animals for animals, was well received by Lasseter, who responded by embracing and lifting Howard [...] "in the <b>air</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baby Simba." [...] Lasseter suggested that Howard should try combining the 1960s theme with the animal characters, especially the space pug. This led Howard to develop and pitch Savage Seas, an international spy film centered on a rabbit named [...] "Jack Savage" [...] who was somewhat like James Bond. It was around this time that screenwriter Jared Bush was hired to work on the film; he was excited to work on a spy film because his own father and grandfather had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E
2500|$|When Entity FX {{took over}} the duties of {{creating}} the digital effects for the series, they also {{took over the}} challenge of crafting effects that would illustrate Clark’s super-powered abilities, including the new [...] "heat vision" [...] that was introduced this season. The visual effects for heat vision evolved {{over the course of}} the first season, until Gough and Millar agreed on one that reflected their image of what heat vision should look like; they did not want the usual [...] "red beams" [...] or [...] "laser vision". The visuals developed from the idea that they wanted Clark to be able to use it in front of people without them being able to see it. What emerged was a [...] "heat ripple" [...] from [...] "distorting the frame". John Wash explains what the creators were looking for:" [...] wanted to be fairly accurate in terms of what you might see from something that was searingly hot traveling through the <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> disturbance of the atmosphere. We keyed our research off the little ripples that you see if a light goes past a hotplate and reflects on a wall. We used a computer to create a conical version of that effect that could emanate from Clark's eyes, in combination with a little effect." [...] They used [...] "blobs of heat vision" [...] instead of [...] "constant rays" [...] for the first instances of Clark using his ability, in an effort to simulate Clark's attempts to control it. A couple of episodes later in [...] "Red", the special effects team would use similar techniques for red kryptonite. To illustrate red kryptonite’s effect on Clark, and it releasing his inhibitions, the special effects team crafted digital effects in his eyes. Brian Harding tweaked the effects they were already using for Clark’s heat vision, giving them a [...] "little devilish, hellish red flicker" [...] in Clark’s iris. To help illustrate Clark’s super speed, Mat Beck and his team would slow down and speed up background settings in a single shot. For example, in [...] "Ryan", when Clark speeds up to the camera everything else slows to a stop—leaves stop blowing and birds are frozen in mid-flight—then everything begins moving normally as Clark races away from the camera. Entity FX also adds a blurring effect to Clark's body, as well as a distortion to the background to help further illustrate the speed at which Clark travels.|$|E
