5|$|Major {{political}} differences between Democrats and Republicans and wartime propaganda caused many Hoosiers to become suspicious of dissenters <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> of potential insurrections, especially from secret societies {{sympathetic to the}} South. During the Indianapolis city election In May, the Democrats, who decided a fair election could not be held, withdrew their ticket. Only 14 votes were cast for Democratic candidates in the nine Indianapolis wards.|$|E
5|$|Hal Jordan, a cocky {{test pilot}} working at Ferris Aircraft, is {{chosen by the}} ring and transported to the crash site, where the dying Abin Sur {{appoints}} him a Green Lantern, telling {{him to take the}} lantern and speak the oath. Jordan says the oath and is whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with veteran Corps members Tomar-Re, Kilowog, and Corps leader Sinestro, who believes he is unfit <b>and</b> <b>fearful.</b> Jordan quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern.|$|E

60|$|O poor mortals, how ye {{make this}} Earth bitter for each other; this <b>fearful</b> <b>and</b> {{wonderful}} Life <b>fearful</b> <b>and</b> horrible; and Satan has {{his place in}} all hearts!

25|$|Care leavers {{reported}} to the Senate Inquiry that as adults they had suffered depression, social anxieties, phobias, recurring nightmares, anger, shame, <b>and</b> were <b>fearful</b> <b>and</b> distrustful of others leading to an inability to form and maintain relationships. Many detailed drug and alcohol dependence, homelessness, unemployment and imprisonment.|$|R
5|$|Wary of the {{potential}} dangers (particularly {{the possibility of a}} prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA created policy recommendations and concluded that the technology could be used safely.|$|E
5|$|The People's Army of Vietnam {{had been}} {{utilizing}} {{large sections of}} relatively unpopulated eastern Cambodia as sanctuaries into which they could withdraw from the struggle in South Vietnam to rest and reorganize without being attacked. These base areas were also utilized by the Vietnamese communists to store weapons and other material that had been transported {{on a large scale}} into the region on the Sihanouk Trail. PAVN forces had begun moving through Cambodian territory as early as 1963. In 1966, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, ruler of Cambodia, convinced of eventual communist victory in Southeast Asia <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> for the future of his rule, had concluded an agreement with the People's Republic of China which allowed the establishment of permanent communist bases on Cambodian soil {{and the use of the}} Cambodian port of Sihanoukville for resupply.|$|E
5|$|Ina Coolbrith {{was born}} Josephine Donna Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois, {{the last of}} three daughters of Agnes Moulton Coolbrith and Don Carlos Smith, brother to Joseph Smith Coolbrith's father died of malarial fever four months after her birth, and a sister died one month after that; Coolbrith's mother then married Joseph Smith, in 1842, {{becoming}} his sixth or seventh wife. No children came of the union—Agnes felt neglected in her unfruitful Levirate marriage, the only such marriage of Smith. In June 1844, Smith was killed {{at the hands of}} an anti-Mormon mob. Losing her faith <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> of her life, Coolbrith's mother left the Latter-day Saint community and moved to Saint Louis, Missouri, where she married a printer and lawyer named William Pickett. Twin sons were born to the couple, and in 1851 Pickett traveled overland with his new family to California in a wagon train. On the long trek, the young Ina read from a book of Shakespeare's works and from a collection of Byron's poems. As a ten-year-old girl, Ina entered California in front of the wagon train with the famous African-American scout Jim Beckwourth, riding with him on his horse, through what would later be named Beckwourth Pass. The family settled in Los Angeles, California, and Pickett established a law practice.|$|E

60|$|It {{speaks of}} {{religious}} people, {{and of a}} religious nation; <b>and</b> of a <b>fearful</b> mistake which they were making, <b>and</b> a <b>fearful</b> danger into which they had fallen. Now we are religious people, and England is a religious nation; and therefore we may possibly make the same mistake, and fall into the same danger, as these old Jews.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, on 2 December 1917 an {{armistice}} {{was signed}} between Russia and the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk and peace talks began. The newly formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Germans on 3 March 1918, formally {{ending the war}} on the Eastern Front and permitting the redeployment of German forces to the Western Front, altering the balance of power. The treaty also permitted the occupation of large areas of European Russia, and within these territories were large stocks of military equipment previously supplied by the allies. In particular, there were large stocks of such supplies in the northern ports of Murmansk and Archangel. The Allied intervention involved fourteen nations and was conducted over a vast expanse of territory. The initial goals of the Western powers had been to rescue the Czechoslovak Legion which had been fighting the Central Powers on the Eastern Front and had later fought the Bolsheviks, {{as well as to}} secure the supplies of munitions and armaments in Russian ports in order to prevent their capture by German forces, and possibly also to re-establish the Eastern Front. However, with the end of World War I <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> of Bolshevism, the Allies openly, if only half-heartedly, intervened in the Russian Civil War, giving support to the pro-tsarist anti-Bolshevik White forces as part of the North Russia Campaign. Opposition for the ongoing campaign became widespread however, mostly due to a combination of a lack of public support and war-weariness; while divided objectives and a lack of an overarching strategy also hampered the effort. These factors, together with the evacuation of the Czechoslovak Legion and the deteriorating military situation, compelled the Allies to withdraw by 1920. With the end of allied support, the Red Army soon defeated the remaining White government forces, leading to their eventual collapse.|$|E

25|$|Adams, {{like other}} minimalists {{of his time}} (e.g. Philip Glass), used a steady pulse that defines and {{controls}} the music. The pulse was best known from Terry Riley's early composition In C, and slowly more and more composers {{used it as a}} common practice. Jonathan Bernard highlighted this adoption by comparing Phrygian Gates, written in 1977, <b>and</b> <b>Fearful</b> Symmetries written eleven years later in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the dog is}} one of {{the most}} common domesticated animals around the world, some {{countries}} have gone to the liberty of banning festive fireworks in private neighborhoods due to the provocation caused to the dogs. Animal-rights organizations believe the sound of the fireworks trigger the nervous-system in dogs, causing them to become agitated <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> as well as provoking continuous barking, which the dogs' owners find incredibly disruptive to the peace in the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|And we also, o my Lord, thy {{weak and}} frail and miserable {{servants}} who are gathered together in thy name, both stand before thee {{at this time}} and have received the example which is from thee delivered unto us, rejoicing and praising and exalting and commemorating and celebrating this great <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> and holy and lifegiving and divine mystery of the passion and the death and the burial and the resurrection of our Lord our Saviour Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|Sarah is {{the female}} {{half of the}} lizard couple, the mate of Leslie. Like her mate, Sarah is {{cautious}} <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> around the humans. Yet like Nancy, she is curious about them and tries to make a connection. Though Sarah defers to Leslie much more than Nancy does to Charlie, she does play a buffer role between the couples. Leslie often consults Sarah on {{what he should do}} and what she thinks about the humans and the situation at hand. At first, Sarah urges wanness, but she also emphasizes the importance of contact.|$|E
25|$|Acoma {{was next}} visited by the Spanish 40 {{years later in}} 1581 by Fray Agustín Rodríguez and Francisco Sánchez Chamuscado with 12 soldiers, 3 other friars, and 13 others {{including}} Indian servants. The Acoma at this time were reported to be somewhat defensive <b>and</b> <b>fearful.</b> This response {{may have been due}} to the knowledge of the Spanish enslavement of other Indians to work in silver mines in the area. However, eventually the Rodríguez and Chamuscado party convinced them to trade goods for food. The Spaniard reports say the pueblo had about 500 houses of either three or four stories high.|$|E
25|$|The {{secure and}} dismissive {{attachment}} styles {{are associated with}} higher self-esteem compared to the anxious <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about the self in working models. The secure and anxious attachment styles are associated with higher sociability than the dismissive or fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about others in working models. These results suggested working models indeed contain two distinct domains—thoughts about self and thoughts about others—and that each domain {{can be characterized as}} generally positive or generally negative.|$|E

25|$|The Civil War-era {{was also}} a time of bitter {{political}} disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. Major political differences and wartime propaganda caused many Hoosiers to become suspicious of Union dissenters <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> of potential insurrections. On May 20, 1863, Union soldiers attempted to disrupt a statewide Democratic convention at Indianapolis, forcing the proceedings to be adjourned, and caused an sarcastically {{referred to as the}} Battle of Pogue's Run. Union soldiers stopped and searched two departing trainloads of convention delegates, many of whom tossed their personal weapons into Pogue's Run, a nearby creek. Fear turned to panic in July 1863, during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but the Confederates forces under the command of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan turned east toward Ohio and never reached Indianapolis.|$|E
25|$|Garnett fell in {{love with}} the sport of {{basketball}} while attending Hillcrest Middle School, although he did not play organized basketball until high school. In his first three years of high school, Garnett attended Mauldin High School in Mauldin, South Carolina and played on the school's basketball team. However, during the summer before his senior year of high school, Garnett was in the general vicinity of a fight between black and white students. Although not directly involved, Garnett was one of three students arrested for second-degree lynching, a charge that was expunged through a pre-trial intervention. Due to the racially charged incident <b>and</b> <b>fearful</b> of being a target, Garnett decided to leave Mauldin High and transferred to Farragut Career Academy in Chicago, for his senior year of high school.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Yang Yuqing, Yang Rushi, Yang Yuqing's brother Yang Han'gong (楊漢工), Zhang Yuanfu (張元夫), and Xiao Huan (蕭澣) were {{perceived}} by Emperor Wenzong {{to be overly}} eager in their partisanship, {{and he began to}} dislike them. After he made Li Deyu chancellor in 833, Li Deyu used Emperor Wenzong's dislike for these officials to begin ejecting Niu Faction officials from the government. Li Zongmin responded by having Zheng Tan, who was then imperial scholar, removed from his post as imperial scholar—but Emperor Wenzong reacted by promoting Zheng to be the chief imperial censor without consulting Li Zongmin, which caused Li Zongmin to be angry <b>and</b> <b>fearful.</b> Soon thereafter, Li Zongmin himself was sent out to Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), to serve as its military governor.|$|E
