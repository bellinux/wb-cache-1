40|$|Twenty-two scab-resistant apple cultivars were {{harvested}} in autumn 1999 and evaluated for sensory quality the following October, November and December. Multivariate analysis {{was effective in}} describing the comblex relationships and variabillity among the numerous attributes used to characterise apple quality. Crispness, mealiness, skin toughness, <b>apple</b> <b>flavour,</b> sweetness, unripe flavour and overripe flavour were informative attributes describing the variation in the sensory quality.

A collection of 85 apple cultivars was examined over two years through descriptive sensory evaluation by a trained sensory panel. The trained sensory panel scored randomized sliced samples of each apple cultivar for seventeen taste, flavour and texture attributes using controlled sensory evaluation practices. In addition, the apple collection was subjected to genotyping by sequencing for marker discovery. A genome wide association analysis suggested significant genomic associations for several sensory traits including juiciness, crispness, mealiness and fresh green <b>apple</b> <b>flavour.</b> The findings include previously unreported genomic regions that could be used in apple breeding and suggest that similar sensory association mapping methods could be applied in other plants...|$|E

40|$|Ice cider is {{produced}} by fermenting apple juice that has been concentrated by freezing (cryoconcentration or cryoextraction). Ice cider is more a sweet wine than a cider, with an intense <b>apple</b> <b>flavour</b> and sweetness, and acidity to balance the flavours. It originates from Canada, where specifications includes a pre-fermentation sugar content of not less than 30 °Brix, and a finished product with a residual sugar content of not less than 130 g/l, containing 7 - 13 % alcohol. This project aims to investigate and document some of the aspects of ice cider production process for Swedish conditions. The ambition is to start building experience and knowledge useful for ice cider production in Sweden. The scientific documentation on ice cider fermentation and biochemical properties of cryoconcentrated apple juice is very limited. In this project factors important {{for the quality of}} cider and ice wine were reviewed, and methods for producing ice cider through cryoconcentration and subsequent fermentation were evaluated. It was demonstrated in this project that concentrating the apple juice by cold has an equally concentrating effect on sugars, total acids and total phenolics. It was also demonstrated that the level of concentration of the juice highly influences the fermentation kinetics and output. Higher sugar level slowed down the rate of fermentation, and the amount of ethanol produced was lower. In order to produce a good ice cider, the juice needs to be sufficiently concentrated to produce the alcohol content and residual sugar level that defines the product, while not be too concentrated and place excessive hyperosmotic stress upon the yeast cells, resulting in slow and potentially stuck fermentations. The juice needs to hold a minimum of 32 °Brix, while a juice of above 42 °Brix will be very difficult to ferment. It was further demonstrated in this project that the selection of yeast strain has an effect on level of ethanol produced, and acid development during fermentation of ice cider. The level of phenolics was found to remain fairly stable across different yeast strains during fermentation. The yeast strain was also demonstrated to have a small impact on the flavour of the ice cider...|$|E
40|$|Aroma {{and texture}} {{are known to}} {{influence}} the overall perception of <b>apple</b> <b>flavour</b> and are subconsciously evaluated by consumers during consumption. Aroma {{is derived from the}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from the apple both before (orthonasal) and during consumption (retronasal). The degree to which the VOC impacts upon the flavour profile is affected by the mechanical breakdown of the apple flesh during mastication. The characteristics of apple texture, microstructure and breakdown are cultivar specific. This thesis aimed to understand the cultivar specific differences of apple texture, microstructure and VOC release in relation to their role in overall flavour perception and to explore the correlations between sensory derived attributes and instrumental derived parameters. In vitro (orthonasal) and in vivo (retronasal) measurements of VOC release were carried out using either a proton transfer reaction quadrupole mass spectrometer (PTR-QUAD-MS) or a proton transfer reaction time of flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). Both instrumental techniques separated cultivars based on their in vitro headspace volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles of either intact or cut apple portions. However, PTR-ToF-MS was found to be superior to PTR-QUAD-MS due to its higher sensitivity. The in vivo nosespace method involving the measurements of dynamic VOC release from the nasal cavity, during swallowing as panellists consumed apple portions, resulted in improved data and temporal resolution, as well as {{an increase in the number}} of detectable nosespace VOCs when the PTR-ToF-MS was used. Ester related VOCs were predominantly detected in the in vivo nosespace measurements followed by carbonyl and alcohol related compounds. Measured nosespace parameters showed potential for use in understanding differences in the mechanical breakdown of apple flesh during mastication; with for example juicy cultivars inducing a faster time to first swallow (Tswal). Panellists also displayed longer consumption times (Tcon) when consuming firm samples, as opposed to softer cultivars. In a preliminary study using the PTR-QUAD-MS, the time to maximum VOC intensity (Tmax) was found to be shorter for soft apple flesh owing to their faster breakdown during mastication and their resulting increase in surface area. However, the PTR-ToF-MS study which used more cultivars suggested that Tmax could also be shorter for firm juicy cultivars, owing to the occurrence of more swallowing events during mastication as juice was released. The feasibility of being able to differentiate between cultivars using solely instrumental techniques was investigated by comparing instrumentally derived results to those gained from descriptive sensory analysis. Sensory odour/ flavour data was compared to VOC profiles obtained from the PTR-ToF-MS, while sensory texture was compared to mechanical and acoustic textural parameters. Both analytical and sensory techniques characterised the cultivars similarly, indicating the potential of solely instrumental techniques to separate apple cultivars based on their VOC profiles and textural properties. Different VOC groups (terpenes; esters and their associated fragments; butanoate esters) were associated to specific sensory attributes. For example, butanoate esters (m/z 103, 117, 131) were positively correlated to lemon flavour and odour whereas hexyl acetate (m/z 145) was positively correlated to overall apple odour signifying its importance towards base <b>apple</b> <b>flavour.</b> Physico-chemical properties such as titratable acidity (TA) were positively correlated to sour taste which could be considered in prediction models. Sweet taste was negatively correlated to TA but was not correlated to soluble solids content (SSC). However, a positive correlation between sweet taste and fruity ester related compounds (m/z 43, 61, 145) was observed indicating a possible aroma-taste interaction. Instrumentally derived texture parameters were well correlated to sensory descriptions. However, the former also provided additional information that could differentiate between cultivars that were firm but not crunchy. As the behaviour of apple flesh breakdown during mastication was shown to affect perceived texture, X-ray micro-computer tomographic (μ-CT) scanning was used to investigate microstructural differences that could affect apple texture. Morphological properties of apple parenchyma such as connectivity and porosity were associated with VOC release, whereas anisotropy was associated with firm texture. Porosity was negatively correlated to firm texture however, this was cultivar specific owing to the fact that porosity is a summation of all intercellular spaces within a volume; it does not take into account the variation in size and distribution which has been shown to affect texture. The use of an ethylene inhibitor, 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) retained the apple texture at a cost of lower VOC emission. However, its efficacy favoured cultivars of high ethylene concentration (Golden Delicious) as opposed to low ethylene emitting cultivars (Fuji). Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of 1 -MCP on specific cultivars. This study demonstrated the viable use of PTR-MS and texture measurements to understand the interrelationships between texture and aroma release during consumption. These techniques were shown to characterise apple cultivars similarly to sensory measurements. Moreover, μ-CT scanning proved to be a powerful tool to visualise the role of microstructure in mechanical texture. Overall, these analyses showed that apple cultivars are distinctly different and suggest that such information could be used to compile a database of phenotypes, such as the cultivar specific VOC and texture characteristics. This database could be used as a reference to create high quality apples through careful selection of specific traits in order to create customised apples targeted towards consumer specific needs...|$|E
40|$|Flavor is a multi-sensorial {{perception}} {{resulting from}} stimulating {{a combination of}} taste buds, olfactory bulbs and chemesthetic receptors within the oral and nasal cavity. Taste is a chemical perception using taste buds whereas for odour to be perceived, volatile organic compounds (VOC) need to stimulate the olfactory bulb either via the nostrils (orthonasal) or via the internal nares of the oral cavity (retronasal) [1]. This is however, influenced somewhat by food texture (structural, mechanical and surface properties of food detected through sight, sound and touch). The combination of texture and flavour are known key factors influencing consumer acceptability of apples however, this relationship is poorly understood[2, 3]. VOC release from six commercial apple cultivars (Fuji, Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, Jonagold, Morgen Dallago and Red Delicious) under static conditions (intact fruit or fresh cut samples) and during consumption of fresh cut samples (nose-space) was determined by Proton Transfer Reaction Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (PTR-QUAD-MS). Physicochemical (pH, acidity and water content) and textural (firmness, fracturability, flesh elasticity and rupture) properties of the apples were also measured. Fuji and Granny Smith apples head space had the lowest total concentration of VOC (esters, aldehydes, alcohols and terpenes) whereas Red Delicious had the highest concentration. Cut fruit generally had a significantly higher overall VOC concentration than intact fruit with acetaldehyde being the most abundant VOC. Dynamic in-vivo nose space analysis enabled cultivars to be characterized based on mastication time, and the in-nose concentration and relative proportion of the four VOC measured (esters m/z 43, 61; acetaldehyde m/z 45; ethanol m/z 47). Softer varieties (Golden Delicious, Morgen Dallago) were consumed faster releasing more VOCs (particularly esters) and reached a maximum VOC intensity (tmax: 20. 5 s) faster. Firm varieties (Fuji, Granny Smith) had a longer consumption time, a higher tmax(27. 7 s) and a lower VOC concentration. Intermediate cultivars (Jonagold, Red Delicious) had a tmax of 21. 5 s and a higher VOC concentration compared to firmer varieties. The diffusion of VOC within the nasal cavity was dependent on particle breakdown during mastication i. e. faster for mealy apples; slower for firm apples. Texture was shown to play an integral role in <b>apple</b> <b>flavour</b> release. This finding suggests that in-vivo PTR-MS coupled with traditional physico-chemical measurements {{could be used to}} yield information on flavour release {{from a wide range of}} food matrixes and help in the development of strategies to enhance food flavour and quality. Limitations of this method include: reduced signal intensities recovered during in-vivo measurements induced by the different eating patterns of panellists and the inability to differentiate isobaric compounds which may mask potentially important findings. Preliminary nose-space results on apples using a Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer, PTR-TOF-MS, allows some of these limitations to be overcome by enabling a full mass spectrum to be measured (greater chemical information) and greater temporal resolution, to confirm and quantify differences in chemical information with increased resolution and full mass spectrum readings. Thus increasing panellist’s reproducibility and allowing differentiation of results based solely between cultivar variation...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Nutrition)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Interest {{has grown}} {{over the last}} two decades in the health {{benefits}} of polyphenols, with particular relation to degenerative diseases. The Kei apple (Dovyalis caffra) is an indigenous plant to South Africa, thought to be rich in polyphenols. This study aimed to produce a functional beverage from the Kei apple, with demonstrable nutritional benefits, which should also be found acceptable by consumers due to its sensory attributes. A long term aim of the study is to assist in improving income of farmers in rural and urban areas by encouraging the participation of small holders in growing the Kei apple for subsequent economic benefit. A thorough literature review was conducted on functional foods, trends for beverages, legislation and on polyphenols as a class of functional ingredients, specifically focusing on fruits and the fate of polyphenols in the body. A review of fruit processing procedures, preservation techniques and legislation, followed by new product development (NPD) and the types of consumers desiring functional foods were investigated as well as the role of sensory evaluation and consumer research were examined. Methods Kei apples were collected from two areas of South Africa, namely Bloemhof in the North West Province in the 200212003 growing season and from the Eastern and Western Cape in the 200412005 growing season. The first set of Kei apples were used to produce a prototype functional beverage, from which future development would take place. The second set of Kei apples were used for pulping on an industrial scale and then a small-scale commercial production batch of the Kei apple beverages for consumer panel testing was produced. Various flavours were used to mask the strong characteristic taste and aroma of the Kei apple for the beverage and these were narrowed down to apple, vanilla and mint 8. vanilla. Consumer panel testing was undertaken with 152 consumers with a pre-tested questionnaire using hedonic scales for overall acceptance, ranking for preference, a Fwd Action Rating Scale (FACT) for consumption intent, and a ranking test for purchase intent. All evaluations were carried out under strictly controlled sensory evaluation requirement and respondents were asked to fill in anonymous questionnaires at North West University, Potchefstroom Campus. Results and Discussion Statistical analysis of the results were determined by the Statistic* programme, version 7. In summary for all of the consumer testing, it was found that consumers regarded the <b>apple</b> <b>flavoured</b> Kei <b>apple</b> beverage statistically significantly more acceptable than the other <b>flavours.</b> The <b>apple</b> <b>flavoured</b> beverage was found to be rated practically significantly higher for the attributes of taste and overall acceptance, as well as for consumption intent, purchase intent and preference. There was, however, no significant differences in any of the attributes or evaluated consumption and purchase intent between the vanilla and mint & vanilla. The total polyphenols, determined by UV spectrophotometry as gallic acid equivalents per litre (GAE/I), were found to be slightly less then expected, with the apple and mint & vanilla showing similar results (as GAEII) 101. 7 versus 106. 1 for the latter two, whilst vanilla was 143. 0 which may have been attributed to the vanillic acid molecule itself which also has a phenolic structure. This lower-than-expected level of total polyphenols may have been due to degradation during processing. There was a clear difference in the polyphenol content between the different harvests from the two regions. The former showed greater acidity as determined by total citric acid 4. 81 % w/w and sugar 16. 3 % versus 2. 54 % w/w and 8. 4 % This may be due to various factors of climate, soil and ripeness. For comparison purposes, a commercial product from the USA, Ocean Spray ® Cranberry, was also found to have more polyphenols present than the Kei apple beverage. This was also demonstrated by the amount of ascorbic acid, free and bound. The Kei apple beverage subjected to pasteurization probably lost most of its vitamin C content due to the heat treatment and the exposure to oxygen during pulping. Conclusion and Recommendations The development of a functional beverage from the Kei apple is feasible. As with most new product developments, further formulation modifications which are not insurmountable are required. The consumer panel was positive towards the <b>apple</b> <b>flavoured</b> beverage and this flavour should be taken forward for future development. The key stumbling block to the success of this project is the lack of an effective organizing body that could liaise with the growers to form a cooperative and provide a consistent supply of Kei apples. The effect of variations in harvesting time, soil conditions and climate must also be evaluated. The improvement of income of farmers may only be achieved by the involvement of other stake holders and the formation of a Kei apple grower's co-operativeMaster...|$|R
