40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this work is to explore the use of Fresnel lenses in {{materials}} and coating processing via self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS). This is achieved by synthesis of intermetallic compounds of the NiIAl system. Nickel aluminides offer high thermal stability, corrosion and oxidation resistance and superior mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. In order to obtain the coating, different metallic powders were placed onto a carbon-steel and heated in {{the focus of the}} lens. The solar energy concentrated provides the heat impulse to initiate the chemical reaction between Ni and <b>Al.</b> <b>Aluminium</b> melts due to the solar heating and reacts by the SHS process with nickel powders forming nickel aluminide (NiAl). The heat generated from the SHS reaction is high enough to melt the intermetallic compound NiAl activating a diffusion process between coating and substrate. The great advantage of this technology is that the process is initiated at low temperatures due to the exothermic nature of the reaction, and that the aluminide is obtained "in situ " and bonded onto the substrate. Hence, long processing times in hlgh temperature furnaces consuming large quantities of energy are not necessary in SHS processes. 1...|$|E

As and Cu follow the same time trend, while different for Cr. It is clear that the concentration of As increased in the groundwater after soil washing and that soil excavating have not the same problem with increased levels.

40|$|The food {{packaging}} industry demands cheap polymer films possessing a high barrier agains permeation of gases, moisture and flavor. Candidates {{for the most}} successful materials fulfilling these requirements are newly developed laminates of biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films containing a thin inorganic barrier layer and possessing an oxygen permeability lower than 3 cm 3 /(m 2 /dbar) and a moisture permeability lower than 0. 05 g/m 2 day). The thin barrier layers are produced by vacuum web coating of BOPP films. In order to achieve high barrier laminates, one key issue along the whole production chain - from film extrusion to lamination - is given by the surface properties of the non-coated films. Non-coated BOPP film surfaces were modified by different kinds of plasma pretreatment and characterized before the vacuum coating process.

The amounts (contents per leaf) of K (potassium), Rb (rubidium), Cs (caesium), Cu (copper) and P (phosphorus) were highest in young leaves, decreasing throughout the growing season and usually in the subsequent winter.

It was similar to deposition rate estimates using moss carpets from the same locality. A passive uptake was positively related to ionic charge and atomic mass. However, the amounts of several, mainly non-essential elements, such as Ni (nickel), Sc (scandium), Zr (zirconium), Cr (chromium), Ag (silver), and Cd (cadmium) were not much lower in the young or maturing leaves than in the wintered dead leaves of this deciduous (hardwood) forest and a proportion apparently originated from internal translocation in the trees.

The methods included (1) sequential digestion of wood tissue to remove the elemental fraction that is mobile across tree rings leaving the structurally intrinsic, residual (or less mobile) ion fraction for analysis and (2) transformation of elemental concentrations into multivariate ratios (compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND)) over a time series. Sampling of trees represented a gradient in acidity resilience using three regions of southern Quebec (St. Lawrence Lowlands; Lower Laurentians; and Appalachian Highlands) and three species (red maple (Acer rubrum L.); sugar maple (Acer sacharum Marsh.); and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). The elemental residual fraction had differences from the mobile fraction over time for Ca, Mg and Mn, but not for K or Al. The base rich Saint-Lawrence region had the highest and slightly increasing incremental stem xylem Al of the regions yet had stable or increasing growth. By contrast the acid sensitive Appalachian region had the greatest increase in Al accompanied by a decrease in growth beyond 1970. The Appalachians also had the highest Mn, which had an adverse effect on growth of sugar maple.

40|$|Growth {{conditions}} on acid soils may be hampered by low nutrient availability and phytotoxic <b>Al</b> (<b>aluminium)</b> concentrations. In this thesis I present my studies on adaptation mechanisms of wild plants to acid soils in the close root environment, the rhizosphere. The {{studies showed that}} plants have developed several mechanisms that may work simultaneously to face the complex soil chemistry. A first greenhouse and field study indicated that wild plants use soil heterogeneity to exploit nutrient rich patches and maybe also to avoid elevated Al concentrations. Further experiments concentrated {{on the ability of}} wild plants to exude organic acids in response to elevated Al concentrations. Organic acids chelate Al and render it thereby non-toxic to plants. Deschampsia flexuosa increased the malic acid exudation in a rhizotron experiment but not in hydroponics. Of ten studied species in hydroponics Rumex acetosella and Viscaria vulgaris increased the exudation of oxalic acid and Galium saxatile and Veronica officinalis the exudation of citric acid in response to Al. In studies over one week the exudation pattern was dependent on Al concentration. All species needed at least four hours before exudation of organic acids was increased. Veronica officinalis was able to raise the pH in the rhizosphere when grown in nutrient solutions with Al. Biodegradation of organic acids was studied to estimate to what extent it lowers the chelating of Al under natural conditions. About 70 % of added organic acids were respired after 24 h. Al concentrations at levels of possible phytotoxicity to plants did not seem to inhibit organic acid degradation. Plants were able to maintain a several fold higher organic acid concentration in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil solution, despite of the high biodegradation rates. My results showed that wild plants use several mechanisms to cope with acid soils, e. g. organic acid exudation, pH changes and exploitation of nutrient rich patches and that the mechanisms vary with plant species, time, plant age and growth medium...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} fate during litter decomposition and mineralization {{is rather}} well established {{only for a}} limited number of elements, mainly essential plant nutrients and a few potentially very toxic metals. Elements which occupy the majority of the positions in the periodical system seems almost unknown in this context. The objectives were, therefore to assess differences in the behavior of 58 mineral elements during the course of beech leaf senescence and decomposition in a unmanaged Swedish beech forest growing on a podzolized soil. It is assumed that chemical properties of the elements and their ions (atomic weight, electronegativity, ionic charge and radius), accumulation and retention by fungi, contributions from atmospheric deposition, and relative plant uptake are of importance to their degree of retention and enrichment in the decomposition products. Elements considered were Ag (silver), <b>Al</b> (<b>aluminium),</b> As (arsenic), B (boron), Ba (barium), Be (beryllium), Bi (bismuth), Ca (calcium), Cd (cadmium), Ce (cerium), Co (cobalt), Cr (chromium), Cs (caesium), Cu (copper), Dy (dysprosium), Er (erbium), Eu (europium), Fe (iron), Ga (gallium), Gd (gadolinium), Ge (germanium), Hf (hafnium), Hg (mercury), Ho (holmium), In (indium), K (potassium), La (lanthanum), Li (lithium), Lu (lutetium), Mg (magnesium), Mn (manganese), Mo (molybdenum), Na (sodium), Nb (niobium), Nd (neodymium), Ni (nickel), P (phosphorus), Pb (lead), Pr (praseodymium), Rb (rubidium), S (sulfur), Sb (antimony), Sc (scandium), Se (selenium), Sm (samarium), Sn (tin), Sr (strontium), Tb (terbium), Th (thorium), Ti (titanium), Tl (thallium), Tm (thulium), U (uranium), V (vanadium), W (tungsten), Y (yttrium), Yb (ytterbium), Zn (zinc), and Zr (zirconium). The concentrations of most elements increased on a dry mass basis during senescence and decomposition with rather few elements showing a decrease. The ash contents of the dry mass did not vary much among the materials. Particularly great increases on dry mass (up to 35 times in the purely organic part of the O horizon compared to green leaves in July) were measured in the rare earth metals (Y, La, and the lanthanides) as well as in Al (21), Bi (26), In (35), Th (46) and Sn (41 times). Several oxoionic elements (U, V, As, Ge, and Sb) had also high concentration ratios. Concentration decreases or no concentration changes on dry mass from green leaves to the O horizon were measured in Ba, Ca, K, Mg, Na, Rb, and Sr. Elements originating from the leaves themselves and, not the least, atmospheric deposition, were major sources of most less common and rare elements in the O horizon of this unmanaged beech forest. The degree of retention and accumulation rate was partly controlled by chemical properties of the ions, principally atomic weight, but electronegativity was also of some positive importance to the retention. Transfer by fungi to the O horizon could be of some importance to a few, but not to most of the elements studied...|$|E
