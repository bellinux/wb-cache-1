40|$|We propose and {{implement}} a direct test of the hypothesis of oligopolistic competition in the U. S. underwriting market against the alternative of implicit collusion <b>among</b> <b>underwriters.</b> We construct a simple model of interaction between heterogeneous underwriters and heterogeneous firms and solve it under two alternative assumptions: oligopolistic competition <b>among</b> <b>underwriters</b> and implicit collusion among them. The two solutions lead to different equilibrium relations between the compensation of underwriters of different quality {{on one hand and}} the time-varying demand for public incorporation on the other hand. Our empirical results, obtained using 39 years of IPO data, are generally consistent with the implicit collusion hypothesis [...] banks, especially larger ones, seem to internalize the effects of their underwriting fees and IPO pricing on their rivals...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} how bank-firm relationships affect post-deregulation competition <b>among</b> <b>underwriters</b> in the U. S. corporate bond underwriting market. I {{find that there}} is a trade-off between relationships and price in the demand equation and that this trade-off is sharply higher for junk bond issuers and first-time issuers. This finding is consistent with the certification effect of commercial bank underwriting. Commercial bank entry has increased bank competition to the extent that their client-specific relationships have increased product differentiation in the market. Since issuers with low reputation value the relationships more, the deregulation has increased competition the most in these segments...|$|R
40|$|We derive a {{behavioral}} {{measure of the}} IPO decision-maker's satisfaction with the underwriter's performance based on Loughran and Ritter (2002) and assess its ability to explain the decision-maker's choice <b>among</b> <b>underwriters</b> in "subsequent" securities offerings. Controlling for other known factors, IPO firms {{are less likely to}} switch underwriters when our behavioral measure indicates they were satisfied with the IPO underwriter's performance. Underwriters also extract higher fees for subsequent transactions involving satisfied decision-makers. Although our tests suggest that the behavioral model has explanatory power, they do not speak directly to whether deviations from expected utility maximization determine patterns in IPO initial returns.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{new evidence}} that initial IPO returns have persistent underwriter-specific components. These components cannot be explained by existing measures of underwriter quality, underwriter service, or controls for several known predictors of initial IPO returns. Tests that trace the roots of persistence most broadly support theories of asymmetric information <b>among</b> <b>underwriters.</b> I present such a model, and consistent with its predictions, I find that high underpricing underwriters (1) are responsible {{for a majority of}} the partial adjustment phenomenon, (2) make more informed analyst revisions, (3) experience superior market share growth, and (4) are more likely to serve an institutional clientele.

30|$|There has {{previously}} been some investigation into the inter-observer variability of using F- 18 -FDG PET/CT for staging and recurrence evaluation in various types of cancers; some using qualitative evaluation [25 – 28] with generally only moderate <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> observers, and some using SUV-based evaluation [5, 29 – 31] which demonstrate better (mostly near perfect) <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> observers. To our knowledge, only two previous studies have evaluated the inter-observer variability for response evaluation; Jacene et al. [8] and Benz et al. [32] for sarcoma and lung cancer patients, respectively, both using a semi-quantitative approach and demonstrating almost perfect <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> observers.|$|R

Both methods however, show a strong <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> observers. To our knowledge no other studies have made this direct comparison. A few studies have shown, that when using qualitative, visual approaches to staging various cancers, the inter-observer agreement is moderate in most cases [25, 26, 28, 37, 39], even the well established Deauville criteria for lymphoma evaluation was shown in a study by Itti et al in 114 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients to have only moderate <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> experienced observers [40].|$|R

50|$|For example, if {{a company}} sells $100 million of shares in an IPO and the gross spread is 7%, the {{underwriting}} syndicate will receive fees of $7 million. These fees will be divided <b>among</b> the <b>underwriters</b> arranging the offering.|$|R
40|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of underwriters charge a gross spread of exactly 7 %, as documented in Chen and Ritter (2000), more than a third charge something other than 7 %. Among offerings of $ 50 million and below where underwriters charge the firm other than 7 %, two-thirds of issuers pay more than published NASD 1 compensation guidelines. When underwriters charge less than expected, they do not trade-off IPO compensation with underpricing. However, our evidence suggests a trade-off between IPO compensation and future SEO business <b>among</b> <b>underwriters</b> that charge something other than 7 % and less than expected.

40|$|Background Extranodal spread (ENS) of tumors {{is widely}} used as a prognosticator for {{patients}} with head and neck cancer and is used as an indicator for postoperative treatment. However, the histopathologic <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> pathologists on {{the assessment of the}} presence or absence of this criterion has never been studied. Methods The interobserver and intraobserver <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> 10 pathologists on the diagnosis of ENS in 41 tumor-positive lymph nodes was evaluated. Results The kappa value of the interobserver <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> pathologists varied between 0. 14 and 0. 75, the overall kappa value was 0. 42 and 0. 49 in the 2 scoring sessions. The intraobserver kappa value varied between 0. 49 and 0. 95. Conclusion The intraobserver and interobserver <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> pathologists in the assessment of the presence of ENS was low in metastatic lymph nodes in the neck. Because of the widely accepted prognostic significance and therapeutic consequences of ENS, there is a need for internationally accepted reproducible criterion for the histopathologic assessment of ENS in metastatic lymph nodes in the neck.

30|$|As before, {{we first}} started with the {{independence}} model which included effects due to all three experts and RENEX. Next, a model allowing pairwise agreement was considered. This was done by adding terms to the previous model which are effects due to pairwise <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> experts and effects due to pairwise agreement between RENEX and an expert. This is the homogenous pairwise agreement model. The third model extended this homogeneous model by expanding the terms described in the homogeneous pairwise agreement model to reflect different strengths of pairwise agreement according to response categories. Finally, we considered the three-way agreement model by including effect due to three-way <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> experts and three-way <b>agreement</b> <b>among</b> expert and RENEX.
