5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are {{going to do something about}} climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

The planets will <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are all in conjunction with each other, even if not all of them actually are. This pattern gives a huge emphasis to the sign occupied by the planets, regardless of the sun sign.|$|E

50|$|The {{characters}} are Braling and Smith and their wives. Braling's wife was quite mean {{to him and}} forced him to marry her, while Smith's wife <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were still honeymooning.|$|R
25|$|During an EVP session, {{the cast}} picked up {{transmissions}} {{from a local}} Ham Radio operator and <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{did not know what}} it was. This was left in the final cut.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by French duo Jonas & François in London, England. It featured choreography by Jamie King, who worked on Madonna's Confessions, Re-Invention and Drowned World tours {{as well as her}} video for the single [...] "Sorry" [...] (2006). Japanese hip hop dancing duo Hamutsun Serve also made an appearance in the video. Before its release, Rolling Stone said that in the video Madonna and Timberlake <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "superheroes" [...] while they evade multiple obstacles. In the video, Madonna wore a cream colored corset, glistening black boots and styled her hair in platinum blond waves while Timberlake wore mainly denims and a scarf around his neck. Regarding the idea behind the music video, Madonna said that [...] "it was conceptualistic". She explained that the video was shot like a march past; [...] "It's a movement, and we want to take everybody with us." [...] About the idea of a black screen devouring everything, Madonna said, ...|$|E
500|$|Two authors later {{reviewed}} the short film and documented two central themes. The {{first is a}} [...] "Child/Man" [...] theme; the role of both a boy and an adult, which writer James M. Curtis states Jackson plays throughout the music video for [...] "Say Say Say". Curtis writes that the bathroom scene involving the shaving foam is reminiscent of boys copying their fathers. He adds that the scene marks [...] "the distinction between Michael's roles as a Child and as a Man". The writer also highlights the part where the singer supposedly becomes strengthened with a miracle potion, a further play on the [...] "Child/Man" [...] theme. Furthermore, Curtis observes that Paul and Linda McCartney seem to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are Jackson's parents in the short film. The author also notes that in a scene where Jackson is handed {{a bouquet of flowers}} from a girl, it is a reversal of one from City Lights, a 1931 film starring Charlie Chaplin, whom the singer greatly adored.|$|E
500|$|The fifth episode, [...] "Kush", {{was filmed}} on a damaged {{fuselage}} set, {{which was built}} by production designer Bridget McGuire. The episode's cast disliked the episode the most {{because they had to}} <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were in freezing temperatures, where in fact it was around 40degrees Celsius. Because it was an expensive set, the producers wanted to reuse it. It was later redesigned to look like the inside of a submarine for [...] "Requiem". It was redressed again for [...] "Revelations". Although released third, [...] "Fata Morgana" [...] was filmed as the fourth episode, and was considered to be aired after [...] "Folding Man". However, Tapping felt strongly that it would make a great stand alone episode after [...] "Sanctuary for All", and the characters appeared more comfortable with each other in [...] "Folding Man". Swapping the episodes caused a major continuity issue, in which Ashley appears to show scratches on her neck from [...] "Sanctuary for All" [...] in [...] "Folding Man", but not in between.|$|E

500|$|With these issues, Kavanagh {{argues that}} there {{are likely to be}} consequences. Firstly, if judges replace the text of a statute with the meaning given to it by a single {{minister}} in Parliament, there is a risk that they will attribute a meaning to it which was not supported by the MPs; interpretations, based on the views of ministers, are more likely to reflect the executive's intention than that of Parliament. Kavanagh also suggests that it could impact on the actions of ministers; rather than attempting to specify law through the difficult route of placing it in legislation, they can simply make a statement within Parliament about the legislation's intent. Lord Mackay's worry that this would increase the cost of litigation was also considered; under Pepper, every lawyer must go through every word said in both Houses of Parliament and in the various committees to ensure that they are giving the best advice to their client. Academics have also expressed worry about the reliability of Hansard as a source; [...] "the debate on the Bill is a battle of wits often carried out under extreme pressure and excitement where much more than the passage of this Bill may be at stake. The Ministers supporting it cannot be expected to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were under oath in a court of law".|$|E
2500|$|Sagwitch's son, Beshup Timbimboo, {{was shot}} seven times but survived and was rescued by family members. [...] Other {{members of the}} band hid in the willow brush of the Bear River, or tried to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were dead. [...] After the {{officers}} concluded the battle was over, they returned with the soldiers to their temporary encampment near Franklin. [...] Sagwitch and other survivors retrieved the wounded and built a fire to warm the survivors.|$|E

5000|$|Near {{the end of}} both 2013 and 2014, {{a series}} of {{commercials}} for the [...] "Jack's Munchie Meal" [...] combo featured a small puppet version of Jack interacting with a human late at night.

60|$|A rush of wind made further {{conversation}} {{just then}} impossible.

2500|$|Insight 2 – No matter how, when, and {{why people}} acquire self-defeating or irrational beliefs (i.e. beliefs {{that are the}} main cause of their {{dysfunctional}} emotional-behavioral consequences), if they are disturbed in the present, they tend to keep holding these irrational beliefs and continue upsetting themselves with these thoughts. They do so not because they held them in the past, but because they still actively hold them in the present (often unconsciously), while continuing to reaffirm their beliefs and <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are still valid. In their minds and hearts, the troubled people still follow the core [...] "musturbatory" [...] philosophies they adopted or invented long ago, or ones they recently accepted or constructed.|$|E
2500|$|Around 529 A.D. St. Benedict of Nursia (480-543 A.D.), later a Christian saint, {{the founder}} of western monasticism and [...] the Order of St. Benedict, today {{the patron saint of}} Europe, {{established}} the first monastery in Europe (Monte Cassino) on a hilltop between Rome and Naples, that became a model for the Western monasticism and one of the major cultural centers of Europe throughout the Middle Ages, where he wrote the [...] "Rule", containing directions for monks and Christians. The Rule of Saint Benedict {{is one of the most}} important written works in the shaping of Western civilian society because it included a written constitution, authority limited by law, and a degree of democracy. Besides, it mandated the moral obligations to care for the sick. In Monte Cassino St. Benedict founded a hospital that is considered today to have been the first hospital in Europe of the new era. There Benedictine [...] monks took care of the sick and wounded according to the Benedict's Rule. The monastic routine called for hard work. The care of the sick was such an important duty that those caring for them were enjoined to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> served Christ directly.|$|E

50|$|Instead, {{according}} to Herodotus, Histiaeus {{suggested that they}} pretend to follow the Scythian plan. So Histiaeus was sent as an ambassador to the Scythians {{to tell them that}} the tyrants would accept the Scythian plan, {{while the rest of the}} tyrants <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were demolishing the bridge. Histiaeus persuaded the Scythians to look for the Persian forces.|$|R

40|$|We study {{collective}} {{decisions by}} time-discounting individuals choosing a common consumption stream. We show that with any heterogeneity in time preferences, utilitarian aggregation necessitates a present bias. In lab experiments {{three quarters of}} "social planners" exhibited present biases, and less than two percent were time consistent.

50|$|The {{individual}} railways <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were independent {{operations and}} {{developed their own}} rolling stock. The extent of this independence is illustrated in an 1893 street plan of Berlin that shows the Silesian station (Berlin's departure point for the Ostbahn since 1882) and {{a few hundred yards}} apart from each other the main workshops for the Royal Berlin Division and the Royal Bromberg Division of the Ostbahn.|$|R

30|$|Moreover, {{temporary}} migrants {{tend not}} only to save more, but also to remit more. Hence, this favors a leakage of domestically produced savings towards the origin country. Many temporary migrants actually end up staying longer than expected, and the ex-post difference between temporary and permanent migrants is more blurred than expected. But <b>if</b> temporary migrants <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were to return home (i.e., saving and remitting more) but instead overstay, the miscalculation of their life-cycle wealth may become an additional burden for the destination countries.|$|R
