The aim of an observed wind climate measurement is to provide information to allow the best possible estimate of the energy on the site. Wind rose and wind speed frequency distribution variability is also important factor in assessing the uncertainty in the annual energy production of a wind farm. A high-quality wind speed measurement from a site is therefore of crucial importance in calculating wind atlas reducing the uncertainty in the predicted energy production. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to calculate wind climate and weibull distribution based on the data measured from an <b>anemometer</b> <b>mast</b> at RGPV Energy Park, Bhopal (India) using WAsP wind software...|$|E
