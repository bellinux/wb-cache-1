In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only {{at the request of the}} local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Not until 2001 did Congress make changing the station's name a condition of further federal funding.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1993, NSB {{launched}} the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, {{of which the}} main service ran from Steinkjer to Trondheim. The initial plans called to the continued use of the Class 92 rolling stock, but saw change in schedules and the upgrading platforms for NOK15 million. At the same time, the stations of Alstad, Langstein and Fleskhus were closed. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. After six months operation, the service had experienced a 40 percent growth in patronage. This was further increased {{with the opening of}} Trondheim <b>Airport</b> <b>Station</b> on 15 November 1994, which cost NOK24 million. The upgrades to the airport also included a new taxiway, which resulted in second Værnes Tunnel being built. A station was also established to serve Levanger Hospital on 20 December 1995. On 10 November 1994, the line received automatic train control. NSB was split up on 1 December 1996 and the ownership of the tracks and infrastructure was inherited by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the operation of trains was taken over by the new NSB. From 1994, Di6 and Di8 locomotives were introduced, but the Di6 proved unreliable and returned to the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of the Back River, MD150 enters the densely {{populated}} community of Essex. Just east of Marlyn Avenue, the highway's old alignment, Old Eastern Avenue, splits to the east. In the center of Essex, MD150 has a partial interchange with MD702 (Southeast Boulevard) that only allows access to and from the north; access to the southern part of the Back River Neck is provided via Old Eastern Avenue's connection with MD702 or the parallel Stemmers Run Road. The route continues northeast and receives the other end of Old Eastern Avenue before crossing the Middle River into the community of Middle River. MD150 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD700 (Martin Boulevard) at Lockheed Martin's Middle River Complex. The highway closely parallels the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and meets the northern end of MD587 (Wilson Point Road), after which the route passes along the northern edge of Martin State Airport. MD150 curves away from the railroad just west of the Martin State <b>Airport</b> <b>station</b> on MARC's Penn Line and the highway's intersection with MD43 (White Marsh Boulevard).|$|E
5|$|The railway past Værnes {{opened on}} 27 October 1902 as the Hell–Sunnan Line—today {{part of the}} Nordland Line. The plans for a railway station in the {{terminal}} of Værnes were launched in 1990, along with the {{plans to build a}} second terminal at the airport. Construction of the new terminal started on 1 October 1992. On 15 March 1993, NSB announced that they would start a commuter train service between Steinkjer and Melhus, south of Trondheim. The service would give a half-hour headway during peak hours between Stjørdal and Melhus, and a one-hour headway onwards to Steinkjer. NSB stated that the concept was based on the success of the Jæren Commuter Rail and that they hoped to have a 70% increase in ridership, in part due to the opening of the <b>airport</b> <b>station.</b> The concept would also take advantage of expansion of Trondheim Central Station that would co-locate the main coach- and train terminals in Trondheim. The service would also give direct services along the Dovre Line to Oppdal and the Røros Line to Tynset. Estimates were that the railway would capture a 10% ground transport market share. The commuter rail service started on 1 September 1993.|$|E
