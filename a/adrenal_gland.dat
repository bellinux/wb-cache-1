5|$|Thehuman genomeincludes {{approximately}} 20,000 protein coding {{genes and}} 70% of thesegenes are expressedin the normal, adult adrenal glands.Only some 250 genes are more specifically {{expressed in the}} adrenal glands compared to other organs and tissues.The <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> specific genes with highest level of expression include members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. Corresponding proteins are expressed in the different compartments of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland,</b> such as CYP11A1, HSD3B2 and FDX1 involved in steroid hormone synthesis and expressed in cortical cell layers, and PNMT and DBH involved in noradrenalin and adrenalin synthesis and expressed in the medulla.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamine {{release is}} {{stimulated by the}} {{activation}} of the sympathetic nervous system. Splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system innervate the medulla of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> When activated, it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{endocrine}} diseases involve dysfunctions of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production {{is associated with}} Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.|$|E
40|$|Very {{few cases}} of {{pheochromocytoma}} in functional accessory <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> {{have been documented}} in literature. We present a twenty-four year old Nigerian female who presented with pheochromocytoma.

50|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> {{are located}} above the kidneys in humans {{and in front}} of the kidneys in other animals. The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> (also known as suprarenal glands) are {{endocrine}} glands that produce a variety of hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol.|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} mice of line BA B/c and normal genotype and thymusless mice. The researchers have studied the mechanism of influence of the thymus on the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> and gonads. In adult mice thymus factors thymosine and tactivin suppress the enodcrinic function of testes. Thyposine is iedirectly responsible for stepping up the endocrinic functional activity of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> via the central necroendocrinic structures. Tactivin prevents ACTG from acting on the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands.</b> Thymosine takes part {{in the formation of}} the endocrinic functions of the gonads and <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> of young animals.

5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is at the}} centre of each <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland,</b> and is {{surrounded}} by the adrenal cortex. The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla. Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.|$|E
5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} scientific research to emerge from Morgan's laboratory concerned the biochemistry of vitamins and the nutritional value of foods. She became best known for her work examining the effects of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) on <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> function. In her early research work, Morgan analyzed processed foods and characterized their vitamin composition. She was the first to establish that a preservative, sulfur dioxide, protected vitamin C but damaged thiamine.|$|E
5000|$|... 11-Ketodihydrotestosterone (11-KDHT), {{also known}} as 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3,11-dione, is an endogenous, {{naturally}} occurring steroid and androgen prohormone that is produced primarily, if not exclusively, in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands.</b> It {{is closely related to}} 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione (11β-KA4), adrenosterone (11-ketoandrostenedione; 11-KA4), and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), which are also produced in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} {{are located on}} both sides of the body in the retroperitoneum, above and {{slightly}} medial to the kidneys. In humans, the right <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger. The adrenal glands measure approximately 3.0cm in width, 5.0cm in length, and up to 1.0cm in thickness. Their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10grams. The glands are yellowish in colour.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{function}} of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> may be impaired by conditions such as infections, tumors, genetic disorders and autoimmune diseases, or as {{a side effect of}} medical therapy. These disorders affect the gland either directly (as with infections or autoimmune diseases) or {{as a result of the}} dysregulation of hormone production (as in some types of Cushing's syndrome) leading to an excess or insufficiency of adrenal hormones and the related symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland,</b> from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
40|$|High {{environmental}} temperature of 40 0 С, applied in different developmental stages in White laboratory rat, is a {{stress on the}} body that load the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands.</b> In terms of hypotermic stress <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> work faster, producing increased amounts of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol. In terms of long-term stress, and load of the glands are entering a phase of temporary hypofunction. If they are healthy, they hypertrophied trying {{to compensate for the}} reduced release of hormones. During a long and exhausting stress comes to chronic hypofunction of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the normal}} situation, ACTH is {{released}} from the pituitary gland {{at the base of}} the brain. It acts on the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> to stimulate the production of steroid hormones (glucocorticoids). If the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are healthy, a single injection of tetracosactide results in a rise in blood cortisol (hydrocortisone) concentrations in 30 minutes. If the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> appear not to be working then tetracosactide injection can be given to check whether the problem is due to diseased or damaged adrenals or due to lack of pituitary ACTH.|$|R
40|$|Stranded harbour {{porpoises}} (Phocoena phocoena) are {{submitted for}} post-mortem investigation to the Veterinary Pathological Diagnostic Centrum (VPDC) of the Department Pathobiology at the Utrecht University (UU). The {{main purpose of}} this investigation {{is to determine the}} cause of death and is commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation (EL&I). In this study the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> of these harbour porpoises were examined using routine histopathology and linked to the health problems they probably had before they died. <b>Adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are releasing stress hormones in stressful situations. When animals suffer from chronic stress, <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are changing morphologically, histologically and in the way of releasing the stress hormones. In this study the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are examined morphological and histological. The hypothesis was that the histological changes correlate with presence and duration of stress as judged by post-mortem investigation. Adrenalitis, congestion, haemorrhage, necrosis, apoptosis, hypertrophy, edema, cysts, extracellular eosinophilic material and vacuolar degeneration were found. All the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> had {{one or more of these}} abnormalities. Several examined examples are probably stress-related. The weights of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> of the group with chronic stress were significant heavier than with acute stress. An adrenalitis in the transitional area of adrenal cortex and medulla has never been described in harbour porpoises and is recommended to be further investigated using IHC...|$|R
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> secretes a basal {{level of}} {{cortisol}} {{but can also}} produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest {{in the early morning}} and lowest in the evening {{as a result of the}} circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion. Cortisone is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11β-HSD on cortisol. The reaction catalyzed by 11β-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the PRKACA {{gene that}} promote {{abnormal}} enzyme activity {{have been linked}} to disease of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> Several mutations in PRKACA have been found in patients with Cushing’s syndrome that result in an increase in the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One mutation in the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation. The Cα gene has also been incriminated in a variety of cancers, including colon, renal, rectal, prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas.|$|E

50|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are {{surrounded}} by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak wall of connective tissue separates the glands from the kidneys. The <b>adrenal</b> <b>glands</b> are directly below the diaphragm, and {{are attached to the}} crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.|$|R
5|$|In poor conditions, {{the weight}} of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> may {{increase}} up to 200%, and rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated, and in water contaminated with oil, they swim less and their mortality increases. The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25Gy and the lethal dose of potassium cyanide is 7.20mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents. In one study, wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease. Exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats. When the pineal gland is removed or melatonin is administered in male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland</b> {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is}} important in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In both males and females, {{the base of the}} glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and <b>adrenal</b> <b>gland.</b> After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.|$|E
