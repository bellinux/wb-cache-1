40|$|This paper {{explains}} why conclusions {{that appear to}} be “facts ” can truly be “myths ” in industries like today’s telecommunications industry, where key suppliers operate in multiple vertical stages of production. The paper explains, for example, why an entrant’s decision to make or buy critical production inputs may be largely insensitive to the price of these inputs. It also reviews why a vertically-integrated producer (VIP) may prefer to assist, rather than disadvantage, retail rivals, and why a VIP may be disadvantaging rivals even when it provides them with the same wholesale service quality that it provides to its own <b>retail</b> <b>affiliate...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tourism {{distribution}} {{has seen}} a shift from the traditional business-to-business (B 2 B) channels via intermediaries to direct business-to-consumer (B 2 C) distribution. Following {{the introduction of the}} World Wide Web in the 1990 s, the new technology brought transparency to the market by allowing access to information that was previously the sole domain of the intermediaries in the travel industry. This study aims to understand how the evolving nature of information and communication technology (ICT), both past and current, is underpinned by a process of integration and consolidation in the New Zealand outbound wholesale travel sector. This single case study focused its investigation on a key player in the New Zealand outbound wholesale travel sector, one which was the best representative of the evolving changes outlined above. This approach allowed an in-depth, intensive investigation of the process of both horizontal and vertical integration in the presence of ICT. The findings show that the establishment of strategic alliances was a protection tactic employed by businesses in the intermediary sector, when threatened by the possibility of disintermediation. The strength of the new, integrated organisation manifested in this study as increased leverage and buying power with suppliers, enhancing the role of the outbound travel wholesaler in their aggregation and provision of product to their <b>affiliated</b> <b>retail</b> network. This in turn leads to an interesting and challenging balance for the different stakeholders involved in the distribution process, with the travel wholesaler seemingly holding the power balance when product availability is limited. The findings also show that while the wholesale sector acknowledges changes in consumer buying behaviour expressed by a preference for online booking, they are constrained by the cost of ICT development. Having already invested heavily in software development, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the required level of system enhancement. In an attempt to gain more synergies with common ICT usage and development, further integration and consolidation within the sector is a likely outcome, given the history of such amalgamations outlined in this study. This research makes an important contribution to theory by confirming the concept of reintermediation, showing the strength and value of the intermediary sector in the travel distribution structure. By exploring how ICT can be exploited by stakeholders to gain or regain control of their distribution channel, it is the focus on unique product and proprietary content that provides practical managerial implications, with the suggestion of leveraging such content as a strategic solution for the outbound travel industry. When determining operational solutions for the wholesale sector, this study reflects the difficulty in maintaining the required level of system enhancement due to the investment required, without further collaboration within the sector itself...|$|R
60|$|It {{had long}} been the notion of Frederick Erlcort, who held it playfully, held it seriously, {{according}} to the company he was in, {{that there might be a}} censorship of taste and conscience in literary matters strictly <b>affiliated</b> with the <b>retail</b> commerce in books. When he first began to propose it, playfully, seriously, as his listener chose, he said that he had noticed how in the great department stores where nearly everything to supply human need was sold, the shopmen and shopwomen seemed instructed by the ownership or the management to deal in absolute good faith with the customers, and not to misrepresent the quality, the make, or the material of any article in the slightest degree. A thing was not to be called silk or wool when it was partly cotton; it was not to be said that it would wash when it would not wash, or that the color would not come off when it would come off, or that the stuff was English or French when it was American.|$|R
50|$|Cleveland Robinson {{was born}} in Swabys Hope, in Manchester, Jamaica. After serving as a local constable and an {{elementary}} school teacher, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1944. When he arrived {{he took a job}} in a Manhattan dry goods store and very soon became active in District 65. In 1947 he owned his own shop; he {{went on to become a}} steward, and then a full-time organizer for the union. He was elected vice-president in 1950 and later in 1952 became secretary-treasurer. He held that position until he retired in 1992. When District 65 was <b>affiliated</b> with the <b>Retail,</b> Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union, Robinson held the positions of international vice-president and executive board member of that union. After disagreements with the retail, wholesale and department store workers union District 65 pulled out and organized the National Council of Distributive Workers of America and Robinson was elected president of the new body. In 1981, District 65 was affiliated with the United Auto Workers. At that time the union had 33,000 members in 37 states, Canada and Puerto Rico.|$|R
5000|$|The website {{was created}} by Riya, a company built to create a search engine used to search for similar faces among photos. The company found it {{difficult}} to monetize the service, however, so they created Like.com to use the same technology for a different purpose. Riya's CEO, Munjal Shah, noted that [...] "the same technology works well to find similar-looking products." [...] Riya's CTO and co-founder, Burak Göktürk, had previously worked with computer vision technology and has filed for two dozen facial-recognition patents under his name. The website was first announced at the Web 2.0 Conference on November 8, 2006. Like.com raised US$19.5 million from investors who included Bay Partners, BlueRun Ventures, and Leapfrog Ventures. The company planned to make money by acting as an <b>affiliate</b> to the <b>retail</b> sites that it links to, allowing it to receive about a 10% commission on each sale that the website sent to an online retailer. As of November 2006, the website had about two million unique products from 200 merchants. In 2015, the site became defunct and redirected users to Google's shopping search engine.|$|R
40|$|Input {{price and}} novel {{vertical}} control regulations are derived for a vertically integrated upstream monopolist when the monopolist {{can engage in}} non-price discrimination against a downstream rival. The paper extends the literature on sabotage in network industries by characterizing welfare-optimal regulatory policy with a realistic set of policy tools when sabotage can be undertaken, at a cost, by a monopoly access provider who also competes in a differentiated products Bertrand retail duopoly. Welfare optimal regulation balances the conflicting goals of reducing non-price discrimination and stimulating efficient production levels downstream. The regulator can induce the rst best in limited cases when the downstream rival is efficient relative to the downstream affiliate of the monopoly access provider, non-price discrimination by the integrated monopolist is sufficiently costly and downstream competition is not too intense. Otherwise, the regulator faces a trade-off between reducing the double markup problem by pricing access low while imposing restrictions on the control the monopoly input provider can exercise over its <b>retail</b> <b>affiliate,</b> versus pricing access high and allowing unrestricted vertical control within the vertically integrated rm in order to deter non-price discrimination. Discrimination costs and competition intensity determine which policy is optimal...|$|R
40|$|In 1999, the FCC {{authorized}} {{direct access}} to INTELSAT, allowing INTELSAT's U. S. customers and competitors to bypass INTELSAT's U. S. <b>retail</b> <b>affiliate</b> (COMSAT), and to take satellite capacity at wholesale prices directly from INTELSAT. This policy was modeled in many respects on the access and unbundling requirements applicable to domestic incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. At the same time, incumbent domestic cable TV system operators have not been required to provide wholesale open access to competitive Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seeking to provide residential broadband Internet service through existing proprietary cable facilities. Yet the policy arguments favoring open access to incumbent domestic cable systems appear to be stronger than those favoring {{direct access to}} INTELSAT. For example, it may be fairly debated whether entrenched cable system operators are now positioned to unfairly leverage their dominance in the multichannel video programming distribution (MVPD) market to thwart competition in the broadband ISP market, as some cable open access advocates assert. In contrast, {{it is clear that}} no analogous issues of tying were implicated by INTELSAT in 1999, when its position in the international telecommunications market was substantially nondominant and, in any event, it had no new product to tie to its established offerings. Similarly, while it may be debated whether or not a cable plant is a bottleneck facility that gatekeeps broadband Internet for many residential users, it is beyond cavil that INTELSAT in 1999 controlled virtually no such bottleneck facilities.
