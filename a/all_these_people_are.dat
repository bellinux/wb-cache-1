[...] The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying [...] "it's fucking distracting", and [...] "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush, making it sound as though Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: [...] "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but I hope he does. I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned it into something that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> enjoying." ...|$|E

To them it is [...] "the {{sanctity}} of the marriage tie"; but the sanctity of the marriage tie is dependent on the sanctity of the family, and the sanctity of the family is dependent on the sanctity of property. And yet I imagine <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> followers of One who never owned anything. It is curious! ...|$|E

One's in a {{position}} where <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> entitled to call themselves one's friends, simply because father put it in his will that I wasn't to get the money till I was twenty-five, instead of letting me have it at twenty-one like anybody else.

However, several wealthy and influential people start dying, and Hugo discovers that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> passing on board the [...] "Ulysses".|$|R
5000|$|In the 19th century, especially, the Potawatomi {{people and}} closely related tribes of Odawa and Ojibwe {{peoples of the}} Anishinaabe were {{affiliated}} as the Council of Three Fires. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>were</b> highly decentralized and bands operated independently.

6000|$|... "I {{am not a}} {{bit more}} fond of Mrs. Proudie than you are, Fanny," [...] said the vicar, with {{something}} like vexation {{in the tone of}} his voice, for he thought that his wife was hard upon him. [...] "But it is generally thought that a parish clergyman does well to meet his bishop now and then. And as I was invited there, especially to preach while <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> staying at the place, I could not well refuse." [...] And then he got up, and taking his candlestick, escaped to his dressing-room.|$|E

"Very {{few of them}} possess guns," [...] Jean Martin remarked, [...] "and {{that they}} should carry them shows how {{disturbed}} {{a state of mind}} <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> in. They know that their priests may be arrested and carried off, at any moment; and no doubt the report that an order has been issued to raise thirty thousand men throughout France, and that every town and village has to furnish its quota, has stirred them up even more effectually. I don't suppose that many of them think that the authorities will really try to drag men off, against their will; but the possibility is quite enough to inflame their minds." ...|$|E
6000|$|The lamest part of {{the whole}} shameful matter was the reason {{suggested}} by his enemies for his destruction of the law, to wit: that he did it to favor Christian, because Christian was his cousin! Whereas Stavely was the only individual in the entire nation who was not his cousin. The reader must remember that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> the descendants of half a dozen men; that the first children intermarried together and bore grandchildren to the mutineers; that these grandchildren intermarried; after them, great and great-great-grandchildren intermarried; so that to-day everybody is blood kin to everybody. Moreover, the relationships are wonderfully, even astoundingly, mixed up and complicated. A stranger, for instance, says to an islander:-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They would {{probably}} sing as well {{if they were}} civilized. Even if they didn't I shouldn't care. All {{the rest of their}} lives is muddle and cruelty and misery. Look at the women. There was that party of bent creatures we met yesterday, carrying great bundles, carrying even the men's cloaks and pipes, while their rascal husbands and brothers swaggered behind. Look at the cripples we have seen and the mutilated men. If we have met one man without a nose, we have met a dozen. And stunted people. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> like evil schoolboys; they do nothing but malicious mischief; there is nothing adult about them but their voices; they are like the heroic dreams of young ruffians in a penitentiary.

6000|$|The Indian {{trains are}} manned by natives exclusively. The Indian {{stations}} except {{very large and}} important ones--are manned entirely by natives, {{and so are the}} posts and telegraphs. The rank and file of the police are natives. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> pleasant and accommodating. One day I left an express train to lounge about in that perennially ravishing show, the ebb and flow and whirl of gaudy natives, that is always surging up and down the spacious platform of a great Indian station; and I lost myself in the ecstasy of it, and when I turned, the train was moving swiftly away. I was going to sit down and wait for another train, as I would have done at home; I had no thought of any other course. But a native official, who had a green flag in his hand, saw me, and said politely: ...|$|E
60|$|The most terrifying {{reflection}} (I am speaking now for myself) is that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> not {{the product}} of the exceptional but of the general--of the normality of their place, and time, and race. The ferocity and imbecility of an autocratic rule rejecting all legality and in fact basing itself upon complete moral anarchism provokes the no less imbecile and atrocious answer of a purely Utopian revolutionism encompassing destruction by the first means to hand, in the strange conviction that a fundamental change of hearts must follow the downfall of any given human institutions. These people are unable to see that all they can effect is merely a change of names. The oppressors and the oppressed are all Russians together; and the world is brought once more {{face to face with the}} truth of the saying that the tiger cannot change his stripes nor the leopard his spots.|$|E

"So there would, Fanny," [...] said Kilcullen, {{feeling that}} she had alluded to her brother's death; [...] "and I'm very, very sorry <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> here to bore you at such a time, and doubly sorry {{that they should have}} been asked on my account. They mistake me greatly, here. They know that I've thought Grey Abbey dull, and have avoided it; and now that I've {{determined}} to get over the feeling, because I think it right to do so, they make it ten times more unbearable than ever, for my gratification! It's like giving a child physic mixed in sugar; the sugar's sure to be the nastiest part of the dose. Indeed I have no dislike to Grey Abbey at present; though I own I have no taste for the sugar in which my kind mother has tried to conceal its proper flavour." ...|$|E
60|$|And yet {{dispersed}} as <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are,</b> {{they are}} far more closely drawn together to common ends and common effort than the filthy savages who ate food rotten and uncooked {{in the age of}} unpolished stone. They live in the mere opening phase of a synthesis of effort the end of which surpasses our imagination. Such intercourse and community as they have is only a dawn. We look towards the day, the day of the organized civilized world state. The first clear intimation of that conscious synthesis of human thought to which I look, the first edge of the dayspring, has arisen--as Socialism, as I conceive of Socialism. Socialism is to me no more and no less than the awakening of a collective consciousness in humanity, a collective will and a collective mind out of which finer individualities may arise forever in a perpetual series of fresh endeavours and fresh achievements for the race.|$|E
60|$|THE largest {{annual event}} in New Orleans is a {{something}} which we arrived {{too late to}} sample--the Mardi-Gras festivities. I saw the procession of the Mystic Crew of Comus there, twenty-four years ago--with knights and nobles and so on, clothed in silken and golden Paris-made gorgeousnesses, planned and bought for that single night's use; and in their train all manner of giants, dwarfs, monstrosities, and other diverting grotesquerie--a startling and wonderful sort of show, as it filed solemnly and silently {{down the street in}} the light of its smoking and flickering torches; but it is said that in these latter days the spectacle is mightily augmented, as to cost, splendor, and variety. There is a chief personage--'Rex;' and if I remember rightly, neither this king nor any of his great following of subordinates is known to any outsider. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> gentlemen of position and consequence; and it is a proud thing to belong to the organization; so the mystery in which they hide their personality is merely for romance's sake, and not on account of the police.|$|E
60|$|In short, {{about the}} latter end of May I {{began to make}} all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this, it {{occurred}} to me, that seeing <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> banished by the czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet, when they came there, were at liberty to go whither they would; why did they not then go away to {{any part of the}} world wherever they thought fit? and I began to examine what should hinder them from making such an attempt.|$|R
60|$|And since I am {{upon the}} {{detection}} of this most refin'd Practice, I crave leave to descend to some particular Instances, which will the better evince the Truth of this Matter, and make it appear that either this was really a Crolian Plot, or else <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>People</b> <b>were</b> perfectly Distracted; and as their Wits in that Lunar World, are much higher strain'd than ours, so their Lunacy, where it happens, must according to the Rules of Mathematical Nature, bear an extream Equal in proportion.|$|R

"Oh, I {{was right}} enough," [...] he went on, in that strange {{continuous}} and sleepy tone which always angered his hearers at acute moments, [...] "I was right enough when I said <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> good. They are heroes; they are saints. Now {{and then they}} may perhaps steal a spoon or two; they may beat a wife or two with the poker. But they are saints all the same; they are angels; they are robed in white; they are clad with wings and haloes--at any rate compared to that man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That!--that! oh, that's {{really the}} work of that Genoese seaman! But to return to my noises; {{there used to be}} in the old days the sound of {{trumpets}} outside that gate. War trumpets! I'm sure they were trumpets. I have read somewhere that Drake, who was the greatest of these men, used to dine alone in his cabin on board ship to the sound of trumpets. In those days this town was full of wealth. Those men came to take it. Now the whole land is like a treasure-house, and <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> breaking into it, whilst we are cutting each other's throats. The only thing that keeps them out is mutual jealousy. But they'll come to an agreement some day--and by the time we've settled our quarrels and become decent and honourable, there'll be nothing left for us. It has always been the same. We are a wonderful people, but it has always been our fate to be"--he did not say [...] "robbed," [...] but added, after a pause--"exploited!" ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the way up}} to {{the lean}} man's house you pass a little village, all of houses like the king's house, so that as you ride through you can see {{everybody}} sitting at dinner, or if it be night, lying in their beds by lamplight; for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> terribly afraid of ghosts, and would not lie in the dark for any favour. After the village, there is only one more house, and that is the lean man's. For the people are not very many, and live all by the sea, and the whole inside of the island is desert woods and mountains. When the lean man goes into this forest, he is very much ashamed to say it, but he is always in a terrible fright. The wood is so great and empty and hot, and it is always filled with curious noises; birds cry like children and bark like dogs, and he can hear people laughing and felling trees; and the other day (when he was far in the woods) he heard a great sound like the biggest mill-wheel possible going with a kind of dot-and-carry-one movement like a dance. That was the noise of an earthquake away down below him in the bowels of the earth, and that is the same thing as to say away up towards you in your cellar in Kilburn. All these noises make him feel lonely and scared, and he doesn't quite know what he is scared of. Once when he was just about to cross a river, a blow struck him on the top of his head and knocked him head-foremost down the bank and splash into the water. It was a nut, I fancy, that had fallen from a tree, by which accidents people are sometimes killed. But at the time he thought it was a black boy.|$|E
6000|$|When Swift was in {{love with}} Stella, and {{despatching}} her a letter from London thrice a month by the Irish packet, you may remember how he would begin letter No. XXIII., we will say, on the very day when XXII. had been sent away, stealing out of the coffee-house or the assembly so as to be able to prattle with his dear; [...] "never letting go her kind hand, as it were," [...] as some commentator or other has said in speaking of the Dean and his amour. When Mr. Johnson, walking to Dodsley's, and touching the posts in Pall Mall as he walked, forgot to pat the head of one of them, he went back and imposed his hands on it,--impelled I know not by what superstition. I have this I hope not dangerous mania too. As soon as a piece of work is out of hand, and before going to sleep, I like to begin another: it may be to write only half a dozen lines: but that is something towards Number the Next. The printer's boy has not yet reached Green Arbor Court with the copy. Those people who were alive half an hour since, Pendennis, Clive Newcome, and (what do you call him? what {{was the name of the}} last hero? I remember now!) Philip Firmin, have hardly drunk their glass of wine, and the mammas have only this minute got the children's cloaks on, and have been bowed out of my premises--and here I come back to the study again: tamen usque recurro. How lonely it looks now <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> gone! My dear good friends, some folks are utterly tired of you, and say, [...] "What a poverty of friends the man has! He is always asking us to meet those Pendennises, Newcomes, and so forth. Why does he not introduce us to some new characters? Why is he not thrilling like Twostars, learned and profound like Threestars, exquisitely humorous and human like Fourstars? Why, finally, is he not somebody else?" [...] My good people, it is not only impossible to please you all, but it is absurd to try. The dish which one man devours, another dislikes. Is the dinner of to-day not to your taste? Let us hope to-morrow's entertainment will be more agreeable. [...] . I resume my original subject. What an odd, pleasant, humorous, melancholy feeling it is to sit in the study, alone and quiet, now <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> gone who have been boarding and lodging with me for twenty months! They have interrupted my rest: they have plagued me at all sorts of minutes: they have thrust themselves upon me when I was ill, or wished to be idle, and I have growled out a [...] "Be hanged to you, can't you leave me alone now?" [...] Once or twice they have prevented my going out to dinner. Many and many a time they have prevented my coming home, because I knew they were there waiting in the study, and a plague take them! and I have left home and family, and gone to dine at the Club, and told nobody where I went. They have bored me, those people. They have plagued me at all sorts of uncomfortable hours. They have made such a disturbance in my mind and house, that sometimes I have hardly known what was going on in my family, and scarcely have heard what my neighbor said to me. They are gone at last; and you would expect me to be at ease? Far from it. I should almost be glad if Woolcomb would walk in and talk to me; or Twysden reappear, take his place in that chair opposite me, and begin one of his tremendous stories.|$|E
5000|$|Several writers, {{philosophers}} and history writers interconnected this culture in a same category.
