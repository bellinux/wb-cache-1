In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.

40|$|Abstract – Relevés from {{meadows and}} {{pastures}} of South Transdanubia (Hungary) are evaluated by clustering and ordination methods. The relevé selection {{focused on the}} Arrhenatheretalia order but its transitions towards other types were also included. The groups of relevés are delimited and described according to differential, dominant and con-stant species. Ecological conditions of the groups were compared using indicator values. Nine groups were distinguished, four of them belonging strictly to the order Arrhenathe-retalia. Each alliance of Arrhenatheretalia presented {{in the study area}} (Cynosurion, Arrhe-natherion) was represented by two groups. Groups from these two alliances are separated along a light gradient, while groups of the same alliance differ in nutrient values. Within Cynosurion, the nutrient-poor group cannot be identified unambiguously as any syntaxa previously known from Hungary. The nutrient-rich Cynosurion meadows are similar to Lolio–Cynosuretum, however, they show a stronger relationship with wet meadows. Within Arrhenatherion, Pastinaco–Arrhenatheretum is recognised as a hay meadow of nutrient-rich soils. The other meadow type is similar to Filipendulo–Arrhenatheretum, thus raising syntaxonomical problems. There are transitional groups towards semi-dry andwetmeadows, one dynamic phase and one outlier group <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>five</b> clusters...|$|E
40|$|SLIM 1, {{a member}} of the EIN 3 -like (EIL) family of {{transcription}} factors in Arabidopsis, is the regulator of many sulfur-deficiency responsive genes. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>other</b> proteins of <b>the</b> family, three regulate ethylene responses and two have unassigned functions. Contrary to the well-defined ethylene signaling, the pathway leading from sensing sulfate status to the activation of its acquisition via SLIM 1 is completely unknown. SLIM 1 binds to the 20 nt-long specific UPE-box sequence; however, it also recognizes the shorter TEIL sequence, unique for the whole EIL family. SLIM 1 takes part in the upregulation and downregulation of various sulfur metabolism genes, but also it controls the degradation of glucosinolates under sulfur deficient conditions. Besides facilitating the increased flux through the sulfate assimilation pathway, SLIM 1 induces microRNA 395, specifically targeting ATP sulfurylases and a low-affinity sulfate transporter, SULTR 2; 1, thus affecting sulfate translocation to the shoot. Here, we briefly review the identification, structural characteristics and molecular function of SLIM 1 {{from the perspective of the}} whole EIL protein family...|$|R
40|$|Background: Historically, most {{refugees}} have originated from countries with {{high rates of}} infectious diseases. However, non-communicable diseases are becoming increasingly more common in refugee populations resettling in the United States. Purpose: Examine the prevalence of selected chronic conditions among newly arriving adult Cuban refugees and compare the results to the prevalence of the same chronic conditions <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> top <b>five</b> incoming refugee populations: Burmese, Bhutanese, Iranians, Iraqis, and Somalis Methods: Data {{used in this study}} were derived from the Department of State’s Medical History and Physical Examination Worksheet and included all adult (≥ 20 years) Cuban, Burmese, Bhutanese, Iranian, Iraqi, and Somali refugees identified through the Center’s for Disease Control and Prevention Electronic Disease Notification Center, and who entered the United States during October 2008 -September 2011. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 19. 0. Descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, and logistic regressions were performed to assess the prevalence of chronic conditions, check for associations between country of origin and outcome of interest, and to estimate the relative risk for Cubans compared to the remaining top five incoming refugee populations. Results: A total of 99, 920 adults were included in the study. The largest population was Iraqi (27. 6 %), followed by Bhutanese (26. 2 %), Burmese (24. 4 %), Iranian (8. 6 %), Cuban (7. 9 %), and Somali (5. 3 %). All outcomes of interest were significantly associated with country of origin. Cubans were at a greater risk for asthma but were not the greatest at-risk population for the remaining outcomes of interest. Conclusion: The prevalence of non-communicable diseases was higher <b>among</b> <b>the</b> incoming refuges than has been traditionally assumed.

40|$|Objectives Workers in {{the rubber}} {{industry}} {{are exposed to}} a complex mixture of hazardous substances and have increased risk of developing several diseases. However, there is no up to date survey examining the exposure in the Swedish rubber industry. One of the toxic compounds in the industry is carbon disulfide (CS 2), which is biotransformed to 2 -thiothiazolidine- 4 carboxylic acid (TTCA). TTCA {{is used as a}} biomarker of CS 2 exposure, but there seem to exist inter- and intraindividual variability; which could partly be due to genetic variation. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine TTCA levels and the modifying effects of glutathione-related genes in a group of Swedish rubber workers. Methods Urine was collected from both exposed workers and controls during the last 4 h of the work shift. The level of TTCA in urine was analyzed by liquid chromatograpy tandem mass spectrometry. Genotyping of the single nucleotide polymorphisms GCLC- 129, GCLM- 588, GSTA 1 - 52, GSTP 1 - 105 and GSTP 1 - 114 and deletions of GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 were performed with real-time PCR or ordinary PCR and subsequent agarose electrophoresis. Results The highest levels of TTCA were found among workers curing with salt bath, hot air, microwaves or Xuid-bed, and lower levels were found among workers curing with injection and compression molding. Furthermore, with respect to GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 there were statistically significant differences in TTCA-levels between genotypes among exposed workers but not <b>among</b> controls. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>five</b> polymorphisms had no impact on the TTCA levels. Conclusions The present study demonstrates relatively high levels of TTCA in urine from Swedish rubber workers. Polymorphisms in GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 modify the levels...|$|R

Fifty one police officers apprehending sixty perpetrators were content analyzed into four categories including race (of both officer and perpetrator), gender (of both officer and perpetrator), US Uniform Crime Report (UCR) type offense (type I or type II), {{as well as the}} specific type of crime depicted. The vast majority of police officers shown on COPS were white male (92 %) and the majority of offenders were nonwhite males (62 %). Black men were most likely to be shown engaging in a crime of burglary or theft or crimes involving drugs. Hispanic men were most likely to be involved in UCR Part I offenses; however, they were in a distinct minority on these episodes. On the other hand, the most likely scenario for white offenders is to be shown committing an alcohol related offense or causing, or being part of, a domestic disturbance. Few white women were included on the show. One was a police officer and <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>five,</b> one was looking for a lost child and the others were picked up for a variety of relatively minor violations (driving under the influence, drug possession, stolen bike, animal disturbance).

The authors argue that media images depicted in COPS are at odds with UCR official crime statistics and reinforce stereotypes and myths about the nature of crime in the United States. 1 All authors are members of the Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, Old Dominion University...|$|E
40|$|The ageing Colombo Sewerage {{system has}} been deteriorating {{over the years and}} the system was unable to cater to the {{increased}} demand and led to many environmental issues. Therefore, certain improvements were carried out in the last 3 decades to address the prevailed issues. But, sewer pipeline stoppages and collapses were increasing gradually with the dilapidated condition of the system, even with the newly introduced improvements. Collapses, blocks and chokes are experienced regularly in the system. This has led to overflows and short-circuiting which has caused serious pollution in water bodies and the environment as a whole. As most of the major collapses and overflows had not been attended to and not been given necessary priority due to various constraints, the situation became critical day by day, so that life styles of the public have been badly affected. Though a few studies have been conducted to develop the existing sewerage system in Sri Lanka by various non government organizations, the expectations were not achieved successfully and some issues still remain. Only a few recommendations of these researches were implemented. Therefore, it is vital to identify the issues in the existing Sewerage Systems in Colombo Municipal Area, to improve it into a smooth running, environmental friendly sewerage system. Thus, {{there is a need to}} conduct a research to explore the root causes for the failures of the existing sewerage system. The case study research approach was used to investigate the research problem, by interviewing key stakeholders, including the Engineers, within a selected administrative district. Further, a questionnaire survey was carried out <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>five</b> administrative districts in the CMC areas to observe whether the identified root causes through the case study are similar and common to the other districts too.

Furthermore, it was observed that the root causes for the failures are common and acceptable to the entire sewerage system in CMC area through the survey. Further it is recognized that these root causes are generated in all three stages; design, construction and maintenance.

Data from the biennial 1984 through 1990 rounds of the Longitudinal Study on Aging were used to predict the movelnot-move behavior of a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized respondents aged 70 years and over in 1984. Six motives for elderly migration were identified: health, affiliation, economic security, comfort, functional independence, and getting on with life after a family crisis.

40|$|Scientific summary Previously, quality {{management}} {{in the field of}} infertility and endometriosis care mainly focussed on only two out of the six dimensions of the quality of care defined by the Institute of Medicine, namely effectiveness and safety. The studies included in this PhD project represent important steps {{to bridge the gap between}} the quality dimension patient-centredness and evidence based medicine by examining six hypotheses in eleven studies. Every hypothesis was examined in at least two Western-European countries. Based on the results of the studies included in this PhD project, we can summarize the following statements regarding the quality dimension patient-centredness: (i) it is important, (ii) it can be described by ten dimensions, (iii) it can be reliably assessed, (iv) it can be a basis for benchmarking between clinics, (v) specific care aspects requiring improvement can be identified, and (vi) it can be integrated in a quality indicator set. Different stakeholder groups of reproductive medicine from different countries agree that patient-centred care is important The discrete choice experiments on infertility care (chapter 2) and the systematic Delphi-consensus-study on infertility and endometriosis care (chapter 11) complemented each other in ranking patient-centredness for importance <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>five</b> quality dimensions. Patients and professionals, including gynaecologists, embryologists, counsellors and nurses/midwifes, agree that the patient-centredness of infertility and endometriosis care is important (chapters 2, 11). The only quality dimensions valued more than patient-centredness, bysome stakeholder groups, are safety and effectiveness (chapters 2, 11). Remarkably, patients and physicians are willing to trade-off a proportion of pregnancy rate per cycle for more patient-centred care (chapter 2). Infertility and endometriosis clinic staff should know that patients value the patient-centredness of care more than they do themselves (chapters 2, 11). Quality managers should monitor and improve thepatient-centredness of their clinic. International condition-specific concepts can clearly describe patient-centred infertility and endometriosis care Systematic reviews (chapters 1, 7), monolingual qualitative studies (chapter 3, 8) and multilingual qualitative studies (chapter 4, 8) were complementary for the development of concepts valid for Western-Europe. Patient-Centred Infertility Care (PCIC) and Patient-Centred Endometriosis Care (PCEC) are defined by ten similar dimensions, including human factors of care, such as emotional support, and system factors of care, like continuity and transition of care (chapters 1, 3, 4, 7, 8). All specific care aspects important to infertile and endometriosis patients can be fitted into these ten dimensional concepts (chapters 1, 3, 4, 7, 8). The concepts of PCIC and PCEC provide infertility and endometriosis clinic staff with insight into how to interact with patients in a patient-centred way. All ten dimensions of PCIC and PCEC should be watched over by quality managers of Western-European fertility and endometriosis clinics. The patient-centredness of infertility and endometriosis care can be internationally assessed in a valid and reliable way The included studies developed the following two reliable and internationally valid patient-centredness questionnaires: the Patient-Centred Infertility Care Questionnaire (E-PCIC-Q) and the ENDOCARE-questionnaire (ECQ; chapter 6, 8). The questionnaires assessed all ten dimensions of, respectively, PCIC and PCEC. Qualitative research proved a trustworthy alternative for assessing the patient-centredness of specific infertility and endometriosis care pathways not covered by these questionnaires (chapter 5). The ECQ proved valid and reliable for Western-Europe (chapters 8, 9, 10). European studies on the E-PCIC-Q are being performed, but the first intermediate analysis showed that both reliability and validity results for Belgium and the Netherlands were satisfactory (chapter 6). Western-European fertility and endometriosis clinics are advised to assess regularly the patient-centredness of their care with the E-PCIC-Q and ECQ. ´International benchmarking for the patient-centredness of infertility and endometriosis care is feasible´ Three international benchmarking studies reliably detected differences in the patient-centredness of two fertility clinics (chapter 6), two endometriosis clinics (chapter 9) and ten European countries providing endometriosis care to members of patient associations (chapter 10) with the E-PCIC-Q and the ECQ. The cultural differences within Western-Europe in the rankings of important care dimensions, and the differences between clinics/countries samples in the patient characteristics influencing patients assessments were taken into account by the E-PCIC-Q and the ECQ (chapter 6, 8, 9, 10). The overall patient-centredness of infertility and endometriosis care was similar across two European university clinics (chapters 6, 9). However, each clinic proved more patient-centred than the other with respect to specific and different dimensions of PCIC and PCEC (chapters 6, 9). AcrossWestern-Europe, Belgium, Denmark and Italy provided the most patient-centred endometriosis care (chapter 10) and are therefore likely to host clinics with excellent patient-centredness. Western-European fertility and endometriosis clinics are advised to use the reciprocally translated E-PCIC-Q and ECQ to reliably compare their patient-centredness with other clinics across Europe. Sound targets for patient-centred quality improvement projects can be identified Systematic reviews on the patients perspective on care (chapters 1, 7), qualitative research (chapter 5) and E-PCIC-Q and ECQ-assessments(chapters 6, 9, 10) all identified reliable targets for patient-centredquality improvement projects at, respectively, overall (chapters 1, 7),clinic (chapters 5, 6, 10) or national level (chapter 9). Frequently identified targets for improving the patient-centredness of infertility care are: informing patients on the emotional aspects of fertility problems and treatments (chapter 1, 6) and using different accommodations for infertile and pregnant patients (chapters 1, 5). Frequently identified targets for improving the patient-centredness of endometriosis care are: staff showing respect for patients by taking their health complaints seriously (chapter 7, 10) and surgically diagnosing endometriosis timely (chapter 7, 9). To identify clinic specific targets to improve the patient-centredness of their care Western-European infertility and endometriosis clinics are encouraged to use, respectively, the E-PCIC-Q and the ECQ. ´Patient-centredness can be integrated in a quality indicator set, integrating allquality dimensions, to be used for international benchmarking of reproductive medicine´ The included quality indicator set covering all six quality dimensions including patient-centredness, serves to provide a balanced judgement of quality of care (chapter 11). Nevertheless, more in-depth insight in all quality dimensions is required. For patient-centredness, this insight can be provided by the E-PCIC-Q and the ECQ. The patient-centred approach of involving patients in the development and selection of quality indicators was successful (chapter 11). Quality management of fertility and endometriosis clinics should monitor all sixquality dimensions, including patient-centredness. The mentioned six hypotheses will all benefit from further research. Furthermore, the included studies are inspirational for future research designed to improve the patient-centredness of care and to expand the patient-centred approach by involving patients in the management of quality dimensions like safety and effectiveness, and in the formulation of priorities for reproductive research.
