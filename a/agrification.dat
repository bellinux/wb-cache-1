40|$|Potato sprout inhibitors are {{generally}} applied to suppress sprouting during winter storage. This study presents the compared environmental {{profiles of the}} two sprout inhibitors available on the Dutch market: A traditional chemical product with isopropyl- 3 -chlorophenylcarbamate (CIPC) and isopropyl-phenylcarbamate (IPC) and a new <b>agrification</b> product with S-(+) -carvone derived from caraway seed (Carum carvi), examining the common idea that natural products are less harmful to the environment than chemical products. Nine environmental effect scores are evaluated based on emissions and energy use during the entire life cycle (life cycle analysis, LCA). A substantial difference {{is found in the}} environmental profiles of the two sprout inhibitors. In seven environmental effects (C) IPC scores better than carvone. Carvone only scores better with regard to human toxicity and ozone depletion. This study has also produced a clear insight into the relevant factors in the life cycles determining the environmental profiles. Regarding carvone, the essential factors are the use of fertilizer in the cultivation of caraway and the relatively high amount of carvone used per ton of potatoes as compared to (C) IPC. It is recommended that environmental LCA's be performed for other <b>agrification</b> products. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to analyze {{the changes in the}} {{territory}} dynamics of brick production in the south-east of Santiago del Estero and of grain production in the so-called Zona Núcleo Granífera (the Core Grain Region), and their impact on the urban-rural relation and on workers’ health. In order to do this, we make use of quantitative (database creation based on institutional epistemological records) and qualitative research techniques (interviews, participating observation, bibliographical and documentary analysis). Within the framework of agricultural frontier advancement, soyazation and <b>agrification,</b> we analyze the relation between labor and territory {{in order to understand the}} health-disease-care process in two regional zoonotic diseases: Chagas Disease and Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever...|$|E
