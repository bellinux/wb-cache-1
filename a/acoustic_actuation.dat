Control on the size of droplets produced in microfluidic devices can be achieved through passive (only controlled by the flow fields of the two immiscible fluids) and active methods (external actuation provided). The present work focuses on the investigation of a novel method with the incorporation of a piezoelectric actuator to control the droplet formation process in a flow-focusing device. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>actuation</b> causes a boundary-induced microstreaming flow in the two immiscible fluids at the cross-junction of the device. The scale of the microstreaming flow is within the Stokes layer and is periodic in nature. Phase-resolved micro-particle-image-velocity (μPIV) is applied for extracting the global, phase-averaged and periodic components from the microstreaming flow. Vibrating fluid-fluid interfaces are observed and <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation</b> causes a reduction in the droplet size. Characterization of droplet formation under <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation</b> is performed. The effects of the control parameters, flow rate ratio, voltage and frequency of <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation,</b> continuous phases with different viscosities on droplet formation are characterized. Droplet size decreases with increase in the voltage and frequency of <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation.</b> Continuous phases with higher viscosities cause a restrained vibration motion at the fluid-fluid interface with a reduced extent of vibration. Since droplet formation mainly depends on the extent of the vibration motion, <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation</b> is more effective in affecting the breakup of droplets in a continuous phase with a lower viscosity. The evolution of the interfacial curvature during the whole droplet formation process in a flow-focusing device is investigated. Two critical curvature values that determine the detachment of liquid thread from walls of orifice and the onset of pinch-off are identified. The rate of evolution mainly depends on the flow rates of the two immiscible fluids and the flow through the gap between the liquid thread and the walls of the orifice. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>actuation</b> reduces the time for triggering the onset of pinch-off as the vibrating interface hinders the process of relaxation of interfacial energy and making pinch-off easier to trigger.

Phase-averaged two-phase micro-particle-image-velocimetry (mu PIV) was applied to extract the oscillating flow fields in the two immiscible phases. Periodic contracting and expanding streaming flow fields in the dispersed phase and steady streaming flow fields in the continuous phase were obtained. The steady streaming flow in the continuous phase provides an additional driving force which helps to drive the continuous phase into the gutters.

An experimental study is performed to investigate the effects of <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation</b> on heat transfer and flow characteristics of an impinging confined water jet. The water, collected in a reservoir, is accelerated by means of free fall and impinged on a smooth plate at which constant heat flux is applied. Two different nozzle geometries were investigated: sudden and smooth contracting nozzle. The flow is actuated with a loudspeaker at different Strouhal numbers {{in the range of}} 0 ~ 1, where nozzle-to-plate spacing of 6 nozzle diameters are tested while Reynolds number is kept constant at 10000 to study the effects of other parameters [...] Flow visualization, turbulence, and surface heat transfer measurements are performed in the scope of this work. A sharp, continuous and significant roll-up evidence is seen in the smooth contracting nozzle, with the actuation frequency of St= 0. 175, at the axial location of about z/D~ 2 where the <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation</b> has caused a decrease in heat transfer.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new computational method {{for the analysis of}} fluids subjected to high frequency mechanical forcing. We focus attention on surface acoustic wave droplet microfluidics. In these problems, we distinguish three time scales 1) the fast (μ s) time scale of Rayleigh waves on the solid surface, 2) medium (μ s-ms) time scale of acoustic wave in the fluid droplet, and 3) slow (ms-s) time scale of capillary wave propagation on the fluid-air surface. Finite element modelling of such problems has been limited in its ability to handle the broad range of timescales. In particular, direct time integration techniques are computationally expensive because of the need to resolve the smallest timescale. Here we solve the Helmholtz equation in the frequency domain, applying hierarchical finite element approximation based on unstructured meshes hierarchical 1, where both pressure field and geometry are independently approximated with arbitrary and heterogeneous polynomial order.

40|$|Ultrasonic surface <b>acoustic</b> wave (SAW) <b>actuation</b> is a {{promising}} technique for generating fluid flow in microfluidic devices, with many potential applications in fluid and particle manipulation. One particular application is ultrasonic atomisation, {{which has already}} been proposed as {{an effective means of}} generating fine particle mists for pulmonary drug delivery. The mechanism behind ultrasonic SAW-induced atomisation is the generation of large capillary waves on the fluid surface which, when at sufficient amplitude, can break off, forming small droplets. Capillary waves appear across a huge range of frequency and length scales in ultrasonic microfluidic systems. The physics behind the generation of these waves is not well understood. For the unstable waves that produce atomised droplets, the process of breaking and droplet ejection has been previously described, and some research has been done in determining the size of droplets ejected. However, the rate of atomisation, and its dependence on excitation level and frequency, is not known. In this thesis we experimentally measure the capillary wave vibrations induced by ultrasonic SAW actuation of a sessile drop, and the rate of atomisation from the drop. Our vibration measurements agree very precisely with the predictions of capillary wave turbulence theory, which predicts a broadband “cascade” power-law relation in the spectrum of vibration. Ours is the first description of wave turbulent behaviour in microfluidic systems; we demonstrate the power-law behaviour over three decades of frequency. We also identify an oscillation at the fundamental resonance frequency of the drop near 200 Hz, which we demonstrate to be directly induced by the excitation at 20 MHz. This fundamental resonance drives the wave turbulent cascade. The atomisation rate is directly connected to this resonance. We show that atomisation does not take place when the excitation level is below a particular threshold; beyond this threshold, atomisation rate steadily increases with excitation amplitude. The threshold behaviour of the resonance is the opposite: steadily increasing with excitation level up to the threshold, then remaining constant above the threshold...|$|R

40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{transverse}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation</b> of { 110 }-cut Ni-Mn-Ga single crystals are discussed. In this actuation mode, crystals are used {{that have the}} { 110 }- type twinning planes parallel {{to the base of}} the crystal. The first method employs two 33 -mode piezoelectric stacks, mounted at 45 deg to the base of a single crystal, to produce a shear stress on the 110 planes. The second method utilizes a single 15 -mode piezoelectric stack, normally incident to the crystal base, to generate shear pulses directly. Both methods are capable of producing <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation.</b> Due to the small size of the 15 -mode stack, and the need to prestress the 33 -mode stacks to prevent them from failing due to tensile stresses, the single stack actuator was chosen for further investigation. Engineering strains of up to -y = 0. 12, the theoretical maximum for Ni-Mn-Ga, have been realized in the single stack configuration. Actuating over a smaller range, the actuator produced 5 % strain in as little as 2. 5 s, at a pulse frequency of 100 Hz, with over 3 % occurring within the first second. Actuation against a load was also investigated. The blocking stress was found to be around 0. 14 MPa, indicating that the acoustic stress exceeded the twinning stress by approximately this amount. (cont.) The maximum output energy density of the actuator was approximately 4000 J/m 3, for an opposing stress of 0. 08 MPa. Given the electrical power consumption of the actuator, which is around 375 mW at 100 Hz, the overall actuator efficiency is approximately 4 x 10 - 4. Recent results for both methods are presented, including new evidence of a viscous loss mechanism that governs the strain rate of the crystal. An increase in the displacement per pulse with frequency is observed, indicating that the inertia of the moving portion of the crystal may cause it to deform even after the pulse has passed. by Jesse Matthew Simon.

While acoustic forces {{have been used to}} control the position of BPs, its theoretical aspects need further investigation particularly for high-resolution manipulation where the wavelength and particle size are comparable. In this study, we used a finite element method (FEM) to amend analytical calculations of acoustic radiation force (ARF) arising from an imposed standing ultrasound field. First, an acoustic solid interaction (ASI) approach was implemented to calculate the ARF exerted on BPs and resultant deformation induced to them. The results were then used to derive a revised expression for the ARF beyond the small particle assumption. The expression was further assessed in numerical simulations of one- and multi-directional standing acoustic waves (SAWs). Furthermore, a particle tracing scheme was used to investigate the effect of actual ARF on separation and patterning applications under experimentally-relevant conditions. The results demonstrated a significant mismatch between the actual force and previous analytical predictions especially for high frequencies of manipulation.

The rapid concentration process, occurring within just three seconds to facilitate spatial partitioning between the two particle species, exploited two acoustic phenomena acting on the suspended particles: the drag force arising from acoustic streaming and the acoustic radiation force, both driving particles in different directions. This study elucidates the very intricate and interesting interplay of physics between fluid drag and acoustic forcing on the particles within a droplet, and, for the first time, demonstrates the existence of a frequency-dependent crossover particle size {{that can be used to}} effect species partitioning: depending on the operating frequency of the SAW device and the particle size, it is possible to cause one phenomenon to dominate over the other.

In real fluid samples, the analyte of interest usually coexists in low concentration amongst a myriad of other constituents, resulting in the need for pre-analytical preparation procedures. Consequently, much research attention has been directed towards concentrating and/or isolating the analyte of interest from the other constituents within microfluidic volumes. The central theme of this thesis is the ultrasonic manipulation of particles and cells within microfluidic systems. Acoustically driven mechanisms for particle and cell manipulation are particularly advantageous as these techniques generally exhibit high throughput, have negligible physiological effects on cells, and are highly portable. Comprising both experimental and theoretical investigations, the studies presented herein focus on the selective concentration and isolation of one particle type from another. Both bulk acoustic wave (BAW) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices provide physical platforms for the microfluidic manipulation techniques. Specifically, three related studies are included: (1) selective particle concentration and isolation within a droplet, (2) particle and cell clustering at air–liquid interfaces, and (3) selective particle trapping using oscillating bubbles. These studies illustrate the intricate interplay of physics between fluid drag and acoustic forcing on the particles, where parameters such as frequency, particle size and device geometry have been exploited to achieve such results.

This paper reports {{for the first time}} a proof of concept for continuous flow acoustophoretic negative selection of WBCs from cancer cells using negative acoustic contrast elastomeric particles (EPs) activated with CD 45 -antibodies that specifically bind to WBCs. The EP/WBC complexes align at the acoustic pressure anti-nodes along the channel walls while unbound cancer cells focus to the pressure node in the channel center, enabling continuous flow based depletion of WBC background in a cancer cell product. The method does not provide a single process solution for the CTC separation challenge, but provides an elegant part to a multi-step process by further reducing the WBC background in cancer cell separation products derived from an initial step of label-free acoustophoresis. We report the recorded performance of the negative selection immuno-acoustophoretic WBC depletion and cancer cell recovery.

The device we have developed converts the frequency content of an acoustic signal into four individually addressable pressure outputs, tunable over a range 0 - 200 Pa with a control resolution of 10 Pa. The pressure generating components of the device consist of a bank of four resonance cavities (404, 484, 532, and 654 Hz), each with an attached rectification structure. We demonstrate how this scheme can be used for programmatic operation of both droplet-based and continuous-flow microfluidic systems using only a single control line. We then explore an alternative <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation</b> scheme involving frequency dependent attenuation within finite phononic crystals. Specifically, finite element analysis of the band properties of peri- odic two-dimensional microstructures subject to a variety of geometric lattice perturbations is presented. Phononic structures with periodicity over the range of 100 - 1400 μm were found to exhibit rich band gap effects over 100 - 300 kHz. We also discuss the utility of one-dimensional transfer matrix method approximations and analysis in the infinite limit as methods for understanding and predicting crystal transmission. Lastly, we describe an advanced modular microfluidic construction scheme using prefabricated polymeric building blocks (MABs) that can be assembled into working devices on-site within minutes.

The developed methodology includes use of a novel substrate, namely, Langasite coupled with various combinations of novel multidirectional interdigital transducer (IDT) configurations such as orthogonal, focused IDTs as well as sensor surface modifications, such as micro-cavities. The current approach exploits the capability of the anisotropic piezoelectric crystal to launch waves of different characteristics in different directions, which can be put to the multiple uses including but not limited to sensing via shear horizontal waves and biofouling elimination via Rayleigh wave induced acoustic streaming. Orthogonal IDTs gives rise to constructive interference, thereby enhancing the magnitudes of device displacements and fluid velocities. The net effect is an increase in device sensitivity and acoustic streaming intensity. The use of micro-cavities in the delay path provides a synergistic effect, thereby further enhancing the device sensitivity and streaming intensity. Focused IDTs are found to enhance the device displacements and fluid velocities, while focusing the device displacements and fluid motion at the device focal point, thereby enhancing the SAW device biosensing performance. The work presented in this dissertation has widespread and immediate use for enhancing sensor sensitivity and analyte discrimination capabilities as well as biofouling removal in medical diagnostic applications of SAW sensors. This work also has a broad relevance to the sensing of multiple biomarkers in medical applications as well as other technologies utilizing these devices such as microfluidic actuation...|$|E
40|$|This work {{discusses}} {{the feasibility of}} fabricating capacitive microphones from SOI wafers. Many current designs of capacitivemicrophones are fabricated by processing two individual wafers and then bonding them together afterwards. If successful, SOI wafers would offer {{the ability to make}} the microphones on one wafer and eliminate the possibility of alignment problems. The ultimate goal was to create functioning microphone membranes with differentgeometries and mechanically test their deflection under <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation.</b> Several microphone designs were examined and discussed. The fabrication process of creating the capacitive microphones from SOI wafers is discussed in full detail, and the four main process steps include fabrication, observation, modeling, and dynamic characterization. The fabrication process was altered between trials in order to produce better results, such as changing the etching time, etching acid, and drying process. Once the microphones were fabricated, they were observed with an SEM machine to examine the surfaces and cross-sections. Four membranethicknesses were modeled in ANSYS and a nonlinear static analysis was performed to predict the deflection of the membrane and the natural frequencies were calculated. The microphones were also mechanically tested with two different methods, the Microvision system and a fotonic sensor, to measure the deflection of the fabricated membrane. Overall, there were five square microphone sizes fabricated, which included 1 / 2 ", 1 / 4 ", 1 / 8 ", 1 / 16 ", and 1 / 32 ". They were fabricated on two different SOI wafers. The first wafer had a membrane thickness of 20 microns while the second wafer had a 4 micron thickness. The SEM images taken after each trial were used to determine the success of the fabrication process. The calculation of natural frequencies was used to indicate which membranes could be actuated. Some, mostly the smaller sizes, were proven to betoo stiff to allow for recordable deflection. The ANSYS results were used as a comparison to the tested results and provided information for which geometries were better suited underdifferent pressures. At higher pressures, the larger microphones are predicted to have a deflection larger than the gap between themembrane and the backplate, so those pressures would not be suitable for typical sound pressure levels experienced for testing. It also again proved that the smaller microphones were too stiff to get a measurable deflection. The microphones that had the most promise were the 1 / 2 " 20 micron membrane and the 1 / 4 " 4 micron membrane. There were many inconsistencies in the mechanical test data which suggest that stiction is a problem. However, the use of a profilometer showed thin cracks in the membranes...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} in this dissertation explores active control of a jet injected into quiescent surrounding or into a crossflow, a flowfield {{also known as the}} transverse jet. Periodic <b>acoustic</b> <b>actuation</b> is used to perturb the temporal jet injection profile about a mean in order to enhance important characteristics of the flow, such as mixing and penetration of the jet into the crossflow. In practice, nonlinear actuation system dynamics make it difficult to shape the injection profile to match a periodic reference. Discrete sinusoidal inputs necessary for periodic reference tracking produce harmonics that fall directly on the neighboring harmonic frequencies of the reference. At low forcing amplitudes, approximately less than 0. 5 m/s RMS, a feedback controller designed from a linear model of the actuation system compensates the coupling between harmonics. A modulated-demodulated controller with feedback from a hotwire placed at the jet exit tracks the first N Fourier coefficients of the reference that fall within the actuation bandwidth. A fundamental improvement to modulated-demodulated control, dynamic phase compensation in place of static phase compensation, is presented to reduce sensitivity function peaking in the neighborhood of the frequencies targeted for rejection or tracking. Above 0. 5 m/s RMS, however, the harmonic coupling destabilizes modulated-demodulated control designed from a linear model of the actuator dynamics. An alternative approach creates a stabilizing feedback control based on a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) empirical model of the harmonic coupling. Transforming the system into baseband coordinates by demodulating the velocity measurement at the harmonic frequencies of the reference waveform simplifies the model to the point the harmonic coupling can be reasonably modeled as a linear MIMO gain. The static model accurately captures the relationship between each harmonic frequency in the neighborhood of an operating point close to a desired reference. The stable feedback loop asymptotically drives the jet velocity to its reference. This control method is applied to the equidensity jet in crossflow to track pulse-like references at jet to crossflow velocity ratios of R= 6. 4 and R= 2. 2. The closed-loop waveforms are symmetric with little ringing and have sharp transitions between the low and high velocity regions of the pulse. Initial experiments with planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) flow diagnostics are also presented. These results show the pulsed jet in crossflow with optimized temporal pulse widths increases the jet spread compared to the unforced and sinusoidally forced jet in crossflow. Additionally, the pulsed jets increase the centerline scalar concentration decay in the near field but become approximately equal with the unforced jet in the far field...|$|E
