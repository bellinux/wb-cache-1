5|$|According to Golf Digest, Woods made $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007, and the {{magazine}} predicted that by 2010, Woods would pass one {{billion dollars in}} earnings. In 2009, Forbes confirmed that Woods was indeed the world's first athlete to earn over a billion dollars (before taxes) in his career, after accounting for the $10million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title. The same year, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $600million, making him the second richest person {{of color in the}} United States, behind only Oprah Winfrey. In 2015, Woods ranked ninth in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, being the top among Asian Americans or the fourth <b>among</b> <b>African</b> Americans.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% <b>among</b> <b>African</b> women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

During this period, Nasser made Egypt a refuge for anti-colonial leaders from several African countries and allowed the broadcast of anti-colonial propaganda from Cairo. Beginning in 1958, Nasser had {{a key role in}} the discussions <b>among</b> <b>African</b> leaders that led to the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.|$|E

5000|$|According to this viewpoint, AAVE had {{originally}} developed from Pidgin English, a pidginized form of English characterized by syntactic structures and words from West-African languages.

This then developed into a creole language which, after hundreds of years of contact with standard varieties of American English, had undergone decreolization to an English mesolect.

5|$|The new law was {{met with}} {{considerable}} resistance, especially in the towns and cities, where Tillman had less support. Dozens of clandestine saloons opened, fueled by barrels of illicit liquor, often transported by railroad. Tillman appointed dispensary constables, who tried to seize such shipments, to be frustrated {{by the fact that}} the South Carolina Railroad was in federal receivership, and state authorities could not confiscate goods entrusted to it. All of Tillman's constables were white, placing him at a disadvantage in dealing with the alcohol trade <b>among</b> <b>African</b> Americans. Some of the constables tried going undercover by blacking their faces like minstrels; later, Tillman hired an African-American detective from Georgia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Among</b> <b>African</b> slaves, Catholicism was the {{religion}} of the majority. Most slaves came originally from the midwestern and southwestern portions of the African coast. For over four centuries this region had been the subject of Christian mission activities. Some Africans and their descendants, however, held onto elements of polytheistic religious traditions by merging them with Catholicism. This resulted in the creation of syncretic creeds such as Candomblé. Islam was also practiced among a small minority of African slaves, although it was harshly repressed {{and by the end of}} the 19th century had been completely extinguished. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Indians in most of eastern Brazil had been either assimilated or decimated. Some tribes resisted assimilation and either fled farther west, where they were able to maintain their diverse polytheistic beliefs, or were restricted to aldeamentos (reservations), where they eventually converted to Catholicism.|$|E

5|$|By 1909, it {{had spread}} to the Orange River Colony. In South Africa, as at Azusa Street, the {{movement}} was initially multi-racial, appealing to both Boers and blacks. It expanded rapidly <b>among</b> <b>African</b> farm workers in the Orange River Colony and Wakkerstroom, where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer {{would have made it}} an attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment. Lake made contact with the Wakkerstroom Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux, and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission. Their influence {{can be seen in the}} AFM's practice of baptism by triple immersion, once each in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was also interaction with other churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement, which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM. Most AFM converts, however, came from the Dutch Reformed churches.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions <b>among</b> <b>African</b> Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{attended}} Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, {{which was}} run by the Presbyterian Board of Missions of Freedmen. She was the only child in her family to attend school, so each day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get to and from school, Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life. Wilson had attended Scotia Seminary (now Barber-Scotia College). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended Dwight L. Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in Chicago (now the Moody Bible Institute), hoping to become a missionary in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal <b>among</b> <b>African</b> Americans.|$|E

40|$|University of Venda Research and Innovation Office funded my {{empirical}} research which {{gave rise to}} this article. This paper reports on findings regarding one African community that has practiced rainmaking until the early 1960 s. Rainmaking <b>among</b> <b>Africans</b> was recorded in 19 th century travel writing by imperialist Europeans such as Rider Haggard in his books Ayesha: the Return of She (1905) and King Solomon’s Mines (1985). In keeping with the agenda of imperialism and colonisation, the art of rainmaking <b>among</b> <b>Africans</b> was reduced to writing in a distorted, Eurocentric manner. Therefore, an Afrocentric investigation of the religiouscultural practice of African communities to bring about rain is warranted. It is hoped that the resulting balanced view of African rainmaking rituals will, among others, discourage Eurocentric tendencies of seeing its exponents such as The Rain Queen Modjadji as inscrutable exotica. Rain Queen Modjadji has been immortalised with the same attitude regretted by writers such as Caitlin Davies (2003). Davies (2003) remarks how subaltern victims such as Sara Baartman and El Negro were removed to museums in places like Spain and London as curious exotica to be studied by the “naturalists” of the 1830 s. Research into the disappearing phenomenon of rainmaking <b>among</b> <b>Africans</b> should preserve the indigenous knowledge as well as purge it of Eurocentric distortions.

5|$|While the subspecific {{status of}} the Asiatic lion (P. l. persica) is {{generally}} accepted, the systematic relationships <b>among</b> <b>African</b> lions are still not completely resolved. Mitochondrial variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies; therefore, all sub-Saharan lions have sometimes been considered a single subspecies. However, a recent study revealed that lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, West-Central African lions are {{more closely related to}} North African and Asian lions than to Southern or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa, and a subsequent recolonisation of these parts from Asia.|$|E

Our findings show that atheroma as a degenerative disease (not linked with hypertension), contrary to prevailing opinion, is not uncommon <b>among</b> <b>Africans.</b> However, the incidence and pattern of distribution of the lesion especially in the aorta show features which indicate interesting peculiarities in the population studied. We also found that although fatty streak-ing of the intima was common and had its peak incidence in the third decade of life, comparatively fewer cases later progressed to atheroma formation...|$|R
