40|$|Abstract — Grasping {{has been}} studied from various {{perspectives}} including planning, control, and learning. In this paper, we take a learning approach to predict successful grasps for <b>a</b> universal jamming <b>gripper.</b> <b>A</b> jamming <b>gripper</b> is comprised of a flexible membrane filled with granular material, and it can quickly harden or soften to grip objects of varying shape by modulating the air pressure within the membrane. Although this gripper is easy to control, developing a physical model of its gripping mechanism is difficult because it undergoes significant deformation during use. Thus, many grasping approaches based on physical models (such as based on form- and force-closure) would be challenging to apply to <b>a</b> jamming <b>gripper.</b> Here we instead use a supervised learning algorithm and design both visual and shape features for capturing the properties of good grasps. We show that given target object data from an RGBD sensor, our algorithm can predict successful grasps for the jamming <b>gripper</b> without requiring <b>a</b> physical model. It can therefore be applied to both <b>a</b> parallel plate <b>gripper</b> and <b>a</b> jamming <b>gripper</b> without modification. We demonstrate that our learning algorithm enables both grippers {{to pick up a}} wide variety of objects, including objects from outside the training set. Through robotic experiments we are then able to define the type of objects each gripper is best suited for handling. I...|$|R
25|$|An inquiry {{concluded}} that the accident had been triggered by post-construction settlement, compounded by excess speed due to {{the weight of the}} train. As a result of the inquiry's recommendations the maximum allowed train weight was reduced to the equivalent of 1½ carriages, leading to lighter carriages being bought and used on two-carriage trains. <b>A</b> <b>gripper</b> system was also installed on the rack railway.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{accident}} in 1896, {{most of the}} line was fitted with 'gripper rails'. These are fixed {{to either side of}} the centre toothed rack rail and are of an inverted 'L' cross section. A 'gripper' is fitted to each locomotive, which fits around the gripper rails and holds the locomotive to the rails and prevents the pinion coming free from the rack.

25|$|Repeatability in an {{industrial}} process is also subject {{to the accuracy of}} the end effector, for example <b>a</b> <b>gripper,</b> and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.|$|E

2500|$|The level 9 adit was {{the longest}} built at Rhosydd, {{measuring}} [...] from the mouth to the haulage system at the inner end. It had a gradient of 1 in 86 to aid drainage, and took eight years to complete, being completed in 1870 or 1871. During its construction, an internal incline was built downwards from floor 5, so that rock from higher levels could be lowered down to the mine exit. Trucks were moved along the adit by attaching them to an endless rope, which was driven by a [...] diameter pitchback water wheel located {{near the mouth of}} the adit. They were marshalled into rakes of about 12 wagons, with <b>a</b> <b>gripper</b> truck or megryn at both ends. A screw handle was used to attach the front megryn to the rope, both on the line of full trucks in the mine and on empty ones outside the adit. The rope was then set in motion, and when the couplings between the trucks were tight, the gripper on the back megryn was applied. When they reached the far end, the grippers were released, as the water wheel took some time to stop. A similar system was used on the Glasgow Subway when it first opened. For most of its length, there were only three rails in the adit, the centre one being shared by both tracks. They fanned out into double tracks at both ends, and for [...] in the middle, so that trucks moving in opposite directions could pass one another. Communication between the operators at either end was by a bell system.|$|E
