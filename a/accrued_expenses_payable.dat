40|$|This {{work was}} {{developed}} through audit procedures and tests and statistics that {{allowed us to}} give an opinion on the preparation and fair presentation of the accounts of the passive current financial obligations to maturity "and" <b>Accrued</b> <b>Expenses</b> <b>Payable</b> "of a company dedicated to service delivery in education in pre-primary levels, primary and secondary education for the year ended 31 December 2008. This work consists of six chapters. The first chapter shows the definitions and basic concepts of a financial audit {{to better understand the}} work. The second chapter presents a description and understanding of the audited company. The third chapter contains the audit planning, which details the company's financial situation by analyzing vertical, horizontal and financial ratios, which allowed us to determine the selected accounts liabilities. The fourth chapter was performed audit tests to selected accounts to determine their reasonableness. The fifth chapter presents the audit report with the opinion of the independent auditors. The sixth chapter contains the conclusions and recommendations of the audit...|$|E
50|$|<b>Accrued</b> <b>expense</b> is a {{liability}} whose timing or amount is uncertain {{by virtue of}} the fact that an invoice has not yet been received. The uncertainty of the <b>accrued</b> <b>expense</b> is not significant enough to qualify it as a provision. An example of an <b>accrued</b> <b>expense</b> is a pending obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash is to be paid out in a later accounting period when the amount is deducted from <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Liability {{accounts}} {{represent the}} different types of economic obligations of an entity, such as accounts payable, bank loans, bonds <b>payable,</b> and <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> {{have not}} yet been paid for, so they are {{recorded}} in a <b>payable</b> account. <b>Expenses</b> for interest, taxes, rent, and salaries are commonly accrued for reporting purposes.|$|R
50|$|Period costs, such as office {{salaries}} {{or selling}} expenses, are immediately recognized as expenses (and offset against revenues {{of the accounting}} period) also when employees are paid in the next period. Unpaid period costs are <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> (liabilities) to avoid such costs (as expenses fictitiously incurred) to offset period revenues {{that would result in}} a fictitious profit. An example is a commission earned at the moment of sale (or delivery) by a sales representative who is compensated {{at the end of the}} following week, in the next accounting period. The company recognizes the commission as an expense incurred immediately in its current income statement to match the sale proceeds (revenue), so the commission is also added to <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> in the sale period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious profit, and it is deducted from <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> in the next period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious loss, when the rep is compensated.|$|R

50|$|The term accrual is {{also often}} used as an {{abbreviation}} for the terms <b>accrued</b> <b>expense</b> and <b>accrued</b> revenue that share the common name word, but they have the opposite economic/accounting characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Deferred revenue (or {{deferred}} income) is a liability, such as {{cash received}} from a counterpart for {{goods or services}} {{that are to be}} delivered in a later accounting period. When such income item is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the deferred revenue is reduced. It shares characteristics with <b>accrued</b> <b>expense</b> with the difference that a liability to be covered later is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later period when its amount is deducted from <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited {{appellee}} corporation's 1972 tax return. The corporation {{filed an}} amended return, claiming it {{was entitled to}} deduct its reserve as an <b>accrued</b> <b>expense,</b> and seek a refund. The IRS disallowed the deduction.|$|R
50|$|For example, goods {{supplied}} by a vendor in one accounting period, but paying {{for them in}} a later period results in an <b>accrued</b> <b>expense</b> that prevents a fictitious increase in the receiving company's value equal {{to the increase in}} its inventory (assets) by the cost of the goods received, but unpaid. Without such <b>accrued</b> <b>expense,</b> a sale of such goods in the period they were supplied would cause that the unpaid inventory (recognized as an expense fictitiously incurred) would effectively offset the sale proceeds (revenue) resulting in a fictitious profit in the period of sale, and in a fictitious loss in the latter period of payment, both equal to the cost of goods sold.|$|R
50|$|Liability {{accounts}} record debts {{or future}} obligations the business/entity owes to others.Accounts payable, salaries and wages payable, income taxes, bank overdrafts, trust accounts, <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses,</b> sales taxes, advance payments (unearned revenue), debt and accrued interest on debt, customer deposits, VAT output etc.|$|R
50|$|An {{accounts}} payable is {{recorded in the}} Account Payable sub-ledger at the time an invoice is vouched for payment. Vouchered, or vouched, means that an invoice is approved for payment and has been recorded in the General Ledger or AP subledger as an outstanding, or open, liability because {{it has not been}} paid. Payables are often categorized as Trade Payables, payables for the purchase of physical goods that are recorded in Inventory, and <b>Expense</b> <b>Payables,</b> payables for the purchase of goods or services that are expensed. Common examples of <b>Expense</b> <b>Payables</b> are advertising, travel, entertainment, office supplies and utilities. A/P is a form of credit that suppliers offer to their customers by allowing them to pay for a product or service after it has already been received. Suppliers offer various payment terms for an invoice. Payment terms may include the offer of a cash discount for paying an invoice within a defined number of days. For example, 2%, Net 30 terms mean that the payer will deduct 2% from the invoice if payment is madewithin 30 days. If the payment is made on Day 31 then the full amount is paid.|$|R

50|$|<b>Accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> is a {{liability}} with an uncertain timing or amount, {{but where the}} uncertainty is not significant enough to qualify it as a provision. An example is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later accounting period when its amount is deducted from <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses.</b> It shares characteristics with deferred income (or deferred revenue) with the difference that {{a liability}} to be covered latter is cash received from a counterpart, while goods or services are to be delivered in a latter period, when such income item is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the same amount is deducted from deferred revenues.|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the effect of {{deferred}} tax assets and liabilities for future current tax over a two-year period (t+ 1, t+ 2). Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses based on financial accounting standards and tax laws. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized in the financial statements because it can lead to future tax payments to be larger or smaller. Sample of this study consists of 38 companies from manufacturing sectors listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2011 - 2014. Multiple regression analysis is used to determine the effect of each component of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future current tax. Data components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are taken from the Notes to the Financial Statements of the company. The results show that deferred tax assets of post-employment benefits has negatively significant and deferred tax liabilities of accelerated depreciation has negatively significant to future tax. This is due to the possibility of some companies samples to defer tax payments. While the results for the deferred tax assets of <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> do not affect future tax.

40|$|Government {{accounting}} {{and other financial}} management practices have in recent times {{become one of the}} major target areas of public management reform. Public sector organisations traditionally use accounting systems based on cash inflows and cash outflows, commonly known as cash accounting. This cash style of accounting differs significantly from accounting systems used in the private sector, so called accrual accounting systems. The recent reforms to government accounting systems have focused largely on implementing accrual accounting in the public sector. The exponents of accrual accounting argue that it provides significantly more detailed and accurate financial information than cash systems. One of the basic principles of {{accounting and}} financial reporting is that it should provide a true and fair view of the financial operations and financial position of an entity. Given that cash accounting records cash transactions only, no consideration is given to assets and liabilities or to items extending beyond the accounting period (i. e. prepayments and <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses).</b> Accrual accounting on the other hand produces detailed information on assets and liabilities and requires depreciation expenses to be matched to the expected life of the related asset. Similarly, <b>accruing</b> <b>expenses</b> such as employee entitlements are represented in the financial reports. Countries with a Westminster style of government have tended to be the leaders in implementing accrual accounting in the public sector. This research paper provides a detailed description and analysis of the financial reforms undertaken in the Australian Commonwealth public sector...|$|R
2500|$|Strip clubs which {{practice}} [...] Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) typically report {{negative working}} capital, where current liabilities exceed current assets. [...] Clubs receive immediate cash payment for sales, while inventories, <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses,</b> and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms. [...] The practice {{is believed to}} increase net cash provided by operating activities. Service revenues include entertainer payments to perform at clubs, customer admission fees, customer payments for tabs and tip charges, dance dollar payments, and suite rental fees. The economic downturn, which accelerated in 2008, impacted clubs at all levels, and even higher-end gentlemen's clubs {{in some parts of}} the U.S. and elsewhere adjusted their business practices to compensate for reduced revenues.|$|R
