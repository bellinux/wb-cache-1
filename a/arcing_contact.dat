40|$|SUMMARY The sputter {{erosion of}} arcing {{contacts}} {{is a very}} complex phenomenon, which is determined by the interaction between electromag-netic force, heat conduction and surface tension of liquid metal. A new model for evaluating the sputter erosion of electrodes is described in this paper, which is based on the electromagnetic forces against the molten pool, flowing velocity, kinetic energy and the surface tension of the molten pool. Erosion tests on AgSnO 2, AgNi 10 and AgNi 0. 15 contacts under the loads of resistance, lamp and inductance respectively at 14 VDC have been carried out. Experimental results indicate good agreement with the model’s simulation. The model shows how the current and density, specific heat and other parameters of material affect the erosion rate. key words: <b>arcing</b> <b>contact,</b> sputter erosion, material property 1...|$|E

The ef-fort of condition monitoring is not justified for every circuit-breaker type, however, and may depend on its importance to the reliability and availability of the system, its maintenance program, and its expected workload. Practically speaking, it is important to frequently switched breakers, such as live-tank breakers that switch shunt capacitors and reactors and generator circuit breakers in pumped-storage hydro power plants—these breakers suffer from higher <b>arcing</b> <b>contact</b> and nozzle wear, possibly causing the allowed ablation to be reached within the standard service interval—and to breakers that are expensive to main-tain, such as GIS.

40|$|Contact erosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial factors {{affecting}} the electrical service lifetime of high-voltage circuit breakers (HVCBs). On-line monitoring the contacts’ erosion degree is increasingly in demand for the sake of condition based maintenance to guarantee the functional operation of HVCBs. A spectroscopic monitoring system has been designed based upon a commercial 245 kV/ 40 kA S F 6 live tank circuit breaker with copper–tungsten (28 wt % and 72 wt %) arcing contacts at atmospheric S F 6 pressure. Three optical-fibre based sensors are used to capture the time-resolved spectra of arcs. A novel approach using chromatic methods to process the time-resolved spectral signal has been proposed. The processed chromatic parameters have been interpreted to show that the time variation of spectral emission from the contact material and quenching gas are closely correlated to the mass loss and surface degradation of the plug <b>arcing</b> <b>contact.</b> The feasibility of applying this method to online monitoring of contact erosion is indicated...|$|E

50|$|HVDC circuit {{breakers}} {{are difficult to}} build because some mechanism must {{be included in the}} circuit breaker to force current to zero, otherwise <b>arcing</b> and <b>contact</b> wear would be too great to allow reliable switching.

40|$|The arc {{behavior}} in the current zero region is critical {{in the case of}} very steep rising TRV, such as after clearing a short-line fault. Therefore, intensive and abundant short-line fault tests (L 90) of a 245 kV SF 6 circuit breaker were performed at the KEMA High Power Laboratory. For the purpose of a comparative analysis three different sets of data were obtained during the tests: 1) High-resolution measurements of near current-zero arc current and voltage were carried out. The current zero measurement system (CZM) works as a standalone system in addition to the standard laboratory data acquisition system. The arc conductance shortly before current zero and the arc voltage extinction peak give a clear indication of the interrupting capability of the breaker under test. 2) From the measured traces of every individual test, arc parameters (3 time constants and 3 cooling-power constants) were extracted for the composite black box arc model, which has been developed by KEMA High Power Laboratory and is based on more than 1000 high-resolution measurements during tests of commercial high-voltage circuit breakers. Its aim is to simulate interruption phenomenon in SF 6 gas, evaluate performance of HV SF 6 circuit breakers in testing and enable the prediction of the performance under conditions other than those tested. 3) After each test, using specially developed computer software, based on a simplified physical enthalpy flow arc model, the values of the <b>arcing</b> <b>contact</b> distance, gas mass flow through the nozzle throat and pressure inside the compression cylinder were calculated. The values of these characteristic quantities at the current zero are relevant indicators for successful interruption. In the comparative analysis, mathematical relations and statistical correlations between the evaluated parameters of the composite black box arc model and the characteristic output quantities are established and discussed. The link has been verified by MatLAB simulation of every indi- - vidual test. This approach enables acceptable prediction of interruption success in a similar circuit and with a similar interrupter without SLF tests and CZM...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMembrane {{switching}} technology {{is commonly used}} to operate electrical apparatus such as remote controls, automotive switches, mobile phones, etc. This technology {{is based on a}} movable contact, mounted in a supple elastomer frame which allows the contact to be pressed against a stationary contact, mounted on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The material of the movable contact is typically a carbon-loaded polymer or a metal whereas the PCB electrode structure is copper, coated with a layer of gold. The current trend is to use this technology for power applications such as operating a coil or a direct actuator control. As reported in the literature, for such currents <; 1 A and inductive loads, microarcs occur between rigid, metallic contacts, during break and make. Their duration and subsequent damage depend highly on the material and the mechanical separation. On the other hand, the high contact resistance of a flexible carbon-loaded polymer and the progressive separation due to its flexibility are expected to modify arc ignition and persistence characteristics. In this paper, we present experimental measurements of the electrical characteristics of such contacts and the consequences of <b>arcing</b> on <b>contact</b> reliability. Long contact rise times of the voltage are found compared to common metallic contacts. These complex voltage characteristics have been analyzed to extract arc voltage and duration.

50|$|Snubbers are {{frequently}} used in electrical systems with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow {{leads to a}} sharp rise in voltage across the current switching device, in accordance with Faraday's law. This transient can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term alternative current path around the current switching device so that the inductive element may be discharged more safely and quietly. Inductive elements are often unintentional, but arise from the current loops implied by physical circuitry. While current switching is everywhere, snubbers will generally only be required where a major current path is switched, such as in power supplies. Snubbers are also often used to prevent <b>arcing</b> across the <b>contacts</b> of relays and switches and the electrical interference and welding/sticking of the contacts that can occur (see also arc suppression).|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{precision}} assemblies in {{high volume}} manufacturing have used pin-hole joints; however {{the evolution of}} more stringent design requirements has pushed the performance of this method to its practical performance limit of approximately five microns repeatability. Next generation designs (i. e. automotive engines and pump assemblies) require low-cost couplings which permit sealing between interfaces and deliver better than five micron repeatability.

GEOMETRY In general, Quasi-Kinematic Couplings (QKCs) are well-suited for high volume precision assembly, particularly where integral locating features and/or sealing contact are required. Quasi-kinematic couplings are similar to traditional Kinematic Couplings as they consist of three convex protrusions which mate with three corresponding grooves.

50|$|Many {{alternative}} solutions, {{particularly those}} based upon an AC Switch Disconnect design which use bridge contacts, have been modified and rated for DC operation. These types of product have a switching speed that is {{directly linked to}} the operator speed, therefore slow operation of the handle results in slow contact separation of the contacts which can produce arcing times of 100ms or more. Additionally in these switches, the contact surface is also the surface upon which electrical arcs tend to form; therefore any surface damage or sooting caused by arcing {{is likely to have}} a detrimental effect on the isolators contact resistance and its longevity.TRUE DC Solar Isolators use a rotary knife contact mechanism so when the unit is operated, the handle movement gives a double make/break per contact set. As DC load switching creates electrical arcing, the design is such that this only occurs on the corners of the switching parts meaning that the main contact is made on an area where no arcing has occurred. The rotary contact mechanism methodology used in TRUE DC solar isolators means that when the isolator is operated, a self-cleaning action occurs on the <b>arcing</b> points and <b>contact</b> surfaces thereby producing good high-vibration resistant contact integrity, with reduced contact resistance. This contact system ensures that power loss per pole is kept as low as possible, and consistent {{over the life of the}} product, unlike conventional style isolators where entrapment of contaminants, and then subsequent compression on lateral operation, can lead to variable and increasing contact resistance, and hence per pole losses.|$|R
