5|$|The {{successful}} {{resistance of}} Dvin {{put an end}} to the Byzantine advance in Armenia, helping preserve the independence of the smaller Armenian realms of Syunik, Tashir and Khachen. Soon after, the regional balance of power was permanently altered with the first large-scale raid of the Seljuk Turks under Qutlumush ibn Arslan Isra'il and Ibrahim Inal into Byzantine Armenia in 1048. While the Shaddadids may have been tempted to see in them welcome allies against the Byzantines, they were equally likely to be a threat, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> attack on Ganja by Qutlumush in 1046/47.|$|E

5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons {{had a short}} range, so {{camouflage}} was unimportant for ships, and for the men {{on board}} them.

Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist.|$|E
5|$|Volcanoes {{are usually}} {{considered}} to be active if they have had eruptions during the Holocene.

In 2012 the same two men had found 60 Iron Age coins in the same area.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{maintain}} {{that given the}} massive reductions in US military aid to South Vietnam after 1973, any major PAVN offensive was bound to succeed. However, the ARVN's soldiers were hardened veterans, and South Vietnam maintained vast stockpiles of ammunition and equipment (<b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> massive quantities of war materiel captured by the PAVN when the war ended). The final collapse of the ARVN {{may well have been}} inevitable, but the end would have been much bloodier and much longer in coming had the PAVN chosen a more direct, conventional plan of attack. In fact, the most damaging blow of the entire PAVN campaign may have been the crushing psychological blow their skillful and unexpected strategy dealt to the mind of the ARVN's commander-in-chief.|$|E
5|$|Schleswig-Holstein was {{put into}} dock for repairs 10–25 June 1916.

5|$|The {{military}} occupation of Kampuchea had profound consequences for Vietnamese foreign policy. Since gaining independence in 1954, the Vietnamese communist perspective {{on foreign policy}} had been dominated {{by the need to}} maintain a world order of two camps, communist and non-communist. Indeed, the treaties of friendship that Vietnam signed with the Soviet Union, Laos and the People’s Republic of Kampuchea were consistent with that view. However, the ideological motivations of the Vietnamese communist leadership were proven to be limited and heavily flawed, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1979 condemnation of Vietnam after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime. In the years that followed, the Vietnamese Government was left isolated from the world and its efforts to rebuild the country were handicapped by the lack of aid from the capitalist Western nations. Furthermore, the presence of Vietnamese military forces in Cambodia became an obstacle which prevented the normalisation of diplomatic ties with China, the United States and the member nations of ASEAN.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlements}} of Hale and Hale Barns {{are closely}} linked; what {{would later become}} Hale Barns {{spent most of the}} medieval period {{as an extension of the}} more dominant Hale. During this era the land around Hale and Hale Barns was used agriculturally because although the soil is poor draining, it is fertile. By the middle of the 15th century Hale Barns had established an identity completely separate from neighbouring Hale <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tithe barn which was established around this time. The tithe barn was for storing the tithes – a tenth of the farm's produce which was to be given to the church. Such an establishment can be seen as a sign of the area's prosperity. The original barn no longer survives but there is a drawing of it (from 1844). It is the source of the village's name. The first explicit reference to the village of Hale Barns– rather than Hale– is in a document from 1616.|$|E
5|$|Early {{development}} of the women's game at the time colonial powers brought football to Sierra Leone and the continent was limited, as colonial powers in the region tended to take concepts of patriarchy and women's participation in sport with them to local cultures that already had similar concepts already embedded in them. Other factors on the continent impact the {{development of}} the game, including limited access to education, poverty among women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When quality players are developed in Africa, they often leave for greater opportunities elsewhere Continent wide; most of the funding for women's football in a country and for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association. Future success for women's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities. Attempting to commercialise the game is not the solution, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> existence of many youth and women's football camps held on the continent that have resulted in improved national team performance as players progressed through the system.|$|E

5|$|There is a glyphic {{record that}} {{sometime}} before 731 a lord of Motul {{was captured by}} a lord (Ruler B) of Machaquilá. In 740, Machaquila attacked Motul de San José. Hieroglyphic Stairway 3 at Dos Pilas records that in 745 a lord of Motul was captured by K'awiil Chan K'inich of Dos Pilas. In {{the middle of the}} 8th century AD, Motul de San José was closely allied with the important city of Yaxchilan on the Usumacinta River, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the king of Yaxchilan Yaxun B'alam IV ("Bird Jaguar IV") who ruled from 752 to 768, took two wives from Motul de San José. They are named in inscriptions at Yaxchilan as Lady Wak Tuun and Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw. Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw is shown preparing her husband for a battle that took place in 755 on Yaxchilan Lintel 41, now in the British Museum in London. In fact, the alliance with Yaxchilan may date further back to the early 8th century since Yaxchilan Lintel 25 (dedicated in AD 723) used the so-called X-ray style of imagery that is closely associated with the Motul de San José polity. However, relations with Yaxchilan were not always peaceful and Hieroglyphic Stairway 5 at Yaxchilan records that Itzamnaaj B'alam III of Yaxchilan defeated the lord of Motul some time {{in the latter part of}} the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was {{the next}} ruler, 16th in the dynasty founded by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', {{although}} he appears {{not to have been}} a direct descendent of his predecessor. He took the throne in June763 and may have been only 9years old. He produced no monumental stelae and instead dedicated hieroglyphic texts incorporated into the city's architecture and smaller altars. Texts make an obscure reference to his father but his mother was a noblewoman from distant Palenque in Mexico. He built the platform of Temple11 over the tomb of the previous king in AD769 and added a two-storey superstructure that was finished in AD773. Around AD776, he completed the final version of Temple16 over the tomb of the founder. At the base of the temple, he placed the famous AltarQ, which shows each of the 16rulers of the city from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' through to Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, with a hieroglyphic text on top describing the founding of the dynasty. By the latter 8thcentury, the nobility had become more powerful, raising palaces with hieroglyphic benches that were as richly constructed as those of the king. At the same time, local satellites were displaying their own local power, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ruler of Los Higos erecting his own stela in AD781. Towards the end of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's reign, the city of Copán was struggling with overpopulation and a lack of local resources, with a distinct fall in living standards among the populace. Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was able to celebrate his second K'atun in AD802 with his own monument, but the king's participation in the K'atun ending ceremony of AD810 was marked at Quiriguá, not at Copán. By this time the city's population was over 20,000 and it had long needed to import basic necessities from outside.|$|E
