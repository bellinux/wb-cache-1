5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions {{are more likely to}} occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 1861, Tom, Horatio and a {{party of}} {{employees}} and their families travelled by steamer to Brisbane, disembarked in Moreton Bay, and then, with livestock and supplies, set out on an eight-month trek through Queensland's rugged interior. Food was scarce and Tom hunted native game to fend off starvation. They suffered many other hardships <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>death</b> when, in Toowoomba, one of Horatio's men drowned. On the Darling Downs over 10,000 sheep were collected. The size of the Wills party {{attracted the attention of}} local Aborigines, and the two groups engaged in games of mimicry. Wary of entering the region's frontier war, Horatio maintained a conciliatory attitude to the Aborigines. The party reached Cullin-la-ringo, situated on Kairi Aboriginal land, in early October, and proceeded to set up camp.|$|E

25|$|In June 2014 {{the police}} {{announced}} {{they would be}} monitoring the A671 between Weir and Bacup (which passes through Broadclough) as {{it has become an}} accident blackspot with a high number of accidents which have resulted in serious injury <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>deaths.</b>|$|R
5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>death.</b> In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>death,</b> whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E
5|$|When Rommel {{was seriously}} wounded on 17 July 1944, the Propaganda Ministry {{undertook}} efforts {{to conceal the}} injury {{so as not to}} undermine domestic morale. Despite this, the news leaked to the British press. To counteract the rumors of a serious injury <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>death,</b> Rommel was required to appear at a press conference held on 1 August. On 3 August, the German press published an official report that Rommel had been injured in a car accident. Rommel noted in his diary his dismay at this twisting of the truth, belatedly realising how much the Reich propaganda was using him for its own ends.|$|E
50|$|Three factors {{contributed to}} the {{eventual}} closing of Palisades Amusement Park: near-gridlock traffic conditions in its vicinity due to inadequate parking facilities, growing uncertainty about its future, plus the increasing incidents of rides breaking down, resulting in numerous injuries, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>deaths.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{survey of}} New York area doctors in February 2007 found that {{injuries}} <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>deaths</b> {{have been caused}} by excessive waits for hospital beds by ED patients.

50|$|Drake's {{possible}} {{violation of}} federal tax law {{was reported to}} the IRS by an advocacy group called Americans United for Separation of Church and State (AU). Drake called on supporters to use imprecatory prayer to pray for the punishment <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>deaths</b> of certain AU members, drawing controversy.|$|R
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is not {{toxic to}} {{all forms of}} life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus {{has no effect on}} photosynthesising plants. It is easily absorbed through the lungs. Inhaling the gas can lead to hypoxic injury, nervous system damage, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>death.</b> Different people and populations may have different carbon monoxide tolerance levels. On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period; in addition, employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ("ceiling") of 100 ppm is reached. Carbon monoxide exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage. The carbon monoxide tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including activity level, rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, sickle cell disease and other hematological disorders, barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.|$|E
5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High {{blood levels of}} free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>death.</b> Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, {{the company}} met {{to debate the}} wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were {{unfamiliar}} with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and Church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women and young children would lead to suffering, sickness <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>death.</b> All of the other Church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, {{perhaps as many as}} 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.|$|E

50|$|One {{concern about}} outsiders trying to perform these ceremonies is that, {{not only does}} it go against the express wishes of the {{traditional}} healers who have inherited these ceremonies, but that those who {{do not know how to}} do them properly have in some cases caused dehydration and heat stroke, resulting in injury <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>deaths.</b>|$|R
25|$|For {{the greater}} part of a decade, the IHSA was {{concerned}} mostly with establishing school control over interscholastic athletic programs and setting eligibility standards for competition. Ringers were a persistent problem, and among schoolboy sports, football was a special concern. In this period, severe injuries <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>deaths</b> were not uncommon, and there was much talk of banning football completely.|$|R

25|$|Other {{plants can}} also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is {{minimized}} by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase {{the ability of the}} soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
