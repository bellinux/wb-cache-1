25|$|Hawley began {{teaching}} at the University of Arizona in 1929. By 1933, the University of Arizona was faced with financial difficulties due to the Great Depression, and they asked most of the young faculty to take a year’s leave of absence, which included Hawley. In the fall of 1934, she took a job {{teaching at the}} University of New Mexico in the Department of Anthropology where she made less than the male professors. As a professor Hawley was not considered easy; she expected her students to learn and to think on their own. She taught over 20 courses, several of which were usually taught by men. She was found at one point to be teaching more courses {{than anyone else in}} the anthropology department. Hawley <b>always</b> <b>brought</b> new theoretical approaches as well as her own ideas into focus while teaching. Her students knew they were expected to organize and comprehend data, in addition to become familiar with the bibliographical material. She continued to work and to teach students in the field after her retirement.|$|E
500|$|After {{the sudden}} {{announcement}} that Muhney {{had been fired}} from the role in December 2013, viewers and critics alike expressed their disappointment in the decision. Michael Ausiello of TVLine wrote that the news was the [...] "worst Christmas present ever", as well as Jamey Giddens of Zap2it writing: [...] "Outspoken and insanely-gifted, Michael Muhney has definitely shaken things up in daytime since joining The Young and the Restless. Whether he was demanding changes in the Daytime Emmy nomination process, or getting into fights with his TV pappy on Twitter, one thing was for certain — Muhney <b>always</b> <b>brought</b> it on screen as bad seed Adam Newman. Well, not anymore." [...] Immediately after the news of his firing, Muhney conducted {{an interview with the}} Huffington Post and stated: [...] "Part of me feels this is because I've always been outspoken, and sometimes I've been too outspoken. Sometimes I've walked around with a big backpack full of hubris. That is entirely on me. CBS, Sony, and Jill Phelps are not to blame for that." [...] Muhney also said that the writers were planning to [...] "take a break from Adam for 3 to 6 months" [...] and then recast the role.|$|E

500|$|Bilson and DeMeo then {{submitted}} their seven-page film {{treatment to}} Disney, but the studio put their script through an endless series of revisions. Over five years, Disney fired and rehired Bilson and DeMeo three times. DeMeo explained that [...] "Disney {{felt that they}} needed {{a different approach to}} the script, which meant bringing in someone else. But those scripts were thrown out and we were <b>always</b> <b>brought</b> back on". They found the studio's constant tinkering with the screenplay to be a frustrating process as [...] "executives would like previously excised dialogue three months later. Scenes that had been thrown out two years ago were put back in. What was the point"? DeMeo said. One of Bilson and De Meo's significant revisions to the script over the years was to make Cliff and Jenny's romance more believable and avoid cliché aspects that would stereotype Jenny as a damsel in distress. The numerous project delays forced Dear to drop out as director. Joe Johnston, a fan of the comic book, immediately offered his services as director when he found out Disney owned the film rights. Johnston was quickly hired and pre-production started in early 1990. After Bilson and De Meo's third major rewrite, Disney finally greenlighted The Rocketeer.|$|E

2500|$|The early {{sessions}} for the John Butler Trio's sixth studio album commenced in mid-2013, following the band's largest {{tour of the}} US. For {{the first time in}} the band's lifetime, the members began with a blank songwriting slate, rather than using the initial ideas of Butler that had been introduced. Butler gathered with Luiters and Bomba at The Compound in Fremantle, Western Australia, which serves as the band's headquarters and the frontman's artistic space, and co-wrote material for the first time, deviating from the Butler-centric process of the past: [...] "I had <b>always</b> <b>brought</b> the material." [...] After contributing a large portion of work towards the album, Bomba eventually left the Compound space to work on his Melbourne Ska Orchestra project and was replaced by Grant Gerathy.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the last}} year of her life, her health, always delicate, became more frail, but she kept up her {{interest}} in all the former work of her life, in spite of times of discouragement, for she realized that her strength was gradually becoming less. She presided at several Alliance meetings, although her friends well-knew that she was not able to bear the strain; but even in times of great weariness she would have days of enjoyment. Not many months before, on a visit to Concord, Massachusetts, which <b>always</b> <b>brought</b> happiness to her, she took part in the music one evening, and sang to the young people about her.

The two married daughters resided near their mother in Somerville, Massachusetts.|$|E
2500|$|Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. The Source magazine's Nicholas Poluhoff said [...] "Raekwon has <b>always</b> <b>brought</b> his own special flavor to the Wu cipher: he sprays out lyrics like gunfire, forming vivid tales. What truly sets Cuban Linx apart is the sheer abundance of well-written, complex lyrics." [...] Poluhoff also praised RZA's production, viewing {{it as his}} best yet: [...] "The tracks are suited to the distinct flow of the Chef, who weaves in and out between beats." [...] Cheo H. Choker from Spin magazine found Raekwon to be as vivid a lyricist as Kool G Rap, [...] "so vivid you smell the gunpowder and wipe the blood on your shirt", while crediting RZA for [...] "taking the art form of production to new heights". Los Angeles Times said the songs with other Wu-Tang Clan members {{are as good as}} anything on Enter the 36 Chambers and wrote of the music: [...] "RZA's production sensibilities, sometimes minimal, other times symphonic, pull the listener in despite the chaos. In a genre characterized by singles, Cuban Linx is a full-blown album where the big picture is just as moving as the compositional stylistic elements." [...] In Vibe magazine, dream hampton was impressed by Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's use of cultural appropriation in their lyrics and said they [...] "bring the best in each other." ...|$|E
