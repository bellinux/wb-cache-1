500|$|Riesling {{is a white}} grape variety which {{originated}} in the Rhine region of Germany. Riesling is an <b>aromatic</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines.

25|$|In 2004, {{research}} at the University of California-Davis and Istituto Agrario di San Michele all’Adige found Nebbiolo {{to be related to}} Piedmont by way of two <b>aromatic</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> — the Freisa grape of Piedmont and the French Rhone variety Viognier. This research would further suggest a parent-offspring relationship between Nebbiolo and several Italian grapes including Freisa, Bubbierasco, Nebbiolo Rosé, and Vespolina of the Piedmont region, and the Lombardy grapes Negrara and Rossola nera. Additional DNA analysis also suggest a parent-offspring relationship with the Lombardy grape Brugnola, previously thought to be only a synonym for the Emilia-Romagna grape Fortana.|$|R

50|$|The Kerner <b>grape</b> is an <b>aromatic</b> white <b>grape</b> <b>variety.</b> It was bred in 1929 by August Herold by {{crossing}} Trollinger (a red variety {{also known}} as Schiava grossa or Vernatsch) and Riesling. Herold was working at a plant breeding station in Lauffen in the Württemberg region of Germany. This station belonged to a state breeding institute headquartered in Weinsberg. It received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in 1969.|$|R
2500|$|Almost all {{wines are}} white, except those {{made from the}} Pinot noir grape which are pale red, often rosé, rarely red (e.g. [...] ). Sparkling wines known as Crémant d'Alsace are also made. Much of the white wines of Alsace are made from <b>aromatic</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties,</b> so many {{characteristic}} Alsace wines are aromatic, floral and spicy. Since they very seldom have any oak barrel aromas {{they tend to be}} very varietally pure in their character. Traditionally all Alsace wines were dry (which once set them apart from German wines with which they share many <b>grape</b> <b>varieties),</b> but an ambition to produce wines with more intense and fruity character has led some producers to produce wines which contain some residual sugar. Since there is no official labeling that differentiates completely dry from off-dry (or even semi-sweet) wines, this has occasionally led to some confusion among consumers. It is more common to find residual sugar in Gewürztraminer and Pinot gris, which reach a higher natural sugar content on ripeness, than in Riesling, Muscat or Sylvaner. Usually there is a [...] "house style" [...] as to residual sugar, i.e., some producers only produce totally dry wines, except for their dessert style wines.|$|R
5000|$|Gewürztraminer (...) is an <b>aromatic</b> wine <b>grape</b> <b>variety,</b> used {{in white}} wines, and {{performs}} best in cooler climates. In English, {{it is sometimes}} referred to colloquially as Gewürz (this is never the case in German, because [...] "Gewürz" [...] means [...] "herb" [...] or [...] "spice"), and in French it is written [...] (without the umlaut). Gewürztraminer is a variety with a pink to red skin colour, {{which makes it a}} [...] "white wine grape" [...] as opposed to the blue to black-skinned varieties commonly referred to as [...] "red wine grapes". The variety has high natural sugar and the wines are white and usually off-dry, with a flamboyant bouquet of lychees. Indeed, Gewürztraminer and lychees share the same aroma compounds. Dry Gewürztraminers may also have aromas of roses, passion fruit and floral notes. It is not uncommon to notice some spritz (fine bubbles {{on the inside of the}} glass).|$|R
40|$|Muscat of Bornova is a {{white and}} <b>aromatic</b> native <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> of Vitis vinifera which is largely {{predominant}} in the İzmir-Manisa province of the Aegan region. In this study, the effect of three different terroirs (Kemaliye, Halilbeyli, Menderes) located in İzmir-Manisa province and two different years (2013 – 2014) on the terpene compounds of Muscat of Bornova grapes were investigated. The terpene compounds were extracted by using liquid–liquid extraction method and identified and quantified by GC–MS-FID. In 2013 vintage eighteen terpene compounds were identified and quantified. The concentration of total terpene compounds in Muscat of Bornova grapes from Menderes determined 2. 1  mg/l, in Halilbeyli 1. 3  mg/l and in Kemaliye 1. 7  mg/l. In 2014 vintage eighteen terpene compounds were identified and quantified. In 2014 a total concentration of terpene compounds decreased in grapes from Menderes and determined 1. 8  mg/L, in Halilbeyli the results {{were the same as}} the first vintage and found 1. 3  mg/l and in Kemaliye there was an increase with 2. 6  mg/l. Among monoterpenes, linalool, α-terpineol, citronellol, nerol and geraniol show significant differences between different terroirs...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of different grape mash maceration treatments on the varietal and secondary aroma profiles of wines produced from an <b>aromatic</b> red <b>grape</b> <b>variety,</b> Muškat ruža porečki, have been investigated. Two essentially different techniques were applied, fermentative maceration {{at room temperature}} and prefermentative cryomaceration, both in durations of one, three and five days. Generally, higher concentrations of free and bound varietal aroma compounds were found in wines obtained by maceration at room temperature in relation to cryomaceration. Regarding {{the effect of the}} duration of maceration, the highest concentrations were determined in wines obtained by three-day maceration treatments, in both fermentative and cryomaceration treatments. Secondary aroma compounds followed a less uniform pattern. The compounds with the highest odour unit values in all investigated wines were linalool, citronellol, geraniol, β-damascenone, β-ionone, isoamyl alcohol, 2 -phenylethanol, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and diethyl succinate. It has been shown that Muškat ruža porečki is an aromatic variety, producing wines with notable monoterpenol fraction, which are characterized by a typical varietal Muscat aroma with a dominant rose odour accompanied by red fruit nuances. Sensorially, longer maceration treatments improved odour and overall wine quality, together with the intensity and recognisability of varietal Muscat aroma, while short-term cryomaceration emerged as a preferable technique for the production of light rosé wines with pronounced Muscat aroma and low phenolic content. The presented maceration techniques were shown to be applicable for the production of different types of Muškat ruža porečki rosé and red wines...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of the {{phenolic}} compounds of wines from Muscat of Bornova, a native <b>aromatic</b> white <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> (Vitis vinifera) {{grown in the}} Aegean region of Turkey {{and the influence of}} terroir (Menderes, Halilbeyli and Kemaliye sub- regions) on these compounds were investigated. From Muscat of Bornova growing sub regions, Menderes/İzmir has a typical Mediterranean climate at around 90 m altitude which is located Eagean cost area with a fertile sandy-loamy soil; Halilbeyli/İzmir sub-region is located in inner İzmir, close to Manisa with 115 m altitude with same soil structure of Menderes. Kemaliye/Manisa has a transition climate between Mediterranean and continental climate at about 245 m altitude. Its soil is pale with a distinct amount of lime (∼ 30 %) and sandy-loamy, as well. High performance liquid chromatography-diode array dedector (HPLC-DAD) and mass spectrometry (MS) were used for the {{phenolic compounds}} analysis. Four flavanols, eight phenolic acids and a flavonol were identified and quantified. It was observed that the total phenolic content in the Halilbeyli sub-region was the highest, fol- lowed by the Menderes and Kemaliye sub-regions. Procyanidin B 4 was the most abundant flavanol and quercetin- 3 -O-glucoside was the only flavonol identified in all regions’ wines. Sensory analysis was also used to investigate the influences of terroir. Statistically significant (0. 05) regional differences were observed. Based upon sensory analysis, the wine obtained from Halilbeyli was darker in color, and had more astringency and bitterness than the others, and was the least popular wine. Kemaliye and Menderes were both preferred due to their better coloring, flavour, less astringency and bitterness attributes...|$|R
