2500|$|The [...] {{armament}} of Il-2 {{was subject}} to a competition. One of the first 1940 photographs of the Il-2 show it equipped with two MP-6 23mm autocannons developed by Yakov Taubin (...) at OKB-16. The MP-6 gun weighed 70kg and developed an initial muzzle velocity of 900m/s. It operated on the short recoil principle and had a rate of fire of about 600 rpm. (The development of the MP-6 gun {{can be traced back}} to 1937. The initial version was tested in the spring of 1940 on a Bf 110 bought from Germany, because there was no suitable Soviet aircraft on which to mount it. In the summer of 1940 it was tested on the Pashinin I-21.) [...] Factory trials of the MP-6 gun on the Il-2 were conducted in August 1940. In the early Il-2 prototypes, these guns were fed by 81-round clips. In flight, these clips sometimes became dislodged because of their large surface, which caused them to experience significant <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Competitive tests were conducted in the spring of 1941 between the MP-6 gun modified to belt-fed and the newly developed, gas-operated Volkov-Yartsev VYa-23, which had otherwise rather similar characteristics. The VYa-23 was declared the winner at this trial. Subsequently, in May 1941, development of the MP-6 gun was terminated and Taubin was arrested and summarily executed in October that year.|$|E
40|$|During a storm, wind induced ovalling {{vibrations}} {{were observed}} on several empty silos of a closely spaced group consisting of 8 by 5 thin-walled silos {{in the port}} of Antwerp (Belgium). To clarify the cause and location of these wind induced vibrations, the spatial distribution of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> on the silo surfaces is determined in both 2 D and 3 D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations of the highly turbulent wind flow around the silo group. The influence of the angle of incidence of the wind flow on the dynamic wind pressures is investigated by performing 2 D URANS (unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes) simulations. Linking of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> to dynamic properties of the silos reveals strong narrow band frequency peaks in the turbulent pressure coefficient spectra of the silos near the lee side corners {{of the group that}} match the structural natural frequencies of the observed ovalling modes. The importance of 3 D wake effects on the spatial distribution of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> along the height of the silos is investigated with 3 D DDES (delayed detached eddy simulations). An important issue in the 3 D simulations is the application of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) at the inlet of the domain. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> on the silo surfaces are first investigated using the same procedure as for the 2 D results and afterwards by performing one way coupling calculations; i. e. by applying the 3 D <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> as transient external loads on a 3 D finite element model of the silos. Determination of modal kinetic and deformation energy of the structural response shows that even for a single silo in ABL flow the ovalling mode shapes with 3 and 4 circumferential wavelengths are dynamically excited, corresponding with the observed ovalling vibrations during the storm in 2002...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{parametric}} bi-cubic {{model for the}} joint probability distribution of wind <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> and structural responses. This non-Gaussian model is a bivariate extension of the well-known Hermite polynomial transformation. It offers {{a new way to}} determine Equivalent Static Wind Loads, with the embedded feature to –at least partly– capture the non-Gaussianity of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> and responses. In a second step, based on the observation that this model as well as the usual LRC method or the conditional sampling technique, fail in reproducing structural responses that do not overestimate the extreme values resulting from a complete structural analysis, we propose a two-step adjustment procedure that restores the non-overestimation condition and the recovery of the considered structural response. With the example of a boundary layer flow around a duo-pitched roof, it is demonstrated that the Equivalent Static Wind Loads, adjusted or not, obtained with the proposed model of non-Gaussian joint probability density function reconstruct the envelope of structural response more efficiently than with the other two techniques.

The fuselage used magnesium alloys extensively, while the wings were fabricated from more conventional aluminum alloys. The airframe was designed to withstand unusually high loads of up to 18 times gravity due to the uncertainties of transonic flight. The forward fuselage was designed so that it, including the cockpit, could be jettisoned from the aircraft in an emergency. The aircraft was configured to carry more than 500 lb of test equipment, including sensors (primarily strain gauges and accelerometers) in 400 locations throughout the aircraft.

Brundle also believed that the larger capacity engine with lighter turbocharging meant less lag and better fuel consumption, especially since the team also had good drivers. Team manager Dave Price, who had also constructed most of the chassis, felt that the Mercedes engine/turbo combination gave them much better fuel economy than anyone else, particularly while Schlesser was driving.|$|E

On 3 June 1937 the Heinkel He 112 was flown with its piston engine shut down during flight by test pilot Erich Warsitz, at which time it was propelled by von Braun’s rocket power alone.
