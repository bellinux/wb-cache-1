5000|$|In the Battle of Britain the Spitfire and Hurricane planes {{powered by}} the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine were {{equipped}} largely with single stage and singlespeed superchargers. Stanley Hooker of Rolls Royce, to improve the performance of Merlin engine developed two-speed two-stage supercharging with <b>aftercooling</b> with a successful application on the Rolls Royce Merlin 61 aero engine in 1942. Horsepower was increased and performance at all aircraft heights. Hooker's developments allowed the aircraft they powered to maintain a crucial advantage over the German aircraft they opposed throughout World War II despite the German engines being significantly larger in displacement. [...] Two-stage superchargers were also always two-speed. After the air was compressed in the low-pressure stage, the air flowed through an intercooler radiator where it was cooled before being compressed again by the high-pressure stage and then possibly also aftercooled in another heat exchanger. Two-stage compressors provided much improved high altitude performance, as typified by the Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 powered Supermarine Spitfire Mk IX and the North American Mustang.|$|E

An absorption inlet-cooling system is introduced to the intercooled reheat recuperated gas-turbine cycle (I cycle). The exhaust gas of the cycle is used to run the system, which cools the inlet air to the low-pressure compressor and high-pressure compressor using two stages of cooling in the intercooler. Five different layouts of the I cycle are presented. Those layouts include the effects of absorption inlet cooling, evaporative inlet cooling, evaporative <b>aftercooling,</b> and absorption inlet cooling with evaporative <b>aftercooling.</b> A parametric study {{of the effect of}} pressure ratio, ambient temperature, ambient relative-humidity, turbine's inlet-temperature (TIT), and the effectiveness of the recuperated heat-exchanger ([var epsilon]HE 1) on the performance of all cycles is carried out. The results indicate that using two stages of cooling in the intercooler could boost the gain in efficiency, because of applying evaporative inlet cooling, by up to 1. 55 %. Applying absorption inlet-cooling could increase the efficiency of the I cycle by up to 6. 6 % compared with 3. 9 % for applying evaporative inlet cooling. Applying absorption inlet-cooling with evaporative <b>aftercooling</b> could increase the optimum efficiency of the I cycle by 3. 5 % and its maximum power by more than 50 %.

40|$|The {{evaporative}} {{gas turbine}} pilot plant (EvGT) {{has been in}} operation at Lund Institute of Technology in Sweden since 1997. This article presents the experimental and theoretical results of the latest process modifications made, i. e. {{the effect of the}} installation of an <b>aftercooler.</b> The purpose of the <b>aftercooler</b> is to increase the performance of the cycle by utilizing more low-level heat in the humidification tower. The chosen <b>aftercooler</b> is of plate heat exchanger type, which, is very compact, has high thermal efficiency and low pressure drop. The installation of an <b>aftercooler</b> lowers the temperature of the air entering the humidification tower. This also lowers the temperature of the circulating humidification water, which facilitates the extraction of more low-level heat from the economizer. This low-level heat can be utilized to evaporate more water in the humidification tower and thus increase the gas flow in the expander. The pilot plant has been operated at different loads and the measured results has been evaluated and compared with theoretical models.

Design sensitivity studies related to intercooling technology in combination with a PDC are further explored for a number of heat-exchanger design effectiveness values and associated pressure loss levels. The acquired results suggest that the incorporation of PDC technology within a conventional core has the potential to significantly improve engine thermal efficiency. Incorporating intercooling improves the cycle performance for any pre-combustion OPR above 10 and contributes to an increase in specific power over the entire range of OPR. Finally, the results demonstrate that <b>aftercooling</b> the high pressure compressor delivery air further improves core specific power, but cancels out any SFC and thermal efficiency benefits arising from pulse detonation...|$|E

50|$|A charge-air cooler {{is simply}} an all-encompassing term, meaning that it cools the turbo's air charge before it is routed into the engine.

The contribution of combustion, manifolds, <b>aftercooler</b> and turbocharger irreversibility production is analysed using detailed diagrams. It is revealed that transient in-cylinder irreversibilities develop in a different manner compared to the respective steady-state.

40|$|A multi-cylinder {{turbocharged}} Diesel {{engine is}} analysed {{from a second}} law analysis point of view via a single-zone thermodynamic model. For this purpose, a comprehensive digital computer program is developed that incorporates subroutines to simulate, among other things, combustion, heat transfer, indirect fuel injection, mass flow through valves, turbocharger and <b>aftercooler</b> behaviour, and real multi-cylinder engine action. This is tested favourably against relevant data from an experimental investigation conducted at the authors' laboratory. A second law analysis is performed {{in all parts of}} the engine (cylinder, compressor, turbine, <b>aftercooler,</b> inlet and exhaust manifolds). The analysis describes explicitly all the availability terms existing, i. e. work, heat and mass transfer, availability accumulation in every control volume and fuel flow, thus providing the proper evaluation of every component's irreversibilities, which for the present study are compressor, turbine, inlet, exhaust and combustion. The model is applied to a six-cylinder, turbocharged and <b>aftercooled,</b> indirect injection, four-stroke, medium-high speed diesel engine, installed at the authors' laboratory. Availability rate and cumulative availability terms, with respect to crank angle, for all the processes encountered are presented in diagrams, which show the trends of the availability accumulation and destruction in every component during an engine cycle. Separate diagrams are presented for the main chamber and the prechamber and also for the closed and open parts of the cycle. Tabulation of all second law analysis terms is given for the full load-maximum speed operation and the differences against first law assessments are discussed. Special attention is paid to the correct determination and explanation of the irreversibility quantification and second law efficiencies for every component and for the whole plant. Thus, it is demonstrated that the second law analysis offers a more spherical and comprehensive insight into the processes occurring in a diesel engine than its traditional first law counterpart.

50|$|The two RSD-7 demonstrators were {{significant}} for Alco. They were built {{with the intention}} of challenging the Fairbanks-Morse Train Master H24-66. When built in early 1954 the RSD-7 delivered the highest continuous tractive effort of all diesel locomotives then available. The RSD-7 offered 75% more dynamic braking capacity than any standard freight unit available at the time. The superlatives of the RSD-7 allowed two units to do the work of three conventional 4-motor units. The dynamic brake system was mounted on top the long hood, leaving room in the short hood for a steam generator. The RSD-7 was the first Alco built with the notched corner sand fills. The RSD-7 was the first Alco to use the coiled air brake intercoolers mounted just above and ahead of the radiator intakes. The RSD-7 was the first Alco to use the then new Model 710 water cooled turbocharger in a 16-cylinder engine. The two demonstrators were numbered DL600 and DL601. The DL600 weighed 360,000 pounds at the standard 60,000 pounds per axle. The DL601 weighed 390,000 to test the gains in adhesion from the extra weight. Additional experimentation by Alco used new fuel injection pumps and nozzles, increased fuel rack settings, and an <b>aftercooler</b> was applied to reduce engine air inlet temperature. The <b>aftercooler</b> allowed higher density inlet air into the engine that promoted greater fuel burning efficiency. The <b>aftercooler</b> became the feature that allowed the 244 to be pushed to 2400 horsepower and the designation of 244H. The 244H is also known as the Alco 250 engine to disassociate it from the troubled 244 engine series. The maroon, yellow and gray painted RSD-7 demonstrators began a 23-railroad, 50,000 mile demonstration tour in the Spring of 1954. The tour concluded in September 1954 and the two units were refurbished before sale to the Santa Fe.|$|R
