Grapevines (Vitis vinifera L. cv Chardonnay) located in eight experimental plots (Burgundy, France) along a hillslope were monitored weekly for three years for leaf water potentials, both at predawn (Ψpd) and at midday (Ψstem). The water stress experienced by grapevine was modeled as a function of <b>meteorological</b> data (<b>minimum</b> and maximum temperature, rainfall) and soil characteristics (soil texture, gravel content, slope) by a gradient boosting machine. Model performance was assessed by comparison with carbon isotope discrimination (δ 13 C) of grape sugars at harvest and by the use of a test-set.

Model predictions at a daily time step improved correlation with δ 13 C data, respect to the observed trend at a weekly time scale. The role of each predictor in these models was described in order to understand how temperature, rainfall, soil texture, gravel content and slope affect the grapevine water status in the studied context.

Here we identify dust sources through MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery and analyze HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particles Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model trajectories and dispersion patterns, along with concomitant synoptic-scale meteorological conditions from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis (NCEP/NCAR). Additionally, surface pressure {{data from the}} hourly <b>METeorological</b> <b>Aerodrome</b> Report (METAR) at Arica (18. 5 °S, 70. 3 °W) and Pisco (13. 7 °S, 76. 2 °W) were used to calculate Alongshore (sea-level) Pressure Gradient (APG) anomalies during Paracas dust storms, their duration and associated wind-speeds and wind directions. This study provides a review on the occurrence and strength of the Paracas dust storms {{as reported in the}} Pisco airfield for five-year period and their correspondence with MODIS true-color imagery in terms of dust-emission source areas. Our results show that most of the particle fluxes moving into the Ica-Pisco desert area during Paracas wind events originate over the coastal zone, where strong winds forced by steep APGs develop as the axis of a deep mid-troposphere trough sets in along north-central Chile. Direct relationships between Paracas wind intensity, number of active dust-emission sources and APGs are also documented, although the scarcity of simultaneous METAR/MODIS data for clearly observed MODIS dust plumes prevents any significant statistical inference. Synoptic-scale meteorological composites from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data show that Paracas wind events (steep APGs) are mostly associated with the strengthening of anticyclonic conditions in northern Chile, that can be attributed to cold air advection associated with the incoming trough. Compared to the MODIS images, HYSPLIT outputs were able to spatially reproduce trajectories and dust dispersion plumes during the Paracas wind storms. HYSPLIT trajectories revealed that part of the wind-eroded lithological material can be transported downwind several kilometers along the Peruvian coast and also deposited over the nearby coastal ocean, giving support to the presence of an aeolian signal in continental shelf sediments, of great importance for paleoenvironmental studies...|$|R

40|$|Key message Extreme {{temperatures}} are causing forest dieback in a Mediterranean-type forest. Topography and cold-air pooling explain the geographic distribution of frost dieback in susceptible tree species. Alterations {{to the frequency}} and intensity of extreme temperatures, predicted with climate change, {{pose a threat to}} the health of many forests. Some Mediterranean climate regions are experiencing higher temperature variability, including more extreme low and high temperature events. Following one such low-temperature event in autumn 2012, we conducted landscape- and site-level studies to examine the impact of frost on trees and the interaction between topography, temperature, and dieback in a forest ecosystem in the Mediterranean climate region of southwest Australia. Canopy damage was widespread across the survey area and occurred in distinct patches, with sizes ranging between 4. 1 and 2, 518. 0 ha. In affected forest, Eucalyptus marginata and Corymbia calophylla experienced nearly complete crown dieback, while E. patens and E. wandoo were undamaged. Canopy damage was found more frequently in valleys and lower to mid-slope positions, and site-level studies confirmed that crown dieback generally increased with decreasing elevation. Low temperatures were strongly correlated with elevation along damaged forest transects and cold-air pooling explained the pattern of forest damage. By regressing temperatures from damaged sites against those collected from the nearest <b>meteorological</b> station, projected <b>minimum</b> air temperatures ranged from - 0. 1 to - 2. 7 °C at valley bottom when the dieback occurred. Insufficient tissue hardening is suspected to have predisposed trees to this autumn frost. The interaction between shifting temperature regimes with climate change and frost damage is discussed. With continued increases in temperature variability, we can expect to see more temperature-driven disturbance events and associated reductions in forest health...|$|R
40|$|Relationships between tomato fruitworm(Heliothis armigera conferta Walker) {{and four}} host plants(lucerne, tomato, aster, sweetcorn) were studied in field, {{greenhouse}} and controlled laboratory conditions at Palmerston North, New Zealand during 1984 - 1986. The {{objective of the}} field trials was to investigate seasonal development, population growth and feeding behaviour of larvae on the four host plants. In the laboratory, oviposition preference within and between plant species, effects of larval foods on development, parameters of larval food quality, feeding preference and induction of feeding preference by different foods were investigated. In the field very few (male) moths were caught by pheromone traps before January, numbers reached a peak in March and had declined to zero by late April. Individual <b>meteorological</b> parameters (<b>minimum</b> night temperature, maximum day temperature and rainfall) showed no significant correlation with moth catches. On mature stages of the four plants larvae fed preferentially on tomato fruits, sweetcorn cobs and aster flowers over plant leaves but were hardly observed at all on lucerne. Glasshouse experiments showed that female moths preferred to oviposit on {{the upper half of}} plants, leaves were preferred over other plant parts and upper leaf surfaces were preferred over lower leaf surfaces. Oviposition preference was however affected by the flowering stage of the plants. At the pre-flowering stage lucerne was the most preferred but at flowering aster was the most preferred. Odour {{played a significant role in}} plant selection for oviposition. Different larval foods gave significant differences in growth and development of the insect as measured by several biological parameters. When larval period, mortality, percent pupation, pupal weight, adult fecundity and life span were combined into an overall fitness index reproductive parts of all plants(flowers, fruits and cobs) gave better performance than leaves. Dry matter content (and its reciprocal water content) and nitrogen content of foods, considered alone or combination, did not provide an adequate measure of food quality for larvae. Larval growth rate on a particular food was clearly influenced by rate of ingestion of that food and larvae tended to consume less of those foods that were more readily digested and assimilated. The nitrogen requirement of H. armigera larvae for adequate growth and development appeared to be low at about 1. 9 % of dry matter which was approximately the nitrogen level found in the reproductive parts of the plants. Newly hatched larvae expressed clear preferences for particular plant species in the order lucerne leaves > tomato leaves > aster leaves > sweetcorn leaves. However, these preferences could be modified in later larvae by early feeding experience but artificial diet (based on kidney bean) had little effect on food preference. Feeding preference for reproductive parts of plants was more strongly expressed than for leaves and reproductive parts evoked greater induction of preference...|$|R

O estudo foi realizado com dados meteorológicos de temperatura mínima do ar, radiação solar global e dados de estatísticas agrícolas de rendimento de arroz irrigado, das seis regiões orizícolas do Rio Grande do Sul, referentes às safras 1982 / 1983 até 2005 / 2006. Foram feitas análises de tendência tecnológica dos rendimentos, e foram estabelecidos os indicadores agrometeorológicos para o ajuste de modelos de estimativa de rendimento de arroz irrigado, para o Rio Grande do Sul. Existe tendência tecnológica de aumento nos rendimentos de arroz irrigado no Estado. As variáveis meteorológicas avaliadas - dias com temperatura mínima do ar {{inferior}} a 15 °C e radiação solar global - podem ser usadas como indicadores do rendimento de arroz irrigado. Os modelos agrometeorológicos elaborados para as seis regiões orizícolas e para o Estado do Rio Grande do Sul apresentam características de precisão, fácil implementação e baixo custo e podem, portanto, ser introduzidos ao programa {{nacional de}} previsão de safras. The {{objective of this}} work was to elaborate and test models to estimate the irrigated rice yield, in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. The study was carried out using <b>meteorological</b> data of <b>minimum</b> air temperature, global solar radiation and data of agricultural statistics about the irrigated rice yield, involving six rice production regions of Rio Grande do Sul, relative to crop years from 1982 / 1983 to 2005 / 2006. Analyses of yield technological tendencies were performed, and agrometeorological indicators for model adjustments of irrigated rice yields were established. There is a technological tendency of increasing the irrigated rice yield in the State. The analyzed meteorological variables - global solar radiation and days with minimum air temperature below or equal to 15 °C - {{can be used as}} indicators of the irrigated rice yield. The adjusted agrometeorological models, elaborated for the six rice production regions and for the Rio Grande do Sul State, show characteristics of accuracy, easy implementation and low cost, which make them able to be introduced in the national program of crop forecast...|$|R

40|$|Daily average net {{radiation}} (DANR) {{is a critical}} variable for estimation of daily evapotranspiration (ET) from remote sensing techniques at watershed or regional scales, and in turn for hydrological modeling and water resources management. This study attempts to comprehensively analyze physical mechanisms governing the variation of each component of DANR during a day, with the objective to improve parameterization schemes for daily average net shortwave radiation (DANSR) and daily average net longwave radiation (DANLR) using MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data products, DEM, and <b>minimum</b> <b>meteorological</b> data in order to map spatially consistent and reasonably distributed DANR at watershed scales for clear sky days. First, a geometric model for simulating daily average direct solar radiation by accounting {{for the effects of}} terrain factors (slope, azimuth and elevation) on the availability of direct solar radiation for sloping land surfaces is adopted. Specifically, the magnitudes of sunrise and sunset angles, the frequencies of a sloping surface being illuminated as well as the potential sunshine duration for a given sloping surface are computed on a daily basis. The geometric model is applied to the Baiyangdian watershed in North China, with showing the capability to distinctly characterize the spatial pattern of daily average direct solar radiation for sloping land surfaces. DANSR can then be successfully derived from simulated daily average direct solar radiation by means of the geometric model and the characteristics of nearly invariant diffuse solar radiation during daytime in conjunction with MCD 43 A 1 albedo products. Second, four observations of Terra-MODIS and Aqua-MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and surface emissivities in band 31 and band 32 from MOD 11 A 1, MYD 11 A 1 and MOD 11 _L 2 data products for six clear sky days from April to September in the year 2007, are utilized to simulate daily average LST to improve the accuracy of estimates of DANLR. Comparisons of the DANLR estimates from the proposed four observation-based method and that from an existing one observation-based method, against that from the Penmen equation solely using routine meteorological data indicates that the proposed method is capable of more accurately simulating DANLR than is the one observation-based method. Using the Penman equation as a reference, results show that overall the proposed method has a bias of 2. 7 W m(- 2) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 12. 8 W m(- 2), whereas the one observation-based method has a bias of - 33. 3 W m(- 2) and a RMSE of 39. 6 W m(- 2) across 18 weather stations for six tested days. In general, simulated DANR is shown to be reasonable over the entire study watershed for the six clear sky days {{as a result of the}} improvement in the parameterization schemes of DANSR and DANLR. The resulting DANR would serve well as a critical variable linking instantaneous evaporative fraction to the estimates of daily Er primarily from remotely sensed data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
