Velu Pillai and Kambola-balika by N. K. Krishna Pillai. But by far the most inspiring work of that time was Aphante Makal by M. B. Namboodiri, who directed his literary talents towards the abolition of old worn-out customs and manners which had for years been the bane of the community.|$|E

However, as reported in 1836 by Prof. A. D. Bache of the University of Pennsylvania, {{the law of the}} effect of heat on the conduction of bodies otherwise non-conductors, for example, glass, could be attributed to Franklin. Franklin writes, [...] "...A certain quantity of heat will make some bodies good conductors, that will not otherwise conduct..." [...] and again, [...] "...And water, though naturally a good conductor, will not conduct well when frozen into ice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dispensationalist christological {{readings}} are notable in deviating {{from this}} general pattern {{in a number}} of ways that <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>mentioning.</b> These readings have the warrant given to Nehemiah in 445/4 BCE as the terminus ad quo, but since 483 years from 445/4 BCE would extend somewhat beyond the lifetime of Christ to 39/40 CE these years are reduced to 476 years by viewing them as 360-day [...] "prophetic" [...] years, which are so-called on the basis that various biblical passages—such as Revelation 12:6, 14 (cf. Dan 7:25; 12:7)—suggest that there was a convention for reckoning time in this way within certain prophetic contexts. Consequently, the sixty-nine weeks of [...] "prophetic" [...] years terminate with the death of Christ in 32/3 CE. The seventieth week is then separated from the sixty-ninth week by a long period of time known as the church age; hence, the seventieth week does not begin until the end of the church age, at which point the church will be removed from the earth in an event called the rapture. Finally, the future Antichrist is expected to oppress the Jewish people and bring upon the world a period of tribulation lasting three and a half years, constituting the second half of the delayed seventieth week. These readings were first popularized through the expository notes written by C. I. Scofield in his Scofield Reference Bible and continue to enjoy widespread support among American evangelicals.|$|E

60|$|On leaving Ascension, we sailed for Bahia, on {{the coast}} of Brazil, in order to {{complete}} the chronometrical measurement of the world. We arrived there on August 1st, and stayed four days, during which I took several long walks. I was glad to find my enjoyment in tropical scenery had not decreased from the want of novelty, even in the slightest degree.

60|$|Among all the retinue of the Baron, however, {{none were}} found to doubt the ardor of that {{extraordinary}} affection which existed {{on the part of}} the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his horse; at least, none but an insignificant and misshapen little page, whose deformities were in everybody's way, and whose opinions were of the least possible importance. He--if his ideas <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>mentioning</b> at all--had the effrontery to assert that his master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and almost imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return from every long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance.|$|E
60|$|Some ancient {{submarine}} volcanic rocks <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>mentioning,</b> {{from their}} rarity on this {{eastern side of}} the continent. In the valley of the Tapas (fifty or sixty miles N. of Maldonado) there is a tract three or four miles in length, composed of various trappean rocks with glassy feldspar--of apparently metamorphosed grit-stones--of purplish amygdaloids with large kernels of carbonate of lime (Near the Pan de Azucar there is some greenish porphyry, in one place amygdaloidal with agate.)--and much of a harshish rock with glassy feldspar intermediate in character between claystone porphyry and trachyte. This latter rock was in one spot remarkable from being full of drusy cavities, lined with quartz crystals, and arranged in planes, dipping at an angle of 50 degrees to the east, and striking parallel to the foliation of an adjoining hill composed of the common mixture of quartz, feldspar, and imperfect hornblende: this fact perhaps indicates that these volcanic rocks have been metamorphosed, and their constituent parts rearranged, {{at the same time and}} according to the same laws, with the granitic and metamorphic formations of this whole region. In the valley of the Marmaraya, a few miles south of the Tapas, a band of trappean and amygdaloidal rock is interposed between a hill of granite and an extensive surrounding formation of red conglomerate, which (like that at the foot of the S. Animas) has its basis porphyritic with crystals of feldspar, and which hence has certainly suffered metamorphosis.|$|E

60|$|In our course {{down the}} Parana, I {{observed}} only three other birds, whose habits <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>mentioning.</b> One {{is a small}} kingfisher (Ceryle Americana); it has a longer tail than the European species, and hence does not sit in so stiff and upright a position. Its flight also, instead of being direct and rapid, like {{the course of an}} arrow, is weak and undulatory, as among the soft-billed birds. It utters a low note, like the clicking together of two small stones. A small green parrot (Conurus murinus), with a grey breast, appears to prefer the tall trees on the islands to any other situation for its building-place. A number of nests are placed so close together as to form one great mass of sticks. These parrots always live in flocks, and commit great ravages on the corn-fields. I was told that near Colonia 2500 were killed in the course of one year. A bird with a forked tail, terminated by two long feathers (Tyrannus savana), and named by the Spaniards scissor-tail, is very common near Buenos Ayres: it commonly sits on a branch of the ombu tree, near a house, and thence takes a short flight in pursuit of insects, and returns to the same spot. When on the wing it presents in its manner of flight and general appearance a caricature-likeness of the common swallow. It has the power of turning very shortly in the air, and in so doing opens and shuts its tail, sometimes in a horizontal or lateral and sometimes in a vertical direction, just like a pair of scissors.|$|E
6000|$|Friedrich Wilhelm sends {{back his}} Ten Thousand, {{according}} to contract; sends, over and above, a beautiful stock of [...] "copper pontoons" [...] {{to help the}} Imperial Majesty in that River Country, says Fassmann;--sends also a supernumerary Troop of Hussars, who <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>mentioning,</b> [...] "Six-score horse of Hussar type," [...] under one Captain Ziethen, a taciturn, much-enduring, much-observing man, whom we shall see again: these are to be diligently helpful, as is natural; but they are also, for their own behoof, to be diligently observant, and learn the Austrian Hussar methods, which his Majesty last year saw to be much superior. Nobody that knows Ziethen doubts but he learnt; Hussar-Colonel Baronay, his Austrian teacher here, became too well convinced of it when they met on a future occasion. [Life of Ziethen (veridical but inexact, by the Frau von Blumenthal, a kinswoman of his; English Translation, very ill printed, Berlin, 1803), p. 54.] All this his Majesty did for the ensuing campaign: but as to the Crown-Prince's going thither, after repeated requests on his part, it is at last signified to him, deep in the season, that it cannot be: [...] "Won't answer for a Crown-Prince to be sharer in such a Campaign;--be patient, my good Fritzchen, I will find other work for thee." [...] [Friedrich's Letter, 5th September, 1735; Friedrich Wilhelm's Answer next day (OEuvres de Frederic, xxvii. part 3d, 93-95).] Fritzchen is sent into Preussen, to do the Reviewings and Inspections there; Papa not being able for them this season; and strict manifold Inspection, in those parts, being more than usually necessary, owing to the Russian-Polish troubles. On this errand, which is clearly a promotion, though in present circumstances not a welcome one for the Crown-Prince, he sets out without delay; and passes there the equinoctial and autumnal season, {{in a much more}} useful way than he could have done in the Rhine-Campaign.|$|E
