40|$|Apparent interferon-mediated {{persistent}} {{infection of}} rabies virus (HEP-Flury strain) {{was established in}} a human neuroblastoma SYM-I (clone K- 104) cell line, which {{had the ability to}} produce interferon. This infection produced variable but small amounts of progeny virus and interferon (up to 100 IU/ml), and resisted superinfection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus as well as homologous rabies virus. The treatment of this infection with <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibody</b> stimulated virus replication and extensive c. p. e. However, some cells survived and grew rapidly without any sign of c. p. e. These produced increased amounts (100 to 1000 times) of infectious and DI particles in the presence of <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibody,</b> becoming susceptible to superinfection with VSV but remaining resistant o the original rabies virus. Small plaque mutants appeared and replaced the original virus during the long-term cultivation of the persistent infection. Several mutants tested were all identified as Sdi (DI-resistant) mutants, suggesting that the persisting viruses were endowed by the Sdi mutation with a selective advantage over the original virus even in interferon-mediated persistent infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{direct effects}} of alpha- and beta-interferons on {{isolated}} mouse pancreatic islets were investigated in vitro {{and found to}} be similar. After 7 h incubation with interferon concentrations above 350 units/ml, glucose-stimulated (pro) insulin biosynthesis was significantly inhibited, with only a slight inhibition of total protein biosynthesis. Inhibition could be abolished in the additional presence of an <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibody.</b> Interferon did not affect insulin release, total insulin content, or glucose oxidation of the islets. The stimulation of (pro) insulin biosynthesis by adenosine, D-glyceraldehyde, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine and leucine was also inhibited by interferon, with no effect on insulin release. At concentrations of dsRNA (double-stranded RNA) said to induce interferon (1 - 100 micrograms/ml), glucose-stimulated (pro) insulin biosynthesis was inhibited without significantly affecting insulin release. The dsRNA may itself inhibit stimulated (pro) insulin biosynthesis or may function indirectly by the induction of interferon...|$|E
40|$|Mice {{infected}} with encephalomyocarditis virus develop a severe state of hyporeactivity to interferon induction. One mechanisms possibly responsibile {{for development of}} hyporesponsiveness in these animals is a circulating factor which can be detected in their serum 96 h after encephalomyocarditis virus infection (at the time of peak hyporeactivity in vivo). This report describes some of the physiocochemical characteristics of this serum hyporeactive factor (SHF). SHF is a protein with a molecular weight between 20, 000 and 40, 000 that was extremely labile at 56 C, losing greater than 90 % of its biological activity in 8 min, but stable at 37 c for at least 4 h. Hyporeactive factor was also stable over a pH range of 2 to 11 for 48 h at 4 C. These results suggest that SHF is physicochemically similar to interferon. However, no interferon could be detected in the SHF preparation, and no loss in biological activity was observed when the serum factor was incubated with <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibody,</b> suggesting that they are separate substances...|$|E
40|$|A {{follow-up}} study {{was made of}} 94 chronic hepatitis C patients at a hepatitis clinic in Brazil, after interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy, to {{determine the influence of}} <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibodies</b> on treatment outcome. Patients diagnosed as having chronic hepatitis C, confirmed by PCR (HCV RNA) and liver biopsy, were treated with interferon alpha 2 a or 2 b for at least six months, and were followed up for 24 weeks after termination of treatment in order to assess biochemical, virological and clinical pathology responses. Only 6 % of the 94 patients developed anti-IFN antibodies, 70 % presented a biochemical response and 23 % maintained a sustained virological response. Clinical evaluation revealed that in only 2 patients was there progression of fibrosis; the necro-inflammatory score indicated that 72 % maintained the same activity, 12 % had worsening necro-inflammatory activity, and the remaining 16 % had decreased activity. There was no significant correlation of demographic and laboratory variables with levels of <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Similarly, biochemical and virological responses were not influenced by <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Multivariate analysis by logistic regression revealed that clinical pathological parameters, staging and necro-inflammatory activity did not influence the response to the virus...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} cell growth and {{differentiation}} in B-cell malignancies may be {{regulated by the}} autocrine production of cytokines, several {{of which have been}} implicated in the growth and survival of B-cells. The effect of interferon-alpha (IFN) therapy in these disorders may be to disrupt autocrine growth or survival loops. We have measured levels of circulating IL- 1 b, IL- 6, TNF-a and soluble CD 23 (sCD 23) in 8 patients with Binet stage A B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) receiving IFN therapy, and compared these with changes in the lymphocyte count following IFN therapy. Two patients developed <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibodies</b> while on IFN therapy, and in both them, the changes in lymphocyte count correlated significantly with the titre of <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibodies,</b> as well as serum levels of IL- 6, TNF-a and sCD 23. In one patient there was significant correlation with levels of IL- 1 b. One patient, who stopped and restarted IFN therapy, demonstrated correlation between lymphocyte count and levels of IL- 6 and sCD 23. In a further two patients, there was correlation with levels of sCD 23 alone, while the remaining three patients showed no correlation between lymphocyte count and the serum cytokines measured. These results suggest that IFN therapy may alter levels of circulating cytokines in some CLL patients and that these effects may be associated with disease progression...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{naturally}} occurring antibodies to IFN-alpha {{were discovered in}} a few systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cancer patients; however, in most patients monitored for anti-IFN antibodies before treatment, no antibodies were found. In an attempt to explain the 'IFN-blocking effect' that we observed in all serum samples we investigated 200 sera from healthy blood donors. We isolated the globulin fraction, and used rabbit anti-human IgG and IgM columns, protein A columns and T-gel affinity chromatography to isolate human IgG and IgM. All sample fractions were tested in a biological IFN neutralization assay {{by means of a}} sensitive MTT-assay. We found that normal human serum contained autoantibodies to crude human leucocyte IFN, native human fibroblast IFN, recombinant human leucocyte IFN-alpha 2 b and recombinant human IFN-gamma, and that these {{naturally occurring}} antibodies were biologically active immunoglobulins of IgG and IgM type. These anti-IFN antibodies were also present in purified human normal immunoglobulin pools. We conclude that all humans have naturally occurring <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibodies</b> in their serum, and it is a tempting theory that human cytokines and lymphokines are, at least partly, regulated by immunoglobulins...|$|R
40|$|Crystallization and {{preliminary}} X-ray diffraction {{analysis of}} the complex between a human <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibody</b> fragment and human interferon a- 2 A Recombinant human interferon- 2 A (rhIFN [...] 2 A) has been crystallized in complex with the recombinantly produced Fab fragment of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (MEDI 545; IgG 1 /) which targets several human interferon subtypes. This constitutes the first reported crystals of a human type I interferon bound to an antibody. The orthorhombic crystals belonged to either space group I 222 or I 212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 134. 82, b = 153. 26, c = 163. 49 A ˚. The diffraction of the crystals extended to 3. 0 A ˚ resolution. The asymmetric unit contained two Fab–rhIFN [...] 2 A complexes. This corresponded to a crystal volume per protein weight (VM) of 3. 02 A˚ 3 Da 1 and a solvent content of 59. 3 %. The corresponding three-dimensional structure is expected {{to shed light on}} the mechanism of action of MEDI 545 and the molecular basis of its specificity...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{interferon}} in host {{resistance to}} viral infection {{has not been}} established. Although administration of interferon can confer a marked protection on virus-infected animals (1), the evidence {{that it is important}} in limiting virus infection has been indirect, based for the most part on temporal associations between the presence of virus and interferon in different tissues (2). Two direct means of determining the role of interferon in experimental or natural virus infections would be: (a) use of an animal incapable of producing interferon or insensitive to its action (such an animal has not been described); and (b) use of a selective inhibitor of interferon production or action. Metabolic inhibiters which inhibit both interferon production and action also affect many host functions and are therefore not selective. An <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibody</b> should however combine selectively with extracellular interferon produced by viralinfected tissues and prevent interferon from protecting uninfected cells. Fauconnier has in fact shown that inoculation of sheep anti-mouse interferon serum of low potency was associated with a more rapid onset of disease and an increase...|$|E
40|$|K- 104 cells, a cloned {{cell line}} {{derived from a}} human {{neuroblastoma}} (SYM-I), were induced by rabies HEP-Flury virus to release large amounts of interferon, and the resulting antiviral activity significantly suppressed the rabies virus replication. The role of endogenous interferon was confirmed by treatment with <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibody</b> which increased the yield of progeny virus. The virus yield in the second undiluted passage through K- 104 cells was much less than {{that in the first}} passage, because of the antiviral state initiated by brief contact of interferon present in the virus inoculum with cells during the short period of virus adsorption. When the m. o. i, was relatively low, as in the third undiluted passage, the effect of interferon present in the inoculum was enhanced and most of the infected cells survived but were shown to be in a state of persistent infection. Defective interfering (DI) particles did not accumulate rapidly during these three undiluted passages. When Sindbis virus was used for infection, the endogenous interferon system of K- 104 cells was not activated uring 12 undiluted passages. However, on the 12 th passage, the yield began to decline due to the generation and accumulation of DI particles...|$|E
40|$|Human beta-interferon stimulates a 4 -fold {{increase}} in the concentration of diacyglycerol and a 2 -fold {{increase in}} the concentration of inositol monophosphate in Daudi (human B-lymphoblastoid) cells within 30 sec of exposure of the cells to interferon. The increase in diacylglycerol and in inositol monophosphate is transient and the concentrations of these compounds decrease to basal levels within 10 min. Preincubation of human beta-interferon with <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibodies</b> inhibits this effect {{as well as the}} binding of interferon to Daudi cells. Diacylglycerol concentrations were unaffected in mouse A 9 cells (fibroblasts) incubated with human beta-interferon and in Daudi cells incubated with human gamma-interferon. Mouse A 9 cells are insensitive to human interferon and Daudi cells are insensitive to human gamma-interferon. The magnitude of the increase in diacylglycerol concentration stimulated by interferon can be correlated to the interferon-induced inhibition of Daudi cell division in a dose-responsive manner. Phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate also inhibits Daudi cell division in a dose-responsive manner. It is likely that the sharp and transient increase in diacylglycerol concentration represents one of the early biochemical changes in Daudi cells exposed to interferon...|$|R
40|$|Five {{patients}} with chronic hepatitis B were treated with 8 -day courses of leukocyte (alpha) interferon (5 X 10 (6) U/day) and with 8 -day courses of recombinant fibroblast (betaser) interferon at dosages of 5 X 10 (6), 35 X 10 (6), and 105 X 10 (6) U/day. Inhibition of hepatitis B virus replication as evidenced by a decrease in DNA polymerase (DNAP) activity was seen during all treatment courses. Equivalent reduction in DNAP was seen from the low-dose alpha and beta ser regimens, but beta ser interferon at 35 X 10 (6) U/day achieved a significantly greater decrease in DNAP activity than did the low-dose regimens. In no patient, however, was permanent loss of DNAP noted. Because of dose-limiting toxicity, only two patients were escalated to the 105 X 10 (6) -U/day dosage level. Transient proteinuria was noted in two patients while they were receiving interferon. This has not been noted in other patients receiving this preparation {{and could not be}} explained by the development of <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibodies.</b> This study has defined an appropriate dosage for future longer-term trials of this agent alone and in combination with other antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B...|$|R

40|$|We {{characterized}} a novel 28 S rRNA cleavage {{in cells}} {{infected with the}} murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The 28 S rRNA cleavage occurred as early as 4 h postinfection (p. i.) in MHV-infected DBT cells, {{with the appearance of}} subsequent cleavage products and a decrease in the amount of intact 28 S rRNA with increasing times of infection; almost all of the intact 28 S rRNA disappeared by 24 h p. i. In contrast, no specific 18 S rRNA cleavage was detected in infected cells. MHV-induced 28 S rRNA cleavage was detected in all MHV-susceptible cell lines and all MHV strains tested. MHV replication was required for the 28 S rRNA cleavage, and mature cytoplasmic 28 S rRNA underwent cleavage. In certain combination of cells and viruses, pretreatment of virus-infected cells with interferon activates a cellular endoribonuclease, RNase L, that causes rRNA degradation. No interferon was detected in the inoculum used for MHV infection. Addition of <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibody</b> to MHV-infected cells did not inhibit 28 S rRNA cleavage. Furthermore, 28 S rRNA cleavage occurred in an MHV-infected mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line derived from RNase L knockout mice. Thus, MHV-induced 28 S rRNA cleavage was independent of the activation of RNase L. MHV-induced 28 S rRNA cleavage was also different from apoptosis-related rRNA degradation, which usually occurs concomitantly with DNA fragmentation. In MHV-infected 17 Cl- 1 cells, 28 S rRNA cleavage preceded DNA fragmentation by at least 18 h. Blockage of apoptosis in MHV-infected 17 Cl- 1 cells by treatment with a caspase inhibitor did not bloc...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic mice constitutively expressing in {{the brain}} the {{influenza}} virus resistance protein Mx 1 controlled by the HMG (3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) promoter showed specific resistance against the neurotropic influenza A virus strain NWS. Control mice of the A 2 G strain express Mx 1 protein in all organs, but only after induction by interferon type I upon or without viral infection. The extent of specific resistance in transgenic mice of the best-expressing line reached about two-thirds that of controls, most likely because of considerably less total-body Mx protein activity in the transgenic mice. Thus, the theoretical advantage in these mice of the continuous presence of Mx protein with early inhibitory potential to viral replication was apparently offset by restricted organ expression. Strong evidence that the Mx 1 protein on its own is a specific anti-influenza A virus agent and that its efficiency in the experimental setting is independent of interferon actions could be derived from the treatment of experimental and control mice with <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{at the time of}} virus tests. Whereas in A 2 G mice, Mx 1 mRNA and Mx 1 protein synthesis were abolished and viral resistance was markedly reduced or abolished, resistance in the transgenic mice persisted to almost the same degree. Transgenic mice generated with a mouse albumin/Mx 1 cDNA construct showed liver-specific expression. However, in two expressing transgenic lines, Mx 1 protein synthesis was suppressed after a few months. The mechanism of suppression could not be elucidated, but increasing methylation of the transgene's coding region was not the cause. It is possible that continuous Mx 1 protein expression in the liver is less well tolerated than that {{in the brain}}. Whether this partial suppression and, with the HMG promoter, restricted organ expression are the organism's responses to interference of Mx 1 with normal cellular activities such as nucleocytoplasmic transport of RNA and proteins cannot be determined until the molecular mechanisms of antiviral activity of Mx 1 protein are understood...|$|R
40|$|A {{functional}} {{in vitro}} assay of cell-mediated immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is described. This procedure uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the inhibitory effect of human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} on VZV antigen production by VZV-infected cell monolayers. When mononuclear cells from VZV-immune, tetanus-immune donors were stimulated with either VZV antigen or tetanus toxoid they reduced VZV antigen production. In contrast, mononuclear cells from VZV-nonimmune, tetanus-immune donors reduced VZV antigen only when stimulated with tetanus toxoid, but not when stimulated with VZV antigen. Cell-free supernatants recovered from the VZV inhibition assays contained the anti-VZV activity. The magnitude of the anti-VZV activity of the supernatants equalled the inhibition observed when the stimulated mononuclear cells were added to the VZV-infected monolayers. Treatment of either mononuclear cells or supernatants with <b>anti-interferon</b> gamma <b>antibody</b> indicated that their VZV inhibitory capability was largely due to the production of interferon gamma by stimulated mononuclear cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} if a retreatment with natural human interferon alpha could lead to a recovery of the therapeutic responsiveness in nonresponder patients with chronic hepatitis C who did (9 cases) or did not (14 cases) develop <b>anti-interferon</b> neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> while on treatment with recombinant interferon alpha 2 a. During retreatment, no patient developed detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies to natural interferon. At the end of retreatment, 6 / 9 positive patients showed a complete response to natural interferon Therapy, while only 1 / 14 negative patients had a partial response. These data suggest that a second course of treatment with the natural preparation may be useful in patients who failed to respond to an earlier course of recombinant interferon, particularly the anti-interferon positive patients who showed hepatitis reactivation after an initial response concomitantly with antibody appearance. Conversely, a second course of natural interferon therapy might be useless in cases in which the lack of response is not associated to antibody development...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were undertaken to examine how interferon and neutralizing antibodies influence the ability of simian virus 5 (SV 5) (strain W 3) {{to establish and maintain}} persistent infections in murine cells. In contrast to the rapid decline in SV 5 protein synthesis observed in murine BALB/c fibroblasts (BF cells), which produce and respond to interferon, between 24 and 48 h postinfection there was no inhibition of virus protein synthesis in MSFI- cells, skin fibroblasts derived from alpha/beta-interferon receptor knockout BALB/c mice. Furthermore, the addition of <b>anti-interferon</b> <b>antibodies</b> to the culture medium of infected BF cells significantly reduced the observed decline in virus protein synthesis. Following infection of untreated BF cells, the majority replicated virus but survived the infection and eventually cleared the virus after 8 to 15 days. However, not all the cells were cured, and the cultures became persistently infected. Upon passage of persistently infected cultures, the virus fluxed between active and repressed states as a consequence of interferon production. This resulted in a balance being reached in which only 5 to 20 % of the cells were infected at any one time. After 30 passages of the persistently infected cells, highly fusogenic virus variants arose (one of which was isolated and termed W 3 -f). W 3 -f remained as sensitive to interferon as the parental W 3 isolate but, in the absence of interferon, spread much more rapidly than the parental W 3 strain through BF cell monolayers. Sequence analysis revealed no deduced amino acid differences between the F proteins of W 3 and W 3 -f. BF cell cultures persistently infected with W 3 -f were rapidly cleared of virus by the addition of virus-neutralizing antibodies to the culture medium. In contrast, neutralizing antibodies had little effect on the numbers of cells persistently infected with W 3 over several passages. These results suggest that the ability of paramyxoviruses to cause cell-cell fusion may be selected for in vivo as a consequence of their adaptation to the interferon response rather than their need to escape from neutralizing antibodies. The significance of these observations with regard to persistent parainfluenza virus infections in vivo is further discussed...|$|R

The experimental data and the results obtained by using relevant mathematical analysis showed that such RA forms of Abs are able to modulate the monoclonal antibody interaction with both soluble and immobilized (to the assay plate well) interferon gamma. These data demonstrated the importance of using relatively low concentrations of both soluble and plate-immobilized interferon gamma to detect the effects of RA forms of Abs to interferon gamma on the binding of monoclonal antibodies to interferon gamma.

Whether supernatants from immune activated T cell clones could produce histological damage to duodenal mucosa in vitro was studied. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 18 patients without coeliac disease or any other demonstrable abnormality. The tissue was maintained in organ culture for 24 hours with organ culture medium alone, with supernatant from gliadin sensitive T cell clones that had (B) or had not (A) been stimulated with gluten, and compared with the effects caused {{by the addition of}} interferon gamma to the organ culture medium.

40|$|The murine suppressive {{factor of}} allergy (SFA) has been {{purified}} from a T-cell hybridoma {{and found to}} consist of two functionally and biochemically distinct protein molecules. One protein (17 kDa) modulates the low-affinity Fc receptor for IgE on lymphocytes (i. e., CD 23); it decreases the binding avidity of IgE to CD 23 -bearing B cells without affecting quantitative expression of CD 23 and is thus designated epsilon-receptor-modulating protein. The second protein (30 kDa) suppresses IgE biosynthesis (i. e., SFA). This purified SFA suppresses interleukin 4 -induced IgE and IgG 1 synthesis by lipopolysaccharide-activated spleen cells but {{has no effect on}} other antibody isotypes; since the activity of SFA is not blocked by <b>anti-interferon</b> gamma monoclonal <b>antibody,</b> it is thus distinct from interferon gamma.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Interferon gamma is {{a potent}} proinflammatory {{cytokine}} implicated in the inflammation of Crohn's disease (CD). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of fontolizumab, a humanised <b>anti-interferon</b> gamma <b>antibody,</b> in patients with moderate to severe CD. METHODS: A total of 133 patients with Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) scores between 250 and 450, inclusive, were randomised to receive placebo or fontolizumab 4 or 10 mg/kg. Forty two patients received one dose and 91 patients received two doses on days 0 and 28. Investigators and patients were unaware of assignment. Study end points were safety, clinical response (decrease in CDAI of 100 points or more), and remission (CDAI < or = 150). RESULTS: There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the primary end point of the study (clinical response) between the fontolizumab and placebo groups after a single dose at day 28. However, patients receiving two doses of fontolizumab demonstrated doubling in response rate at day 56 compared with placebo: 32 % (9 / 28) versus 69 % (22 / 32, p = 0. 02) and 67 % (21 / 31, p = 0. 03) for the placebo, and 4 and 10 mg/kg fontolizumab groups, respectively. Stratification according to elevated baseline C reactive protein levels resulted in a decreased placebo response and pronounced differences in clinical benefit. Two grade 3 adverse events were reported and were considered to be related to CD. One death (during sleep) and one serious adverse event (an elective hospitalisation) occurred, both considered unrelated. CONCLUSION: Treating active CD with fontolizumab was well tolerated and resulted in increased rates of clinical response and remission compared with placeb...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the safety of fontolizumab, a humanised <b>anti-interferon</b> gamma <b>antibody,</b> in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty five patients with a CD activity index (CDAI) of 250 - 450 were randomised in a double blind, placebo controlled, dose escalating fashion to receive single doses of fontolizumab (0. 1, 1. 0, and 4. 0 mg/kg) or placebo. By day 29, patients with clinical response were re-randomised to receive three additional doses of one half their initial fontolizumab dose or placebo at four weekly intervals. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes included assessments of immunogenicity, clinical activity, and potential pharmacodynamic surrogates. RESULTS: Treatment was generally well tolerated. There were slightly more reports of chills, flu-like syndrome, asthenia, nausea, and vomiting in the 1. 0 mg and 4. 0 mg/kg fontolizumab cohorts. Two serious adverse events rated as worsening of CD occurred under fontolizumab. Antibodies to fontolizumab were confirmed in one patient. No differences in clinical activity parameters were noted between any of the active treatment groups and placebo, with the placebo group having a particularly favourable outcome (60 % response and 40 % remission). By day 29, a more enhanced decrease in median Crohn's disease endoscopic index of severity (p = 0. 02) and serum C reactive protein (p< 0. 001) was observed in the 4. 0 mg/kg (n = 14) fontolizumab cohort compared with placebo (n = 10). Pharmacodynamic effects were observed by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: Fontolizumab was well tolerated with minimal immunogenicity at doses of up to 4. 0 mg/kg in patients with CD.

40|$|Even though <b>anti-interferon</b> beta (IFNβ) <b>antibodies</b> are {{the main}} {{determinants}} of IFNβ bioactivity loss and Myxovirus-resistance protein A (MxA) is the most established marker of IFNβ biological activity in IFNβ-treated multiple sclerosis patients, their usefulness in the routine clinical practice is still debated. Therefore, 118 multiple sclerosis patients naïve for treatment were enrolled for a 3 -year longitudinal observational study mimicking the conditions of a real-world setting. In order to evaluate the kinetics of bioactivity loss in blood samples obtained every 6 months after therapy initiation, MxA and interferon receptor isoform/subunit mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR, anti-IFNβ binding antibodies were detected by radioimmunoprecipitation, and neutralizing antibodies by cytopathic effect inhibition assay. Clinical measures of disease activity and disability progression were also obtained at all time points. We found that, at the individual-patient level, the response to IFNβ therapy was extremely heterogeneous, including patients with stable or transitory, early or late loss of IFNβ bioactivity, and patients with samples lacking MxA mRNA induction in spite of absence of antibodies. No interferon receptor isoform alterations that could explain these findings were found. At the group level, none of these biological features correlated with the measures of clinical disease activity or progression. However, when MxA mRNA was evaluated not at the single time point as a dichotomic marker (induced vs. non-induced), but as the mean of its values measured over the 6 -to- 24 month period, the increasing average MxA predicted a decreasing risk of short-term disability progression, independently from the presence of relapses. Therefore, a more bioactive treatment, even if unable to suppress relapses, reduces their severity by an amount that is proportional to MxA levels. Together with its feasibility in the routine laboratory setting, these data warrant the quantification of MxA mRNA as a primary tool for a routine monitoring of IFNβ therapy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{full-length}} cDNA clone {{was constructed}} from the genome {{of the human}} parainfluenza type 2 virus (hPIV 2). First, Vero cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T 7 RNA polymerase, and then the plasmid encoding the antigenome sequence was transfected into Vero cells together with polymerase unit plasmids, NP, P, and L, which were under control of the T 7 polymerase promoter. Subsequently, the transfected cells were cocultured with fresh Vero cells. Rescue of recombinant hPIV 2 (rPIV 2) from cDNA clone was demonstrated by finding the introduced genetic tag. As an application of reverse genetics, we introduced one nucleotide change (UCU to ACU) to immediate downstream of the RNA-editing site of the V gene in the full-length hPIV 2 cDNA {{and were able to}} obtain infectious viruses [rPIV 2 V(−) ] from the cDNA. The rPIV 2 V(−) possessed a defective V protein that did not have the unique cysteine-rich domain in its carboxyl terminus (the V-protein-specific domain). The rPIV 2 V(−) showed no growth in CV- 1 and FL cells. Replication of the rPIV 2 V(−) in these cells, however, was partially recovered by adding <b>anti-interferon</b> (IFN) -β <b>antibody</b> into the culture medium, showing that the rPIV 2 V(−) is highly sensitive against IFN and that no growth of rPIV 2 V(−) in CV- 1 and FL cells is mainly due to its hypersensitivity to endogenously produced IFN. These findings indicate that the V-protein-specific domain of hPIV 2 is related to IFN resistance. On the other hand, the rPIV 2 V(−) efficiently replicated in Vero cells, which are known as a IFN-non-producers. However, the virus yields of rPIV 2 V(−) in Vero cells were 10 - to 100 -fold lower than those of control rPIV 2, although syntheses of the viral-specific proteins and their mRNAs in rPIV 2 V(−) -infected Vero cells were augmented up to 48 p. i. in comparison with those of rPIV 2. Furthermore, the rPIV 2 V(−) virions showed anomalous in size as compared with rPIV 2 virions. These results suggest that the V protein {{plays an important role in}} the hPIV 2 assembly, maturation, and morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{engineering}} {{is a powerful}} tool to modify proteins to generate novel and desired properties that could be applied in biotechnological, diagnostics and therapeutic areas. In this thesis, both rational design and library based engineering principles have been exploited to develop affinity proteins with desired traits. One study {{was focused on the}} use of site-directed mutagenesis to obtain variants of the staphylococcal protein A-derived 58 -residue immunoglobulin binding Z domain with improved affinity for mouse IgG 1 Fc. Screening of ca. 170 constructed variants revealed one variant with a single F 5 I amino acid substitution, denoted ZF 5 I, with a ten-fold higher affinity. The Fc binding ZF 5 I variant was further investigated for use in affinity-driven site-specific covalent photoconjugation to mIgG 1 monoclonal antibodies. Here, nine candidate positions in the domain were investigated for introduction of a UV-activatable maleimide benzophenone (MBP) group via conjugation to an introduced cysteine residue. The best photo-conjugation results were obtained for a variant in which the MBP was introduced at position 32, denoted ZF 5 I-Q 32 C-MBP, which could be conjugated at high yields to all nineteen mouse IgG 1 s tested. The use of a biotinylated Z-based probe for biotinylation via photoconjugation of a monoclonal <b>anti-interferon</b> gamma <b>antibody</b> resulted in a higher antigen binding activity than if a conventional amine directed biotinylation strategy was used. In a second study, the goal was to develop a new homogeneous immunoassay for quick antigen detection, based on split-protein complementation and pairs of antigen recognizing proteins. In one of the formats investigated, separate fragments of a split-beta-lactamase enzyme reporter were genetically linked to ZF 5 I-Q 32 C-MBP units which were individually photo-conjugated to two different mAbs recognizing different epitopes on a human interferon gamma model target analyte. Simultaneous binding of the two mAb-enzyme half probes to the analyte resulted in an analyte concentration-dependent enzyme fragment complementation which could be spectrophotometrically detected using a nitrocefin substrate. Using ribosome display technology, Z-domain based binders to mouse IgG 1 were selected from an affibody library. One binder denoted Zmab 25 was shown capable of selective binding to mouse IgG in a background of bovine IgG, and could be used for species-selective recovery of monoclonal antibodies from complex samples, resembling hybridoma culture supernatants. Epitope mapping experiments showed that that the binding site on mouse IgG was located in the Fab fragment and was overlapping with that of streptococcal protein G. In a final study, phage display technology was used to select affibodies binding to human interleukin 6 (IL- 6), for potential use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy via blocking of the signaling involving the ternary complex between IL- 6, the IL- 6 receptor α (IL- 6 R α) and the gp 130 co-receptor. Several affibodies were shown to be capable of blocking the interaction between gp 130 and preformed complexes of IL- 6 and soluble IL- 6 R α (IL- 6 /sIL- 6 R α) in vitro, corresponding to the so-called trans-signaling interaction. One of these affibody variants denoted ZIL- 6 _ 13 showed a KD of approx. 500 pM for IL- 6 and was genetically fused to different chain ends of the monoclonal anti-TNF antibody adalimumab to build bi-specific “AffiMab” constructs. One construct, ZIL- 6 _ 13 -HCAda,in which the affibody was fused to the N-terminus of the adalimumab heavy chain had the most optimal properties in different cell assays and was also evaluated in vivo in an acute serum amyloid A (SAA) mouse RA model, involving a dual challenge of animals with both IL- 6 and TNF. Compared to adalimumab that could only reduce SAA levels to 50 % at the highest dose, the bi-functional AffiMab reduced SAA levels to below the detection level.   QC 20150416 </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fatigue is {{a common}} and {{potentially}} distressing symptom for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with no accepted evidence-based management guidelines. Evidence suggests that biologic interventions improve symptoms and signs in RA as well as reducing joint damage. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of biologic interventions on fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases up to 1 April 2014 : Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Current Controlled Trials Register, the National Research Register Archive, The UKCRN Portfolio Database, AMED, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Social Science Citation Index, Web of Science, and Dissertation Abstracts International. In addition, we checked the reference lists of articles identified for inclusion for additional studies and contacted key authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials if they evaluated a biologic intervention in people with rheumatoid arthritis and had self reported fatigue as an outcome measure. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, we pooled data in meta-analyses using a random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 32 studies for inclusion in this current review. Twenty studies evaluated five anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) biologic agents (adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab), and 12 studies focused on five non-anti-TNF biologic agents (abatacept, canakinumab, rituximab, tocilizumab and an <b>anti-interferon</b> gamma monoclonal <b>antibody).</b> All {{but two of the}} studies were double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials. In some trials, patients could receive concomitant disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These studies added either biologics or placebo to DMARDs. Investigators did not change the dose of the latter from baseline. In total, these studies included 9946 participants in the intervention groups and 4682 participants in the control groups. Overall, quality of randomised controlled trials was moderate with a low to unclear risk of bias in the reporting of the outcome of fatigue. We downgraded the quality of the studies from high to moderate because of potential reporting bias (studies included post hoc analyses favouring reporting of positive result and did not always include all randomised individuals). Some studies recruited only participants with early disease. The studies used five different instruments to assess fatigue in these studies: the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Domain (FACIT-F), Short Form- 36 Vitality Domain (SF- 36 VT), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0 to 100 or 0 to 10) and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). We calculated standard mean differences for pooled data in meta-analyses. Overall treatment by biologic agents led to statistically significant reduction in fatigue with a standardised mean difference of - 0. 43 (95...|$|R
