50|$|The {{chasuble}} took Mabel {{about two}} years to finish. As she was finishing her work in 1241, pearls and gold were ordered for her use in decorating the robe. Upon completion, the King commanded an appraisal be made, by knowledgeable people, {{for the value of}} the finished work as well as an <b>appropriate</b> <b>fee</b> for Mabelâ€™s work. The King was very insistent that Mabel be paid fairly with a generous sum. Considering that she was an artisan and he a medieval king, it is remarkable how much attention Henry put to this matter and how much respect he treated Mabel with. She must have truly been uniquely talented in her craft. The King even ordered that she be given the remnants of all precious materials used for the creation of the chasuble.|$|E

5000|$|The {{degree of}} {{strictness}} of border controls {{depends on the}} country and the border concerned. In some countries, controls may be targeted at the traveler's national origin or other countries that have been visited. Others may need to be certain the traveler has paid the <b>appropriate</b> <b>fees</b> for their visas and has future travel planned out of the country. Yet others may concentrate on the contents of the travelers baggage, and imported goods to ensure nothing is being carried that might bring a biosecurity risk into the country.|$|R
5000|$|The Los Angeles Metro ExpressLanes HOT system {{requires}} {{vehicles to}} be fitted with manually [...] "switchable" [...] transponders where the driver selects {{the number of}} occupants, based on which the <b>appropriate</b> <b>fee</b> is charged. California Highway Patrol officers have in-vehicle devices which display the declared occupancy of a vehicle, which they can verify visually and cite any driver(s) with fewer occupants than declared (and tolled for). The new system proved itself to be highly effective in reducing the rate of lane-use violations, with it falling to 40-50% of the violation rates of other comparable CA highways, from more than 20-25% (nearly {{one out of four}} or five) to just 10% (one in ten). Other transportation officials in California took note of this, subsequently leading to the Bay Area officials of Alameda County to adopt a similar system for the (then) planned Interstate 580.|$|E
50|$|The binding {{regulation}} {{as stated}} in Â§ 31 IV UrhG made the concession of rights of use for yet unknown types and the legal obligations resulting therefrom ineffective and it limited the rights of use down to only the types of use known at that time. It was intended that the author should be protected to the best possible extent against an unlimited exploitation of their rights due to types of use {{which could not be}} foreseen at the time of conclusion of the contract. The author could, however, decide whether or not they agreed to have their work exploited regarding a type of use not yet known at the time of conclusion of the contract and if so, by whom. It was intended that the countervalue of granting rights of use for new types of use should always be secured for the author; they should be in the position of negotiating an <b>appropriate</b> <b>fee</b> arrangement.It is decisive that the type of use is not only specified by its technical possibilities but also by its economical importance and usability. It is also decisive, inter alia, whether a large audience is targeted, whether separate distribution structures are created or whether the range of economic exploitation can be significantly expanded. A type of use needs to be sufficiently known to have established itself in a market at a fixed price. It could be that a new technique differs clearly from an established one creating a new kind of use. Furthermore, {{it is also possible that}} a technically known but economically not yet relevant kind of use could be part of a contract if specifically named and explicitly agreed upon between the parties. According to jurisdiction, contracts on yet unknown types of use (representing a so-called business of risk) are only effective if such a type is specifically named, explicitly discussed and agreed upon in the contract; never does this form a part of the general terms and conditions.As kinds of independent and formerly not yet known types of use exploitation on e. g. narrow-gauge film, on video and via video on demand are all recognised by the legislator.|$|E

Both parts have the same objectives but are typically addressed by separate management systems. Office management involves the allocation and financing of resources, principally premises, trained staff and computer systems, and on establishing and charging <b>appropriate</b> <b>fees</b> for the services rendered. Project management focuses on timescales, developing a design from initial concept to working drawings, and managing the construction process (see for example Emmitt, 2014).|$|R
