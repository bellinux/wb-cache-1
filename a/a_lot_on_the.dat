5|$|In late 1869, Earp courted 20-year-old Urilla Sutherland (c. 1849–1870), the {{daughter}} of William and Permelia Sutherland, who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar. They were married by his father Nicholas in Lamar on January 10, 1870, and in August 1870, Wyatt bought <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of town for $50, where he built a house. Urilla was pregnant and about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold the lot and a house on it for $75. Hoping to keep the office {{to which he had}} been appointed, he ran against his elder half-brother Newton for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race.|$|E

[...] That same year, the studio was less successful {{in its efforts to}} promote Open Your Eyes, a tract on the dangers of venereal disease that featured Jack Warner's sole screen appearance. During this period, the studio earned few profits; and in 1920, the Warners secured a bank loan to settle outstanding debts. Shortly thereafter, the Warners relocated their production studio from Culver City, California, to Hollywood, where they purchased <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner of Sunset Boulevard and Bronson Avenue, known today as Sunset Bronson Studios.

They have an energy, and urgency, and serious metal crunch to them that will make any rocker sit up and pay attention." [...] Chad Bower of About.com noted that Free [...] "isn't one of those metal albums that hypes you up and makes you want to break stuff. It's one where you have to sit back, throw on the headphones, and appreciate the complexity and musicianship." [...] Olav Björnsen of Prog4you.com stated that [...] "layers upon layers of electronic sounds, that fill out the soundscapes of the songs, create nuances and subtle moods as well as walls of sound and tension."

500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Richie Unterberger, Tommy was hailed by contemporary critics as the Who's breakthrough, but its critical standing diminished {{slightly in the}} subsequent decades, because of its occasionally pretentious concept and flimsy songs that functioned as devices to [...] "advance the rather sketchy plot." [...] Christgau wrote in 1983, [...] "Tommys operatic pretensions were so transparent that for years it seemed safe to guess that Townshend's musical ideas would never catch up with his lyrics." [...] In his review for AllMusic, Unterberger said that, despite its slight flaws, the album has [...] "many excellent songs" [...] permeated with [...] "a suitably powerful grace", while Townshend's ability to devise a lengthy narrative introduced [...] "new possibilities to rock music." [...] Uncut wrote that the album [...] "doesn't quite realise its ambitions, though it achieves <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way", and felt {{it was not as}} well developed as their later album, Quadrophenia. Mark Kemp, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), felt that [...] "in retrospect, Tommy isn't quite the masterpiece it was originally hyped to be", suggesting The Who Sell Out was better, though because of Townshend, it produced several [...] "bona fide classic songs".|$|E
500|$|Matsuhara, {{who came}} up with the concept of the phone trigger system, stated that he {{initially}} wanted to incorporate the player's own mobile phone into the system. However, the idea was abandoned due to concerns that it might clash with Japan's privacy laws. When asked if the phone trigger system would be used in a possible sequel to the game, Hayashi stated that he hoped this would not be the case and recalled saying [...] "who thought of this system!" [...] while writing the contents of the text messages. While Shitakura did not directly contribute to the script itself, Hayashi stated that Shitakura helped with the overall plot and provided assistance with the second half of the story. In particular, Shitakura helped <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> time traveling aspects of the story. Hayashi stated that while he did not want the script to repeat the same text over and over again, it was ultimately unavoidable due to the player having to travel back in time so he tried to place emphasis on the overall tempo of the plot's development and how the plot unfolded. With regards to the theme of time traveling, Hayashi had felt that it seemed like a topic that was overdone and expressed concern over it when he first heard the idea from Shikura.|$|E

500|$|The Hay–Adams Hotel {{may also}} be host to the ghost of Marian [...] "Clover" [...] Hooper Adams. She was the wife of Henry Brooks Adams, the celebrated 19th-century American journalist, historian, {{academic}} and novelist who was the grandson of John Quincy Adams. She married Henry Adams on June 27, 1872, and in 1877 the couple moved to Washington, D.C., and rented the Slidell House at 1607 H Street NW. Their home became a salon for the capital's literati and politically powerful. In 1881, the Adamses purchased <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northwest corner of 16th Street NW and H Street NW on Lafayette Square, and with their friend John Hay began building the famous Hay-Adams Houses—two of the most architecturally important private residences ever built in the city. Marian Adams' beloved father, to whom she was exceptionally close, died on April 13, 1885, and she sank into a deep depression. Just months before she was to occupy her spacious and luxurious new home, Adams committed suicide on December 6, 1885, by swallowing potassium cyanide. To mark her grave in Rock Creek Cemetery, Henry Adams commissioned sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and architect Stanford White to create the haunting Adams Memorial with its hooded, robed, androgynous figure formally titled Mystery of the Hereafter and The Peace of God that Passeth Understanding (but which is commonly called Grief). The Hay-Adams Houses were razed in 1927 by real estate developer Harry Wardman, and the Hay-Adams Hotel built on the site. Although Marian Adams never {{lived in the house}} where the Hay-Adams Hotel is today, some hotel staff say her specter haunts the site. Housekeepers and other staff have reported being hugged by an invisible presence as well as hearing a woman sobbing. Other mysterious occurrences attributed to the Adams specter include locked doors opening and closing, clock radios turning on and off, and a woman's voice whispering, [...] "What do you want?" [...] A few witnesses say the ghost is accompanied by the scent of mimosa, Adams' favorite scent. The incidents are located primarily on the hotel's fourth floor, and occur usually during {{the first two weeks of}} December (near the anniversary of Marian Adams' death).|$|E
