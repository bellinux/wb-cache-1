5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} titles, Ninja Gaiden III received mostly positive reviews from critics. Early reviews praised the game for its plot, gameplay, and difficulty; later reviews criticized it for that plot being overly outlandish, inconsistent level designs, and the game's difficulty level, in which the North American version was intentionally made harder than the Japanese version through limited continues, stronger enemies, and omission of a password system. The Atari Lynx port, while receiving general praise for graphics <b>and</b> <b>controls,</b> received poor reception for its sound and for the inability for players to see characters and items, attributing it to the Lynx's small screen.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2014. The game was {{directed}} by Mark Pacini, written by Joseph Staten and conceptualized by Keiji Inafune. Mega Man and Metroid were significant influences in its creation. The development was divided between Armature Studio and Comcept into their own distinctive proficiencies, while Asobo Studio assisted. ReCore received mixed reviews, the most critical of which noted insufficient design choices, technical issues regarding lengthy and unsuccessful loading screens – later redressed – and repetitive combat. Praise was overall focused on the story, platforming <b>and</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|E

Specific technologies emerging in the micro-guidance <b>and</b> <b>control</b> field will be examined.

30|$|Wide area {{protection}} <b>and</b> <b>control</b> collects the measurement, <b>control</b> <b>and</b> protection information of each substation and sends out commands through the substation {{area protection}} <b>and</b> <b>control</b> device.

Local area protection function is realized without depending on substation area and wide area protection <b>and</b> <b>control</b> systems, but executes necessary information exchange. Local area bay protection, substation area protection, and wide area protection <b>and</b> <b>control</b> are combined organically {{to form a}} complete hierarchical protection <b>and</b> <b>control</b> system, which not only guarantees the independence, reliability, and quick operation of bay protection, but also uses substation area and wide area protection <b>and</b> <b>control</b> {{to solve the problems}} of relay protection for traditional substations, and improve protection performance <b>and</b> <b>control</b> capability of system security and stability.|$|R

5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death <b>and</b> <b>controls</b> the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission <b>and</b> <b>controls</b> neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
5|$|Hughes Aircraft would {{continue}} {{the development of}} the advanced fire control system and the GAR-9 missile. Development of the F-108 radar and missiles was continued by the USAF and the system was eventually used in the Lockheed YF-12 program.

5|$|IGN {{said that}} the {{difference}} between character classes such as Thief and Jew were disappointingly minimal, offering little variety or incentive to replay as another class. IGN also said some missions and side quests were tedious, and were elevated by their setting rather than their quality, while the reviewer thought the environmental puzzles were a clever option for avoiding combat and were rare enough to be enjoyable when available. However, GameSpot said the puzzles felt scripted and simple. Reviewers said that many of the gameplay functions <b>and</b> <b>controls</b> were poorly explained, making them difficult to activate; others were critical of excessive loading times upon entering new locations and slow menus such as the Facebook panel.|$|E
