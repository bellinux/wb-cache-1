On leaving, Joshua Topolsky, former Editor-in-chief, is quoted having said, “We have been working on blogging technology that was developed in 2003, we haven’t made a hire since I started running the site, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could be more successful elsewhere”.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 19, 1976 on the South Fork of Long Island with {{the scene in}} which Alvy and Annie boil live lobsters; filming continued periodically {{for the next ten}} months, and deviated frequently from the screenplay. There was nothing written about Alvy's childhood home lying under a roller coaster, but when Allen was scouting locations in Brooklyn with Willis and art director Mel Bourne, he [...] "saw this roller-coaster, and... saw the house under it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>we</b> have to use this." [...] Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters a trove of cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.|$|E
500|$|Conservative media figure Glenn Beck (who {{joined the}} LDS Church in 1999) has alleged that President Barack Obama [...] "is {{going to bring}} us to the verge of {{shredding}} the Constitution, of massive socialism." [...] On November 14, 2008—following Obama's election—Beck appeared on Bill O'Reilly's show The O'Reilly Factor and said that [...] "we are {{at the place where}} the Constitution hangs in the balance, I feel the Constitution is hanging in the balance right now, hanging by a thread unless the good Americans wake up." [...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>we</b> are at the point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread." [...] Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring [...] "I believe our Constitution hangs by a thread." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2009, Spin writer Mark Prindle {{observed}} that the Ramones had to date [...] "inspired a jaw-dropping 48(at least!) full-length tribute records." [...] The first Ramones tribute album featuring multiple performers was released in 1991: [...] includes tracks by such acts as the Flesh Eaters, L7, Mojo Nixon, and Bad Religion. In 2001, Dee Dee made a guest appearance on one track of Ramones Maniacs, a multi-artist cover of the entire Ramones Mania compilation album. The Song Ramones the Same, which came out the following year, includes performances by the Dictators, {{who were part of}} the early New York punk scene, and Wayne Kramer, guitarist for the influential protopunk band MC5. , released in 2003, features performers such as Rancid, Green Day, Metallica, Kiss, the Offspring, Red Hot Chili Peppers, U2, and Rob Zombie (who also did the album cover artwork). Also some other famous bands recorded tribute songs. Motörhead's Phil Campbell tells in Jari-Pekka Laitio-Ramone's book Ramones: Soundtrack Of Our Lives: [...] "We did a cover of Rockaway Beach with me on backing vocals, which was quite enjoyable. When Johnny Ramone heard it, he refused {{to put it on the}} tribute album. Lemmy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> did a good version." ...|$|E
500|$|Television critics {{reacted with}} mixed {{reaction}} toward the episode, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "pretty dull." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of American Dad!, The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers that preceded the show, and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I don't {{have much to say}} about tonight's Family Guy. Last week, we had some comments about how Family Guy seems to be willing to play with its format this season. That didn't happen this week at all." [...] Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school, stating, [...] "Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating, if you're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent." [...] He concluded his review by praising [...] "the burning bush" [...] joke, and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating, the worst rating of the night. It was beaten by the American Dad! episode [...] "Fart-Break Hotel", The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta?", The Simpsons episode [...] "Flaming Moe", and the Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Crawl Space". In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its [...] "silly side jokes," [...] but felt disappointed by the ending to the show, commenting, [...] "it didn't follow any real logic [...] It was an easy way out, as if they'd written themselves into a corner." [...] Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags, writing, [...] "at least there were some funnier moments in this one. Unfortunately, a lot of those came in the cutaways. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were starting to move away from a dependence on them." [...] Hughes went on to comment that he felt confused by Stewie possibly being fathered by a porn star, adding that [...] "it would be far more likely that Chris or Meg was fathered by the porn star." ...|$|E

2500|$|There were {{plans in}} 1991 {{to bring back}} the {{original}} Death's Head, which would have featured the character on trial and facing the death penalty, and flashing back to how he'd got there. Early into production the new editor Paul Neary scrapped it and commissioned Death's Head II instead: replacing the character with a new version, created by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, and Liam Sharp. In an autumn 1992 interview with Comic World, Neary was dismissive about the original character and the aborted : [...] "I didn't like the pages that had been produced - I didn't think there was much future in Transformers-style robots <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could do an awful lot better." [...] He produced some sample sketches of how he wanted the character to look,and Liam Sharp's take gave the project [...] "a kickstart". Ironically, the success of Death's Head II meant Neary was ordered to create more titles and the easiest way was to reprint the original series ("The Incomplete Death's Head"); editor John Freeman had to talk him into it.|$|E

60|$|We {{realized}} our danger now and rowed, {{or rather}} paddled, furiously in our {{attempt to get}} out of the vortex.

Luckily I retained sufficient presence of mind to shout out, instantly setting the example by throwing myself into the bottom of the canoe, 'Down on your faces -- down!' and the others had the sense to take the hint.
