40|$|Various high {{molecular}} weight dialkylnitrosamines were prepared including, for the first time, methyl-n-octadecylnitrosamine and di-n-dodecylnitrosamine. The infrared, ultraviolet and mass spectra of a selection of these compounds were recorded and studied. Gel permeation chromatography {{was used for the}} isolation of individual nitrosamines in standard nitrosamine mixtures, while ion-exchange chromatography effected complete clean-up of amine-contaminated nitrosamine solutions. Thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatographic methods were developed for the detection, separation and <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> nanogram quantities of these lipophilic nitrosamines. In addition the above chromatographic systems were used for the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>distillates</b> <b>of</b> spiked wheat flour samples. High recoveries of dicyclopentylnitrosamine, di-n-heptylnitrosamine and di-n-octylnitrosamine, from the spiked wheat flour samples, were achieved using a specially developed freeze-drying/vacuum distillation technique, the distillates obtained being relatively free from major contaminants.

40|$|The present {{work was}} aimed at {{focusing}} the effects of two acidification treatments of grape pomace destined {{to the production of}} Grappa, during the storage period. The first is an acidification treatment, commonly adopted by the distilleries to limit bacterial proliferation, whereas the second is the inoculation with a selected yeast, chosen from a wide pool of isolates collected during previous experimentations. In the first case, non-treated grape marcs were compared with acidified grape marcs up to pH 2, 9. In order to evaluate the dynamics of the indigenous microorganisms, three different samplings were made during the storage period (T 0, after 15 days and at the end).

40|$|This report {{provides}} an <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> {{data collected from}} gas service providers and end-use customers in the six New England States and offers a preliminary assessment {{of the impact of}} interruptible gas customers on the distillate fuel oil market this past winter. Based on information collected and analyzed as of October 2000, the main findings areas follows: (1) For interruptible gas customers with distillate fuel oil as a backup fuel, their volume of interruptions was equivalent to about 1 to 2 percent of the total sales <b>of</b> <b>distillate</b> fuel oil in New England during January-February 2000. For the two peak weeks of gas supply interruptions, however, the equivalent volume <b>of</b> <b>distillate</b> fuel oil amounted to an estimated 3 to 6 percent of total sales in New England. There were no interruptions of the natural gas service during the 2 -month period. (2) Purchases <b>of</b> <b>distillate</b> fuel oil by interruptible gas customers may have contributed somewhat to the spike in the price <b>of</b> <b>distillate</b> fuel oil in January-February 2000, especially during the peak weeks of gas interruptions. Nevertheless, other factors [...] a sudden drop in temperatures, low regional stocks <b>of</b> <b>distillate</b> fuels, and weather-related supply problems during a period of high customer demand [...] appear to have {{played a significant role in}} this price spike, as they have in previous spikes. (3) While this preliminary analysis suggests that interruptible natural gas service does not threaten the stability of the home heating oil market, several steps might be taken-without undermining the benefits of interruptible service [...] to reduce the potential adverse impacts of gas supply interruptions in times of market stress. Regardless of the magnitude of the impact <b>of</b> <b>distillate</b> fuel oil purchases by interruptible gas customers on Northeast heating oil markets, the threat of future heating oil price spikes and supply problems still remains.

Samples of wines and samples <b>of</b> <b>distillates</b> made from these wines were analysed using liquid-liquid extraction method (LLE) followed by gas chromatography analysis (GC). Potential characteristics [...] chemical markers were determined: trans-linalool oxide and cislinalool oxide which are typical for Muscat Ottonel and tetradecanote, ethyl 3 - methylpentanoate for Pinot Blanc. In wine distillates, ethyl 2 -methylbutanoate, ethyl 3 - methylpentanoate, 1, 1 -diethoxybutane, diethoxypentane were determined, however none of these substances were found in wines. These substances probably originate {{as a result of}} esterification process during ageing <b>of</b> wine <b>distillates</b> after distillation process. Differences in chemical composition <b>of</b> wine <b>distillates</b> made from red wine grape cultivars were analysed using main component method. Group of substances such as ethyl butanoate, hexanoate, octanoate, decanoate, dodecanoate and diethyl succinate can be considered as possible markers identifying wine distillates from red wine grape cultivars and white grape cultivars. Characteristic aroma of grape variety was recognisable in wine distillates from Muscat Ottonell and Blue Frankish varieties. Samples of wine and wine distillates were analysed using Solid-phase micro extraction (SPME-headspace) technique followed by Gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GCMS). Negative correlation between 1 -hexanol content and intensity of aroma was discovered in wine <b>distillates.</b> Characteristic aroma <b>of</b> grape variety showed significantly in distillates from Pinot Gris (RS_ 2) and in distillates from red wine grape cultivars, particularly Saint Laurent (SV) and Pinot Noir. Based on <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> samples <b>of</b> wine <b>distillates</b> from red wine grape cultivars, ten major terpentic aromatic substances were determined (o-cymen, limonen, cis-b-ocimen, cislinalool oxid, linalool, isoborneol, terpinen- 4 -ol, a-terpineol, trans-sabinyl acetate a transkalamenen). All these substances influence aroma of grape variety. Both centred log ratio transform (clr) and main component method were applied and similarity in aroma <b>of</b> wine <b>distillates</b> was found and it was discovered that aroma <b>of</b> wine <b>distillate</b> from varieties Merlot, Pinot Noir and similar ones are influenced by terpenoids cis-linalool oxid, linalool, 94 isoborneol, terpinen- 4 -ol a a-terpineol.

40|$|Providing {{access to}} safe {{drinking}} water becomes increasingly difficult on a worldwide level. Various regions of the Mexican Highlands have issues of groundwater contamination {{in terms of inorganic}} (e. g. arsenic or fluoride) or bacteriological parameters, which are exceeding the es- tablished limits in the Norma Oficial Mexicana (Official Mexican Standard) (NOM) for drinking water. One of the affected areas is the Altiplano region in the federal state of San Luis Potosí. Most of the rural communities in the region {{do not have access to}} (adequate) technology for groundwater purification and thus their inhabitants are exposed to the elevated levels of con- tamination which are potentially the cause for diseases, such as the fluorosis. Due to the facts of marginalization and poverty it is vital to investigate towards decentralized and economical technologies which can be applied on a small-scale level. A low-cost and “low-tech” approach is necessary in order to provide the people with a technology which they can construct, oper- ate and maintain themselves. A promising approach is the technology of solar distillation for drinking water supply on domestic level, making use of the high regional potential of solar en- ergy. It is proven that this technology is capable of removing nearly any type of contaminants (inorganic and bacterial) from the raw water. The simplest and most durable form of imple- mentation is the passive shallow-basin, single-slope solar still. The mayor drawback consists in its low daily output of drinking water (about two to five liters per square meter of insolated area). In the scope of the thesis, so-called passive energy augmentation measures are applied to the aforementioned design, in order to raise the distillate output to an adequate level for the drinking water supply of a small family of four members with a demand of approximately eight liters per day (considering the amount of pure ingestion). A prototype unit of the passive solar still is built and its parameters <b>of</b> <b>distillate</b> output, energy efficiency and construction costs are determined, considering two different configurations. An additional <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>distillate</b> quality is made. The first configuration of the prototype is mainly characterized by a low water level in the evaporation basin and raw water pre-heating, whereas the second configuration adds reflective side- and rear wall coating inside the distillation chamber. Furthermore, a prototype of an active solar still is designed, incorporating an additional energy source (solar air collector) for higher process temperatures and therefore augmentation <b>of</b> the daily <b>distillate</b> yield. The emphasis in construction was put on the use of local, economical and recycled materials as far as possible, in order to lower the costs, attain a high reproducibility and to facilitate the possi- bility of autonomous self-construction in rural areas [...] ...|$|R
