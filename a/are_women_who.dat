25|$|Socioeconomic {{status of}} mothers likely has a larger {{influence}} on breastfeeding adherence than race or ethnicity, {{as many women}} {{who are members of}} groups with low breastfeeding rates also have a low socioeconomic status. Among women born in the United States, women who are wealthier are more likely to breastfeed. In addition, employment can influence the decision to breastfeed. When either parent was unemployed or held a lower-status occupation (such as labor or sales), their children were more likely to never have been breastfed. In addition, women with public insurance or with no health insurance are more likely to never have breastfed their children, as <b>are</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> receive WIC.|$|E

As {{citizens}} of a post-war nation, some Kosovar (or Kosovan) women have become participants {{in the process of}} peace-building and establishing pro-gender equality in Kosovo's rehabilitation process. Women in Kosovo have also become active in politics and law enforcement in the Republic of Kosovo. An example of which is the election of Atifete Jahjaga as the fourth President of Kosovo, and as such she became the first female, the first non-partisan candidate, and the youngest to be elected {{to the office of the}} presidency in the country. Before becoming president, she served as Deputy Director of the Kosovo Police, holding the rank of Major general, the highest among women in Southeastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|According to Armenian lore, there <b>are</b> <b>women</b> <b>who,</b> in {{consequence}} of deadly sins, are condemned to spend {{seven years in}} wolf form. In a typical account, a condemned woman is visited by a wolfskin-toting spirit, who orders her to wear the skin, which causes her to acquire frightful cravings for human flesh soon after. With her better nature overcome, the she-wolf devours each of her own children, then her relatives' children in order of relationship, and finally the children of strangers. She wanders only at night, with doors and locks springing open at her approach. When morning arrives, she reverts to human form and removes her wolfskin. The transformation is generally said to be involuntary, but there are alternate versions involving voluntary metamorphosis, where the women can transform at will.|$|E
25|$|The {{longitudinal}} study Excess Mortality from Suicide and other External Causes of Death Among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants (2007), reported {{that women who}} sought breast implants are almost 3.0 {{times as likely to}} commit suicide as <b>are</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> have not sought breast implants. Compared to the standard suicide-rate for women of the general populace, the suicide-rate for women with augmented breasts remained alike until 10-years post-implantation, yet it increased to 4.5 times greater at the 11-year mark, and so remained until the 19-year mark, when it increased to 6.0 times greater at 20-years post-implantation. Moreover, additional to the suicide-risk, women with breast implants also faced a trebled death risk from alcoholism and drugs abuse (prescription and recreational). Although seven studies have statistically connected a woman's undergoing a breast augmentation procedure to a greater suicide-rate, the research indicates that augmenation surgery does not increase the suicide death-rate; and that, in the first instance, it is the psychopathologically-inclined woman who is likelier to undergo breast augmentation.|$|E

25|$|A drag queen is a person, usually male, who {{dresses in}} {{clothing}} {{of the opposite}} sex and often acts with exaggerated femininity and in feminine gender roles for the purpose of entertainment or fashion. Often, they will exaggerate certain characteristics such as make-up and eyelashes for comic, dramatic, or satirical effect. While drag is very much associated with gay men and gay culture, there are drag artists of all sexualities. There are many kinds of drag artists and they vary greatly in dedication, from professionals who have starred in films to people who just try it once, or those who simply prefer clothing and makeup that is usually worn by the opposite sex in their culture. Drag queens can vary widely by class and culture. Other drag performers include drag kings, women who perform in male roles and attire, faux queens, who <b>are</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> dress in an exaggerated style to emulate drag queens, and faux kings, who are men who dress to impersonate drag kings.|$|E

25|$|Nouns used attributively {{to qualify}} other nouns are {{generally}} in the singular, even though for example, a dog catcher catches {{more than one}} dog, and a department store {{has more than one}} department. This is true even for some binary nouns where the singular form is not found in isolation, such as a trouser mangle or the scissor kick. This is also true where the attribute noun is itself qualified with a number, such as a twenty-dollar bill, a ten-foot pole or a two-man tent. The plural is used for pluralia tantum nouns: a glasses case is for eyeglasses, while a glass case is made of glass (but compare eyeglass case); also an arms race versus arm wrestling. The plural may be used to emphasise the plurality of the attribute, especially in British English but very rarely in American English: a careers advisor, a languages expert. The plural is also more common with irregular plurals for various attributions: women killers <b>are</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> kill, whereas woman killers are those who kill women.|$|E

500|$|One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing criticisms in the Rights of Woman {{is against}} false and {{excessive}} sensibility, particularly in women.

In fact, {{not only do they}} do harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilization: these are not women who can refine civilization – these <b>are</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> will destroy it. But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other.
