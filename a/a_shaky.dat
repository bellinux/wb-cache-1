5|$|Steinitz {{returned}} to serious competitive chess in the Vienna 1882 chess tournament, {{which has been}} described as the strongest chess tournament of all time at that point. Despite <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> start he took equal first place with Szymon Winawer, ahead of James Mason, Zukertort, George Henry Mackenzie, Blackburne, Berthold Englisch, Paulsen and Mikhail Chigorin, and drew the play-off match.|$|E
5|$|Another {{derivative}} genre termed machinima verite, from cinéma vérité, {{seeks to}} add a documentary and additional realism to the machinima piece. L.M. Sabo's CATACLYSM achieves a machinima verite style through displaying and recapturing the machinima video with a low resolution black and white hand-held video camera to produce <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> camera effect. Other element of cinéma vérité, such as longer takes, sweeping camera transitions, and jump cuts may be included to complete the effect.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} two seasons with Chicago, Pierce posted records of just 14–7 and 10–9, but <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> bullpen contributed to his {{middling}} record; although he left {{the game with a}} lead in the sixth inning or later 15 times in those seasons, White Sox relievers failed to protect that lead seven times. Indeed, Pierce was seen to be the team's only consistently effective starter in 1960, picking up eight complete-game victories by mid-August. On June 20, 1961, Pierce broke Ed Walsh's White Sox record of 1,732 career strikeouts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{its early}} days the McIntyre mine was a {{nightmare}} of problems. It was remarked [...] "it is doubtful if any major mining corporation anywhere was ever established on <b>a</b> <b>shakier</b> foundation." [...] Mine manager Dick Ennis told how {{he ran to the}} bank with hot bullion bars to cover a payroll and how he disappeared underground to hide from creditors.|$|R

5|$|India had <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> {{start to}} the tournament. In their opening match against the Netherlands, they were bowled out for 204 runs. Although they won the game by 79 runs, the team was criticised for failing to bat out their 50 overs. After they were {{dismissed}} for 125 runs against Australia and lost the match by nine wickets, angry fans in India burned effigies of the players; Mohammad Kaif's house and Rahul Dravid's car were vandalised. India won all the remaining games of the stage—against Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Namibia and England.|$|E
5|$|The British {{held two}} major trials against the top German war criminals who had perpetrated crimes during the Italian campaign. For {{political}} reasons {{it was decided}} to hold the trials in Italy, but a request by Italy to allow an Italian judge to participate was denied on the grounds that Italy was not an Allied country. The trials were held under the Royal Warrant of 18 June 1945, thus under British Military Law. The decision put the trials on <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> legal basis, as foreign nationals were being tried for crimes against foreigners in a foreign country. The first trial, held in Rome, was of Mackensen and Mälzer for their part in the Ardeatine massacre. Both were sentenced to death on 30 November 1946.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes of}} the protagonist's college life were filmed at Keyes High school, near Secunderabad Junction railway station. A school wall was {{demolished}} and a gate was repaired for the film's opening scene. Raghuvaran was carried away during the shoot of few action sequences and slapped Brahmaji for nearly six times in a row. To avoid such issues {{in the case of}} murder scenes, Varma decided to complete few of them by using plain close-ups of the victims. Sudhakar's murder scene was filmed near Keesara in Ranga Reddy district. Gopala Reddy and Ellore placed a camera in a bag and ran behind him for <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> effect. In the cycle-chain scene in which Siva uses a cycle chain to fight with J. D., the hand pulling the chain was Ellore's; in the next shot, Nagarjuna is shown holding the chain. The scene in which Naresh is killed near his home was filmed in the streets of Vengala Rao Nagar. The cycle chase scenes were filmed in Somajiguda and the slums behind Yashoda Hospitals. The bus chase scene was shot in Yusufguda. The film's climax was filmed at the Swapnalok complex in Secunderabad, and Bhavani's suicide was filmed on a set at Venus Studios in Chennai.|$|E

25|$|In the opener, Florida {{was off to}} <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> start, but {{was able}} to defeat the 45-point underdog Houston Cougars 4521. The defense was suspect, {{surrendering}} 421 total yards to a Cougar team which won a single game the year before.|$|E

25|$|Australian captain Michael Clarke won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. <b>A</b> <b>shaky</b> {{start in the}} opening, led to the fall of David Warner for 9. The shaky start from Australia {{continued}} when the other opener Finch fell for 24.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, Superman left Krypto in Superboy's care, {{saying that}} Smallville's open spaces were {{a better place}} for the dog, and that Superboy could use a friend (as shown in Teen Titans vol. 3, #7). Their {{relationship}} had <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> start, not helped by Krypto getting Superboy in trouble with the superheroine Starfire for destroying her alien garden.|$|E
25|$|The show's {{board of}} {{directors}} plan to run a short 10-week season rather than risk losing $25,000 a day in <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> post-war economy.

25|$|In 2004–05, after <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> {{performance}} in the Pool stage, Munster qualified as 5th seeds and played Biarritz away. The match was played at Real Sociedad's ground, the Anoeta Stadium, in San Sebastián, Spain – the first Heineken Cup game ever played in Spain. Biarritz won 19–10 to avenge a 38–29 defeat at the same stage in 2001. Munster {{finished second in the}} 2004–05 Celtic League season.|$|E

25|$|Summary: Tampa Bay {{wrapped up}} the preseason {{with a win}} against the Houston Texans by a score of 16–6. Josh Johnson and Chris Simms shared quarterback duties and Kenneth Darby led the team in rushing (55 yards). The {{highlight}} of scoring was rookie Dexter Jackson's 83-yard punt return touchdown. The Buccaneer defense sacked Houston once, and had one interception. Kicker Matt Bryant finished up <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> preseason kicking 3-out-of-5 field goals.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Ryan's Astros {{faced the}} New York Mets in the National League Championship Series. Ryan had <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> start in Game2, taking the loss. He {{returned}} in Game5, throwing 9 innings of 2-hit, 1-run, 12-strikeout ball, {{but one of}} those hits was a Darryl Strawberry home run which tied the game at 1–1, as Dwight Gooden matched Ryan pitch for pitch. Ryan got a no-decision as his Astros lost in 12 innings.|$|E
25|$|As {{the flow}} of goods, services, investment, capital, and skilled labour between {{countries}} is liberalised with the ASEAN Economic Integration in 2015, the need arises for ASEAN banking institutions to accommodate and expand their services to a greater intra-ASEAN market. While the ASEAN financial integration {{is not going to}} take effect until 2020, experts from the financial services industry have already forecast <b>a</b> <b>shaky</b> economic transition, especially for smaller players in the banking and financial services industry.|$|E

5000|$|Economist Mark Zandi {{described}} {{moral hazard}} as a {{root cause of}} the subprime mortgage crisis. He wrote: [...] "...the risks inherent in mortgage lending became so widely dispersed {{that no one was}} forced to worry about the quality of any single loan. <b>As</b> <b>shaky</b> mortgages were combined, diluting any problems into a larger pool, the incentive for responsibility was undermined." [...] He also wrote: [...] "Finance companies weren't subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks. Taxpayers weren't on the hook if they went belly up pre-crisis, only their shareholders and other creditors were. Finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible, even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards." ...|$|R
