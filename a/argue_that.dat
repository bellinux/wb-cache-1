5|$|Some {{critics and}} historians <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> one {{characteristic}} of the Silver Age was that science fiction and aliens replaced magic and gods. Others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> magic was {{an important element of}} both Golden Age and Silver Age characters. Many Golden Age writers and artists were science-fiction fans or professional science-fiction writers who incorporated SF elements into their comic-book stories. Science was a common explanation for the origin of heroes in the Silver Age.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{scholarly}} criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to be a Christian. Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did not describe Philip as a Christianand which, indeed, recorded him participating as pontifex maximus (chief priest) over the millennial Secular Games in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, Irfan Shahîd, and Warwick Ball, <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the ecclesiastic narratives are clear and dependable enough that Philip {{can be described as}} a Christian; still others, like Glen Bowersock, <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the sources are strong enough to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not strong enough to call him a Christian.|$|E
5|$|Although the Auburn Dam is now mostly {{considered}} history, {{there are}} still proponents and groups devoted to restarting the long-inactive project. Advocates <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the construction of Auburn {{would be the only}} solution for providing much-needed flood protection to the Sacramento area; that millions of dollars have already been spent making preparations; that it would provide an abundant supply of reliable water and hydroelectricity; and also that the recreational areas lost under the reservoir could be rebuilt around it. A major supporter of the revival of the dam is the Sacramento County Taxpayer's League; a recent survey revealed that up to two-thirds of Sacramento citizens support construction of the Auburn. They also <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the dam would only cost $2.6 billion instead of $6–10 billion, and that it is the cheapest alternative to provide flood control for the American River.|$|E

50|$|During the campaign, {{supporters}} of the draft constitution <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the constitution would provide stability. Most opponents <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the constitution was too favorable to the Muslim Brotherhood, and did not grant sufficient minority rights. However, some extreme Salafists also opposed the constitution, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> {{it should have been}} based more closely on Sharia law.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the issue}} of peace {{negotiations}} with the Taliban Naeem <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{certain parts of the}} Taliban want peace and could be compromised with. Sultanzoy <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Taliban was a tool of foreign intelligence agencies, and that in order to marginalize the Taliban the Afghan people needed to unite behind a unifying goal. Hilal <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Taliban was a diverse group, with certain members being driven by poverty, whilst others were [...] "agents of intelligence agencies." [...] Hilal <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the former parts could and should be negotiated with. Arsala <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> if the Taliban embraced politics, instead of violence, that they could be given a [...] "chair in the cabinet." ...|$|R

5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. Some <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other scholars <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> variation among circuits allows local courts {{to experiment with}} new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disparity}} with the Principate, Jones and Elton <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> 4th-century remuneration was attractive {{compared to the}} hard reality of existence at subsistence level that most recruits' peasant families had to endure.

25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{have criticized}} Objectivist ethics. The philosopher Robert Nozick <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Rand's foundational argument in ethics is unsound {{because it does}} not explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and having no values. He <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is, therefore, an instance of begging the question. Nozick also <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Rand's solution to David Hume's famous is-ought problem is unsatisfactory. In response, the philosophers Douglas B. Rasmussen and Douglas Den Uyl have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Nozick misstated Rand's case.|$|R
50|$|In the {{subsequent}} socialist calculation debates, a dichotomy between socialists emerged {{between those who}} <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> socialization entailed the end of monetary valuation and capital markets, and those who <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> monetary prices could be used within a socialized economy. A further distinction arose between market socialists who <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> social ownership can be achieved {{within the context of}} a market economy, where worker-owned or publicly owned enterprises maximized profit, and those who <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> socially owned enterprises operate according to other criteria, like marginal cost pricing.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the recent}} successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has {{remained}} controversial. Proponents <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the zoos {{have not only}} aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small captive breeding group. Opponents of the captive breeding program <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the losses are too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats. In October 2015 Harapan, the last rhino in the Western Hemisphere, left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E

His public lectures on hadith were subsequently cancelled in late 1985, and his book was banned in Malaysia.|$|R
5000|$|Sultanzoy also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{corruption}} was {{resulting in}} poverty, and that increases in pensions and salaries could be afforded through {{a reduction in}} corruption. Arsala also focused {{on the issue of}} corruption, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> [...] "government administration overall must be reformed." [...] Hilal advocated reducing corruption through a mixture of better policing and the digitizing of government records. Naeem <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> corruption was a major issue for the Afghan bureaucracy, and had increased over the past 12 years.

5|$|Margunn Bjørnholt and Ailsa McKay <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other {{as well as the}} planet.|$|E
5|$|One {{avenue for}} {{non-compliance}} {{is the black}} market. FairTax supporters state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing a sales tax, supporters <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.|$|E
