500|$|... "On <b>a</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Like</b> This" [...] {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} most music critics.

While likening the recording to the track [...] "Groovejet" [...] by Spiller and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, a reviewer from British tabloid NME felt the comparison [...] "works because it doesn't revolve awkwardly round a random disco beat".|$|E

500|$|Similarly, Hunter Felt from PopMatters {{enjoyed the}} song, but felt {{disappointed}} by Parlophone {{and the public}} for not releasing the single in the United States, commenting [...] "'On <b>a</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Like</b> This', a track that is meant to go right to {{number one on the}} Billboard Club Tracks list and while being completely ignored by the general public." [...] In a review of Minogue's greatest hits album, The Best of Kylie Minogue (2012) by PopMatters' Matt James, he described [...] "On <b>a</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Like</b> This" [...] as a [...] "bedroom-eyed nightclubber", further adding it was [...] "still hot enough to melt large glaciers." [...] An editor from NME, Stevie Chick, believed that Minogue lacked genuine [...] "passion" [...] throughout the song and labelled it [...] "unremarkable". Billboards Jason Lipshutz felt it was [...] "more propulsive, with an even more enjoyable bridge" [...] than previous single [...] "Spinning Around".|$|E
500|$|The single {{performed}} moderately around Europe and Australasia. [...] "On <b>a</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Like</b> This" [...] entered at number39 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, {{and reached}} its peak position at 34 the following week; this resulted in marking one of Minogue's lowest-charting singles in that region, with it spending a total of nine weeks within the top50.

Scott Kara from the New Zealand Herald highlighted the track {{as one of}} the two standouts on the album, and praised its composition; he called it a [...] "sweeping and grand serenade". Similarly, Digital Spy's Robert Copsey selected the track {{as one of the}} better cuts and commended how the orchestral quality allowed to emphasise the lyrical content more than the original. Jeff Katz from the American music website Idolator was very positive, stating [...] "Many of the cuts—including 'On <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Like</b> This,' 'Finer Feelings' and 'Conﬁde In Me' — sound ready for placement in a Bond ﬁlm. Driving drums and suspenseful strings breathe new life into the old favorites." [...] Philip Matusavage from MusicOMH enjoyed the [...] "re-invented" [...] and [...] "advertous" [...] track, and selected it as a [...] "confident" [...] highlight from the album. To promote the single, Minogue performed the orchestral version as part of the BBC Proms in the Park London 2012 in December.|$|E

Annie Zaleski from The A.V. Club described the composition as a [...] "brassy R torch song thanks to a soaring gospel choir and dramatic strings". Writing for The Guardian, Caroline Sullivan noted the track to [...] " [...] the teenage-crush fervour of the original into a cool, big-band seduction". To promote the track, Minogue's label Parlophone distributed a CD single in the United Kingdom on 17 December 2012, which featured the re-worked recording and its instrumental version.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} visual artist Nick Egan, which paid homage to the 1970s culture and figures.

500|$|Musically, [...] "On <b>a</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Like</b> This" [...] is a dance {{song that}} {{incorporates}} elements of disco in its instrumentation, {{as described by}} Nick Levine from Digital Spy and radio station Pandora. Minogue recorded the track at Dreamhouse Studios in London, United Kingdom during early 2000, and it was mixed by Mark Taylor and Graham Stack. A staff member of Pandora Radio commented the recording's instrumentation as consisting of string sections, acoustic guitars, keyboards and synthesisers managed by Taylor and Stack; the pre-chorus and chorus sections feature background vocals. According to the sheet music published by Universal Music, the song is written in the key of C minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 130 beats per minute. Minogue's vocals span from B♭3 to C5, whilst the recording has a sequence of Cm-B♭-Fm7-B♭-Cm-B♭-FM7-B♭-Cm-B♭/C-Fm7/C-B♭/C in the verses, and Cm-B♭/C-A♭-B♭ in the chorus as its chord progression. Lyrically, [...] "On <b>a</b> <b>Night</b> <b>Like</b> This" [...] focuses on a person enjoying unique experiences on night time, but also approaches themes of relationships and love. According to New Zealand Heralds Scott Kara, the composition is [...] "a swirling, late night club pop tune." [...] A reviewer from British tabloid NME compared the [...] "disco" [...] sound to the 2000 track [...] "Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)" [...] by Spiller, and {{to the work of}} English recording artist Sophie Ellis-Bextor. Philip Matusavage, writing for MusicOMH, argued that the song included musical influences of europop.|$|E

[...] Media reports then quoted Gerrard as saying he wished to leave Liverpool, citing events that had occurred in the month after the Champions League victory as the reason. On 6 July, however, Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry released a statement confirming that Gerrard would remain at the club, and Gerrard signed a new four-year contract on 8 July.|$|E
