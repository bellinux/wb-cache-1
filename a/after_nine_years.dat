5|$|Cool World marked Bakshi's {{return to}} feature films <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years.</b> The film was {{originally}} pitched as an animated horror film about an underground cartoonist who fathers an illegitimate half-real/half-cartoon daughter, who hates herself {{for what she}} is and tries to kill him. During production, Bakshi's original screenplay was scrapped by producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. and heavily rewritten by Michael Grais and Mark Victor in secret. Reviews praised the film's visuals, but criticized the story and characters, {{as well as the}} combination of live-action and animation, which some critics felt was unconvincing. The film would eventually gross only half its production budget.|$|E

5|$|Early {{on in the}} 1923 season, Coveleski pitched 27 {{straight}} scoreless innings, winning {{three consecutive}} games during that time. However, he won less frequently as the season wore on, losing three straight games in mid-August. His last game came on August 15, with over a month left in the season. Coveleski finished {{the season with a}} 13–14 record, his first season with a losing record. Despite that, he had an ERA of 2.76 and five shutouts, both of which led the AL. In 1924, Coveleski struggled, {{and at the end of}} May, he had four losses and an ERA of 6.49. By the end of the season, he had a 15–16 record and a 4.04 ERA. In December 1924, <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> pitching for Cleveland, Coveleski was traded to the Washington Senators for pitcher By Speece and outfielder Carr Smith.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> in {{his senior}} {{position}} at Triplex, and 27 {{years at the}} company, Horne accepted the position of {{managing director of the}} British Industries Fair, a government-backed organisation promoting British goods worldwide; he took up his position in July 1955. Much of the work involved liaising with foreign buyers and delegations, and he accompanied the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on visits to the annual fair. In 1956 the government withdrew its funding and the BIF closed. Horne received several attractive job offers, and chose the post of chairman and managing director of the toy manufacturers Chad Valley, where he was a success. In September that year he and Murdoch appeared in a one-off television programme Show for the Telly.|$|E

5|$|Scholar-officials {{who entered}} civil service through {{examinations}} acted as executive officials {{to a much}} larger body of non-ranked personnel called lesser functionaries. They outnumbered officials by four to one; Charles Hucker estimates that they were {{perhaps as many as}} 100,000 throughout the empire. These lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies. Yet they {{should not be confused with}} lowly lictors, runners, and bearers; lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank. The one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries.|$|E
5|$|The split and, due to {{the open}} letter's allegations, Turunen's {{character}} {{became the subject of}} close media coverage. Turunen responded through an open letter on her website and through some interviews in which she explained her view. She was upset that <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> of working together, Holopainen announced the separation via an open letter. Because of the continuing media interest, Marcelo Cabuli posted a message addressing the situation on the website in February 2006. He asked that anyone who had questions should email him. In June 2006, Cabuli posted a lengthy reply to many of the questions he had received. He answered questions related to the greed accusation by explaining that the band had agreed on the distribution of earnings in a contract at the formation of Nightwish. Based on that contract, every band member got a fixed share of 20% of the band's income. Marcelo Cabuli stated that, unlike others, Turunen had never fought for additional songwriter royalties.|$|E
5|$|Transfer {{activity}} continued {{after the}} season began. Inside forward Jack Lane was brought in from Cradley Heath in December 1920, followed by defender John Pearson from the same club two months later. Winger George Douglas was signed from Leicester City in February 1921. Thomas Jackson, who had made only one first-team appearance for Burnley, left the club in January 1921 to sign for Scottish side Dundee. Two players who had been signed {{at the beginning of}} the season left Burnley in April 1921; Bob McGrory moved to Stoke City on a free transfer and Frank Birchenough was released after playing two league matches. Bert Freeman left Burnley at the end of the season <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> service, by which time he had become the club's all-time leading goalscorer.|$|E

5|$|While {{talking to}} the camera, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reveal that Jim was offered an {{entrepreneurial}} sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because {{it would not be}} good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years,</b> the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting will happen to the Halperts in a long time.|$|E
5|$|CT was {{involved}} in a criminal investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the mid-1990s of Ed's Transmission, a transmission shop in Everett used by the agency for bus parts. Detectives from the FBI and Snohomish County Sheriff seized records from both parties and began a two-month audit of Community Transit management. The auditors released a report that criticized the management style of Executive Director Ken Graska and his department heads, leading to the former's resignation in December 1993 <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> at his position. Federal prosecutors accused Ralph Woodall, the 50-year-old co-owner of the shop, of 15 counts of mail fraud after intentionally overbilling for transmission repairs. Community Transit Maintenance Director Michael Lynn resigned after confessing that he had accepted gifts from Woodall in exchange for sending all of CT's transmissions to Ed's Transmissions without going through competitive bidding. A U.S. District Court jury found Woodall guilty of 15 counts of mail fraud in December 1996, with Judge John C. Coughenour sentencing him to 2.5 years in federal prison the following May, along with Ed's Transmission being forced to pay a $825,000 settlement after a civil suit was filed.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 off-season, Lemaire {{once again}} retired and was {{replaced}} by former Florida Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer. DeBoer's new system helped develop a strong offense, which had seven 40-point scorers by the season's end and broke an NHL record for the best regular season penalty kill since before the Expansion Era. Four players – Kovalchuk, Elias, David Clarkson and newly named captain Zach Parise – scored 30 or more goals, with Kovalchuk and Elias also finishing the season among the NHL's top ten-point scorers. Rookie forward Adam Henrique totaled 51 points and earned a Calder Trophy nomination for rookie of the year. As the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Devils defeated Southeast champions Florida before overcoming both divisional rivals, the Flyers and Rangers, to win the Conference and return to the Finals <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years.</b> Facing the Los Angeles Kings in the Finals, the Devils lost the first three games, but won the next two while facing elimination.

5|$|Parslow {{returned}} to fitness ahead of 2014–15, but {{having failed to}} regain {{his place in the}} team signed for Conference Premier club Grimsby Town on a one-month loan on 18 September 2014. He debuted two days later in their 1–0 away win over Kidderminster, and made seven appearances for Grimsby before the loan expired on 20 October 2014. Having been an unused substitute for three matches after returning to York, Parslow rejoined Grimsby on loan until 4 January 2015 on 7 November 2014, and made his second debut for the club a day later in a 3–1 home defeat to Oxford in the FA Cup first round. The loan was extended {{until the end of the}} season during January 2015. He came on as a 74th-minute substitute for Gregor Robertson in the 2015 Conference Premier play-off Final against Bristol Rovers at Wembley on 17 May 2015; following a 1–1 draw after extra time, Grimsby lost 5–3 in a penalty shoot-out. Parslow had made 23 appearances in his second loan spell at Grimsby, and after returning to York was released <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> at the club.|$|E
5|$|Clough was {{appointed}} as manager at Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 November 1973, with Taylor joining as his assistant. Just after the pair were appointed, the team lost 4–0 {{at home to}} Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8–2 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December. Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973–74 season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division, and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter Grummitt, Andy Rollings, Ian Mellor, Steve Govier, and Ken Goodewe; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however, and {{spent too much time}} away on media commitments. Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974, but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well, and so the partnership ended <b>after</b> <b>nine</b> <b>years</b> as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager. He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton, but admitted that both he and Clough were much more effective as a duo; he felt that he had struggled to make the good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager. He stayed on at the South coast club for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in 1975–76, missing promotion by two points. His successor, Alan Mullery, managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976–77 and then into the top-flight in 1978–79.|$|E
