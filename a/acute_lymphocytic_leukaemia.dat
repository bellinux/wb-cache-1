40|$|In {{a variety}} of adult and {{childhood}} leukaemia cell samples collected at different states of the disease, we analysed {{in a series of}} sequentially performed slot-blot or Northern-blot hybridisation experiments the expression of genes possibly involved in multiple drug resistance (MDR) (mdr 1 /P-glycoprotein, DNA topoisomerase II, glutathione-S-transferase pi), and the expression of the DNA topoisomerase I and histone 3. 1 genes. Occasionally, P-glycoprotein gene expression was additionally examined by indirect immunocytofluorescence using the monoclonal antibody C 219. No significant difference in mdr 1 /P-glycoprotein mRNA levels between primary and relapsed state <b>acute</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (ALL) was seen on average. Second or third relapses, however, showed a distinct tendency to an elevated expression of this multidrug transporter gene (up to 10 -fold) in part well beyond the value seen in the moderately cross-resistant T-lymphoblastoid CCRF-CEM subline CCRF VCR 100. Increased mdr 1 /P-glycoprotein mRNA levels were also found in relapsed state acute myelogenous leukaemias (AML), and in chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (CLL) treated with chlorambucil and/or prednisone for several years. Topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II mRNA levels were found to be very variable. Whereas in all but one case of CLL topoisomerase II mRNA was not detected by slot-blot hybridizations, strong topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II gene expression levels, frequently exceeding the levels monitored in the CCRF-CEM cell line, were seen in many cell samples of acute leukaemia. If topoisomerase II mRNA was undetectable, expression of topoisomerase I was clearly visible throughout. These observations might be valuable considering the possible treatment with specific topoisomerase I or topoisomerase II inhibitors. Significant positive correlations were found (i) for topoisomerase I and histone 3. 1 gene expression levels in general (P less than 0. 001), and (ii) in the CLL samples additionally for the expression levels of the mdr 1 gene, and the histone 3. 1, topoisomerase I, and glutathione-S-transferase pi genes, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Ras-assocation family (RASSF) of tumour {{suppressor}} genes (TSGs) contains 10 {{members that}} encode proteins containing Ras-assocation (RA) domains. Several {{members of the}} RASSF family are frequently epigenetically inactivated in cancer, however, their role in leukaemia has remained largely uninvestigated. Also, RASSF 10 is a predicted gene yet to be experimentally verified. Here we cloned, characterised and demonstrated expression of RASSF 10 in normal human bone marrow. We also determined the methylation status of CpG islands associated with RASSF 1 – 10 {{in a series of}} childhood <b>acute</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (ALL) and normal blood and bone marrow samples. Results COBRA and bisulphite sequencing revealed RASSF 6 and RASSF 10 were the only RASSF members with a high frequency of leukaemia-specific methylation. RASSF 6 was methylated in 94 % (48 / 51) B-ALL and 41 % (12 / 29) T-ALL, whilst RASSF 10 was methylated in 16 % (8 / 51) B-ALL and 88 % (23 / 26) T-ALL. RASSF 6 and RASSF 10 expression inversely correlated with methylation which was restored by treatment with 5 -aza- 2 'deoxycytidine (5 azaDC). Conclusion This study shows the hypermethylation profile of RASSF genes in leukaemias is distinct from that of solid tumours and represents the first report of inactivation of RASSF 6 or RASSF 10 in cancer. These data show epigenetic inactivation of the candidate TSGs RASSF 6 and RASSF 10 is an extremely frequent event in the pathogenesis of childhood leukaemia. This study also warrants further investigation of the newly identified RASSF member RASSF 10 and its potential role in leukaemia. </p...|$|R

The result was that myeloid cells had about twice the polarization value of lymphocytic cells. The use of FDA for the determination of IFP appears to be useful for differential diagnosis, at least between <b>acute</b> myelogenous and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemias.</b> These 2 types of leukaemia also showed a pronounced difference in fluorescence intensity when treated with FDA, perhaps owing to a difference in uptake velocity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lipid profiles in plasma and in primary leukaemia cells isolated from patients with <b>acute</b> or chronic <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (ALL and CLL) were studied. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Decreased levels of HDL-C were observed in plasma of leukaemic patients, levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides and phospholipids were unchanged or only slightly increased. As compared to normal lymphocytes, freshly isolated leukaemic cells showed increased levels of cholesterol esters and reduction in free cholesterol. Growth stimulation of ALL and CLL cells with phytohemagglutinin led to further increase in levels of cholesterol esters. Conversely, treatment with an inhibitor of cell proliferation such as the mTOR inhibitor, RAD, caused decline in population growth rate of leukaemia cells, which was preceded by sharp reduction in rate of cholesterol esterification.

Anaphylaxis to Asnase occurred in 8 patients after the second course and one other had transient Asnase-induced diabetes. All patients received central-nervous-system prophylaxis after achieving remission, during which they were also treated with weekly vincristine and a 2 -week course of prednisolone.

A total of 30 consecutive children with <b>acute</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (ALL) were treated from June 1971 until December 1974.

Then the liver, spleen, and kidney were irradiated and 6 -mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate were administered during the maintenance phase. Pulsed doses of vincristine and prednisone were administered at 10 - to 12 -week intervals. The patients were subdivided into two groups based on their initial white blood cell (WBC) counts: a standard risk group with an initial WBC count of less than 25 000 /mm 3 (25 X 10 (9) / 1) and a high risk group with an initial WBC count greater than 25 000 /mm 3 (25 X 10 (9) / 1).
