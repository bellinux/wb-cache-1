5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by <b>an</b> <b>authority</b> from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by <b>an</b> <b>authority.</b> Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E
