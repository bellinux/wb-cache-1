40|$|The {{surface of}} <b>alloyed</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> was {{subjected}} to thermochemical modification by nitrocarburizing and nitriding with or without postoxidation {{in order to improve}} its mechanical properties, corrosion, and wear resistance. Treated samples were characterized by testing their basic properties (compound layer thickness, nitriding, nitrocarburizing depth, and surface hardness) according to standards. Detailed estimation of the modified metal surface was performed by additional testing: X-ray diffraction, microstructure, surface roughness and topography, and wear and corrosion resistance. The surface layer obtained after nitrocarburizing treatment consists mainly of ε-Fe 2 - 3 (N,C) and γ'-Fe 4 (N,C); similarly, the nitrided surface is formed by ε-Fe 2 - 3 N and γ'-Fe 4 N iron nitrides. The surface layer after postoxidation contains additionally Fe 3 O 4. The results obtained show that nitrocarburization, nitridation, and postoxidation result in better mechanical, wear, and corrosion resistance of 42 CrMo 4 steel, and postoxidized sample properties are influenced by surface morphology...|$|E

The wear tests were undertaken in a laboratory at SSAB in Oxelösund with a newly designed wear test machine. The wear performance was evaluated by abrasive material clinkers and slag in Room temperature as well as High temperature at 400 °C. Eight samples are used for each test, the samples are placed inside the drum with sample holders. The wear test performed by 217 mm diameter drum rotate over the two-horizontal bar at 37 RPM, thus creating sliding, rolling and some impact over the surface of the materials. Investigations were performed by weight measurements of the samples, hardness measurements at room temperature, after the 400 °C test, and at high temperatures up to 400 °C, and light optical microscopy examinations. The results show that wear rate at Room temperature depends on hardness of material and hardness of abrasive material.

This leads to poor formability of warm rolled and annealed sheet [1, 2].

The final density of the sintered P/M parts plays {{a vital role in}} determining the component properties and characteristics. In the present study, an attempt has been made to investigate the dry sliding wear characteristics of sintered/hot extruded P/M alloy steels with Fe- 1 % C as base material, W (Tungsten) and Ti (Titanium) as alloying elements. The wear behavior of the sintered/hot extruded performs were studied under dry sliding conditions on pin-on- disc (ASTM G 99) arrangement against EN 38 steel disc of hardness HRC 60 with a constant sliding speed of 2 m/s and at a normal load of 30, 50 and 70 N respectively. The microstructure and wear regime of extruded P/M steels has been systematically characterized to understand the structure-property relationships using both optical microscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM).

40|$|Metal hollow sphere {{structures}} (MHS) feature excellent {{properties for}} functional applications [1]. But, since their mechanical properties {{are still too}} weak for an use in lightweight constructions. Automotive industry demands {{a significant increase in}} strength and a decrease of density. In the present work, a study on the increase in the strength of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> hollow spheres by additional heat treatment was conducted. Such additional heat treatments for improving the steel properties are quite usual. But, in contrast to the hardening of bulk material, metal hollow spheres show an extreme low thermal conductivity and high internal surfaces. Thus, the additional heat treatment of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> hollow spheres gives rise to three main challenges, which are closely related. First the carbon content must be adjusted at an amount of 0. 6 - 0. 8 wt. -percent and this amount must be held without a loss during austenitisation. This carbon content is optimal for high strength combined with high ductility. The second challenge is how to avoid the oxidation. Metal Hollow spheres show high internal surfaces. Hence, oxidation is promoted. Since massive oxidation of the shells of the MHS will harm the mechanical properties, it can hide the effect of the increasing strength of the residual shell due to hardening. Oxidation can occur during austenitisation by the atmosphere, during cooling by water or air and after the process, due to remaining water between the MHS. The third challenge is the fast cooling of MHS. Low <b>alloyed</b> and unalloyed <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> requires fast cooling in order to obtain phase changes from austenite to martensite. On the one hand water as cooling fluid allows the maximal cooling rate due to its high heat capacity. On the other hand, cooling in water is challenging owing to the corrosiveness of remaining water. Furthermore, packages and structures of MHS are closed-cell foams with low thermal conductivity. This lowers the cooling rale in the centre of structure or packages. Consequently, incomplete phase transition may occur, causing a gradient in the strength of such structures. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R

The presence of (HMDTMPA) reduces remarkably the corrosion rate of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> in acidic solution. The effect of temperature on the corrosion behavior of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> was studied {{in the range of}} 298 – 328  K. Results clearly reveal that the (HMDTMPA) behaves as a mixed type corrosion inhibitor with the highest inhibition at 4  ×  10 − 3  M. The adsorption of HMDTMPA on the <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> surface obeys to the Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm. Surface analysis via scanning electron microscope (SEM) shows a significant improvement on the surface morphology of the <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> plate...|$|R
5|$|The <b>carbon</b> {{content of}} <b>steel</b> is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents {{higher than those of}} steel make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron <b>alloyed</b> with <b>carbon</b> is called <b>carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> alloy steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|R
