5|$|To {{termites}}, any {{breach of}} their tunnels or nests {{is a cause}} for alarm. When termites detect a potential breach, the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach. Additionally, an alarmed termite bumps into other termites which causes them to be alarmed <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> pheromone trails to the disturbed area, {{which is also a}} way to recruit extra workers.|$|E
5|$|In October, Diederichs {{planned to}} rotate his ships through repair {{facilities}} in the region for periodic maintenance; Prinzess Wilhelm was scheduled to dock in Shanghai. He requested permission to take Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser to Kiaochou for autumn gunnery training <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Prinzess Wilhelm stationed there during the winter, which was denied. Diederichs {{was able to make}} use of the murder of a pair of German priests on 6 November in Shangtung, however, to justify his move against Kiaochou. At the time, the only ships available for the attack were Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser. Cormoran joined the two ships after a few days, and by 10 November, the ships were ready. Prinzess Wilhelm left port on the 11th, to rendezvous with Kaiser and Cormoran at sea.|$|E

He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up {{becoming}} a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches the letter from Kate and tells her not to feel sorry for him <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted {{to examine the relationship}} between human resource practice, organisational support, social support, performance <b>and</b> intention <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> of teachers in South Africa. Three hundred teachers at different schools were invited to participate in this research. Using a quantitative research approach, six standardised questionnaires, including a Biographical Questionnaire, a Human Resource Practice Scale, Organisational Support Scale, Social Support Scale, Performance Scale <b>and</b> Intention <b>to</b> <b>Leave</b> Scale were used. The findings revealed that a positive practical significant relationship with a medium effect exists between human resource practices, organisational support <b>and</b> intention <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> but a negative practical significant relationship exists between human resource practices <b>and</b> intention <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> of teachers. Furthermore, a positive practical significant relationship with large effect was found between organisational support and social support, but a negative practical significant relationship with a medium effect exists between organisational support <b>and</b> intention <b>to</b> <b>leave...</b>|$|R

25|$|Sonnet 19 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare and is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the final sonnet of the initial procreation sequence. The sonnet addresses time directly with the instruction to destroy its own weapons <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Shakespeare's beloved, the fair youth, unscathed. The theme is redemption, through art, of time's inevitable decay.|$|E
25|$|At the Hampton Court Conference of 1604, he and Richard Bancroft implored King James {{to change}} {{nothing in the}} Church of England.

25|$|Council of Epaone in 517 {{witnesses}} {{to the rise of}} the practice of replacing severe canonical penances with a new milder penance: its 29th canon reduced to two years the penance that apostates were to undergo on their return to the Church, but obliged them to fast one day in three during those two years, to come to church and take their place at the penitents' door, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> with the catechumens. Any who objected to the new arrangement was to observe the much longer ancient penance.|$|E
25|$|The master {{theme is}} the {{alcoholism}} {{of a man}} who causes the downfall of his family. Helen Graham, the central character, gets married for love to Arthur Huntingdon, whom she soon discovers to be lecherous, violent, and alcoholic. She is forced to break with the conventions that keep her in the family home that has become hell, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> with her child to seek secret refuge in the old house of Wildfell Hall. When the alcohol causes her husband's ultimate decline, she returns to care for him in total abnegation until his death.|$|E

Emily had a visceral need {{of her home}} and the countryside that surrounded it, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it would cause her to languish and wither. Charlotte and Anne, being more realistic, did not hesitate in finding work and from April 1839 to December 1841 the two sisters had several posts as governesses. Not staying long with each family, their employment would last for some months or a single season. However, Anne did stay with the Robinsons in Thorp Green where things went well, from May 1840 to June 1845.|$|E

25|$|Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter {{and longer}} while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually for {{multiple}} times (2-3 typically). Steeping too hot or {{for too long}} results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew’s taste is also affected by the steeping technique. Two important techniques are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water as you drink the tea.|$|E
25|$|Growing up, Kooser {{attended}} Ames Public Schools {{for elementary}} and middle school. When Kooser arrived at Ames High School, his interest diverted from the library and went to cars. He joined the Nightcrawlers Car Club and became secretary of the group in 1956. His motivation for writing in high school can be in part credited {{to one of his}} teachers, Mary McNally, who encouraged him to continue writing essays and poems that reflected his life.

25|$|Lerman surmises {{that the}} Jewish sages {{at the time}} could argue for a {{determination}} {{of the position of}} their years in both cycles and could therefore compute the absolute year-count modulo 532 years. They were left with a number of options, 532 years apart from each other, and Lerman suggests that they chose the dating closest to what seemed to be the truth according to a literal interpretation of biblical accounts. The sages legally defined future equinox times by instituting the 28-year cycle, to protect the Hebrew dating against future change, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> a remembrance to what they had done.|$|E
25|$|A common {{defensive}} configuration is {{to leave}} the general at its starting position, deploy one advisor and one elephant on the two points {{directly in front of}} the general, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the other advisor and elephant in their starting positions, to the side of the general. In this setup, the advisor-elephant pairs support each other, and the general is immune from attacks by cannons. Losing any of the pieces makes the general vulnerable to cannon, and the setup may need to be abandoned. The defender may move advisors or elephants away from the general, or even sacrifice them intentionally, to ward off attack by a cannon.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th century, Springfield, Illinois was a rapidly growing {{industrial}} center, with the highest percentage of African-American residents of any comparably sized city in Illinois. It also had a high proportion of European immigrants who came for industrial jobs. Black people had been migrating north for work <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the social oppression of the South; in 1900 they numbered 2300 residents in Springfield, 6.5 percent of the town's population. Although Black people were generally kept to lower-class and unskilled jobs, and lived in segregated areas, social tensions arose from fierce job competition with the recent European immigrants for the lower grade jobs. Industries sometimes used Black workers as strikebreakers during labor strikes. Town residents worried about growing political power among Black people.|$|E
