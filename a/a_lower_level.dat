This result was explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample, and by practice having a higher influence on chess skill.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and {{isolated}} by development show <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations.

It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E

5|$|After leaving West Ham, Greaves put {{on weight}} and did not attend a match as either a player or a spectator for two years.

He later admitted that he was also regularly driving whilst drunk during this period. Seeking an answer to his alcoholism, Greaves decided to return to football at <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> where he would not be required to be as fit as he had been whilst playing in the Football League.

Another First Amendment case in public schools came up in 1998, when E.D. Mo. heard Beussink v. Woodland R-IV School District. Judge Rodney W. Sippel ruled that the school violated a student's rights by sanctioning him for material he posted on his website. This case has been widely cited in higher courts.|$|E
5|$|In {{his opinion}} {{all human beings}} have the same {{abilities}} with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations.

Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> of activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; {{the growth of the}} volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E

This {{was lower than}} the first Ace Attorney Investigations, which sold 172,000 copies during its opening week. The Japanese sales tracker Media Create theorized that {{this was due to}} Ace Attorney Investigations 2 having less TV {{commercials}} than the first game, and <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> of consumer recognition according to weekly recognition surveys. They also noted that marketing had been targeting women more than men, leading to an increased interest among women, but decreased interest both among men and overall.

When he was demobilised, he returned to England and made his peace with Surrey. He played a handful of games between 1919 and 1921 but faded out of first-class cricket to pursue a career in industry. In all first-class cricket, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at an average of 20.66.
