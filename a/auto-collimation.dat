40|$|A {{wide-range}} laser <b>auto-collimation</b> {{method to}} measure the surface profiles of targets with steep slopes has been proposed. This method employs a deflecting optical system to enlarge the measurement range of the angle sensor. However, this optical system also changes the sensitivity property of the angle sensor. Therefore, we propose a new in-situ self-calibration method that includes the geometrical designed data of the target and {{can be applied to}} wide-range laser <b>auto-collimation</b> method. In the proposed method, the calibration sensitivities at each measurement point are obtained with two sets of measured data, which are acquired before and after performing minute rotation or translation with respect to the measured target, and the simulated shift of the normal angle at each point.

40|$|Demands {{for long}} {{mechanical}} and optical parts which have high straightness or flatness are increasing. Examples {{are seen in}} a flat panel for liquid crystal display, a throttle die for thin film production and machine elements of semiconductor equipments. Although {{the length of the}} parts exceeds 1 m, the requirement for their figure accuracy is higher than 0. 1 mm. However, there is no useful method to evaluate precisely the figure accuracy of the long parts. The reasons are inevitable difficulties in manufacturing long tangible datum and prevention of deformation due to gravity and environment. Therefore, developing the ultra-precision measuring machine for long parts is an urgent need. A possible method for the purpose described above is differential laser <b>auto-collimation</b> (DLAC). The principle of figure measuring with DLAC is the accumulation of difference angle in inclination measured by laser <b>auto-collimation</b> between two points along a straight line on the surface to be measured. However, the figure accuracy measured by the method is influenced by the in alignment error of the devices in the measuring system. IN-SITU SELF CALIBRATION LASE...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of precision spherical positioner alignment techniques used today {{are based on}} procedures that were developed in the 1970 ’s around the use of precision levels and <b>auto-collimation</b> transits. Electrical alignment techniques based on the phase and amplitude of the antenna under test are also used, but place unwanted limitations on accurately characterizing an antenna’s electrical/mechanical boresight relationship. Both of these techniques can be very time consuming. The electrical technique requires operator interpretations of data obtained from amplitude and phase measurements. The <b>auto-collimation</b> technique requires operator interpretations of optically viewed measurement data. These results are therefore typically operator dependent and the resulting error quantification can be inaccurate. MI Technologies has recently developed a mechanical alignment technique for Spherical Near-Field antenna measurements using a tracking laser interferometer system. Once the laser system has been set-up and stabilized in the operational environment; the entire spherical near-field alignment may be completed in a few hours, {{as compared to the}} much more lengthy techniques used with level/transit or electrical techniques. This technique also simplifies the quantification of the errors due to the inaccuracy of the alignment. This paper will discuss the effect of the alignment error on results obtained from spherical near-field measurements, and the procedures MI Technologies developed using a tracking laser interferometer system to obtain the precision alignment needed for a spherical near-field measurement...|$|E

Dependence of refractive indices of DKDP on deuterium content show different {{trend in the}} infrared region as in uv-visible region. Dependence of n 2 (the square of refractive index) on the mole fraction of deuterium shows a difference between pure KDP and partially deuterated KDP.

40|$|Optical {{alignment}} machining is {{an effective}} method to ensure the co-axiality of optical system. The co-axiality accuracy is determined by optical-centering accuracy of single optical unit, which {{is determined by the}} rotating accuracy of lathe and the optical-centering judgment accuracy.

An axis-determination tool which is based on the principle of <b>auto-collimation</b> can be used to determine the only position of centerscope is designed. The only position is the position where the optical axis of centerscope is coincided with the rotating axis of the lathe. Also a new optical-centering judgment method is presented.

40|$|Periodic {{structures}} {{have a large}} {{influence on}} propagating waves. This holds for various types of waves over a large range of length scales: from electrons in atomic crystals 1 and light in photonic crystals 2 – 4 to acoustic waves in sonic crystals 5. The eigenstates of these waves are best described with a band structure, which represents {{the relation between the}} energy and the wavevector (k). This relation is usually not straightforward: owing to the imposed periodicity, bands are folded into every Brillouin zone, inducing splitting of bands and the appearance of bandgaps. As a result, exciting phenomena such as negative refraction 6, 7, <b>auto-collimation</b> ofwaves 8, 9 and lowgroup velocities 10 – 12 arise. k-space investigations of electronic eigenstates have already yielded new insights into the behaviour of electrons at surfaces and in novel materials 13 – 16.

40|$|A high-accuracy space smart payload {{integrated}} with attitude and position (SSPIAP) {{is a new}} type of optical remote sensor that can autonomously complete image positioning. Inner orientation parameters (IOPs) are a prerequisite for image position determination of an SSPIAP. The calibration of IOPs significantly influences the precision of image position determination of SSPIAPs. IOPs can be precisely measured and calibrated in a laboratory. However, they may drift to a significant degree because of vibrations during complicated launches and on-orbit functioning. Therefore, laboratory calibration methods are not suitable for on-orbit functioning. We propose an on-orbit self-calibration method for SSPIAPs. Our method is based on an auto-collimating dichroic filter combined with a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) point-source focal plane. A MEMS procedure is used to manufacture a light transceiver focal plane, which integrates with point light sources and a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor. A dichroic filter is used to fabricate an <b>auto-collimation</b> light reflection element.

The ARGO-M optical system consists of 40 cm receiving telescope, 10 cm transmitting telescope, and detecting optics. For the development of ARGO-M optical system, the structural analysis was performed {{with regard to the}} optics and optomechanics design and the optical components. To ensure the optical performance, the quality was tested at the level of parts using the laser interferometer and ultra-high-precision measuring instruments. The assembly and alignment of ARGO-M optical system were conducted at an <b>auto-collimation</b> facility. As the transmission and reception are separated in the ARGO-M optical system, the pointing alignment between the transmitting telescope and receiving telescope is critical for precise target pointing. Thus, the alignment using the ground target and the radiant point observation of transmitting laser beam was carried out, and the lines of sight for the two telescopes were aligned within the required pointing precision.

40|$|Photonic {{crystals}} are periodic dielectric structures, {{where the}} periodicity varies on the wavelength scale. Analogous to electrons in semiconductors, the photon propagation {{can be described}} using a band structure in which transmission bands are separated by bandgaps, energy ranges at which light cannot exist inside the photonic crystals. This analogy suggests that photonic crystals may be suitable to fabricate the components needed for integrated optics. As yet {{most of the research}} done on photonic crystals has been focussed on using these bandgaps. However, many novel properties of light propagating in the transmission bands may also serve this purpose. This thesis studies theoretically and experimentally the light propagation in two dimensional planar photonic crystals with the aim of creating new components for integrated optics. A theoretical model based on Fourier analysis of electromagnetic Bloch waves was developed to describe light propagation in photonic crystals. This model gives an intuitive understanding of the novel phenomena observed in the transmission bands of the photonic crystal: negative refraction, <b>auto-collimation</b> and super-dispersion. This new approach clarifies the fundamental physics of these phenomena enabling their advantages and disadvantages to be easily evaluated for new optical functions; particular attention is paid to <b>auto-collimation.</b> The influence of the structural properties of the photonic crystal (lattice type, filling factor, etc.) is also studied and has been used to create two integrated optic components: a light condenser and a wavelength demultiplexer. The theoretical predictions have been tested experimentally on two dimensional planar photonic crystals fabricated in heterostructure GaAs/AlxGa 1 -xAs. The fabrication of these photonic crystals was the first experimental work undertaken in this thesis. Advanced microfabrication techniques enabled the fabrication of planar photonic close to those of the state-of-the-art. The optical properties of the fabricated photonic crystals fabricated were studied using the internal light source technique. This method uses photoluminescence generated by quantum wells or quantum dots as an internal light source to probe the optical properties of the photonic crystals. Initially the experimental setup was designed to study the bandgaps. However after some modifications the transmission bands could also be investigated. Another experimental improvement made was the introduction of a technique using coupled waveguides which reduces the losses by a factor of 10 and allowed the light in the photonic crystals to be studied over long distances. Adding a spatially resolved vertical detection, enabled the analysis of the light diffracted out of the plane in order to measure the propagation losses and to map the electromagnetic field. These two modifications were used to study components for integrated optics based on photonic crystals: waveguides and auto-collimators...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{two-dimensional}} Maxwell-Bloch code COLAX {{has been}} used to optimize the geometrical parameters of the half-cavity in a neon-like Zn X-ray laser. The tuning of the mirror position and curvature is shown to be a crucial step in designing such an experimental setup, as it influences both the amplified intensity and the spatial coherence of the double-pass X-ray laser beam. 1. EXPERIMENTAL BACKGROUND The experiment (see Fig. 1) involves a 1. 06 pm laser-created plasma from solid targets, using a 2 cm long, 150 pm wide line focus with a gaussian 600 ps FWHM main pulse and several low-power prepulses. The X-ray laser uses the collisionally excited J = 0 - J = 1 line of Ne-like Zn with a 212 A wavelength, which is expected to undergo strong refraction in the plasma. A multilayered spherical X-ray mirror with a 13 cm cur-vature radius and 30 % reflectivity is located 9 mm away from the left end of the plasma. The <b>auto-collimation</b> angle is set at 7 mrad. The X-ray line is monitored by spectral, intensity and coherence diagnostics located 50 cm to the right end of the plasma. The geometrical properties of the radiation are deduced from the shadow of a cross-wire system located in the diagnostics region. The beam divergence measured is 2. 8 X 6 rnrad and the bulk deflection is 6. 3 mrad. The transverse coherence length, as estimated from the Fresnel diffraction patterns in the wire shadow, i...|$|E
40|$|Imaging at hard X-ray {{energies}} (~ 10 - 600 keV) {{over very}} large fields of view (~ 60 deg per telescope) {{is required to}} conduct a high sensitivity all-sky and all-time survey for black holes. The proposed Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) could achieve the high sensitivity required for the mission science objectives by scanning an array of widefield coded aperture telescopes with aperture mask holes radially aligned to minimize <b>auto-collimation</b> by the thick (~ 7 mm) masks required for high energy imaging. Simulation results from a preliminary design study are reported which quantify the improvement in off-axis imaging sensitivity vs. the conventional case with mask holes all perpendicular to the mask. Such masks can be readily constructed from a stacked laminate of thin (1 mm) laser-etched W sheets. An even more dramatic increase in coded aperture imaging sensitivity, and dynamic range, for a realistic telescope and imaging detector with typical systematic errors {{can be achieved by}} continuously scanning the field of view of the telescope over the source region to be imaged. Simulation results are reported for detectors with systematic errors 1 - 10 %, randomly distributed but unknown in each detector pixel. For the simplified case of a 1 -D coded aperture telescope scanning along its pattern, the systematics are removed identically. Results are also presented for the 2 -D case with both 1 -D and partial 2 -D scanning which demonstrate the feasibility of a coded aperture scanning telescope with systematic errors achieving nearly Poisson-limited sensitivity for signal/background ratios S/B ~ 10 ^- 4, in constrast to limits typically ~ 10 - 100 X worse that have been actually achieved by pointed or dithered coded aperture telescopes flown (or proposed) previously.

40|$|A {{new method}} {{to test a}} surface form of the convex high-aperture {{hyperbolic}} mirrors has been developed with the secondary mirror of a telescope «Millimetron» as an example. It was proposed to use the selfsame auxiliary spherical mirror relatively small in diameter for testing the inner central part and outer part of a hyperbolic mirror. To test {{the central part of}} a hyperbolic mirror, an aberration-free points method is offered. It uses the non-traditional ray path for the secondary mirror. As a result, the overall length of interferometer measurement branch optical system is significantly reduced. Working wave front is reflected trice from the auxiliary spherical mirror surface and twice from the hyperbolic mirror under test. Double interaction of the working wave front with tested surface increases sensitivity of optical testing. The feature of the working bundle ray path is that the rays fall towards the auxiliary mirror once perpendicular to the surface and twice at the arbitrary angles to the surface. As a result, the homocentricity of the ray bundle is violated, i. e. the spherical aberrations arise. To compensate aberrations, a Mangin mirror compensator is used. It is placed in the central non-working zone of a hyperbolic mirror. The outer part of hyperbolic mirror is tested using the selfsame auxiliary spherical mirror according to Hindle scheme in several stages with serial imposition of the auxiliary mirror until information about the whole surface is collected. The interferometer provides measurements recording the interferogram from each part of the surface of tested mirror. Then to obtain complete information about the mirror surface form the interferograms are united. The article presents calculation results of the optical systems for testing the hyperbolic secondary mirror of the radiotelescope «Millimetron», which has extremely high aperture. It has been shown that the auxiliary spherical mirror of 665 mm in diameter and with 500 mm radius of curvature provides testing of hyperbolic mirror of 492 mm in diameter with the aperture angle of an edge ray exceeding 90 degrees. The wave front aberration residuals of the interferometer measurement branch optical system with <b>auto-collimation</b> ray path make 0. 2 of He-Ne laser wavelength. </p...|$|E
