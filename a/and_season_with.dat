5|$|Linde {{made his}} major league debut with the Indians on September 11, 1947, which {{ended up being}} his only {{appearance}} of the season. In that one appearance, he pitched ⅔ of an inning and allowed two earned run, finishing the game <b>and</b> <b>season</b> <b>with</b> an ERA of 27.00. During the off-season, Linde played basketball with the Olo Soaps, a team located in his native Beaver Dam. He took part in spring training {{with the rest of}} the Indians roster for the 1948 Cleveland Indians season. In late March, however, he was struck on the chin from a line drive hit by Indians manager Lou Boudreau, causing him to be sidelined for several days. By the end of spring training, Linde remained a part of the Indians roster. He pitched three games for the Indians early on in 1948, pitching ten innings, allowing six earned runs and finishing the season with a 5.40 ERA. After three games, he was demoted to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. He spent the rest of the 1948 season as a starting pitcher for Baltimore.

I let my staff and escort ride ahead while I halted and, for an excuse, asked for a glass of water. I was invited at once to dismount and come in.

The host, however, was not pressing, so that I declined the invitation and, mounting my horse, rode on.|$|E

5000|$|The OED {{traces the}} word to the 15th century: various Latin vocabularies {{translate}} balducta, bedulta, or casius as [...] "poshet", [...] "poshoote", [...] "possyt", or [...] "possot". Russell's Boke of Nurture (c. 1460) lists various dishes and ingredients that [...] "close a mannes stomak", including [...] "þe possate". Posset is frequently used {{as a starting point}} for other recipes (e.g. [...] "Make a styf Poshote of Milke an Ale", and [...] "Take cowe Mylke, & set it ouer þe fyre, & þrow þer-on Saunderys, & make a styf poshotte of Ale", each of which is the first sentence of a longer recipe). Recipes for it appear in other 15th-century sources: boil milk, add either wine or ale [...] "and no salt", let it cool, gather the curds and discard the whey, <b>and</b> <b>season</b> <b>with</b> ginger, sugar, and possibly [...] "sweet wine" [...] and candied anise.|$|E
50|$|For 700 g of fish, finely chop {{an onion}} and saute it with oil, parsley, and two whole cloves of garlic. The moment the onion starts to brown, add 300 g of chopped from {{tomatoes}} or tomato paste, <b>and</b> <b>season</b> <b>with</b> salt and pepper. When the tomatoes are cooked, pour in one finger of strong vinegar or two fingers of weak vinegar, diluted {{in a large}} glass of water. Let boil {{for a few more}} minutes, then discard the garlic and strain the rest of the ingredients, pressing hard against the mesh. Put the strained sauce back on the fire along with whatever fish you may have on hand, including sole, red mullet, gurnard, dogfish, mantis shrimp, and other types of fish in season, leaving the small fish whole and cutting the big ones into small pieces. Taste for seasoning; but in any case it is not a bad idea to add a little olive oil, since the amount of soffritto was quite small. When the fish is cooked, the cacciucco is usually brought to the table on two separate platters: on one you place the fish, strained from the broth, and on the other you arrange enough finger-thick slices of bread to soak up all the broth.|$|E
