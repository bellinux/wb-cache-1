5|$|The rose petal's micro- and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the <b>adhesive</b> <b>force</b> between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high <b>adhesive</b> <b>force</b> with water.|$|E

500|$|When {{comparing}} the [...] "petal effect" [...] to the [...] "lotus effect", {{it is important}} to note some striking differences. The surface structure of the lotus leaf and the rose petal, as seen in Figure 9, can be used to explain the two different effects. The lotus petal has a randomly rough surface and low contact angle hysteresis, which means the water droplet is not able to wet the microstructure spaces between the spikes. This allows air to remain inside the texture, causing a heterogeneous surface composed of both air and solid. As a result, the <b>adhesive</b> <b>force</b> between the water and the solid surface is extremely low, allowing the water to roll off easily (i.e. [...] "self-cleaning" [...] phenomenon).|$|E

Conference theme - Innovative Systems Thinking: Unravelling Complexity for Successful Solutions. Micro-material handling and micro-assembly becomes increasingly important in largevolume manufacturing of products like sensors in automotive applications. Smaller dimensions of the micro-objects lead to problems {{with regard to the}} reliability of the manufacturing process because <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> become predominant over gravity for objects whose dimensions are in the micro-range. In contrast to the common approach of minimizing those <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces,</b> this paper focuses {{on the use of the}} three main <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces,</b> van-der-Waals, electrostatic and surface tension forces, as gripping principles. These forces are compared to conventional vacuum grippers with regard to gripping forces and complexity of application. Modelling of the forces is executed for separation distances in the range of 1 x 10 - 12 m - 1 x 10 - 3 m. Even though vacuum forces dominate in magnitude over others within the whole range, there are several disadvantages of using them. On the other hand <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> are advantageous in that they require little amount of energy and they do not mechanically strain the micro-parts being handled.

40|$|The present paper {{shows that}} atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) imaging of friction force and phase lag in ambient air {{can be used to}} characterize the chemical contrast induced by electron beam (EB) irradiation on polyethylene glycol oxide (PEO) surface. Time-of-flight secondary emission mass spectroscopy measurements showed that the EB irradiation generates chemical contrast on PEO surface by decreasing the ether bond density. The AFM measurements showed smaller phase lag and lower friction and <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> on the EB irradiated PEO surface, as compared to the non-irradiated PEO surface. While the chemical contrast in friction force had a linear dependence on the EB irradiation dose, the dependence of the chemical contrast in the phase lag was strongly non-linear. As the friction and <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> depended on the AFM probe hydrophilicity and air humidity, the contrast in friction and <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> is ascribed to different capillary condensation of ambient water vapour at the AFM tip contact with the EB irradiated and non-irradiated PEO surfaces, respectively.

40|$|Micro-material {{handling}} has challenges accompanying {{it because}} of <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces,</b> which make the picking and placing of micro-parts difficult. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> hinder the picking of a micro-part, and once picked, they pose even a greater challenge when attempts to release a micro-part are made. Van der Waals forces {{are part of the}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> and are always present between interacting surfaces in a micro-material handling operation. However, Van der Waals forces can profitably be manipulated in a micro-material handling operation. The paper reveals how the Van der Waals forces can be advantageously used in micro-material handling operations involving silver, copper and aluminium coatings of rms surface roughness values ranging from 0. 5 nm to 2. 72 nm, which are produced by the electron beam evaporation (e-beam) method. These were found to exert Van der Waals forces ranging from 17 nN to 314 nN, which can be used for reliable micro-material handling operations...|$|R

40|$|Highlights - New lattice-free {{stochastic}} model of collective cell migration with an arbitrary number of distinct interacting subpopulations - Infinite hierarchy of moment equations derived {{to describe the}} {{stochastic model}} - Mean field and moment dynamics approximations are used to mimic different kinds of monoculture and coculture cell biology experiments - Moment dynamics description is necessary when <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> are sufficiently strong - Mean field description is sufficient when <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> are sufficiently weak Abstract Cell migration within tissues involves the interaction of many cells from distinct subpopulations. In this work, we present a discrete model of collective cell migration where the motion of individual cells is driven by random forces, short range repulsion forces to mimic crowding, and longer range attraction forces to mimic adhesion. This discrete model {{can be used to}} simulate a population of cells that is composed of K ≥ 1 distinct subpopulations. To analyse the discrete model we formulate a hierarchy of moment equations that describe the spatial evolution of the density of agents, pairs of agents, triplets of agents, and so forth. To solve the hierarchy of moment equations we introduce two forms of closure: (i) the mean field approximation, which effectively assumes that the distributions of individual agents are independent; and (ii) a moment dynamics description that is based on the Kirkwood superposition approximation. The moment dynamics description provides an approximate way of incorporating spatial patterns, such as agent clustering, into the continuum description. Comparing the performance of the two continuum descriptions confirms that both perform well when <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> are sufficiently weak. In contrast, the moment dynamics description outperforms the mean field model when <b>adhesive</b> <b>forces</b> are sufficiently large. This is a first attempt to provide an accurate continuum description of a lattice-free, multi-species model of collective cell migration...|$|R

50|$|Due to an {{interplay of}} the forces of {{adhesion}} and surface tension, water exhibits capillary action whereby water rises into a narrow tube against the force of gravity.
