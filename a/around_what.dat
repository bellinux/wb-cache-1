5|$|Fleet Street was {{established}} as a thoroughfare in Roman London and {{there is evidence that}} a route led west from Ludgate by 200 AD. Local excavations revealed remains of a Roman amphitheatre near Ludgate on what was Fleet Prison, but other accounts suggest the area was too marshy for regular inhabitation by the Romans. The Saxons did not occupy the Roman city but established Lundenwic further west <b>around</b> <b>what</b> is now Aldwych and the Strand.|$|E
5|$|Glenn McCarthy was {{a modest}} oil worker who pioneered wells <b>around</b> <b>what</b> the Houston area. In 1932, he struck oil at Anahuac near the Galveston Bay. Over the next decade, he made {{dozens of other}} strikes and quickly became one of Texas' richest men. His extravagance was legendary leading to his {{becoming}} $52 million in debt in 1952 ($ in present-day terms). His love of bourbon led him to establish the WildCatter bourbon label. His excesses made him an unwilling national celebrity during the 1940s and 1950s as the media became enamored with tales of Texas oil wealth.|$|E
5|$|The castle's Norman stone fortifications {{were added}} {{possibly}} {{as early as}} the 1080s onwards, and were finished before 1115, based <b>around</b> <b>what</b> is now the inner bailey of the castle, forming a stone version of a ringwork. It had four towers and a gatehouse tower along the walls, with a ditch dug out of the rock along two sides, the excavated stone being reused for the building works, and would {{have been one of the}} very first masonry castles in England. With its circular design and grand entrance tower, it has been likened to the earlier Anglo-Saxon burgheat designs. In 1096, Roger was stripped of his lands after rebelling against William II and they were reassigned to Roger's brother, Hugh.|$|E
5000|$|Several law {{enforcement}} officers have commented on the Juggalo gang's tendency toward extreme violence. Arizona Department of Public Safety Detective Michelle Vasey has also expressed concern at the Juggalos high potential for violence, stating [...] "The weapons, they prefer, obviously, hatchets ...

5|$|The exposed geology of the Bryce Canyon area in Utah shows {{a record}} of {{deposition}} that covers {{the last part of}} the Cretaceous Period and the first half of the Cenozoic era in that part of North America. The ancient depositional environment of the region <b>around</b> <b>what</b> is now Bryce Canyon National Park varied from the warm shallow sea (called the Cretaceous Seaway) in which the Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited to the cool streams and lakes that contributed sediment to the colorful Claron Formation that dominates the park's amphitheaters.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Roman settlement <b>around</b> <b>what</b> is now Bond Street. In 1894, a culvert made from brick and stone was discovered in the area. The street was named after Sir Thomas Bond, {{the head of a}} syndicate of developers who purchased a Piccadilly mansion called Clarendon House from Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle in 1686, and proceeded to demolish the house and develop the area. At that time, the house backed onto open fields, known as Albemarle Ground, and the development of estates in Mayfair had just begun.|$|E
5|$|Until the 19th century Rivington was a rural village built <b>around</b> <b>what</b> is now {{the village}} green. Its {{inhabitants}} were employed in agriculture on scattered local farms, hand loom weaving in their own homes, working in the local quarries or the small coal mines on Winter Hill Coal mining was on a very small scale. Nicholas Fish, Brooker and Company had a coal pit on Wilders Moor that was mentioned on the 1869 and 1880 mines lists. in 1896 the Rivington Moor Colliery employed two workers mining coal from the Mountain coal seam for own or local use.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{there were}} a growing range of demands on the mounted police, and they {{struggled}} {{to cope with the}} changes. The rising population drove an increase in the criminal cases tackled by the force: less than 1,000 were investigated in 1900, but within four years the number of cases had risen to over 4,000. There was controversy <b>around</b> <b>what</b> role the mounted police should play in the new towns, and the force became concerned that these were pulling in police manpower, {{at the expense of the}} wider, less populated areas of the Prairies, where the patrolling system had already had to be cut back. A special railway branch was briefly established in 1888, using undercover officers positioned along the railway line to gather intelligence, and plans were put forward, but not enacted, to create a larger detective branch. Attempts were made to enforce the prostitution laws in the new towns – previously these had been largely ignored – with the police informally regulating the local sex industries.|$|E
5|$|The Bryce Canyon area shows {{a record}} of {{deposition}} that spans from {{the last part of}} the Cretaceous period and the first half of the Cenozoic era. The ancient depositional environment of the region <b>around</b> <b>what</b> is now the park varied. The Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm, shallow waters of the advancing and retreating Cretaceous Seaway (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders). The colorful Claron Formation, from which the park's delicate hoodoos are carved, was laid down as sediments in a system of cool streams and lakes that existed from 63 to about 40million years ago (from the Paleocene to the Eocene epochs). Different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and river deltas migrated.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{independence}} from Spain in 1821, the area {{became part of}} Mexico. Under Mexican rule, the mission system gradually ended, and its lands became privatized. In 1835, Englishman William Richardson erected the first independent homestead, near a boat anchorage <b>around</b> <b>what</b> is today Portsmouth Square. Together with Alcalde Francisco de Haro, he laid out a street plan for the expanded settlement, and the town, named Yerba Buena, began to attract American settlers. Commodore John D. Sloat claimed California for the United States on July 7, 1846, during the Mexican–American War, and Captain John B. Montgomery arrived to claim Yerba Buena two days later. Yerba Buena was renamed San Francisco on January 30 of the next year, and Mexico officially ceded the territory to the United States {{at the end of}} the war. Despite its attractive location as a port and naval base, San Francisco was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{discovery}} of gold-bearing reef in the Klerksdorp area in 1933 by the Anglo American Corporation encouraged geologists and others with vision to see the northwestern Free State as a potential gold field. Prospecting intensified and the first high values of gold were discovered in 1939. By 1940, sufficient work {{had been done to}} prove the existence of gold in the area and thirteen mining areas were later demarcated <b>around</b> <b>what</b> would become the town of Welkom.|$|E
