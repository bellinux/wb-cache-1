50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>skimmer</b> {{is found}} from Senegal to {{northern}} Congo River and southern Nile Valley, southern Tanzania to the Zambezi Valley, {{and then to}} KwaZulu-Natal Province (South Africa) and Angola. They live at large tropical rivers with sandbanks for nesting and roosting, lake shores, and coastal lagoons. The <b>African</b> <b>skimmer</b> is generally uncommon and the total populations is estimated at 15,000-25,000 individuals.|$|E

50|$|<b>African</b> <b>skimmers</b> are partial intra-African migrants, {{they arrive}} in {{southern}} Africa {{when the water}} level of rivers starts falling {{at the beginning of}} the dry season, i.e. April-June, returning northwards after breeding when rivers start rising again at the start of the rainy season in November-January.|$|R
5000|$|The river has {{a complex}} flow pattern. It flows in the {{westerly}} direction through [...] "Pandanus palm-braided channels". On the east, its flow is through rocky gorge {{with the entire}} river vanishing into [...] "slot canyons" [...] displaying broad sandy waterways. This is {{the location of the}} breeding colonies of globally threatened <b>African</b> <b>skimmers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>skimmer</b> (Rynchops flavirostris) is a near-threatened {{species of}} bird {{belonging}} to the skimmer genus Rynchops in the family Laridae. It is found along rivers, lakes and lagoons in Sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
50|$|The {{black skimmer}} of the Americas is larger {{with a black}} tip to the bill. The <b>African</b> <b>skimmer</b> is smaller with more black in the tail and no white collar. In older times the Indian skimmer was {{also known as the}} Indian scissors-bill.|$|E
50|$|Over 400 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} within the Zambezi National Park. Pel's fishing owl, <b>African</b> <b>skimmer,</b> collared palm thrush, lanner falcon, goliath heron, African finfoot, rock pratincole and long-toed lapwing {{are considered to be}} among the speciality birds of the park.|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>skimmers</b> fly {{in lines}} over calm waters, and dip their lower {{mandible}}s {{in the water}} to feed. When the mandible touches a fish, the skimmer snaps its mouth shut. They feed mostly at dawn and dusk and have good night vision. The following fish have been recorded as prey for African skimmers: Micralestes, Tilapia, Barbus, Marcusenius, Hepsetus, Aplocheilichthys and Petrocephalus.|$|R
5000|$|<b>African</b> <b>skimmers</b> {{have long}} wings, {{with a black}} back, hindneck, and crown. The {{forehead}} and {{rest of the body}} is white, with a bright, long, orange beak that ends with a yellow tip (black tip when immature). Their short forked tail is white, and their legs are bright red. The average size is about 38 cm long. Their voice is a sharp [...] "kip-kip". Their bill structure is unique; the lower mandible is much longer than the upper mandible, and is flattened sideways like scissor blades.|$|R
50|$|The {{probability}} of long-time isolation from other wetlands {{is suggested by}} a fish endemic to the lake, the Jipe tilapia. Jipe's waters are teeming with big fish, principally siluriforms and cyprinoids. Jipe forms a biodiversity rich ecosystem also known for the water birds that frequent its reedy shores; these include storks, egrets, pelicans, spur-winged plovers, ducks, and Egyptian geese. Lesser jacana and the purple gallinule are common on the lake despite being rare {{in other parts of}} Africa and Madagascar squacco heron, black heron, African darter and <b>African</b> <b>skimmers</b> are often seen. The vicinity of the lake is frequented by herds of game. Hippopotami and crocodiles are plentiful.|$|R
50|$|African skimmers nest {{in loose}} colonies on large sandbanks. The colonies {{typically}} consist {{of less than}} 50 pairs and each pair lays 2-3 (rarely 4) eggs in a scrape in the sand. Sometimes <b>African</b> <b>skimmer</b> colonies are mixed {{with those of other}} sand bank nesting birds such as collared pratincole, pied avocet and white-fronted plover.|$|E
50|$|Some birds {{more common}} to Turkana are the little stint, the wood sandpiper, {{and the common}} sandpiper. The <b>African</b> <b>skimmer</b> (Rhyncops flavirostris) nests in the banks of Central Island. The white-breasted {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax lucidus) ranges over the lake, as do many other waterbirds. The greater flamingo wades in its shallows. Heuglin's bustard (Neotis heuglinii) {{is found in the}} east of the lake region.|$|E
50|$|The Mahango Area and Kavango River {{in western}} Bwabwata {{are listed as}} an internationally Important Bird Area {{supporting}} globally threatened species and is an avian diversity hotspot. Species include black-winged pratincole, slaty egret, wattled crane, <b>African</b> <b>skimmer,</b> African pygmy-goose, coppery-tailed coucal, white-backed night heron, rufous-bellied heron, Allen's gallinule, Dickinson's kestrel, black-faced babbler, swamp boubou, collared palm thrush, Meves's starling, southern ground hornbill, barred owlet, Bennett's woodpecker, wood owl, various warblers and cisticolas.|$|E
50|$|The Ulanga Valley is {{characterized}} by its large populations of large mammals such as the buffalo, elephant, hippopotamus, lion, and puku. The majority of the world's Puku population live in the Ulanga Valley. The Ulanga Valley is {{home to one of}} the largest populations of Nile crocodile in Africa and is an important breeding ground for bird species such as the African openbill, white-headed lapwing, and the <b>African</b> <b>skimmer.</b> The Ulanga Valley is also home to a number of species only found in the Valley, such as the Udzungwa red colobus monkey and three species of birds, the Ulanga weaver and two undescribed species of cisticolas.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} avifaunal species {{reported}} is 528 to 530.

40|$|A {{research}} {{paper on the}} ecology of fish-eating birds on Lake Kariba {{and their impact on}} fish populations within and beyond the lake. Most fish-eating species which were present in the middle Zambezi valley before inundation still occur on the lake (Donnelly and Donnelly 1983) and only those which occupied specialized habitats now lost through flooding have disappeared or become scarce and restricted (e g. Rufous-bellied Heron, <b>African</b> <b>Skimmer,</b> Little Bittern). White-breasted Cormorants disappeared from the lake after 1963 but have now returned (Hustler et al. 1986, Hustler 1986 a). Species that have colonized the lake include the Black Egret, Lesser Black- backed Gull, Grey-headed Gull and White-winged Black Tern. The last three species have probably responded to the large areas of open water formed by the lake and the increase in fishing activity (Begg 1973, Hustler 1986 b). There is no permanent population of Pelicans on Lake Kariba (Irwin 1981) but small numbers have been recorded periodically in recent years (Hustler 1987). These birds are abundant in shallow lakes such as Lake St. Lucia, South Africa (Whitfield and Cyrus 1978) and Lake Nakuru, Kenya (Vareschi and Jacobs 1984), and are absent from Lake Kariba because there are few suitable shallow areas. Fish-eating birds on the lake can be divided into residents, migrants and vagrants. It is likely that most resident species have increased in number because of the longer shoreline and greater availability of fish. Intra-African or palearctic migrants may be present for up to six months every year but their numbers vary considerably. The present investigations were sponsored for many years by the University of Zimbabwe Research Board and by the Swedish Agency for Research Cooperation with Developing Countries (SAREC) ...|$|E
