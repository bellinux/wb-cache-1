50|$|In {{bank lending}} (homes, autos, credit cards, {{commercial}} lending, etc.) the expected loss on a loan varies over {{time for a}} number of reasons. Most loans are repaid over time and therefore have a declining outstanding <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaid.</b> Additionally, loans are typically backed up by pledged collateral whose value changes differently over time vs. the outstanding loan value.|$|E
5000|$|Some voters {{argued that}} the <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> was exorbitant. When {{presenting}} the bond offerings, the district guaranteed {{that there would be}} no increases in property taxes, which would require repayment to come from non-traditional sources. County Treasurer and tax collector Dan McAllister wondered about the future economic impact. [...] "It's not just this generation, or the next generation, but probably two generations down the road," [...] McAllister said of the economic impact of the bond. [...] "We're not saying this is going to end up an Armageddon situation, but potentially the risks are much greater with this kind of financing than what would be a more traditional way," [...] he added.|$|E

As a matter of form, a dividend paid by a company is one that is declared by the directors of the company and either paid to the shareholders or credited to the shareholders account with the company. However, where a company pays <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> or for shareholders, not expecting the <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaid,</b> without formally declaring a dividend, {{the reality is that the}} advances <b>are</b> analogous <b>to</b> a dividend.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze a market for {{microfinance}} in a region of a developing nation in which all projects are either of high or low quality. There is adverse selection because only borrowers know whether their project is of high or low quality but the microfinance institutions (MFIs) do not. The MFIs are competitive, risk neutral, and they offer loan contracts specifying the <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaid</b> only if a borrower's project makes a profit. Otherwise, this borrower defaults on his contract. Design/methodology/approach – A game theoretic model is used that explicitly accounts for adverse selection and then a study is made of the trinity of adverse selection, loan default, and self-financing. Findings – First, in the pooling equilibrium, a borrower with a low-quality business project will obtain positive expected profit. In contrast, this borrower will obtain zero expected profit in the separating equilibrium. Second, for small enough values of the probability p that a business project is of high quality, MFIs will not finance any business project in the pooling equilibrium. Third, the cost of sending a signal is not too high and hence a separating equilibrium exists. Finally, under some circumstances, self-financing can be used to mitigate adverse selection related problems Research limitations/implications – This paper studies a model with only two types of business projects. In addition, no allowance is made for repeated interactions between borrowers and MFIs. Originality/value – This paper usefully shows that under some circumstances, a credible signaling device such as self-financing can be used to mitigate adverse selection related problems that routinely plague interactions between poor borrowers in developing countries and MFIs.

5000|$|The {{combination}} of loans {{and interest in}} Judaism is a complicated and detailed subject. The biblical Hebrew terms for interest are neshekh (נשך), literally meaning a bite, and marbit/tarbit (...) , which specifically refers to the gain by the creditor; neshekh referred <b>to</b> interest that <b>was</b> charged by deducting it from the loaned money itself, before the loaned money <b>was</b> handed over <b>to</b> the debtor, while marbit/tarbit referred <b>to</b> interest that <b>was</b> charged by adding it <b>to</b> the <b>amount</b> due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaid.</b> The word marbit/tarbit, which referred to the form of interest more familiar in modern times, became ribbit (...) , in later Hebrew, and hence in modern Hebrew.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} where universities competitively supply education to mobile students. Students <b>are</b> subject <b>to</b> a liquidity constraint so that tuition {{must be paid}} out of pre-university income. It is shown that student loans provided by home jurisdictions will ensure an efficient quality of higher education if loans do not contain any subsidy. If there is income-related debt relief, however, the equilibrium quality of education is inefficiently low. This is because students reduce their expected future income by attending a university offering low quality, and thereby reduce the <b>amount</b> of debt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaid...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{question}} of whether there exist strategies whereby countries <b>are</b> able <b>to</b> sustain a cartel or collusive behavior when bargaining with a bank over the <b>amount</b> of debt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaid.</b> We show that despite the existence of economies to scale in bargaining [...] if commitment were possible the countries would benefit from joint bargaining [...] a debtors' cartel will not emerge in equilibrium (in the absence of credible commitment mechanisms). A unique subgame-perfect equilibrium exists in which the bank <b>is</b> effectively able <b>to</b> isolate each country and extract from each the same payoff that it would obtain in the absence of economies to scale. Consequently, a country {{would be better off if}} another country declared default. We also show that if two countries of unequal size are bargaining with a bank, in equilibrium a decrease in the size of the smaller country implies a greater payoff to the large country although the payoff to the small country is invariant. ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{financial}} instrument (a {{new kind of}} a loan) is introduced. The loan-stock instrument (LSI) combines fixed rate instruments (loans, etc.) with other financial instruments that have higher volatilities and returns (stocks, mutual funds, currencies, derivatives, options, etc.). This new loan depends {{on the value of}} underlying security (for example, stock) {{in such a way that}} when underlying security increases, the value of loan decreases and backwards. The procedure to create a risk free portfolio and a technique to fairly price the LSI is described. The philosophy behind this procedure <b>is</b> quite similar <b>to</b> the Black-Scholes formalism in option theory. Creation of the risk free portfolio is possible because the change in the underlying security offsets the change in the value of the loan (or the amount that the borrower has to repay). The {{new financial}} instrument takes an advantage of the fact that on average the stock market grows in time. It is beneficial for both the borrower and the lender. The LSI is more attractive for the borrower than the traditional loan <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> the decrease in the <b>amount</b> that has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repaid.</b> This attractiveness constitutes the benefit for the lender in terms of the market share among the borrowers. In addition, the lender can charge the extra premium. Comment: 9 page...|$|R
