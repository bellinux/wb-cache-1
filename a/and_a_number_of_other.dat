5|$|An {{earthquake}} in 1302 caused damage to al-Azhar <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> mosques throughout Mamluk territory.

The charter, which would come into effect upon Radama's accession to the throne, granted Lambert large tracts of land and exclusive rights to road construction, mineral extraction, timber harvesting and other activities on the island.
