5|$|Ant Island is {{a colony}} of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, {{they are forced to}} give food to a gang of marauding {{grasshoppers}} led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> off.|$|E

In chapter 7 (chapter 173 of Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar), Haakon recovers from his injuries and offers gifts to Þorgerðr Hǫrdabrúðr {{and her sister}} Irpa, seeking their counsel {{on how best to}} take vengeance on Þorleifr. Following their advice, Haakon has a wooden man (Old Norse trémaðr) built out of driftwood and endows it with a human heart. Haakon and the two sisters then bring the trémaðr to life, arm him with a halberd, <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to Iceland to kill Þorleifr, which he does.|$|E

Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a Eurocorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping {{to use it to}} make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was naïve to think that way.|$|E

Rögnvaldr's response was seize Óláfr <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to the King of Scots, where he was imprisoned for almost seven years. Upon his release, Óláfr undertook a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, after which the half-brothers were reconciled and Rögnvaldr had Óláfr married to Lauon, the sister of his own wife. Sometime after 1217 this marriage was nullified by Reginald, Bishop of the Isles, {{who may have been}} an ally of Óláfr against Rögnvaldr. Óláfr then married Christina, a daughter of the King of Scots' protégé Ferchar, Earl of Ross. The chronicle claims that Rögnvaldr's bitter wife tricked their own son, Guðrøðr, into attempting to kill Óláfr; however, Óláfr narrowly escaped with his life and fled to the protection of his father-in-law on the mainland. Together with a loyal follower, one Páll Bálkason, Óláfr later defeated Guðrøðr on Skye.|$|E
5|$|Henri-Georges Clouzot {{was born}} in Niort, France, to mother Suzanne Clouzot and father Georges Clouzout, a book store owner. He {{was the first of}} three {{children}} in a middle-class family. Clouzot showed talent by writing plays and playing piano recitals. In 1922, Clouzot's father's bookstore went bankrupt and his family moved to Brest, France, where his father became an auctioneer. In Brest, Henri-Georges Clouzot went to Naval School, but was unable to become a Naval Cadet due to his myopia. At the age of 18, Clouzot left for Paris to study political science. While living in Paris, he became friends with several magazine editors. His writing talents led him to theater and cinema as a playwright, lyricist and adaptor-screenwriter. The quality of his work led producer Adolphe Osso to hire him <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to Germany to work in Studio Babelsberg in Berlin, translating scripts for foreign language films shot there.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{received}} the news eight days {{after arriving in}} Salta. He was informed that he was deposed {{as president of the}} Junta, and that he should hand the command of the Army of the North to Juan Martín de Pueyrredón. Trying to avoid returning to Buenos Aires, he requested to be relocated at Tucumán or Mendoza. He was allowed to stay at the later city, rejoining his wife and children. The press of Buenos Aires was very harsh about him, so the Triumvirate asked the governor to capture Saavedra <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to Luján, near Buenos Aires. The order, however, was never carried out because the triumvirate was deposed by the Revolution of October 8, 1812, and replaced by the Second Triumvirate.|$|E

Suddenly, in another day, his father visits him to say he and Meire are missing him; Neto asks to leave the place and Wilson takes him away. At home, his mother asks a downcast Neto {{if he wants to}} return to school or to work as a salesman; he decides to work. The mother of one of his friends forbids Neto to see him, and he discovers Leninha is a married woman. Then, he becomes distressed to the point of leaving a client {{in the midst of a}} sale. To unwind, Neto goes to a party at night, where he mixes Coca-Cola and cachaça. Drunk, he carries his friend Bel to the bathroom and they start to kiss each other.

There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical views. Cole is interviewed {{by a panel of}} doctors, and he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened, and nobody can change it. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but he disappears moments later, and wakes up back in his own time. Cole is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message which asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> back in time. He arrives at a battlefield of World War I where he is shot in the leg, and then he is suddenly transported to 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{starts in}} 1476 as Francisco leads Portuguese troops under Prince Juan {{to victory in}} the Battle of Toro by destroying Aragonese military camps and capturing Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba. He then launches raids on supporters of Queen Isabella. In the end, the battle is indecisive, but King Afonso receives assurances from Spain that the African coast and eastern waters are a Portuguese domain. Thirteen years later, in 1489, Francisco serves the now-King Juan, in a mission to consolidate Portuguese control of Tangiers at an island outpost in the Loukkos River led by Afonso de Albuquerque, defending the area from Barbary pirates. He is then appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India by King Manuel, and sets sail for his new post. He plunders the Swahili coast along the way there, razing Mombasa. He then establishes Portuguese India in Cannanore and Cochin and confronts the Zamorin of Calicut who intends to undermine Portuguese rule of India, and who has suborned the allegiance of Kolathiri Raja with gold; Francisco then plunders the Malabar coast. He then moves to the Gujarati coast. Afonso de Albuquerque is sent by King Manuel to relieve Francisco of his post <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to Portugal to face accusations of misconduct in the Indies. Francisco hears of the news of his son's death {{at the hands of}} a Egyptian fleet led by Amir Husain and refuses to return until he avenges his son's death. He converts Afonso de Albuquerque to his side and then takes revenge on his enemies in the Battle of Diu in 1509, including the Egyptian Mamelukes and the Ottomans. This being done, he sets sail for Portugal, being slain by Khoikoi warriors in modern-day South Africa while gathering water.|$|E

5|$|The {{power balance}} {{began to change}} after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off {{as an attempt to}} assert the King's {{authority}} from the Mukhtiyar, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went {{into the hands of the}} senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the mukhtiyar himself. Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to Palpa as its governor. Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.|$|E

It took perhaps ten years of sustained attack to remove his uncle Donnchad from power, <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> into exile, and to place Toirdelbach in power in Munster as Diarmait's faithful ally.|$|E
