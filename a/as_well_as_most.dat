5|$|Despite Bringing Up Babys {{reputation}} as a flop, it was successful {{in some parts of}} the U.S. The film premiered on February 16, 1938 at the Golden Gate Theatre in San Francisco (where it was a hit), and was also successful in Los Angeles, Portland, Denver, Cincinnati and Washington, D.C.. However, it was a financial disappointment in the Midwest, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>most</b> other cities in the country, including NYC; to RKO's chagrin, the film's premiere in New York on March 3, 1938 at Radio City Music Hall made only $70,000 and it was pulled after one week in favor of Jezebel with Bette Davis.|$|E
5|$|Grey's {{force of}} 4,000 was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} relief force for the British garrison that was briefly besieged at Newport, Rhode Island, but they arrived after the Americans had retreated. They were diverted for raiding by British army officer General Sir Henry Clinton. On September 5 and 6, Grey raided New Bedford and Fairhaven, encountering significant resistance only in Fairhaven. His troops destroyed storehouses, shipping, and supplies in New Bedford, where they met with light resistance from the local militia; they damaged fewer American holds at Fairhaven where militia resistance had additional time to organize. He then sailed for Martha's Vineyard, which was undefended. Between September 10 and 15, its residents surrendered 10,000 head of sheep and 300 oxen, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>most</b> of the island's weapons.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the only}} Class-A fishery {{waters in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only one small stream near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>most</b> of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999.

However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the brown bullhead and the bluegill fish had vanished from the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{galaxies in}} the Universe are gravitationally bound {{to a number of}} other galaxies. These form a fractal-like {{hierarchical}} distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group of galaxies is {{the most common type of}} galactic cluster, and these formations contain a majority of the galaxies (<b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>most</b> of the baryonic mass) in the Universe. To remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.|$|E
5|$|No. 77 Squadron {{returned}} to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault MirageIII supersonic fighters, undertaking its initial flights on 7July. The Mirages {{were charged with}} interception, high- and low-angle bombing, close air support, and photo reconnaissance; their armament included 30mm cannon, Sidewinder missiles and conventional bombs. No.77 Squadron's prime role was ground attack, although none of the RAAF's Mirages ever saw combat. No.481 Squadron was responsible for day-to-day servicing, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>most</b> heavy maintenance. No.77 Squadron suffered its first fatal Mirage accident on 3April 1973, when an aircraft crashed during a training flight at low altitude.

5|$|On 22 June 1941, at the {{beginning}} of Operation Barbarossa, some 981 MiG-3s were in service with the Soviet Air Forces (VVS), the Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) and Soviet Naval Aviation. The MiG-3 was difficult to fly in peacetime and even moreso in combat. It had been designed for high-altitude combat but combat over the Eastern Front was generally at lower altitudes, where it was inferior to the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>most</b> of its Soviet contemporaries. It was also pressed into service as a fighter-bomber during the autumn of 1941 but proved equally unsuited for this role. Over time, the survivors were concentrated in the PVO, where its disadvantages mattered less, the last being withdrawn from service {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Råsunda Stadium was {{revealed}} {{as the official}} venue of the final in December 1997.

Råsunda also held four of the national team's fixtures, in the 1992 European Championship, and the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final; it was also the home base of AIK's matches, until demolishment plans began in 2012.
