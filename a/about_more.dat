5|$|By {{the end of}} the crusade, the {{countryside}} of Mecklenburg and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion. This was to help bring <b>about</b> <b>more</b> Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.|$|E

Also, he understands {{the search for truth}} as a dialogical process, mentioning dialogue 60 times in Evangelii Gaudium. He speaks of consensus building (EG 240) and calls for attention to the sensus fidei or [...] "instinct of faith" [...] especially of the poor (EG 198), whereby the faithful discern what is of God through a connaturality or intuitive wisdom (EG 119).|$|R

When Lupin supposedly falls ill, the much hated Potions Master Professor Snape temporarily takes over teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts and torments the class, much to their dismay.|$|E
5|$|The Bubonic Plague struck Gaza {{again in}} 1839 and the city, lacking {{political}} and economic stability, went {{into a state of}} stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought <b>about</b> <b>more</b> death and destruction in Gaza whilst the city was still recovering from the effects of the plague.|$|E

When a young man goes missing at a Boer farm and is feared enslaved, Nxumalo decides to investigate undercover. He gets employment as a labourer at the farm, where he is treated like a slave and nearly killed. He becomes a celebrity when his story is published, further reinforced by getting himself in prison and reporting about its conditions. Nxumalo decides that his destiny {{is to be a}} muckracker and, {{with the help of the}} German photographer Jürgen Schadeberg (Gabriel Mann), ventures on more risky investigations.|$|E

In 1840, Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza, with the Ottomans emerging victorious, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. The battles brought <b>about</b> <b>more</b> death and destruction, just barely after the city began {{to recover from the}} plague. The Church of Saint Porphyrius was renovated in 1856, and in 1874, French orientalist Charles Clermont-Ganneau visited Gaza, gathering and cataloging a sizable collection of Byzantine inscriptions and describing the city's Great Mosque in detail. Sultan Abdul Hamid II had the wells of Gaza restored in 1893.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{stated purpose}} of GRCs was {{to guarantee a}} minimum representation of minorities in Parliament and ensure that {{there would always be}} a multiracial Parliament instead of one made up of a single race. Speaking in Parliament during the debate on whether GRCs should be introduced, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Goh Chok Tong said he had first discussed the necessity of ensuring the multiracial nature of Parliament with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in July 1982. Then, Lee had expressed concern about the voting patterns of younger Singaporeans, who appeared to be apathetic to the need of having a racially balanced slate of candidates. He was also worried <b>about</b> <b>more</b> Singaporeans voting along racial lines, which would lead to a lack of minority representation in Parliament.|$|E

But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again to talk to you <b>about</b> <b>more</b> serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
