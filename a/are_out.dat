5000|$|Suppose that Carr <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> If Carr <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> then if Allen <b>is</b> also <b>out</b> Brown {{would have}} to be in, since someone must be in the shop for it to be open. However, we know that {{whenever}} Allen goes out he takes Brown with him, and thus we know as a general rule that if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> Brown <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> So if Carr <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then the statements [...] "if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then Brown <b>is</b> in" [...] and [...] "if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then Brown <b>is</b> out" [...] would both be true at the same time.|$|R

5|$|Age of Mythology shared many {{elements}} of gameplay {{with the main}} series, and was considered {{a part of the}} series, despite its different focus. The campaign in Age of Mythology tells the story of an Atlantean, Arkantos, and his quest to find why his people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of favor with Poseidon. Microsoft published the game on October 30, 2002, and its expansion, The Titans, on October 21, 2003. The Titans featured the Atlanteans as a new civilization. Its campaign is shorter than previous expansions, and centers on Kastor, son of Arkantos, who falls for the lies of the titans and frees them from Tartarus. Age of Mythology sold more than one million units in four months. It scored 89% on Game Rankings and Metacritic. The Titans failed to equal the sales success of Age of Mythology, although critics rated it highly.|$|E

5|$|Before Peter is {{preparing}} to leave for jury duty, the family is seen watching a television sitcom entitled How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother, a parody of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, which features Henry Kissinger, whose heavy accent makes his speech unintelligible.

5|$|Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of Cleopatra) is based loosely on Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, {{in which the}} Queen of Egypt travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an {{alliance}} with the Roman general Mark Antony. While superficially similar to The Coral Finder, Cleopatra is {{more closely related to}} the style of Regnault, with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of proportion to each other and the ship, while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting. As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture.|$|E

50|$|After the game, it was {{announced}} that three players would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> for weeks due to injuries.

5000|$|However, {{the correct}} {{conclusion}} {{to draw from}} the incompatibility of the two [...] "hypotheticals" [...] is that what is hypothesised in them (that Allen <b>is</b> <b>out)</b> must <b>be</b> false under our assumption that Carr <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> Then our logic simply allows us {{to arrive at the}} conclusion [...] "If Carr <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> then Allen must necessarily be in".|$|R
5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique {{in being able}} to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events {{that took place in the}} past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E

The Doctor and Amy work with Van Gogh to defeat the Krafayis, but in their attempt to have Van Gogh realise his legacy through bringing him to the future they ultimately realise that not all of time can be rewritten and there are some evils which <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of the Doctor's reach.|$|E

The next morning, Toby's boots are filled with switches, indicating—according to Klaus's story—that he has been visited by the Krampus due to his naughtiness. Celia {{suspects}} Kathy, who is not Toby's mother, but Julian rebukes her. At dinner, Toby {{tells of the}} wonderful day he has had with Klaus. Toby heads to bed, and Kathy speculates that Toby was sleepwalking the night before, becoming agitated when Julian and Celia are unconvinced. That night, both Toby and Celia <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of bed, and {{the figure of the}} Krampus is seen. The next day, scratches are found on Toby's body, and Celia leaves with the child.|$|E

5|$|Mumbai {{consists}} of two distinct regions: Mumbai City district and Mumbai Suburban district, which form two separate revenue districts of Maharashtra.

Of this, the island city spans 67.79km2 (26 sq mi), while the suburban district spans 370km2 (143 sq mi), together accounting for 437.71km2 (169 sq mi) under the administration of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). The remaining areas belong to various Defence establishments, the Mumbai Port Trust, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Borivali National Park, which <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of the jurisdiction of the MCGM.

5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of reach {{of many of the}} world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.|$|E
