40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between the psychological bearing capacity and trait coping style of military chauffeurs, and explore their influencing factors. Methods　By random cluster sampling, a total of 390 military drivers (experimental group) and 396 military non-drivers (control group) were chosen as subjects, and they were investigated with the Military Personnel Resilience Scale (MPRS) and Trait Coping Styles Questionnaire (TCSQ). The relationship between the psychological bearing capacity and trait coping style, and the influencing factors were analyzed. Descriptive statistics, independent sample t-test, correlation analysis and multiple stepwise regression analysis were performed by SPSS 17. 0 software. Results　 Compared to the control group, the scores of problem-solving, will power, self-confidence and the total score of MPRS were higher in experimental group (P< 0. 01 or 0. 05). Correlation analysis suggested all the factors of MPRS in the drivers were positively correlated with positive coping style (P< 0. 01 or 0. 05) and negatively correlated with negative coping style (P< 0. 01); the will power was positively correlated with educational level (P< 0. 05). Multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that both the positive and negative coping style were incorporated into the regression equation with problem-solving, will power, interpersonal relationship, self-confidence and total score of MPRS <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> (P< 0. 01); negative coping style was incorporated into the regressive equation with family support <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> (P< 0. 01) and educational level was incorporated into the regressive equation with will power <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> (P< 0. 01). Conclusions　The military drivers show a stronger psychological bearing capacity, and the major factor is trait coping style. In addition, educational level may affect the will power, so it may be regarded as a reference on psychological intervention to improve the psychological bearing capacity of military drivers...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares {{and tests}} two {{different}} model specifications {{of employment and}} age-specific migration. One specification deals with out- and-in migration <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variables,</b> while <b>the</b> other deals with <b>the</b> net migration <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b> <b>The</b> migration variable in both models is disaggregated into two-age-specific groups, young and old. The sample employed in this study consists of 62 SMSAs in 32 states distributed in the four main regions of the U. S. A. The two models have been estimated in double-logarithmic form using the three-stage least squares (3 LS) method. The empirical {{results indicate that the}} use of in-and-out-migration variable is more appropriate than the use of a variable relating to net-migration. Moreover, the results support the hypothesis of the causal relationship between migration of each age group and employment growth rates and the hypothesis of the opposite direction movement between the out-and-in-migration variables. Finally, the major finding of this study, which has not been shown before, is that the total employment increased by <b>the</b> same amount <b>as</b> <b>the</b> young migrant's contribution to it and by less than the old migrant's contribution to it...|$|R
