500|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} at the American box office, Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD. David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "every Christmas a new flock of children comes {{up to me and}} says, 'Oh! you're the one who's in Labyrinth!" [...] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said [...] "I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places. I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie. It's on TV all the time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> pretty much look the same." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{began to}} appear in small-budget films which did well with critics, such as 1997's drama Inventing the Abbotts, set in the late 1950s, in which she played the part of Eleanor, one of three daughters of the town millionaire, Lloyd Abbott. About her performance, {{director}} Ron Howard said, [...] "She not only was beautiful and seductive but gave some difficult psychological moments in the film a lot of depth and complexity. She had an extraordinary combination of talent and beauty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> stored that information {{in the back of my}} brain".|$|E
500|$|Derulo {{explained}} {{that he did not}} believe in the possibility of [...] "It Girl" [...] to be the next single from Future History. However, his peers believed that it was very distinct from the lead single, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] and that response motivated him to pick it as the second single. He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not want to put another dance song so that his fans do not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up has definitely taken place. My music has always been a representation of who I am <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> speak differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E

60|$|You see, {{it was an}} {{endurance}} test, and no man {{likes to}} give another best. Faugh! it was steam beer. I had learned more expensive brews. Not for years had I drunk steam beer; but when I had, I had drunk with men, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> could show these youngsters some ability in beer-guzzling. And the drinking began, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to drink {{with the best of}} them. Some of them might lag, but the guest of honour was not permitted to lag.|$|R
500|$|On 18 October, The Sun {{reported}} that McGuire {{had left the}} band. At a reception when Ayers Rock returned to Australia, he said: [...] "The pressure of the tour was just too much. We {{were on the road}} all the time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> wasn't as strong {{as the rest of the}} band. When we got into the studio I had the shakes. I mean I was playing the right notes, but not in the right places." [...] To finish the album McGuire's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts, and American Jeff Castleman played bass on [...] "Catchanemu". Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney. McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975, to warm applause.|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} {{the crew of the}} show enjoyed the episode, for the most part. Co-producer Paul Rabwin said that the episode had some of the funniest {{material}} in The X-Files {{as well as some of}} the most horrific, such as the scene where a cockroach crawled into someone's arm. Gillian Anderson rated the episode one of her favorite episodes of the third season. On a more negative note, writer Darin Morgan ended up being unhappy with the final product, saying [...] "The other day, my girlfriend was saying, 'I never understood that episode,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> don't either. It was an episode that had a lot of what I thought were really good ideas and never quite got it to work. I was really disappointed with that episode. Some people love it." [...] The plot for [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin, under the title Die, Bug, Die!.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{response to the}} AP, Gregg was quoted as saying, [...] "For 30 years, I've been my own person in charge of my own views, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> hadn't really focused on the job of working for somebody else and carrying their views, {{and so this is}} basically where it came out." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{corporal}} {{was evidently}} gratified. [...] "I've shown {{quite a few}} men they were wrong on that point, <b>and</b> now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> must be getting on. You'll excuse me, Miss Leger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hump his hunch {{for five}} {{thousand}} just the same," [...] said MacDonald. [...] "I {{had the best}} hand before the draw, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> still <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> got it." ...|$|R

2500|$|Eisner in 2005 {{recalled}} his studio as [...] "a friendly shop, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> {{was the same}} age as the youngest guys there. We all got along. The only ones who ever got into a hassle were George Tuska and Bob Powell. Powell was kind of a wiseguy and made remarks about other people in the shop. One day, George had enough of it, got up, and punched out Bob Powell". Eisner on another occasion said his partnership with Everett M. [...] "Busy" [...] Arnold created tensions when Arnold wanted to hire Powell separately: ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Parliamentary {{debates that}} led to the {{introduction}} of the NMP scheme, it was argued by a number of PAP MPs such as Dr. Arthur Beng, Dr. Tan Cheng Bock, Dr. Dixie Tan, and Dr. Aline Wong that the scheme is undemocratic in nature given the fact that NMPs are nominated rather than elected by the people for the people. However, in accordance with party discipline, they were eventually required to vote in favour of the constitutional amendment. As Beng said: [...] "This is the constraint upon us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> will have to continue to live a schizophrenic political life – speaking against, yet voting for a Bill." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mara was {{inspired}} to act by seeing musical theatre and classic movies, like Gone with the Wind (1939), Rebecca (1940), and Bringing Up Baby (1938), with her mother. [...] She also {{wanted to be like}} her sister, Kate Mara, a professional actress. Mara resisted pursuing acting as a child, stating to The Journal News that [...] "it never seemed that honorable to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> was always afraid that I might fail." [...] Her first and only role in high school was Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, which she got after being signed up to audition by a friend. [...] Mara acted in a few student films while at NYU, and then began her career in acting, first auditioning at the age of nineteen.|$|E

"Well, I {{promise not}} to tell mother," [...] he said, presently; [...] "and seeing you're here safe <b>and</b> well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> won't go packing a gun down there, {{wherever}} that is. But I won't promise to keep anything from Dick that perhaps he ought to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am mixed up, and no mistake," [...] he murmured, {{his face}} falling. [...] "I shouldn't {{have been so}} sure of myself at the start.

60|$|Harold bit {{the hair}} that hung over his lip, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed,</b> what <b>I</b> {{afterwards}} {{found to be}} the truth, that his stepfather was no small trial to him; being, in fact, an unprosperous tutor and hanger-on on some nobleman's family, finally sent out by his patrons in despair, to keep school in Sydney.|$|R
2500|$|José Guillén {{had to be}} {{restrained}} from a heckling fan during the fourth inning of a 2-1 loss to the Texas Rangers on August 26. Royals third base coach Luis Silverio and others restrained Guillén, while security escorted to a new seat in Kauffman Stadium. Guillén met with Royals general manager Dayton Moore to discuss Guillén's public outburst, his fourth of the season. Royals manager Trey Hillman {{did not see the}} incident take place. [...] "I was actually in the toilet, so I didn't see it", Hillman said. [...] "Managers do have to use the restroom <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> picked a bad time to be in the restroom. I found out about it a half inning later. We talked about it briefly. There's no sense on commenting on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulties}} encountered {{during the}} peace talks {{between the government and}} the Zapatistas were due mostly to the initiatives promoted by the Attorney General of Mexico (PGR). On 23 October 1995, in order to derail {{the peace talks}}, the PGR arrested and sent Fernando Yañez Muñoz to prison. These actions violated the governing peace talks law, which granted a guarantee of free passage to all Zapatistas during the negotiations and suspended outstanding arrest warrants against them. On 26 October, the Zapatista National Liberation Army denied any association with Muñoz and announced a Red Alert, while Marcos returned to the mountains. That same day, the PGR dropped all charges against the alleged Comandante German. The COCOPA agreed with the determination. On 27 October, Muñoz was freed from the Reclusorio Preventivo Oriente. He said: [...] "I was arrested for political reasons <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> am set free for political reasons, my arrest was with the objective purpose of sabotaging the peace talks." [...] On 29 October 1995 the Zapatistas lifted the Red Alert and negotiations were resumed.|$|E
2500|$|After she {{had arrived}} in the United States in 1989 with Panait, Comăneci stated, [...] "Constantin told me that I was going to live with his wife and {{children}} for a bit. I never questioned him." [...] Her arrival initially generated some negative press, however, {{as a result of the}} media's misrepresentation of her relationship with Panait. Comăneci later stated in her memoir that her response of [...] "so what?" [...] to a reporter's comment that Panait was married was due to her poor command of the English language at the time:Constantin had offered to help me defect, and I'd accepted. I assumed that his wife knew that he was going to help a handful of Romanians get out of the country and that I was one of them. But what people took from my answer was that I was a home-wrecker. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In hindsight, I understand that I'd made a very poor choice of words. Constantin had plans to become my personal manager upon our arrival in the United States. I didn't know that, but he promised to help me get settled, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> just accepted his involvement in my future career as fair payment for the risks he'd taken. People died every day trying to defect.|$|E

5000|$|Gill is {{divorced}} from Brian Richmond, Canadian director {{and professor at}} the University of Victoria, whom she married on 21 May 1993. When Gill was asked, [...] "Would {{you say you are}} bisexual?", she confirmed this saying, [...] "I guess, well I've thought about that a lot. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> perhaps <b>I</b> am." [...] She is also close friends with fellow Queer As Folk co-star Michelle Clunie.|$|R
