50|$|Bruitist poem {{it is the}} phonetic poem, not so {{different}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> poem. Invented by Richard Huelsenbeck.|$|R
50|$|His {{poems are}} {{characterized}} by the so-called titanic lyric subject, resulting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> neo-romantic lyrical subject, with the features of Nietzschean superman and Whitman's pantheism. In addition, many poems reveal a strong expressionist influence. Podbevšek's initial enthusiasm for futurism was later attenuated: what remained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> influences was <b>the</b> celebration of art and some stylistical elements, but even those can actually {{be attributed to the}} emerging expressionism. Differently <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>futurists,</b> Podbevšek had a highly ambivalent attitude to the war.|$|R
50|$|In 1927, Casavola radically revised his views, {{and chose}} to break decisively <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> movement. In truth his musical {{direction}} {{had already begun}} to display increasingly lyrical and refined qualities.|$|R
50|$|Richard Stephen Kirby (July 16, 1949—September 24, 2009) was {{a theologian}} and {{chaplain}} with interests in astronomy, cosmology, and futurology.

Wells, through the philosopher Olaf Stapledon and the astronomer and science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{illustrate}} how the combination of Network Analysis and Futures Studies becomes a powerful instrument for envisioning and analyzing futures and social change. The study of three cases shows network analysis becoming an analytical tool in futures studies while, at the same time, acquiring the dimension of change and dynamics steaming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> perspective...|$|R

50|$|Futurism was {{an early}} twentieth-century {{movement}} in Italy that sought to free <b>the</b> country <b>from</b> what <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> saw as <b>the</b> dead weight of its classical past. <b>The</b> <b>Futurists</b> were preoccupied with the technology and dynamism of modern life. The movement found its expression primarily in literature and art.|$|R
50|$|Given {{its unique}} {{objectives}} and material, {{the practice of}} futures studies only rarely features employment of the scientific method {{in the sense of}} controlled, repeatable and verifiable experiments with highly standardized methodologies. However, many futurists are informed by scientific techniques or work primarily within scientific domains. Borrowing <b>from</b> history, <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> might project patterns observed in past civilizations upon present-day society to model what might happen in the future, or borrowing <b>from</b> technology, <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> may model possible social and cultural responses to an emerging technology based on established principles of the diffusion of innovation. In short, the futures practitioner enjoys the synergies of an interdisciplinary laboratory.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> title derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>futurist</b> work Future Shock by Alvin Toffler. The hero is a {{survivor}} in a hypothetical world of quickly changing identities, fashions and lifestyles, where individuals are still controlled and oppressed {{by a powerful}} and secretive state apparatus. His highly developed computer skills enable him to use any public telephone to punch in a new identity, thus reinventing himself, within hours. As a fugitive, he must do this {{from time to time}} to escape capture. The title is also a metaphor for survival in an uncertain world.|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} work, {{the lines of}} the preparatory {{drawings}} are translated into curves and cones, outlined using Boccioni's characteristic divisionist technique. This technique was primarily derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> early <b>Futurist</b> Giacomo Balla. Boccioni, after visiting Parisian avant-garde painters, added new elements to the style, including the typical Cubist segmentation of planes.The discordant colour choices reflect the failure of <b>the</b> <b>Futurists</b> to develop a coherent colour theory to match their theories in other areas.|$|R

40|$|Between 1911 and 1913, two Italian {{brothers}} named Anton Giulio Bragaglia and Arturo Bragaglia produced Futurist photography {{which they}} termed "photodynamism. " These images, {{together with the}} theoretical manifesto Fotodinamismo futurista, represent a remarkable effort in avant-garde photography and theory in the early 20 th century. The Bragaglias' intent in making these photographs was to produce deeply emotional images of modern dynamic motion which convey the spiritual essence of human beings that becomes exteriorized {{in the process of}} physical movement. Through a short, intense campaign in 1913, Umberto Boccioni succeeded in expelling <b>the</b> Bragaglias <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Futurist</b> movement. Because of this, the importance of their photography has often been neglected, underrepresented or misrepresented in scholarship. This thesis offers an alternative reading of the photodynamic project based on its occult foundation and a better sense of how to understand photodynamism {{within the context of the}} movement and the broader history of photography...|$|R
