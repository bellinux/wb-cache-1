40|$|An {{increasing}} {{percentage of}} trade occurs via <b>air.</b> However, <b>air</b> <b>services</b> {{are excluded from}} the WTO Agreement and, as a result, the aviation market is regulated by a plethora of <b>Air</b> <b>Services</b> Agreements. In this paper, we investigate the extent of discrimination -in terms of access to international air services- generated by this system. In particular, using recently available information on <b>Air</b> <b>Services</b> Agreements for 184 countries, we estimate the impact of international <b>air</b> <b>services</b> liberalization on <b>air</b> passenger flows. We find that increasing the degree of liberalization has a positive and significant effect. For instance, the higher degree of <b>air</b> <b>services</b> liberalization among countries of the European Economic Area (EEA) is estimated to account for approximately 30 per cent higher intra-EEA passenger traffic compared with countries that signed Open Skies-type agreements. Our results are robust {{to the use of}} several measures of liberalization as well as alternative estimation techniques that address potential problems of endogeneity, heteroscedasticity and data inaccuracy. ...|$|R
