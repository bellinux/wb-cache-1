40|$|This study {{presents}} a new multipurpose image hashing {{scheme based on}} Block Truncation Coding (BTC). Vector Quantization (VQ) and BTC are both block-based lossy image compression techniques for gray-level images, but BTC can maintain the {{mean and standard deviation}} after compression. In our scheme, the original gray-level image is first partitioned into non-overlapping small blocks. BTC is then performed on each block to yield two mean values, i. e., a lower mean and a higher mean, as well as a bit plane. The relationship between two mean values are utilized to generate the intermediate binary image for copyright protection, while the number of ‘ 1 ’s in the bit plane is compared with a threshold to generate the intermediate binary image for content authentication. Finally, the <b>authentication</b> <b>mark</b> and permuted copyright logo are respectively XOR-ed with the two intermediate binary images to obtain final authentication and protection fingerprints. Because BTC is a fast encoding scheme, our proposed method is therefore with lower complexity compared to VQ-based multipurpose image hashing schemes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, the {{proposed}} methods in [9, 23, 24] trace {{up to the}} autonomous system (AS) level, while the other aforementioned works trace {{up to the edge}} router of the attack source. Song et al. [13] and Goodrich et al. [18] have proposed <b>authentication</b> <b>marking</b> methods, while the other aforementioned works send their marking information in clear text that are susceptible for mark changing in the case of existing compromised routers in the network path. Wang et al. [25] proposed a framework for ‘Sleepy Watermark Traceback (SWT)’ (i.e., watermarking and tracing packets to the attacker’s source IP address, only if the IDS subsystem has determined that there is an attack in progress). This technique is based on traffic timing and {{is quite different from the}} ones mentioned above in that it injects non-displayable contents into packets. SWT has the following assumptions: (1) Intrusions are interactive and bidirectional. This paper refers to intrusions as those attacks aiming to gain unauthorized access, rather than Denial of Service attacks, so it is not able to trace back Denial of Service attacks that are bidirectional, and attempts to block access to the targeted server by consuming computing resources on the server and by consuming all of the bandwidth of the network connecting the server to the Internet. (2) Routers are trustworthy. (3) There is no link-to-link encryption. So this method is vulnerable to encrypted traffic.|$|R

We present a device with episcopic coaxial illumination, specifically developed for such kind of inspection tasks, which simultaneously renders both a coherent image and the spatial spectrum of {{a portion of the}} surf ace, precisely defined by the illuminating laser spot. It is based on the well- known single-lens coherent image processing system, with beamsplitters added to insert the illuminating laser beam and to allow simultaneous access to the Fourier transf orm and the image planes. The device allows inspecting the speckle signature of surface features in both planes, thus allowing different defect recognition appr oaches. By selecting the size of the illuminated area of the object or the lens aperture, different speckle sizes can be obtai ned. If the speckle size is made large enough, identification of individual features can be {{made on the basis of}} their particular speckle signatures.

40|$|The {{inspection}} of optically rough surfaces searching for defects or other macroscopic features, {{or with the}} aim of characterizing roughness, are tasks well suited to optical techniques. We present the concept, the architecture, the mathematical modeling, the calibration, and some results of a device with episcopic coaxial illumination, specifically developed for surface inspections, which simultaneously renders both a coherent image and the energy spectrum of the complex reflection coefficient of a portion of the surface, precisely delimited by the illuminating laser spot. This concept is based on the well-known, single-lens, coherent image processing setup with beamsplitters added to insert the illuminating beam and to allow simultaneous access to the Fourier transform plane and to the image plane. Information about the resolved macroscopic features and the nonresolved surface microstructure (through the corresponding speckle signature) is obtained in both planes which enables different surface analysis strategies. The speckle sizes in the spectrum, and in the image, can be controlled by selecting the size of the illuminated area of the object and the lens aperture, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} segmenting and identifying handwritten annotations in noisy document images. In many types of documents such as correspondence, {{it is not uncommon for}} handwritten annotations to be added as part of a note, correction, clarification, or instruction, or a signature to appear as an <b>authentication</b> <b>mark.</b> It is important to be able to segment and identify such handwriting so we can 1) locate, interpret and retrieve them efficiently in large document databases, and 2) use different algorithms for printed/handwritten text recognition and signature verification. Our approach consists of two processes: 1) a segmentation process, which divides the text into regions at an appropriate level (character, word, or zone), and 2) a classification process which identifies the segmented regions as handwritten. To determine the approximate region size where classification can be reliably performed, we conducted experiments at the character, word and zone levels. We found that the reliable results can be achieved at the word level with a classification accuracy of 97. 3 %. The identified handwritten text is further grouped into zones and verified to reduce false alarms. Experiments show our approach is promising and robust. 1...|$|E
40|$|Perceptual hashing {{has been}} {{proved to be an}} {{effective}} solution for multimedia indexing, authentication or watermarking. Traditional perceptual hashing schemes are typical designed only for one purpose. This study presents a multipurpose image-hashing scheme based on Mean-Removed Vector Quantization (MRVQ) for both copyright protection and content authentication. The main idea is to perform MRVQ on the original image to yield two index tables, one for copyright protection and the other for content authentication. The original gray-level image is first divided into non-overlapping small blocks. The mean value for each block is calculated and quantized by the scalar quantizer to get a mean index and the quantized mean is removed from the image block to obtain the residual vector that is further quantized by the vector quantizer to obtain the residual index. All obtained mean indices constructed the mean index table and all obtained residual indices construct the residual index table. The obtained two index tables are then transformed into two intermediate binary images based on two different mapping functions, respectively. One mapping function is based on the variance of indices in a 3 x 3 neighborhood and the other mapping function is {{based on the number of}} indices larger than the mean of indices in a 3 x 3 neighborhood. Finally, the <b>authentication</b> <b>mark</b> and permuted copyright logo are respectively XOR-ed with the two intermediate binary images to obtain final authentication and protection fingerprints.

40|$|In {{ubiquitous}} environments; {{users of}} multimedia service can access to rich multimedia content any time any where, via user-friendly and easy-to-carry handheld, mobile and wearable {{devices such as}} mobile phones, PDAs, laptops and even vehicles. Besides the usual requirement of ensuring the integrity and privacy of these contents as they travel from one device to the next, {{there is also a}} need for optimal bandwidth use of these devices to ensure the user's comfort in hassle-free access. Fragile watermarking schemes is one measure used to ensure integrity of content, typically images. Fragile watermarking schemes commonly exploit particular properties of transmitted images and thus provide localization and semi-fragility features not found in image authentication schemes based on purely cryptographic techniques. The basic idea in an image authentication scheme is to compute and insert an <b>authentication</b> <b>mark</b> into the image, and later during verification to recompute the same mark and compare with the inserted version for a match. In the context of the optimal bandwidth ubiquitous environment, we formulate the notion of the originator's rights to his multimedia content. We then propose a fragile watermarking scheme that achieves this notion, thereby making optimal use of the bandwidth. This scheme also prevents two problems that we highlight on a previous fragile scheme by Byun et al. As an aside, our results appear to be the first analysis of the Byun et al. scheme. Furthermore our proposed scheme is one of the only three known SVD-based fragile watermarking schemes to date, and the only one that protects the originator's rights...|$|E

In addition, extensions to Mobile IPv 6 are proposed, which provide support for roaming users at a fundamental level...|$|R
30|$|Authentication of {{physical}} products is generally done {{by using the}} stochastic structure of either the materials that composes the product or of a printed package associated to it. Authentication can be performed for example by recording the random patterns of the fiber of a paper [3], but such a system is practically heavy to deploy since each product needs {{to be linked to}} its high-definition capture stored in a database. Another solution is to rely on the degradation induced by the interaction between the product and a physical process such as printing, marking, embossing, carving, etc. Because of both the defaults of the physical process and the stochastic nature of the matter, this interaction can be considered as a physically unclonable function (PUF) [4] that cannot be reproduced by the forger and can consequently be used to perform authentication. In [5], the authors measure the degradation of the inks within printed color tiles and use discrepancy between the statistics of the authentic and print-and-scan tiles to perform <b>authentication.</b> Other <b>marking</b> techniques can also be used; in [6], the authors propose to characterize the random profiles of laser marks on materials such as metals (the technique is called LPUF for laser-written PUF) to use them as authentication features.|$|R

40|$|Denial of Service (DoS) attacks {{presents}} {{a serious problem}} for internet communications. It simply floods the link of the victim server with {{a large amount of}} packets leading to a high rate of packet drops for legitimate users. In general DoS attacks are not exposed, but the threat is common. The problem is aggravated when the attackers spoof their IP addresses. Defense against IP spoofing is a dominant and many approaches that could diminished the spoofing problem. Since the destination based forwarding paradigm of the Internet Protocol, IP address spoofing is both simple and very effective in evading both prevention and detection. The straightforward method of installing simple filters without proper validation at border routers is rendered inefficient by IP spoofing. The attacker can choose randomly an IP address as the source for different packets and thus make the detection method infeasible. Therefore, detecting and preventing packets with spoofed source address has been actively pursued in the research community. Many existing solutions to this problem are IP trace back, packet <b>marking,</b> <b>authentication</b> methods etc. Among these, this paper proposes a solution based on request verification cum filtering technique near the victim server...|$|R

The study that he conducted, between June and December 2003, shows the weaknesses of the means of establishing proof of counterfeiting, with regard to fast-moving consumer goods. Pierre Delval concluded that it was necessary to implement a policy of technical prevention and dissuasion against counterfeit goods and recommended the use of secure <b>authentication</b> and traceability <b>marking,</b> in order to fight against organised crime’s interest in this very lucrative offence. This concept attracted the interest of Nicholas Sarkozy, who was then Ministre d’État (an honorary title conferred on French government ministers) and Minister for the Economy, Finances and Industry. On 27 March 2004 he appointed Pierre Delval Chargé de mission for his Ministry and, in April of the same year, he included the Policy of technical prevention and dissuasion among the 11 national measures of action against counterfeiting ratified by the French Council of Ministers.|$|R
