It was constructed {{on the site of}} the Pre-Romanesque cathedral and the Rector's Palace, thus encircling the city's harbour. The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miličević in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a triptych painted by the artist Nikola Božidarević around 1500.|$|E
5|$|That May, RKO {{released}} Citizen Kane, coproducing with director Orson Welles's Mercury Productions. While {{it opened}} to strong reviews and {{would go on}} to be hailed {{as one of the greatest}} movies ever made, it lost money at the time and brought down the wrath of the Hearst newspaper chain on RKO. The next year saw the commercial failure of Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons—like Kane, critically lauded and overbudget—and the expensive embarrassment of his aborted documentary It's All True. The three Mercury productions combined to drain $2 million from the RKO coffers, major money for a corporation that had reported an overall deficit of $1 million in 1940 and a nominal profit of <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $500,000 in 1941. Many of RKO's other artistically ambitious pictures were also dying at the box office and it was losing its last exclusive deal with a major star as well. Rogers, after winning an Oscar in 1941 for her performance in the previous year's Kitty Foyle, held out for a freelance contract like Grant's; after 1943, she would appear in just one more RKO production, thirteen years later. On June 17, 1942, Schaefer tendered his resignation. He departed a weakened and troubled studio, but RKO was about to turn the corner. Propelled by the box-office boom of World War II and guided by new management, RKO would make a strong comeback over the next half-decade.|$|E

25|$|With its {{aluminum}} {{body and}} frame, the Insight was an expensive car {{to produce and}} was never designed for high-volume sales.

Ahead of this announcement, Honda stopped selling Insight in the UK, for example, as early as December 2005.|$|E
25|$|In {{northern}} Japan near Sapporo, nests {{are covered}} with snow until early April. About 2 weeks later, the single founding queen arrives to start the nest, falling {{under the category of}} haplometrotic foundation. The first worker in the nest emerges in early July, and all emerge within a couple of days. The workers are produced by eggs that were laid {{at the beginning of the}} nest formation. The incubation period is about 60 days for a worker. P. snelleni only has 5-15 workers in a single nest, proving to be one of the smallest in Japan. Males in P. snelleni emerge after workers, during a period of 1–2 weeks, in cells that are separated from those that produce workers. There are about 10-20 males in an average nest, which is only <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the amount of workers. Young queens (about 30-50) also come about during this time, in late July, in northern Japan. In central Japan, the young queens come about a month later in the middle of August. Reproductive females mate during the nesting season. These young queens are particularly aggressive. It sometimes happens that there are dwarf queens that arise in the nest, that look vaguely like workers. These emerge in late August when only a few workers remain in the nest and the food supplies have dwindled. These dwarf queens have a low chance of mating because most of the males have died. Eggs and larvae disappear in middle and later August respectively.|$|E

25|$|Marianne Vos {{signaled}} {{her presence}} {{right after the}} start, as she attacked during the first kilometer but was caught soon after. The pace was high from the beginning, and the first climb saw some riders struggling already. In front of the peloton, the Polish and Lithuanian riders were setting the pace, as well as Rebecca Much from the United States who was present in front during the whole race. The first lap was completed after <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 26 minutes, with the peloton still together. Climbing the Torricelle for the second time, the race got a little more nervous with some attacks, but the leading riders from Italy, Germany and East-European countries controlled the pace. Another rider in front was Amanda Spratt from Australia, who closed the gap to a Polish rider's attack. The field slowly diminished in number, as some struggled to keep up and the first riders abandoned. After passing the finish line for the second time, {{at the foot of}} the Torricelle climb, Spratt crashed inside the bunch, but got up quickly again, made it back to the front and even attacked soon after that. The Italian riders were paying attention and pulled her back. Instead, Francesca Andina and Savrina Bernardi escaped, but were caught by the leading bunch under control of the Ukrainian riders. Spratt was relentless in her efforts, but could not create a gap on her own. With two laps to go the Italian Savrina Bernardi set the pace in the climb and the only riders able to follow were Spratt and Ekaterina Tretiakova from Russia, until a chase group of about 15 joined them on the descent. For the final lap, another group of 15 joined them making a field of about 30 riders, half of the peloton, that rode the decisive phase of the race. The Italian and Dutch teams attacked each other on the last climb, but no break attempt was as powerful as the one by Vos. She took off and nobody could follow. Increasing her lead rapidly, it was about 20 seconds on top of the Torricelle climb, and the chase group down the descent had three other Dutch riders in it, not helping it much. Rebecca Much from the United States was leading the group on her own, and during the last kilometres it became apparent that Vos would take her solo to the finish. The other Dutch riders therefore did not hold back any more and managed to place a second rider on the podium, Ellen van Dijk, who crossed the line right after Marta Bastianelli from Italy.|$|E

Vulcans also took part in the 1960, 1961, and 1962 Operation Skyshield exercises, in which NORAD defences were tested against possible Soviet air attack, the Vulcans simulating Soviet fighter/bomber attacks against New York, Chicago and Washington.

[...] He concluded that [...] "two-parter is strongest when it grabs hold of this notion. But it’s at its weakest when it turns into just another episode of The X-Files." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode was not as strong as the previous installment, largely due to the shift from in-depth character exploration to a rehashing of earlier elements of the mythology. Emily is a good plot device in terms of personalizing the conspiracy’s depredations just a bit more, but at times, it seems like the writers are victimizing Scully <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> necessary.

Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean."

[...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way.

500|$|The Greeks {{could not}} {{comprehend}} {{an absence of}} slaves. Slaves exist even in the [...] "" [...] of Aristophanes' The Birds {{as well as in}} the ideal cities of Plato's Laws or Republic. The utopian cities of Phaleas of Chalcedon and Hippodamus of Miletus are based on the equal distribution of property, but public slaves are used respectively as craftsmen and land workers. The [...] "reversed cities" [...] placed women in power or even saw the end of private property, as in Lysistrata or Assemblywomen, but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the Golden Age, where all needs were met without anyone having to work. In this type of society, as explained by Plato, one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides' Amphictyons barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honor of being eaten by men. Moreover, objects move themselves—dough kneads itself, and the jug pours itself. Similarly, Aristotle said that slaves would not be necessary [...] "if every instrument could accomplish its own work... the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them", like the legendary constructs of Daedalus and Hephaestus. Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a [...] "normal" [...] society, one needs slaves. Aristotle argues that slave are a necessity though, saying [...] "Property is part of the household,... For no man can live well or indeed live at all, unless he provided with necessaries." [...] He also argues that slaves are the most important part of the property as they [...] "take precedence of all the instruments." [...] This would suggest that at least some slaves would be treated well for the same reason one would take great care of their most important tools. By viewing slaves as tools of a household, it creates another reason for acceptance of slavery. Aristotle says [...] "indeed the use of slaves and of tame animals is not very different," [...] showing as well that at least in part, some slaves were thought of no higher than the common tamed animals in use at the time. Antiphon viewed slaves as <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> common animals or tools. On the topic of a man killing his own slave, he says that the man should [...] "purify himself and withhold himself from those places prescribed by law, in the hope that by doing so he will best avoid disaster." [...] This suggests that there still is some sense of inappropriateness in killing a slave, even one owned by the killer.|$|E
