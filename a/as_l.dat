5|$|In a {{practical}} implementation, the variables {{used to represent}} the indices will often be of fixed size, and this can result in an arithmetic overflow for very large arrays. If {{the midpoint of the}} span is calculated <b>as</b> (<b>L</b> + R) / 2, then the value of L + R may exceed the range of integers of the data type used to store the midpoint, even if L and R are within the range. If L and R are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the midpoint <b>as</b> <b>L</b> + (R minus& L) / 2.|$|E

5|$|Some nemerteans, such <b>as</b> <b>L.</b> longissimus, absorb {{organic food}} in {{solution}} through their skins, which {{may make the}} long, slim bodies an advantage. Suspension feeding is found only among the specialized symbiotic bdellonemerteans, which have a proboscis but no stylet, and use suckers to attach themselves to bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Spiders in the French {{territory}} of New Caledonia in the Pacific were identified <b>as</b> <b>L.</b> hasselti in 1920, based on morphology. Their behaviour differs from Australian redbacks, {{as they do}} not engage in sexual cannibalism and are less prone to biting humans. The first recorded envenomation in New Caledonia was in 2007.|$|E
5|$|De Gaulle {{ordered the}} plan for an advance into Libya {{to be put in}} motion {{in the wake of the}} Eighth Army's victory in the Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942. Leclerc set out from Fort Lamy on 16 December 1942 with 500 European and 2,700 African troops in 350 vehicles. He {{captured}} Sebha on 12 January 1943, and Mizdah on 22 January. He reached Tripoli on 26 January, where he was greeted by the Eighth Army's commander, General Bernard Montgomery. Leclerc's command, now reinforced by the Greek Sacred Squadron, and known <b>as</b> <b>L</b> Force, covered the Eighth Army's inland flank during its advance into Tunisia. L Force beat off a German counterattack on 10 March, and participated in the attack on the Mareth Line.|$|E

5|$|L.lubrica fruit {{bodies are}} similar to those of Cudonia confusa, {{commonly}} known as the cinnamon jellybaby. The species can be differentiated by the fact that L.lubrica fruit bodies are more sturdy, and those of C.confusa are much paler in colour. Another Cudonia species, C. circinans (which is highly similar to C. lutea), is similar to L. lubrica, though it can be differentiated by its colour (which is more brown), spores (which are smaller and thinner) and texture (which is less slimy and gelatinous than L. lubrica). L. lubrica fruit bodies can also be mistaken for those of the much rarer L.atrovirens, which can be differentiated by its darker colouration. L.viscosa can again be differentiated by colouration; the species has a green head. However, <b>as</b> <b>L.</b> lubrica fruit bodies can sometimes have a greenish hue, differentiation between the two species is not always easy.|$|E
5|$|The forces {{under his}} command, known <b>as</b> <b>L</b> Force, campaigned in Libya in 1943, covered the Eighth Army's inland flank during its advance into Tunisia, {{and participated in}} {{the attack on the}} Mareth Line. L Force was then {{transformed}} into the 2e Division Blindée, although it was often referred to as La Division Leclerc. It fought under Leclerc's command in the Battle of Normandy, and participated in the liberation of Paris and Strasbourg. After the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, he was given command of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (Corps expéditionnaire français en Extrême-Orient, CEFEO). He represented France at the surrender of the Japanese Empire in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. He quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the nascent conflict in Indochina, but once again was ahead of his countrymen, and was recalled to France in 1946. He was killed in an air crash in Algeria in 1947.|$|E

25|$|With Hugh Bromley-Davenport, {{he shares}} {{the record for}} the longest 'supposed' surname among Test cricketers. However, Sivaramakrishan is not his surname at all. He started out <b>as</b> <b>L.</b> Sivaramakrishnan but, as is typical with {{expanding}} initialled south Indian names, turning the L to Laxmanan caused Sivaramakrishnan to appear to be his surname. Sivaramakrishnan is his given name and his father's given name was Laxmanan and hence he started out <b>as</b> <b>L.</b> Sivaramakrishnan as is common with Tamils to keep the first letter of one's father's first name as initial.|$|E

25|$|L. curvatus {{is found}} in a {{relatively}} narrow band of sediments from shortly {{before and after the}} extinction, and can be used as an approximate marker for the boundary between the Permian and Triassic periods. A skull identified <b>as</b> <b>L.</b> curvatus has been found in late Permian sediments from Zambia. For many years it had been thought that there were no Permian specimens of L. curvatus in the Karoo, which led to suggestions that L. curvatus immigrated from Zambia into the Karoo. However, a re-examination of Permian specimens in the Karoo has identified some <b>as</b> <b>L.</b> curvatus, and {{there is no need to}} assume immigration.|$|E

25|$|But {{discrimination}} {{was perhaps}} less overt than such events suggest. It {{could be argued}} that some politicians and publicists may have promoted and disseminated controversial ideologies through popular books such as H. Glynn-Ward’s 1921 The Writing on the Wall and Tom MacInnes’s 1929 The Oriental Occupation of British Columbia. Newspapermen such <b>as</b> <b>L.</b> D. Taylor of the Vancouver World and General Victor Odlum of the Star generated a glut of editorials analyzing and warning about the “Oriental Menace,” as did Danger: The Anti-Asiatic Weekly.|$|E
