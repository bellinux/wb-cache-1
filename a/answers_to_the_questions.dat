25|$|The apologetic historiography in the Acts of the Apostles {{presented}} Christianity as {{a religious}} movement at home within the Roman Empire and no threat to it and was {{a model for the}} first major historian of the Church, Eusebius. Apologetics might also be directed to Christians already within the community explain their beliefs and justify positions. Origen's apologetic Contra Celsum, for instance, provided a defense against the arguments of a critic dead for decades to provide answers to doubting Christians lacking immediate <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> raised. Apologetic literature was an important medium for the formation of early Christian identity.|$|E
25|$|A {{crucial point}} in the {{dialogue}} is when Socrates tells Meno {{that there is no}} such thing as teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or anamnesis. Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows geometric principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask him questions to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy a series of questions about the size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though the boy has no training, he knows the correct <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> – he intrinsically knows the Pythagorean proposition.|$|E

Rowe treated Jackson's vitiligo, {{which he had been}} diagnosed with in 1986 and which would affect his physical appearance for the remainder of his life. Rowe supported Jackson, providing <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> Jackson asked about his medical condition. The pair became good friends; the pop star frequently sent autographed merchandise to the woman, who hung it on the walls of her office. According to Rowe's friend Tanya Boyd, the dermatologist's assistant would obsess over Jackson, gushing over him and his traits. She would say to her friend, [...] "If people knew him like I knew him, they would not think he was strange. He's unique, kinky, actually." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{one scene}} in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", Munch and Bolander force a suspect {{to take a}} [...] "electrolyte neutron {{magnetic}} scan test", which involved placing his hand on a copy machine and photocopying his hand as they asked him questions. Prior to giving the exam, the detectives loaded papers with the words [...] "True" [...] and [...] "False" [...] into the machine, so when the final copies came out it appeared the machine was giving <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> The detectives pretended the test was radioactive and dangerous to further make the suspect nervous. This scene {{was based on a}} real-life trick used by Baltimore Police Department detectives in 1988. The real-life instance was featured in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. This hoax was also used in [...] "More with Less", the fifth season premiere episode of David Simon's later police drama series, The Wire.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying it [...] "wonderfully" [...] developed the show's characters as [...] "it unveiled many of the <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that have been dangling about for some time with out using Mulder or Scully as conduits {{for many of these}} answers." [...] The main reason behind creating a resolution to the Syndicate arc was that Chris Carter thought the series was going to be cancelled by early 2000. While promoting the episode, Carter said it would give many long-waited answers {{but at the same time}} create new ones. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk named [...] "Two Fathers," [...] along with its follow-up [...] "One Son," [...] as one of the [...] "highlights of season six." [...] Joyce Millman from Salon magazine said the episode (along with [...] "One Son") was one [...] "of the most coherent, [...] almost unbearably tense, hours in the series' run". The Michigan Daily reviewer Melissa Runstrom said [...] "Two Fathers" [...] along with [...] "One Son" [...] and season finale [...] "Biogenesis" [...] were the highlights of the sixth season.|$|E

2500|$|The {{remaining}} dialogues {{are classified}} as [...] "late" [...] and are generally agreed to be difficult and challenging pieces of philosophy.

He discovers that the library {{was not meant to}} hold books—rather, it was a vault meant to house Altaïr's Apple of Eden.

2500|$|A {{study of}} coffee growers in Guatemala {{illustrates}} {{the effect of}} fair trade practices on growers. In this study, thirty-four farmers were interviewed. Of those thirty-four growers, twenty-two had an understanding of fair trade based on internationally recognized definitions, for example, describing fair trade in market and economical terms or knowing what the social premium is and how their cooperative has used it. Three growers explained a deep understanding of fair trade, showing a knowledge of both fair market principles and how fair trade affects them socially. Nine growers had erroneous or no knowledge of Fair Trade. The three growers who had a deeper knowledge of the social implications of fair trade all have responsibilities within their cooperatives. One is a manager, one {{is in charge of}} the wet mill, and one is his group's treasurer. These farmers did not have a pattern in terms of years of education, age, or years of membership in the cooperative; their <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> [...] "Why did you join?" [...] differentiate them from other members and explain why they have such an extensive knowledge of fair trade. These farmers cited switching to organic farming, wanting to raise money for social projects, and more training offered as reasons for joining the cooperative, other than receiving a better price for their coffee.|$|E
