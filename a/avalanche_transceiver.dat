50|$|Magnus {{collaborated with}} {{researchers}} at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, at first studying all the existing technologies.

40|$|With the {{widespread}} use of digital <b>avalanche</b> <b>transceiver</b> technology, search times for companion rescue have decreased significantly. Dedicated transceiver training sites and increased avalanche education opportunities have further aided both recreationists and pros in reducing search times. But the excavation phase remains the most time-consuming component of an avalanche rescue. This phase offers the most potential for reducing overall rescue times and increasing survivability. Field tests in Colorado in the spring of 2006 suggest that significant time savings may be gained in companion rescue with a strategic approach to the excavation phase. This can also lead to a more useful working area once the victim is recovered, minimizing compaction of the victim's air pocket and providing adequate space to roll and treat the victim. Avalanche educators should include these strategies when instructing students in avalanche rescue...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: “Practice. Practice.

5000|$|<b>Avalanche</b> <b>{{transceivers}}</b> or <b>avalanche</b> beacons are a {{class of}} active radio beacon transceivers operating at 457 kHz and specialized {{for the purpose of}} finding people or equipment buried under snow. When the owner sets out on a skiing descent, the transceiver is activated, causing the device to emit a low-power pulsed beacon signal during the trip. [...] Following an avalanche, and if the holder of the transceiver is safe and has not themselves been caught by the avalanche, they may switch the transceiver from transmit into receive mode, allowing use as a radio direction finding device to search for signals coming from other skiers' transmitter beacons who may be trapped. A 457 kHz beacon is an active device that requires batteries. A ski suit may also contain a passive RECCO transponder sewn into the clothing.|$|R
40|$|At the {{completion}} of the lecture on “New Hope for Surviving the Avalanche”, participants will be able to: 1. Understand the respiratory physiology of asphyxiation during avalanche burial. 2. Know the importance of companion rescue as the major determinant of survival during avalanche burial. 3. Identify the priorities of medical care for an avalanche burial victim. 4. Discuss the rate of development of hypothermia during avalanche burial and the contribution of core temperature afterdrop in extricated avalanche burial victims. Summary Asphyxiation is the major cause of death during avalanche burial and is time dependent. Avalanche burial victims extricated within 15 minutes have a greater than 90 % chance of survival, but this decreases to about a 30 % chance of survival if extricated after 30 minutes, emphasizing the need for companion rescue using <b>avalanche</b> <b>transceivers</b> and shovels.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For over 40 years, {{avalanche}} transceivers {{have been}} helping searchers locate and rescue victims buried in avalanches. They rely on internal electronics receiving and interpreting radio waves being transmitted by the victim’s <b>avalanche</b> <b>transceiver,</b> and their success and usefulness {{is measured by}} how quickly and effectively they can follow that signal to the buried victim. Up until now, little {{has been done to}} understand the effect that external interference has on this signal, and therefore the effectiveness of the beacon itself. In this study, personal electronic devices were held near a searching beacon to see if they had any influence on the beacon’s ability to follow a signal. This was done by finding both the normal and affected ranges and comparing the two values. In the end, there was clear evidence that electronic devices, when held close enough to a searching beacon, had a negative effect on that beacons functionality...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Between the new {{international}} standards adopted in 2001 and {{the aging of the}} world's fleet of analog <b>avalanche</b> <b>transceivers,</b> the time is approaching when older analog transceivers will need to be retired. As beacon manufacturers worldwide convert to digital technology, downward compatibility with aging analog beacons is gaining in importance. Transmit frequency precision and tight receiver tolerances aid in digital beacon performance. But transmit frequency "drift " is characteristic of aged and traumatized analog units; many no longer meet the {{new international}} standards. Our research indicates that many of the recently introduced digital transceivers don’t reliably detect older units transmitting outside the standards—or even new units whose frequency has been altered by physical abuse. To ensure downward compatibility and decrease risk, an international standard should be created for receiver bandwidth. Users should strongly consider receiver bandwidth when selecting new transceiver fleets. Those with analog fleets should institutionalize a regular inspection program with the manufacturer—and eventual replacement of that fleet with units containing high-quality crystal transmitters and wide receiver bandwidth...|$|R
50|$|The 14 {{scholars}} {{and their three}} adult group leaders, two of whom were experienced skiers and trained in avalanche education, were from Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School near Okotoks. They were on the annual 10th grade class backcountry skiing trip, a four-day trip and a 27-year-old tradition of the school's outdoor education program. The group were hiking along the Balu Pass Trail in the Connaught Creek Valley in British Columbia's Glacier National Park, some 5 km west of the Rogers Pass summit, scene of the 1910 avalanche disaster. At 11:45 a.m. two mountain guides, {{who happened to be}} in the same area, heard a crack signalling the avalanche's start and shouted warnings to the school group below, who were swept away moments later. The guides raced down to the site, freeing those whose hands and legs were showing above the snow, and searching for those buried deeper using the <b>avalanche</b> <b>transceivers</b> which the scholars were all carrying. A satellite phone call alerted rescuers five minutes later. Some 35 rescuers with helicopters soon reached the scene, and within 80 minutes of the avalanche the 10 survivors and 7 fatalities had been located.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Avalanche</b> <b>transceiver</b> – shovel – probe. This {{still is}} the {{standard}} equipment recommended for touring in the backcountry. More and more, off-piste and backcountry recreationists carry additional avalanche safety gear such as avalanche airbags. In a series of field tests with four artificially triggered avalanches, we compared the effect of additional safety equipment. We measured burial depth and visibility of dummies equipped with two different brands of avalanche airbags (ABS and Snowpulse), the avalanche ball and of dummies with no additional equipment. The burial depth of dummies equipped with an airbag was significantly lower compared to dummies which carried an avalanche ball or no additional equipment. Moreover, based on a qualitative validation the airbag systems were rated better than dummies without airbag. Both brands of airbags and the avalanche ball were visible in all cases {{on the surface of}} the avalanche deposits – partly due to the avalanche size and the path topography. Acceleration measurements at the head of the dummies suggest that the risk of injury may be reduced with an appropriate form of the airbag...|$|E
40|$|Snow {{avalanches}} {{claim in}} excess of 200 lives annually on a worldwide basis. However, since {{the invention of the}} first effective <b>avalanche</b> <b>transceiver,</b> the process of locating victims has remained fundamentally unchanged. Humans as a carrier for locating devices are perceived to be inefficient when moving over rugged avalanche debris, and potentially exposed to excessive risk from secondary avalanches. The technology of small unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as UAVs, are currently on the up rise as they are a low-cost, simple and effective aerial platform, which can perform a multitude of functions depending on the payload they carry. Therefore, this thesis wants to evaluate if the capabilities of UAVs could be exploited to provide valuable contributions in snow avalanche search and rescue efforts – and if so – what challenges would arise, opposing this application. Through a thorough literature review, state-of-the-art for avalanche search and rescue, UAV platforms and sensor technology is investigated to establish a theoretical frame of reference. This framework is the foundation for evaluating how to improve the current search and rescue efforts in avalanches, what capabilities current UAV and sensor technology has, and how to best apply UAVs to satisfy the needs of a rescue organization without endangering the rescuers. The subject of UAVs in search and rescue is still in its initial stages, and the amount of research and knowledge is therefore limited. Because of this the attendance of the ReCAMP workshop, Tromsø 2016, was essential with respect to the exchange of information. Tromsø Red Cross is considered pioneers on the aforementioned application of UAVs, and their collaboration was a necessity when establishing the state-of-the-art of UAV use for search and rescue purposes. The main challenges identified and discussed in this thesis is under the categories of adverse meteorological conditions and technological challenges. Weather conditions such as precipitation, extreme cold, wind and darkness are believed to prove the most challenging for the small type of UAV platforms which could be applicable for avalanche search and rescue. The most prominent technological challenges were in relation to degree of autonomy, collision avoidance, somewhat underdeveloped sensor systems and power plant of the UAV. There were also identified some challenges regarding compliance to regulations and in relation to human and organization, however these were less precarious for the implementation. The UAV platform was identified to be a sufficient carrier for electronic search devices such as RECCO and <b>avalanche</b> <b>transceiver,</b> however other sensor systems still needs to be developed further. The already limited energy density of batteries and the combination with a cold operating environment could cause problems during a rescue, but can be sufficient for preliminary testing. Furthermore, it was established that UAVs are not yet capable of replacing manned helicopters, but could still be a unique and valuable asset to a rescue operation. It was also identified that the implementation of UAVs with the current technology and organization of rescue resources, is highly unlikely to benefit avalanche victims, primarily due to excessive deployment times. There were identified some hazards due to implementation of UAVs, none of which were believed to pose and excessive risk, especially when considering the expected benefit for the rescuers as it provides them with an alternative in dangerous situations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Avalanche {{education}} {{began in}} the United States in early 1970 ’s. The current entry level [...] {{often referred to as}} Level 1 [...] avalanche curriculum focuses on the practical application of basic avalanche skills and knowledge. This study attempts to determine what avalanche information the learner can recall a week after and a year after completion of a Level 1 Avalanche course and to determine which skills learned are routinely put into praxis by the learner. A tertiary goal {{of this study is to}} offer a reflection on current Level 1 Avalanche curriculum and delivery. Students completing a Level 1 Avalanche course were surveyed one week and one year after course completion. Two hundred and ten students completed the week-after survey and one hundred and eighteen completed the year-after survey. In the week-after survey 45 % of students reported they had a beginner level of avalanche knowledge, this decreased to 33 % in the year-after survey. Conversely, in the week-after survey 50 % of students reported they had an intermediate level of avalanche knowledge, this increased to 61 % in the year after survey. Respondents on the second survey scored 10 % lower overall on the factual questions than the first survey; this is a decrease from 88 % correct on the first survey to 77 % correct on the second survey. The percentage of students that always carried a beacon in backcountry avalanche terrain increased from 47 % to 79 %. Similar increases were seen in students carrying a probe and a shovel. Many students increased the frequency of using safe travel techniques such as traveling one at a time, grouping up in safe areas, and doing <b>avalanche</b> <b>transceiver</b> checks prior to entering the backcountry. Many other knowledge, behavioral, and action oriented outcomes are explored in this report...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Searching in {{parallel}} {{is a technique}} {{that can be used}} in avalanche rescue scenarios where manpower and leadership are abundant and the number of buried victims is unknown. It is es-pecially applicable at ski resorts and by search-and-rescue teams. The technique involves using as many searchers as possible with the objective of narrowing each rescuer’s search strip width. The rescue leader adjusts the search strip width according to the size of the debris area and the number of available searchers. Each searcher commits to the coarse and fine search only after their distance reading is lower than their designated search strip width. This eliminates redundancy and ensures that each searcher locates a different victim. If more than one victim is buried, then these search strips can be adjusted by the rescue leader, if necessary, after each victim is pinpointed. Searching {{in parallel}} reduces the necessity of using complex multiple-burial search methods and technologies. It can be used to harness large pools of relatively unskilled searchers with only basic training in the technique. Searching in parallel is more feasible than in the past due to the simplicity of modern digital <b>avalanche</b> <b>transceivers.</b> It should be considered for use by rescue teams and in profes-sional avalanche courses, but only after the basics have been mastered, such as single-victim search-ing, probing, and shovelling...|$|R
