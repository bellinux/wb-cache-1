Because tibial fracture has lower similarity to ulna fracture than to asthma, it is assigned to c 2. For an appropriate threshold α (depending on the similarity measure chosen) the process could stop here. If instead we now continue the clustering, we would eventually obtain a total clustering consisting of only singleton sets: tibial fracture would become h e <b>a</b> <b>d</b> 3 (because it has minimal distance to h e <b>a</b> <b>d</b> 2); later on, cough would become h e <b>a</b> <b>d</b> 4 and influenza would be h e <b>a</b> <b>d</b> 5.|$|R

In this paper we presen t a visualization framework - visBDD, in ten ded for an alyzin g algorithms for Ordered Bin ary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs). Datin g back to the late 1950 s [1, 2] <b>an</b> <b>d</b> bein g in troduced as a can on ical represen tation for Boolean fun ction s by Bryan t in 1986 [3], OBDDs are established as the state-of-the-art data structure in computer aided design of very large scale in tegrated (VLSI) circuits. Almost every step in this design cycle can be mapped to the task of man ipulatin g Boolean fun ction s <b>an</b> <b>d</b> for performin g these tasks efficien tly in an automated way with a computer, OBDDs are very well suited, because the [...] ...|$|R
