5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
40|$|Subsonic lateral-direction and {{longitudinal}} {{characteristics of}} a forward-swept-wing fighter configuration were examined in wind-tunnel tests at Mach numbers of 0. 2 and 0. 5 for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> from - 7 to 47 deg. and over a sidelslip range of +/- 15 deg. The effects of a canard, strakes, vertical tail, and leading- and trailing-edge flaps are examined. The canard and strakes both reduce asymmetric moments and side forces at zero sideslip for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> up to about 30 deg. The canard has a small influence on lateral-directional stability; however, strakes produce a substantial reduction in lateral stability for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> greater than about 20 deg. The vertical tail improves directional stability for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> up to 30 deg. Deflection of the leading-edge flap to 20 deg. at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> on the strake and canard configurations degrades lateral and directional stability. Deflection of the trailing-edge flap to 20 deg. on the canard configuration generally increases lateral and directional stability at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Leading- and trailing-edge flaps on the wing-body and canard configurations are effective for increased lift only for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> up to about 40 deg.

The {{results of the study}} showed that at <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> below the stall the yawing derivatives were essentially independent of the yawing velocity and sideslip angle. However, at <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> above the stall some nonlinear variations were present and the derivatives were strongly dependent upon sideslip angle. The results also showed that the rolling moment due to yawing was primarily due to the wing-fuselage combination, and that at <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> below the stall both the vertical and horizontal tails produced significant contributions to the damping in yaw. Additionally, the tests showed that the use of the forced-oscillation data to represent the yawing stability derivatives is questionable, at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> due to large effects arising from the acceleration in sideslip derivatives...|$|R

5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and twisting during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E

5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E

The placement of the engines indicates that Coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised. The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids, removal of the horizontal stabiliser, a supporting surface was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics. Though Coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms, Antoniu believes that Coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E

5|$|To {{adapt the}} {{original}} Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage {{to withstand the}} great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings (landings where the aircraft does not 'float' and slow its decent rate just prior to touchdown). The leading edge slats, flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the wingspan remains unchanged. The wings feature double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons; in total, the refinements enlarge the wing area by 10–12%. The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck. The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust-to-weight ratio, {{as well as an}} in-flight refuelling probe. The Su-33 sports canards that shorten the take-off distance and improve manoeuvrability, but have required reshaping of the leading edge root extensions (LERX).

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{bases for}} {{the stability of}} locomotory motions in fishes are poorly understood, even for those fishes, such as the rigid-bodied smooth trunkfish Lactophrys triqueter, that exhibit unusually small amplitude recoil movements during rectilinear swimming. We have studied {{the role played by}} the bony carapace of the smooth trunkfish in generating trimming forces that self-correct for instabilities. The flow patterns, forces and moments on and around anatomically exact, smooth trunkfish models positioned at both pitching and yawing <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> were investigated using three methods: digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), pressure distribution measurements, and force balance measurements. Models positioned at various pitching <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> within a flow tunnel produced well-developed counter-rotating vortices along the ventro-lateral keels. The vortices developed first at the anterior edges of the ventro-lateral keels, grew posteriorly along the carapace, and reached maximum circulation at the posterior edge of the carapace. The vortical flow increased in strength as pitching <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> deviated from 0 °, and was located above the keels at positive <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and below them at negative <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Variation <b>of</b> yawing <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> resulted in prominent dorsal and ventral vortices developing at far-field locations of the carapace; far-field vortices intensified posteriorly and as <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> deviated from 0 °. Pressure distribution results were consistent with the DPIV findings, with areas of low pressure correlating well with regions of attached, concentrated vorticity. Lift coefficients of boxfish models were similar to lift coefficients of delta wings, devices that also generate lift through vortex generation. Furthermore, nose-down and nose-up pitching moments about the center of mass were detected at positive and negative pitching <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> respectively. The three complementary experimental approaches all indicate that the carapace of the smooth trunkfish effectively generates self-correcting forces for pitching and yawing motions — a characteristic that is advantageous for the highly variable velocity fields experienced by trunkfish in their complex aquatic environment.

25|$|A {{streamlined}} body {{looks like a}} fish (Tuna, Oropesa, etc.) or an airfoil with small <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> whereas a blunt body looks like a brick, a cylinder or an airfoil with high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> For a given frontal area and velocity, a {{streamlined body}} will have lower resistance than a blunt body.

25|$|Therefore, {{when the}} drag is {{dominated}} by a frictional component, the body is called a streamlined body; whereas {{in the case of}} dominant pressure drag, the body is called a blunt body.

An experimental study of the pitching-moment contribution of the horizontal tail indicated that the marked destabilizing effect of the horizontal tail at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> for Mach numbers of 0. 80 to 1. 00 was associated with the formation of completely separated flow on the upper surface of the wing. Computations of the interference effects of the wing-body combination on the tail for Mach numbers of 0. 80 and 0. 94 and high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> confirmed this conclusion.
