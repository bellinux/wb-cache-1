40|$|International audienceAnalysis of TOC and NO 3 - {{contents}} in {{the water}} at four springs {{in the province of}} Malaga (southern Spain), sampled under different hydrologic conditions, revealed two different hydrochemical behaviour patterns for these natural tracers of infiltration. TOC content increased during every recharge period, following the rapid <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> infiltrating through the soil. On the other hand, NO 3 - content only rose during the first flood episodes (normally in autumn), and fell during the winter and spring ones. This difference is the consequence of the distinct biogeochemical kinetics of nitrogen with respect to organic carbon, both in the soil and within the aquifer. Unlike the mineralisation undergone by TOC from the surface to the spring, the NO 3 - ion remains in the aquifer almost unaffected, due to the oxidising conditions prevailing within the karst medium, which impede its denitrification and favour its preservation within the saturated zone. TOC and NO 3 - have a common origin in the soil and can be used to determine infiltration processes and the hydrogeological functioning of karst aquifers. Their different hydrogeochemical evolution provide information about mineralization and degradation processes of organic matter within karst aquifers, which can be used to validate the vulnerability to contamination in this type of medium...|$|E
40|$|Wetting front {{instability}} is {{an important}} phenomenon affecting fluid flow and contaminant transport in unsaturated soils and rocks. It causes the development of fingers which travel faster than would a uniform front and thus bypass much of the medium. Water saturation and solute concentration in such fingers tend {{to be higher than}} in the surrounding medium. During infiltration, fingering may cause unexpectedly rapid <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and solute at the water-table. This notwithstanding, most models of subsurface flow and transport ignore instability and fingering. In this report, we survey the literature to assess the extent to which this {{may or may not be}} justified. Our overview covers experiments, theoretical studies, and computer simulations of instability and fingering during immiscible two-phase flow and transport, with emphasis on infiltration into soils and fractured rocks. Our description of instability in an ideal fracture (Hele-Shaw cell) includes an extension of existing theory to fractures and interfaces having arbitrary orientations in space. Our discussion of instability in porous media includes a slight but important correction of existing theory for the case of an inclined interface. We conclude by outlining some potential directions for future research. Among these, we single out the effect of soil and rock heterogeneities on instability and preferential flow as meriting special attention in the context of nuclear waste storage in unsaturated media...|$|E

40|$|Throughout the {{developing}} world, many water distribution systems are unreliable. As a result, it becomes necessary for each household to store its own {{water as a}} hedge against this uncertainty. Since <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> are not synchronized across households, serious distributional inefficiencies arise. We develop a model describing the optimal intertemporal depletion of each household’s private water storage when it is uncertain when water will next arrive to replenish supplies. The model is calibrated using survey data from Mexico City, a city where many households store water in sealed rooftop tanks known as tinacos. The calibrated model is {{used to evaluate the}} potential welfare gains that would occur if alternative modes <b>of</b> <b>water</b> provision were implemented. We estimate that most of the potential distributional inefficiencies can be eliminated simply by making the frequency of deliveries the same across households which now face haphazard deliveries. This would require neither costly investments in infrastructure nor price increases. ...|$|R

40|$|Between 1905 and 1934 over 869 {{farmers in}} Owens Valley, California sold {{their land and}} {{associated}} water rights to Los Angeles, 250 miles to the southwest. This agriculture-to-urban water transfer increased Los Angeles' water supply by over 4 times, making the subsequent dramatic growth of the semi-arid city possible, generating large economic returns. The exchange took water from a marginal agricultural area and transferred it via the Los Angeles Aqueduct. No other sources of water became available for the city until 1941 with the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from Hoover Dam via the California Aqueduct. The Owens Valley transfer {{was the first and}} last, large-scale voluntary market exchange of water from agriculture to urban. Despite gains to both parties from the re-allocation of water to higher-valued uses, the Owens Valley transfer serves today as a metaphor, cautioning any agricultural region against water sales to urban areas. In this paper I examine the bargaining involved in the Owens Valley water transfer to determine why it was so contentious and became so notorious. I focus on valuation disputes, bi-lateral monopoly, and third party effects. I also examine the impact of the transfer on Owens Valley and Los Angeles land owners. The results suggest gains to both groups. Broader conclusions for bargaining, when the aggregate gains from trade are enormous, but distribution very skewed, are drawn. ...|$|E
40|$|Model {{predictions}} {{are affected}} by uncertainty in input parameters, stochastic variability in formation properties, computational roundoff and cancellation errors, and errors in the conceptual model. The source, nature, and relative magnitude of these errors vary considerably, depending on the physical processes involved, the quality and amount of available characterization data, and the overall objective of the study. We examined various types of uncertainties and their propagation with a predictive model that simulates a water pulse flowing through an unsaturated, fractured porous medium. The propagation of the water pulse depends {{not only on the}} hydraulic properties of the fracture network, but also on the strength of fracture-matrix interactions and the storage capacity of the matrix. Different predicted variables (such as local saturation changes, total amount of water retarded in the matrix, or first <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> at a certain depth) depend on different parameters and thus show different uncertainty structures. The strong nonlinearities inherent in such a system require the use of Monte Carlo simulations. These simulations investigate the spread of model predictions as a result of changes in spatial variability and uncertainty in key input parameters. We also discuss the role of conceptual-model formulation and parameter estimation in the development of reliable prediction models. We observe that systematic errors in the conceptual model often render probabilistic uncertainty analyses meaningless if not misleading. Nevertheless, sensitivity analyses provide useful insight into the system behavior and help design experiments that eventually would reduce prediction uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|Wet-snow {{avalanches}} can {{be difficult}} to forecast. However, recent studies have shown that an index (LWCindex) related to the mean liquid water content of the entire snowpack can be used to predict the onset of periods with high wet-snow avalanche activity. Nevertheless, this index has not yet been verified. We therefore compared modelled and measured liquid water content to wet-snow avalanche activity for four winter seasons at the Dorfberg test site, above Davos, Switzerland. Using the 1 -D snow cover model SNOWPACK, we simulated snow stratigraphy, the mean liquid water content and water infiltration within the snowpack. Simultaneously, we used an upward-looking ground penetrating radar (upGPR) to monitor mean liquid water content and changes in percolation depth. Measurement and simulations agreed well and showed that increased wet-snow avalanche activity started when the mean liquid water content of the snowpack reached 0. 6 - 1 % by volume. Concurrently, at the onset, a significant diurnal increase in liquid water content was also observed. In three out of four melt seasons, the first <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{at the bottom of the}} snowpack coincided with the onset of high wet-snow avalanche activity. Overall, these results show that the index could improve prediction of wet-snow avalanche activity. The model approach might be particularly helpful for narrowing down the period of temporary avalanche mitigation measures (e. g., preventive closures, artificial release by explosives), since conditions favoring wet-snow avalanches usually persist only for a short period of time. Combined with a numerical weather prediction model, this approach may allow for effective wet-snow avalanche forecasting...|$|E

Lack of rain and unseasonably high temperatures is the major contributor to the mega-drought crippling into SWC. Southwest drought is generally not caused by annual precipitation, and seasonal distribution or the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation (Yang et al., 2011). The analysis of drought in 2009 October to 2010 March in Southwest China, shows that the southern branch trough strength continued weak, groove of southwest air current water vapor transport is abate, the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor in the southwest region of China is correspondingly reduced, resulting in the severe drought in southwest area (Wang and Li, 2010). And the analysis of the drought causes of the fall in 2009 to the spring in 2010, Huang et al.

40|$|International audienceIn karstic aquifers, {{changes in}} organic content are now {{commonly}} used to track the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from rapid infiltration (Blondel et al., 2010). Along with physico-chemical and hydrodynamic monitoring, the continuous monitoring of Total and Dissolved Organic Carbon (TOC/DOC) can thus be used to enhance our understanding of karst flows processes and karst vulnerability to pollution. In addition to laboratory TOC analyzer, different optical approaches have been proposed to measure organic contents in waters, based on fluorescence or absorbance properties of the organic compounds (Coble, 1996). First studies dealing with fluorescence spectroscopy on karstic aquifers highlighted two distinct compounds of fluorescent organic matter, denoted humic-like and protein-like (Mudarra et al., 2011; Quiers et al., 2013). This approach however requires analyses on water samples, and is consequently limited to punctual monitoring. Other studies focused on continuous measurements of natural fluorescence by using field fluorometers, initially designed for continuous measurement of artificial dye tracers. Recent results highlight that field fluorometers {{can be used to}} measure humic-like substances, while protein-like compounds need further developments (Durepaire, 2014). Based on such in situ monitoring, correlation between TOC/DOC and natural fluorescence data is not straightforward and show seasonal variations (Savoy, 2007; Tissier et al., 2013). Our study aims at better understanding the relationships between fluorescence, absorbance and organic content in karst groundwater from two karst systems with contrasted environmental contexts, the Lez spring and the Fontaine de Nîmes spring. These two sites are equipped for physico-chemical and hydrodynamic monitoring, and also with field fluorometers and a submersible UV/VIS spectrometer. Field sampling campaigns are also carried out in order to compare in situ measurements with laboratory analyses and also to sample different types of water that contribute to karstic flows to characterize the origin of the GW organic compounds. All these data will be gathered to explore and discuss the relationship between TOC/DOC and fluorescence using samples analyses and in situ monitoring during the hydrological cycle...|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{particles}} play crucial {{roles for}} contaminant transport in karst aquifers, but {{few studies have}} investigated the relationships between sediment dynamics and contaminants. This {{is partly due to}} the difficulty in monitoring suspended particles: Turbidity is easy to measure but does not deliver detailed information on the size and type of particles; mineralogical laboratory analyses are laborious and not suitable for continuous monitoring. A portable particle counter was used for the study presented here. The instrument delivers time-series of particle-size distribution (PSD), i. e. the number and diameter of suspended particles, grouped into different size-classes ranging from 0. 9 to 139 μm. The test site is a karst system near the city of Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland. A swallow hole draining agricultural land is connected to two karst springs, 4. 8 and 6. 3 km away, which are occasionally contaminated by faecal bacteria at highly variable levels. Turbidity alone {{turned out not to be}} a reliable indicator for microbial contamination. To obtain more insight into bacteria and particle transport towards the springs, a comprehensive research program was carried out, including tracer tests and monitoring of PSD, turbidity, total organic carbon (TOC), faecal bacteria(E. coli) and various hydrologic and physicochemical parameters. Results show that there are two types of turbidity: A primary turbidity signal occurs shortly after rainfall during the rising limb of the hydrograph; a secondary signal typically occurs during spring flow recession. The first signal is explained by remobilization of conduit sediments due to a hydraulic pressure pulse (autochthonous or pulse-through turbidity). The second peak indicates the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from the swallow hole, often together with TOC and faecal bacteria (allochthonous or flow-through turbidity). PSD analyses revealed that autochthonous turbidity is composed of a broad mixture of fine and large particles, while allochthonous turbidity predominantly consists of very fine particles. This is explained by sedimentation of larger particles between the swallow hole and the springs. During allochthonous turbidity periods, very good correlation between the finest particles (0. 9 – 1. 5 μm) and E. coli was found (R 2 = 0. 93). The relative increase of fine particles can consequently be used as an “early-warning parameter” for microbial contamination of karst spring water. Further applicability and limitations of this approach are also discussed. </span...|$|E
