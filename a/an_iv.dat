It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning.

25|$|The {{original}} {{lines that}} delineated an EMT from a Paramedic and a Paramedic {{from a doctor}} are becoming increasingly blurred. Skills that were once reserved for physicians are now routinely performed by paramedics, and skills once reserved for paramedics, such as defibrillation, are now routinely performed by Basic Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). However, there is wide variation among states, and even among counties within states, of what type of care providers at different levels are allowed to provide. In addition to these variations, some states and counties allow for add-ons, such as defibrillation or IV therapy, which enable workers at a lower level to learn and use additional skills that would not normally be {{within the scope of}} practice of their qualification level (for example, an EMT is not generally permitted to start <b>an</b> <b>IV,</b> but after successfully completing <b>an</b> <b>IV</b> add-on course, he or she would then be able to do so.) Add-on skills are generally more common in rural areas where definitive care is further away geographically and immediate interventions by EMTs are beneficial for patient care.|$|E

25|$|Errors {{can include}} {{misdiagnosis}} or delayed diagnosis, {{administration of the}} wrong drug to the wrong patient or in the wrong way, giving multiple drugs that interact negatively, surgery on an incorrect site, failure to remove all surgical instruments, failure to take the correct blood type into account, or incorrect record-keeping.

25|$|In {{addition}} to artifacts {{generated by the}} body, many artifacts originate from outside the body. Movement by the patient, or even just settling of the electrodes, may cause electrode pops, spikes originating from a momentary change in the impedance of a given electrode. Poor grounding of the EEG electrodes can cause significant 50 or 60nbsp&Hz artifact, depending on the local power system's frequency. A third source of possible interference can be the presence of <b>an</b> <b>IV</b> drip; such devices can cause rhythmic, fast, low-voltage bursts, which may be confused for spikes.|$|E

40|$|Background: NC 1 domains from a 1, a 2, a 3 and <b>a</b> 6 (<b>IV)</b> {{collagen}} chains {{were shown}} to exert anti-tumor or anti-angiogenic activities, whereas the NC 1 domain of the <b>a</b> 4 (<b>IV)</b> chain did not show such activities so far. Methodology/Principal Findings: We demonstrate in the present paper that the NC 1 <b>a</b> 4 (<b>IV)</b> domain exerts <b>a</b> potent antitumor activity both in vitro and in an experimental human melanoma model in vivo. The overexpression of NC 1 <b>a</b> 4 (<b>IV)</b> in human UACC- 903 melanoma cells strongly inhibited their in vitro proliferative (– 38 %) and invasive (– 52 %) properties. MT 1 -MMP activation was largely decreased and its cellular distribution was modified, resulting {{in a loss of}} expression at the migration front associated with a loss of migratory phenotype. In an in vivo xenograft model in athymic nude mice, the subcutaneous injection of NC 1 <b>a</b> 4 (<b>IV)</b> -overexpressing melanoma cells induced significantly smaller tumors (– 80 % tumor volume) than the Mock cells, due to a strong inhibition of tumor growth. Exogenously added recombinant human NC 1 <b>a</b> 4 (<b>IV)</b> reproduced the inhibitory effects of NC 1 <b>a</b> 4 (<b>IV)</b> overexpression in UACC- 903 cells but not in dermal fibroblasts. An anti-avb 3 integrin blocking antibody inhibited cell adhesion on recombinant human NC 1 <b>a</b> 4 (<b>IV)</b> substratum. The involvement of avb 3 integrin in mediating NC 1 <b>a</b> 4 (<b>IV)</b> effect was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays showing that recombinant human NC 1 <b>a</b> 4 (<b>IV)</b> binds to avb 3 integrin (KD = 14869. 54 nM). Conclusion/Significance: Collectively, our results demonstrate that the NC 1 <b>a</b> 4 (<b>IV)</b> domain, named tetrastatin, is a ne...|$|R

25|$|CT {{angiography}} {{can act as}} a less invasive {{alternative to}} Catheter angiography. Instead of a catheter being inserted into a vein or artery, CT angiography involves only the injection of a CT-visible dye into the arm or hand via <b>an</b> <b>IV</b> line. CT angiography lowers the risk of arterial perforation and catheter site infection. It provides 3D images that can be studied on computer, and also allows measurement of heart ventricle size. Infarct area and arterial calcium can also be observed (however those require a somewhat higher radiation exposure). That said, one advantage retained by Catheter angiography is the ability of the physician to perform procedure such as balloon angioplasty or insertion of a stent to improve blood flow to the artery.|$|E
