30|$|Is crucial the {{information}} of the <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitations,</b> since a 24  h rainfall event {{is not enough}} to trigger landslides (Pagano et al. 2010). For example, during Hurricane Ida (2009) several sand/silt/debris flowslide/debris avalanche were initiated in the scarps of Ilopango Caldera (covered by TBJ, Figs.  4, 5), but for the event DT 12 E (2011) there were not landslides observed, in spite having more accumulated rain (24  h) than Hurricane Ida. These recent landslides that have taken place mostly close to Ilopango Caldera, might be connected with a large volume of material in the streams ready to be mobilized or to deposits in the bed stream that is impacted by smaller landslide mass (drained or undrained loading) producing fluidization (Hungr et al. 2013). In addition, a time of preparation for anthropic, erosion mechanical and chemical weathering processes might be needed to set the next failure area and accumulation of deposits inside the drainage systems.|$|R
40|$|In {{our modern}} societies, lifelines {{play a vital}} role, even in normal conditions. Therefore, during crises, the {{dependency}} to critical infrastructures {{is likely to be}} exacerbated. Indeed, in order to provide quick emergency services to the population, systems have to be functional. However, even if not directly damaged, in order to be functional, elements of the different systems have to receive enough resources but also to be able to supply their own services. In a multi-risk approach, this necessity to take into account systemic vulnerability to assess the real impact of natural hazards on society is even made more obvious. For example, impacts of one hazard, taken separately, might not significantly affect societies, but might reduce redundancy, and therefore could increase functional vulnerability to other hazards. The present study aims at analyzing the effects of cascading events on the behaviour of interdependent systems and on the capacities {{of the health care system}} to treat the victims. In order to work on a close system, an insular context (Guadeloupe, French West Indies) has been selected. The hazard cascading scenario consists of a M 6. 3 earthquake striking Basse-Terre, and triggering landslides in the mountainous areas where <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitations</b> have made the area prone to slide. Damages due to earthquakes have been estimated for the 5 considered systems (buildings, healthcare system, electrical network, water supply network and transporta- tion). Due to their localization in mountainous areas, landslides would affect only transportation networks, with closure of roads. The inter- and intra-dependencies of systems have been modeled thanks to the I 2 Sim platform developed at UBC. The functionality of each element is therefore the consequence of the physical (direct damage) but also functional (indirect) damage. Analyses are performed for different strategies of resources allocations, and one of the final results is the impact of the induced landslides on the Health care treatment capacity...|$|R

Quantifications of SSF suffer from the limited ability to predict how SSF is formed at a particular hillslope and how it varies in time and space. This study concentrates on the temporal variability of SSF formation. Controlled sprinkling experiments at three experimental slopes were replicated with varying precipitation intensity and varying <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation.</b> SSF characteristics were observed with hydrometric measurements and tracer experiments. SSF response was affected in different ways and to varying degree by changes of precipitation intensity and <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation.</b> The study showed that the influence of <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation</b> on SSF response depends on how SSF is formed at a particular hillslope. As formation of SSF was hardly influenced by the increase of precipitation intensity subsurface flow rates were not increased by higher intensity. However, timing and relevance of subsurface flow response changed substantially at different precipitation intensities, because saturation and flow formation occurred above the soil-bedrock interface, but also within the topsoil depending on precipitation intensity. ...|$|E

A statistically significant inverse relationship is found between monsoon precipitation {{in an area}} defined as the Monsoon West (Arizona and western New Mexico) and <b>antecedent</b> winter <b>precipitation</b> in the southwestern (SW) United States and the mountainous region in Utah and Colorado (the predictor area). This linkage is strong during 1965 – 90 and weak otherwise, as has been suggested by previous studies.

40|$|On the Korean Peninsula (KP), heavy {{rainfall}} often precedes the landfall of a tropical cyclone (TC). This rainfall is called <b>antecedent</b> indirect <b>precipitation</b> (AIP), because it occurs {{well beyond the}} effective radius of the TC. The present study examines the statistical characteristics and physical mechanism of the AIP produced by TCs that influenced the KP during the period 1993 – 2004. Composite analyses demonstrate that the AIP events were accompanied by midtropospheric frontogenesis due to the TC-mid-latitude environment interaction. When an approaching TC encountered an approaching mid-latitude upper-level trough, this encounter resulted in confluent and deformed flows at the mid-level by the combination of westerlies from the trough and southerlies from the TC. The delicate balance of horizontal winds related to the two systems at the mid-level led to the midtropospheric frontogenesis {{to the north of}} the KP. The frontogenetic feature related to the AIP was in marked contrast to those of the remote rainfall event over the KP and the predecessor rainfall event over the United States suggested by previous studies. Quasi-geostrophic analysis demonstrates that the midtropospheric front induced thermally direct circulation, which led to ascending motion over the KP. Consequently, the midtropospheric front helped to intensify the AIP, together with the convective instability that was amplified by the transport of warm and moist air along the conduit between the TC and subtropical high...|$|R
40|$|The water {{retention}} {{capacity of a}} landscape, usually measured for a catchment basin, {{is a very important}} and decisive characteristic to identify the runoff amount from the catchment area and, in consequence, for antierosion and flood protection measures. Besides, creating water reserves in the landscape and keeping the water in them is also rather important. Soil humidity contributes to the calculation of potential {{water retention}} through modelling the runoff amount and peak discharge from the catchment basin within an area not larger than 5 – 10 km 2. This method is based on curve number values (CN), which are tabulated according to hydrological characteristics of soils, land use, vegetation cover, tillage, antierosion measures and soil humidity, estimated as a 5 -day sum of preceding precipitation values. This estimation is known as the <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation</b> index and it is divided into 3 degrees – I, II, III. Degree I indicates dry soil but still moist enough to till, whereas degree III means that the soil is oversaturated by water from preceding rainfall. Degree II is commonly used in this context as the <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation</b> index. The aim {{of this paper is to}} obtain real <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation</b> index values in given climatological stations (Brno, Dačice, Holešov, Náměšť nad Oslavou, Strážnice, Telč – Kostelní Myslová, Velké Meziříčí, Znojmo – Kuchařovice) for the period of years 1961 – 2009. Daily precipitation sums higher than 30 [*]mm were considered to be the best candidate for such precipitation value since this occurs approximately once a year in studied areas.

To assess the possibility of shallow landslides at different precipitation levels, a method to draw slope units and steepest slope profiles based on ARCtools and a new method for calculating slope stability are proposed. The methods were implemented in a case study conducted in Yan’an, north-west China. High resolution DEM (Digital Elevation Model) images, soil parameters from in-situ laboratory measurements and maximum depths of precipitation infiltration were used as input parameters in the method. Next, DEM and reverse DEM were employed to map 2146 slope units in the study area, based on which the steepest profiles of the slope units were constructed. Combining analysis of the water content of loess, strength of the sliding surface, its response to precipitation and the infinite slope stability equation, a new equation to calculate infinite slope stability is proposed to assess shallow landslide stability. The slope unit stability was calculated using the equation at 10 -, 20 -, 50 - and 100 -year return periods of <b>antecedent</b> effective <b>precipitation.</b> The number of slope units experiencing failure increased in response to increasing effective antecedent rainfall.

A need {{exists to}} develop {{relationships}} between hydrologic characteristics {{and water quality}} for Coastal Plains streams and the fundamental hydrographic/water chemistry responses to storms in karst regions. Nine storms and resultant runoff were sampled in Ichawaynochaway Creek in southwest Georgia to quantify these relationships. Stream hydrologic response varied with seasonal <b>antecedent</b> conditions, <b>precipitation</b> amount, and duration. Both the intensity of a storm and the quantity of water generated resulted in variable non-point source runoff and/or dilution of baseflow conditions. Increases in dissolved concentrations were typically seen for ammonium, orthophosphate, sulfate, potassium, and dissolved organic carbon. Alterations were generally consistent with floodplain inundation rather than erosive surface runoff from agricultural land. Changes in chemistry were affected by the base flow water quantity and quality, timing of source waters, and biological activity. Decreases in concentration were typically seen for alkalinity, pH, conductivity, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, and sodium. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

During 2012 - 2013 {{an extraordinary amount of}} precipitation resulted in {{an increase in the number}} of landslides reported in the UK, highlighting the importance of hydrogeological triggering. Slope failures (landslides on engineered slopes) in particular caused widespread disruption to transport services and damage to property. SW England and S Wales were most affected. Easy-to-use and accessible indicators of potential landslide activity are required for planning, preparedness and response and therefore analyses have been carried out to determine whether antecedent effective precipitation can be used as a proxy for landslide incidence. It is shown that for all landslides long-term <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation</b> provides an important preparatory factor and that relatively small landslides, such as slope failures, occur within a short period of time following subsequent heavy precipitation. Deep-seated, rotational landslides have a longer response time as their pathway to instability follows a much more complex hydrogeological response.

A subset of Landsat TM acquired on April 17 th, 1988 and February 11 th, 1999 that covers Kajang-Cheras-Dengkil area (with less than 5 percent cloud cover on the image) were used in this study.

40|$|Even though {{rainfall}} {{is considered}} a well known trigger of natural slope instability, its effective role in initiating landsliding phenomena cannot be easily distinguished due to many time- and space- variable interactions among several factors (i. e. slope geometry, mechanical and hydraulic characters of superficial layers and the basin, etc.). A common approach to relate rainfall to the onset of shallow landslides is to plot effective rainfall intensity vs duration to draw intensity threshold lines. Since the earliest work by Caine (1980) on this topic, several researchers have tried to establish intensity thresholds by means of deterministic and probabilistic approaches {{from a number of}} worldwide and regional rainfall-landslide inventories. With respect to this intensity-duration threshold approach, information about rainfall-induced landslides are generally collected from chronicles or historical landslide time series, whilst no data about the hydraulic and geometric features of soils and rocks involved into the natural slope instability is commonly taken into account. On the contrary, rainfall heights at different time lag (even every 30 min) are available at different stations by rain gauges. As rain gauge measurements are concerned, these can suffer many problems such as temporary saturation, temporary lack of data transmission and anomalous geographical distribution of the rainfall. Recently, satellite data have been employed to quantify the rainfall event related to landslide occurrence but their correlation to the effective rainfall height at a site is not guaranteed yet. So far, rain gauge measures still represent the most used option. Moreover, the physical simplification introduced by such “rainfall based” approach on landslide prediction can be accepted due to the assumption that only shallow landslides are considered for drawing a regional intensity-duration threshold from the considered data. Starting from the above considerations, and within the framework of a nationwide project by CNR-IRPI, under funds from the National Civil Department, the authors propose in this article a new criterion to identify from rain gauge measures the duration of the rainfalls triggering shallow landslides. The new criterion represents an attempt to identify the duration of the “effective rainfall event” responsible for the landslide occurrence, as reported by newspaper clips and/or in real time web newspapers. At this regard, <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitations</b> are not taken into account, since the model considers only that amount of rainfall that effectively triggers the slope failure. The model analyses the hourly rainfall time series for at least one month before occurrence of the shallow landslide, using a historical landslide archive covering the time range between 2002 and 2011 in the Lazio Region, central Italy. This archive was obtained by a procedure consisting of the following steps: i) critical scrutiny of chronicles, ii) identification of the landslide site, and iii) retrieval of the rainfall data from the nearest rain gauge station within the pluviometric network provided by the National Department of Civil Protection. The proposed method, for each reported landslide, uses the cumulative function of the rainfall heights and rainfall intensity calculated for different time lag. Then, in order to identify the beginning of the effective rainfall event, two conditions have to be satisfied: (1) the difference in rainfall intensity between two adjacent windows must be very low, and (2) the time series of lack of rainfall must be stationary. When these conditions are met, the initial time of the efficient rainfall necessary to trigger the landslide is established. Such criterion is statistically based according to the rainfall time distribution only. No assumption is needed on the probabilistic distributions of time series of rain/not rain. Such approach has been successfully applied to medium-to-long rainfalls, for which rain/not rain datasets are statistically significant. Very short rainfall durations (i. e. a few hours), due to the small number of data, are not suitable to this approach, but, on the other hand, their onset is generally easily recognizable by visual inspection of the height pluviometric trends...|$|R

This variability includes periods of multidecadal drought in the 1500 s more persistent than any event in the historical record.

In this study, different approaches were evaluated to determine volumetric runoff coefficients in 18 small/ medium experimental gauged catchments of the Iberian Peninsula and to fit runoff calculations based on precipitation data for gauged and ungauged catchments. Using data derived from 1962 events, rainfall-runoff relationships were characterized and compared in order to evaluate the various hydrological response patterns. Volumetric runoff coefficients and cumulative runoff and precipitation ratios of the events that generated runoff (Rcum) minimized the root mean square error. A linear fit for the estimation of Rcum in ungauged catchments was based on mean annual precipitation, rates of infiltration, the fraction of forest-land use, and the catchment channel length. Despite high catchment heterogeneity, Rcum resulted in a suitable parameter to evaluate hydrological variability in rural gauged and ungauged catchments.

We found out, that the moisture from <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation</b> influences modeling of soil runoff. The <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation</b> conditions the change of basic physical characteristic. We disregarded the influence of evapotranspiration and effect of vegetation on soil runoff. For the parameterization we have chosen two methods, which describe soil runoff. It was SCS CN and Green Ampt methods. These two methods have been compared on sample of resulting events. The methods were manually and automatically calibrating. The results showed on the insignificant difference between both observed methods. No better significant predicative capacity was manifested for one or other methods. Key worlds: soil runoff modeling, SCS CN, Green Ampt, HEC-HMS, infiltratio...|$|E
40|$|Streamflows have {{increased}} notably across the U. S. Midwest {{over the past}} century, fueling a debate on the relative influences of changes in precipitation and land cover on the flow distribution. Here, we propose a simple modeling framework to evaluate the main drivers of streamflow rates. Streamflow records from 290 long-term USGS stream gauges were modeled using five predictors: <b>precipitation,</b> <b>antecedent</b> wetness, temperature, agriculture, and population density. We evaluated which predictor combinations performed best for every site, season and streamflow quantile. The goodness-of-fit of our models is generally high and varies by season (higher {{in the spring and}} summer than in the fall and winter), by streamflow quantile (best for high flows in the spring and winter, best for low flows in the fall, and good for all flow quantiles in summer), and by region (better in the southeastern Midwest than in the northwestern Midwest). In terms of predictors, we find that precipitation variability is key for modeling high flows, while antecedent wetness is a crucial secondary driver for low and median flows. Temperature improves model fits considerably in areas and seasons with notable snowmelt or evapotranspiration. Finally, in agricultural and urban basins, harvested acreage and population density are important predictors of changing streamflow, and their influence varies seasonally. Thus, any projected changes in these drivers are likely to have notable effects on future streamflow distributions, with potential implications for basin water management, agriculture, and flood risk management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) is a {{systemic}} infection caused by inhalation of airborne spores from Coccidioides immitis, a soil-dwelling fungus {{found in the}} southwestern United States, parts of Mexico, and Central and South America. Dust storms help disperse C. immitis so risk factors for valley fever include conditions favorable for fungal growth (moist, warm soil) and for aeolian soil erosion (dry soil and strong winds). We analyze and intercompare the seasonal and interannual behavior of valley fever incidence and climate risk factors for the period 1980 – 2002 in Kern County, California, the US county with highest reported incidence. We find weak but statistically significant links between disease incidence and <b>antecedent</b> climate conditions. <b>Precipitation</b> anomalies eight and twenty months antecedent explain only up to 4 % of monthly variability in subsequent valley fever incidence during the 23 year period tested. This {{is consistent with previous}} studies suggesting that C. immitis tolerates hot, dry periods better than competing soil organisms, and, as a result, thrives during wet periods following droughts. Furthermore, the relatively small correlation with climate suggests that the causes of valley fever could be largely anthropogenic in Kern County. Seasonal climate predictors of valley fever in Kern County are similar to, but much weaker than those in Arizona, where previous studies find precipitation explains up to 75 % of incidence. Causes for the discrepancy between climate associations with valley fever in California and Arizona are not yet understood. Higher resolution temporal and spatial monitoring of soil conditions could improve our understanding of climatic antecedents of severe epidemics. 1...|$|R

40|$|Using the WETNET database, {{existing}} {{methods for}} {{the estimation of}} surface wetness from SSM/I data have been assessed and further developed. A physical-statistical method for optimal estimation of daily surface heat flux and Bowen ratio on the mesoscale has been developed and tested. This method is based on observations of daytime planetary boundary layer (PBL) growth from operational ravansonde and daytime land-surface temperature amplitude from Geostationary Operational Environmental (GOES) satellites. The mesoscale patterns of these heat fluxes have been compared with an AVHRR-based vegetation index and surface wetness (separately estimated from SSM/I and in situ observations). Cases of the 1988 Midwest drought and a surface/atmosphere moisture gradient (dry-line) in the southern Plains were studied. The analyses revealed significant variations in sensible heat flux (S(sub 0), and Bowen ratio, B(sub 0)) associated with vegetation cover and <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation.</b> Relationships for surface heat flux (and Bowen ratio) from <b>antecedent</b> <b>precipitation</b> and vegetation index have been developed and compared to other findings.

40|$|Discharge {{is often}} {{strongly}} correlated to the temporal variability of {{dissolved organic carbon}} concentrations ([DOC]) in watercourses. One recently proposed way to model this is the riparian flow-concentration integration model (RIM) concept that accounts {{for the role of}} flow pathway control on [DOC] dynamics in streams. However, in boreal systems, there is also commonly a seasonal pattern, which cannot be explained by variability in discharge alone. The objectives with this study were to (1) demonstrate RIM as a tool for studying variability in stream water chemistry, (2) investigate factors related to stream water DOC variability, and (3) modify RIM to account for these factors. RIM was used with 14 years of daily discharge and almost 500 stream measurements of [DOC] from a forested boreal headwater stream. We used the calibrated RIM to account for discharge influences and then investigated variables that could be related to DOC variability (air and soil temperature, soil moisture, <b>precipitation,</b> <b>antecedent</b> flow and stream sulfate). Five alternative formulations of RIM, with temporally varying soil concentration profiles based on the variability in soil temperature and/or antecedent flow, were evaluated. The model where only the effects of riparian soil temperature on dynamics in DOC depth profiles were included performed best overall. This dynamic RIM improved the Nash-Sutcliffe to 0. 58 compared to 0. 42 for the flow-only formulation and reduced the median absolute error from 3. 0 to 2. 1 mg L− 1. This study demonstrates that RIM is a simple way of modeling stream DOC and exploring controls on stream water chemistry...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, 7 years (during {{the growing}} season (April–October) of 2002 – 2008) of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) data taken at a {{frequency}} of 6. 9 GHz for night observations at both polarizations are processed and used to conduct 7 years of surface soil moisture dataset for an arid area, in Northwestern China. This soil moisture dataset can contribute to better understanding the climate change and forecast modeling for this area. Based on the first-order radiative transfer model calculation, a unique method for estimating surface soil moisture over the study area is developed. Considering extremely complex topography over the study area, we have to present a parameterization of surface roughness at the 6. 9 GHz and spatial resolution of the AMSR-E using the annual minimum MPDI (Microwave Polarization Difference Index). For validation purpose, the comparisons of soil moisture patterns with precipitation fields are made. The results indicate the evolutions of soil moisture estimated from the AMSR-E and <b>antecedent</b> ground daily <b>precipitations</b> are in a good agreement. Furthermore, a series of rainfall traces is captured over the Taklimakan Desert. Comparisons of the estimated values of soil moisture with the ground observations are also made for two reprehensive sites over 2002 – 2004. The results indicate there has a good agreement between them, with higher correlation coefficients (R= 0. 649, 0. 604) and RMSE (3. 5, 5. 4 %), and the soil moisture product derived from the AMSR-E is realistic and acceptable. This new long time series of estimated soil moisture will prove valuable for other studies of climate change and model evaluation...|$|R
