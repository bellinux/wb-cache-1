5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called <b>arc</b> <b>eye</b> or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
40|$|New {{method of}} {{blinking}} detection is proposed. The utmost important of blinking detection method is robust against different users, noise, and also change of eye shape. In this paper, we propose blinking detection method {{by measuring the}} distance between two <b>arcs</b> of <b>eye</b> (upper part and lower part). We detect <b>eye</b> <b>arcs</b> by apply Gabor filter onto eye image. As we know that Gabor filter has advantage on image processing application since it able to extract spatial localized spectral features such as line, arch, and other shapes. After two of <b>eye</b> <b>arcs</b> are detected, we measure the distance between <b>arcs</b> of <b>eye</b> by using connected labeling method. The open eye is marked by the distance between two arcs is more than threshold and otherwise, the closed eye is marked by the distance less than threshold. The experiment result shows that our proposed method robust enough against different users, noise, and eye shape changes with perfectly accuracy...|$|R

500|$|Welders wear {{protective}} clothing, including {{light and}} thin leather gloves and protective long sleeve shirts with high collars, to avoid exposure to strong ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the absence}} of smoke in GTAW, the electric arc light is not covered by fumes and particulate matter as in stick welding or shielded metal arc welding, and thus is a great deal brighter, subjecting operators to strong ultraviolet light. The welding arc has a different range and strength of UV light wavelengths from sunlight, but the welder is very close to the source and the light intensity is very strong. Potential arc light damage includes accidental flashes to the eye or <b>arc</b> <b>eye</b> and skin damage similar to strong sunburn. [...] Operators wear opaque helmets with dark eye lenses and full head and neck coverage to prevent this exposure to UV light. Modern helmets often feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to the bright light of the struck arc.

40|$|Purpose. Clinically, what is {{the best}} time for age-related {{cataract}} (ARC) patients to receive surgeries and get the most benefits is important. We explored the relationship between age and presenting postoperative visual acuity (POVA) in patients from rural China. Methods. Three Lifeline Express Hospital Eye-Train missions of Peking University People’s Hospital were chosen. At the first day after surgery, 3452 <b>ARC</b> <b>eyes</b> with the presenting POVA ≥ 6 / 60 were enrolled. The relationship between age and POVA was analyzed statistically. Results. In these three missions, there were more female patients than males; the ratio of females to males was 1. 71. The average age of females was older than males. Overall, the percentages of patients with good visual outcomes (≥ 6 / 18) were significantly decreased with aging. Different regions had variations, but the trends were the same. There was weak linear correlation between age and POVA. The correlations of females were stronger than males in Yuncheng and Sanmenxia and weaker than males in Zhoukou. Conclusion. The good visual outcomes of presenting POVA were significantly decreased with aging and there were weak linear correlations between age and POVA in rural China.

40|$|AbstractLoss of arc {{function}} {{results in}} a downwardly curved wing and smaller eyes with a reduced number of ommatidia. Consistent with this phenotype, molecular analysis shows that arc mRNA and protein are expressed in the wing imaginal disc and in clusters of cells in the morphogenetic furrow of the eye imaginal disc. The 36 -kb arc transcription unit contains 10 exons that are spliced to form a 5. 5 -kb mRNA. The encoded Arc protein is 143, 000 Da and contains two PDZ (PSD- 95, Discs large, ZO- 1) domains; there is no close structural similarity to other PDZ proteins. In addition to its expression in imaginal discs, arc is expressed during embryogenesis in epithelia undergoing morphogenesis, including the invaginating posterior midgut, evaginating Malpighian tubule buds, elongating hindgut, invaginating salivary glands, intersegmental grooves, and developing tracheae. Arc protein colocalizes with Armadillo (β-catenin) to the apical (luminal) surface of these developing epithelia, indicating that it is associated with adherens junctions. Genes that are required for patterning of embryonic epithelia (e. g., tailless, Krüppel, fork head, and brachyenteron) or for progression of the morphogenetic furrow (i. e., hedgehog) are required to establish or maintain the regional expression of arc. Misexpression of <b>arc</b> in the <b>eye</b> imaginal discs results in rough and larger eyes with fused ommatidia. We propose that <b>arc</b> affects <b>eye</b> development by modulating adherens junctions of the developing ommatidium...|$|R

5000|$|... "Keratoconjunctivitis photoelectrica" [...] (<b>arc</b> <b>eye)</b> means {{inflammation}} {{caused by}} photoelectric UV light. It {{is a type}} of ultraviolet keratitis. Such UV exposure can be caused by arc welding without wearing protective eye glass, or by high altitude exposure from sunlight reflected from snow ("snow blindness"). The inflammation will only appear after about 6 to 12 hours. It can be treated by rest, as the inflammation usually heals after 24-48 hours.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the workplace hazards generally faced by industrial workers, electricians are also particularly exposed to injury by electricity. An electrician may experience electric shock due to direct contact with energized circuit conductors or due to stray voltage caused by faults in a system. An electric <b>arc</b> exposes <b>eyes</b> and skin to hazardous amounts of heat and light. Faulty switchgear may cause an arc flash incident with a resultant blast. Electricians are trained to work safely and take many measures to minimize the danger of injury. Lockout and tagout procedures are used {{to make sure that}} circuits are proven to be de-energized before work is done. Limits of approach to energized equipment protect against arc flash exposure; specially designed flash-resistant clothing provides additional protection; grounding (earthing) clamps and chains are used on line conductors to provide a visible assurance that a conductor is de-energized. Personal protective equipment provides electrical insulation as well as protection from mechanical impact; gloves have insulating rubber liners, and work boots and hard hats are specially rated to provide protection from shock. If a system cannot be de-energized, insulated tools are used; even high-voltage transmission lines can be repaired while energized, when necessary.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION One of {{the first}} things we agreed to as an {{editorial}} staff was that our university???s literary journal needed an updated title. There was nothing inherently wrong with the name Island Fox, per se, but we preferred something that might better demonstrate the joie de vivre of writing. After batting about a few names, we settled on MYUZ ??? a nod of appreciation to the nine daughters of Zeus ??? the Greek goddesses of artistic inspiration. A muse is something (or someone) every writer needs ??? an inspirational influence to whisper in their ear, to help lift their words and voice above the mundane. During this past year, newspapers, television, and internet blogs have been filled with bad news ??? some of it terrifying. Here in Ventura County we were jolted by the huge loss of life in the Chatsworth Metrolink crash ??? the worst train accident in California history. We have decided to open our journal this year with a non-fiction piece by Joshua Bauer that deals with this tragedy. Bauer begins his first person narrative with a group of friends getting together for a few games of bowling. The Metrolink disaster, which had happened just two days before, is not really on their radar. The story takes a dramatic turn when Katie, a young woman who had been quiet all evening, suddenly reveals the news that a friend of theirs from high school was one of the Metrolink victims. Another short story you???ll be sure to want to check out is Bishara, Avi, Always, Kristi Kellog???s narrative of what happens when a conservative Hindu boy meets a worldly Indian girl hell-bent on winning a major beauty contest. Poetry is well represented in this year???s journal, making up about one-half of the entries. Adam Piccirilli electrifies us with his love poem <b>Arc</b> <b>Eyes,</b> Sara Parker introduces us to the horrors of nursing home life in A Part of Adulthood I???d Rather Avoid, and Krista Wilbur, last year???s managing editor, takes us into the dark, blood-stained alleys of poesie noir with Kaleidoscope. Current events were popular with our submitters this year; Sara Parker comes through again, delivering a sarcastic political elbow-punch with Hooray For Proposition 8, Chris O???Neal tells us the advantages of pet ownership during a recessionary economy in Do Rabbits Dream of Electric People, and Sean Colletti???s esoteric Now Serving Number 44 will have you puzzling over its meaning. Look closely ??? the clues are there. Our editorial committee offers up their own contributions, of course. MYUZ???s mamma capa, Kellie Griffin, brings us into the lives of two young friends {{on their way to a}} blood test in Transposition, Julie Fontes shows us what can happen when you meet up with your past at a downtown club in And Hearts, and Guy MacLaury illustrates the perils of beachcombing after dark in Jamaica with A Walk on the Seven Mile Beach. In addition, Luis Maranan takes us into the gravity-prone forest of One Hundred Hills, there???s the aforementioned reflective non-fiction short story from Joshua Bauer ??? Spared ??? and George Morgan squeezes in a few pages with a story about cul-de-sac culture, helicopters, and Polynesian cannabis in Where the Road Ends. We broke some new ground this year, using technology in innovative ways. This is the first time the CSUCI literary journal has been published by an online publishing company: lulu. com. This will allow copies of MYUZ to be available in perpetuity. All in all we believe our readers will enjoy the writing in this year???s campus journal. It???s been a pleasure putting it together. If you have any comments, or ideas to improve the next one, please write to us at island. fox@csuci. edu. The MYUZ Committe...|$|R
