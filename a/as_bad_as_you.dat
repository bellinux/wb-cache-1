2500|$|Moving Pictures is {{the second}} webcomic created by Kathryn and Stuart Immonen, who both had {{experience}} creating comic books together for Marvel Comics. The pair's first webcomic, Never <b>as</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>You</b> Think, is a comedic slapstick comic strip with little to no story. Greg Burgas of Comic Book Resources noted the difference in tone between the Never <b>as</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>You</b> Think and Moving Pictures, the latter taking on a much darker subject matter and more complex story. The two webcomics share a [...] "sharp" [...] artstyle, with characters being rendered as [...] "skinny and pointy".|$|E

"As bad as I {{have been}} represented, or <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may think me, I {{assure you that}} I feel support in my afflictions from {{entertaining}} a proper sense of religion. [...] As all men are subject to wrong, I cannot but say that the principle is likewise inherent in me. [...] I acknowledge myself guilty in regard of many of my slaves, but I call God to witness to my innocence in respect {{to the murder of}} Prosper. [...] I am sensible that the country thirsts for my blood, and I am ready to sacrifice it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fred Cate, Director of the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University, said: [...] "This is {{the classic}} {{definition}} of spyware. [...] It's <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can imagine." [...] Eileen Lake of Wynnewood, whose three children attend district schools, said: [...] "If there's a concern that laptops are misplaced or stolen, they should install a chip to locate them instead. There shouldn't be a reason to use webcams for that purpose." [...] Marc Rotenberg, Georgetown University Law School information privacy professor and President and Executive Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), said: [...] "There are less intrusive ways to track stolen laptops, no question about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Reuters writer Daniel Carlson {{said the}} show was [...] "exactly <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would fear". Carlson said the jokes were bad and that delivery from the actors is too exaggerated; although he praised Matt Lucas, he said Maguire and Lucas were inappropriately over-the-top. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe called the show a [...] "relentless, mediocre spoofery that so desperately wants {{to remind us of}} Monty Python and the Holy Grail". However, Gilbert said the show might work better in half-hour increments, rather than in the one-hour premiere with [...] "Wench Trouble" [...] and [...] "Golden Powers". Kate Ward of Entertainment Weekly said although the show's premise had promise, she did not particularly like the execution. Ward said Matt Lucas's character [...] "came off as Dr. Evil light", but said Sean Maguire was charming and that she laughed at some of the [...] "juvenile jokes", including Horst Draper, the name of a prisoner accused of raping horses. Boston Herald reviewer Mark A. Perigard complimented the show's high production values, but said, [...] "What was spent on sets didn't go into the script." [...] He also said the concept of a comedy swords-and-fantasy show is redundant because even serious shows, like [...] and , are comedies to an extent.|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Boston Herald reviewer Mark A. Perigard {{called the}} show a [...] "dismal effort" [...] {{and said the}} Bruce character was such an offensive gay stereotype that he [...] "would get shunned even on Bravo's Queer Eye". Perigard said of the episode, [...] "Go ahead and watch, but don't blame me when brain matter starts to dribble out your ears." [...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe called the show a [...] "relentless, mediocre spoofery that so desperately wants {{to remind us of}} Monty Python and the Holy Grail".

Reuters writer Daniel Carlson said the show was [...] "exactly <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would fear". Carlson said the jokes were bad and that delivery from the actors is too exaggerated; he also said some of the dialogue, particularly from Bruce, is [...] "so head-shakingly bad that it evokes pity for Ray, who had to say it aloud." [...] Curt Wagner of RedEye said he did not enjoy or appreciate the gay jokes: [...] "Do the writers really think being gay is funny?" [...] However, Wagner said he enjoyed the episode as a whole and particularly liked Matt Lucas, who he said was [...] "just too entertaining as he calls for 'juice and muffins' after mistakenly killing someone".|$|E

6000|$|... 'But it's like this, you know,' said Herbert, rising excitedly, and at {{the next}} moment, on reflection, composedly reseating himself. 'How many of your people {{actually}} saw it? How many owned to its being <b>as</b> <b>bad,</b> <b>as</b> complete, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> made out? I don't want {{for a moment to}} cut right across what you said last night--our talk--but there are two million sides to every question, and as often as not the less conspicuous have sounder--well--roots. That's all.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Bless me, mystery {{seems to}} thicken. Well, {{you have got}} {{yourself}} into a pretty pickle. Why, child, burns of that sort leave scars <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> had been burnt by fire. You {{ought to be in}} a dark room with your face and hands bandaged, instead of tramping along here in the sun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No; you can’t {{take your}} lawyer along when you visit a sick man. Still, if he’s not quite <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> Aynsley thinks, <b>you</b> may <b>as</b> well {{be on your}} guard.” ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{had hardly}} seemed {{aware of his}} {{impending}} fate till the last evening, when, as the family were separating at night, he sighed disconsolately, and said, 'I am <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are, Sophy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{stole the}} things; or, rather, I think I had better say I took them, {{although}} {{it amounts to}} the same thing. But I don't think I am quite <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> suppose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Right, Jeff,' says Andy. 'We'll stick {{right along}} with Murkison if he insists on going and block this funny business. I'd hate to see any money dropped in it <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And I {{was just}} going to give her such a scolding for giggling in the garden," [...] said Flora, [...] "and to say we had been <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> Miss Walkingham. <b>You</b> should not have been so awkward, Harry; you nearly betrayed yourself." ...|$|R
