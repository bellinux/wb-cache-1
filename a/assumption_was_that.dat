Yagi, in turn, referred Kanō to Fukuda Hachinosuke, a bonesetter who taught Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū in a 10-mat room adjacent to his practice. Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū was itself a combination of two older schools: the Yōshin-ryū and Shin no Shindō-ryū.|$|E

40|$|This article argues <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> several <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> {{guide and}} shape {{the issues of}} {{decentralisation}} and partnership in creating a responsible and citizen-focused public service in South Africa, in developed countries and in other developing countries. The first <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> decentralisation as a normative ideal ought to be pursued everywhere. The second <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> public administrators simply need to make decentralisation work for the citizenry and not question it at all.

The fourth <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if decentralisation <b>is</b> not working {{in the interests of}} the citizenry the fault lies elsewhere than with decentralisation itself – the corollary of this is to be found in the assumption where two public administrators simply need to find ways of making it work {{in the interests of the}} citizenry. And the fifth <b>assumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> centralisation equals bad and decentralisation equals good and the corollary of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> states ought to pursue decentralisation both as an end and as a means to an end. am 2016 School of Public Management and Administratio...|$|R

When Tarascon had to drop out because of an injury from a crash, Nungesser came in as a replacement. Nungesser and Coli took off from Le Bourget airport near Paris on 8 May 1927, heading for New York in their L'Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird) aircraft, a Levasseur PL.8 biplane painted with Nungesser's old World War I insignia. Their plane was last sighted heading past Ireland and, when they never arrived, the <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> their plane had crashed in the North Atlantic Ocean.

25|$|Before the invasion, many {{observers}} had expected a lengthy campaign of aerial bombing before any ground action, taking as examples the 1991 Persian Gulf War or the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to decapitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see Shock and awe), attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The <b>assumption</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces {{would allow them}} to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.|$|E

The first proposal to reform the {{doctrine of}} privity was made in 1937 by the Law Revision Committee in its Sixth Interim Report, which proposed an act of Parliament to allow third parties to enforce terms of a contract that specifically allowed them to do so.

500|$|The {{role that}} Pope John XXI {{played in the}} lead up to the {{condemnation}}s is a more recent point of discussion.

However, more than forty days after Tempier produced his list, another papal letter gives no indication that the Pope was as yet aware of Tempier's action, and seems to suggest otherwise. It is therefore possible that Tempier had already been preparing his condemnations prior to receiving the Pope's first letter. The Pope himself had not played any direct role in the condemnations, having merely requested an investigation, and one scholar has argued that there was [...] "less than enthusiastic papal approval of the bishop of Paris' actions." ...|$|E
