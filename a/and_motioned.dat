O'Hara first attempted to surrender to Rochambeau, who {{shook his head and}} pointed to Washington. O'Hara then offered his sword to Washington, who also refused <b>and</b> <b>motioned</b> to Benjamin Lincoln. The surrender finally took place when Washington's second-in-command accepted the sword of Cornwallis' deputy.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Capitals then signed Brashear on July 14, 2006, to a one-year, $1 million contract. The signing was {{to provide}} Alexander Ovechkin with some on-ice protection. Capitals {{management}} felt that Brashear was skilled enough {{not to be a}} liability on the team while bringing an intimidating presence. During the 2006–07 season, the Capitals decided to extend Brashear's contract, signing him to a one-year, $1.1 million contract extension. He was suspended one game by the NHL during the regular season for punching New York Rangers defenceman Aaron Ward following a fight between Brashear and Brendan Shanahan. In the game, Shanahan felt Brashear was taking liberties with Rangers captain Jaromír Jágr, and subsequently challenged Brashear to a fight. Brashear won the fight <b>and</b> <b>motioned</b> as if he was dusting off his hands. Ward then approached him and had words with Brashear, who responded by punching him in the face, earning Brashear a game misconduct for intent to injure and eventually the suspension. At season's end, his point total increased from the previous season to 13 and his 156 PIMs ranked him in the top ten (sixth) in the League for the sixth time in his career. In the 2007–08 season, Brashear played in 80 games for the Capitals, but his offensive production slipped down to eight points while registering only 119 PIMs. However, he served as one of the Capitals' alternate captains. On January 24, 2008, the Capitals once again re-signed Brashear, this time to a one-year, $1.2 million extension.|$|E

O'Neill immediately shot bin Laden twice in the forehead, then once more as bin Laden crumpled to the floor. Matt Bissonnette, who entered the room at about the same time, also claims to have fired shots into bin Laden's fallen body. Simultaneously, in these versions, one of bin Laden's wives, Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah is said to have screamed at the SEALs in Arabic <b>and</b> <b>motioned</b> as if she were about to charge.

Stereo <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> image analysis are intimately connected and can provide complementary information to obtain robust estimates of scene structure <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b> We present an information fusion based approach for multi-camera and multi-body structure <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> that combines bottom-up and top-down knowledge on scene structure <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b> The only assumption we make is that all scene motion consists of rigid motion. We present experimental results on synthetic and nonsynthetic data sets, demonstrating excellent performance compared to binocular based state-of-the-art approaches for structure <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b> ...|$|R

After the sponsorship speeches, Representatives Lagman, Suarez, Marcoleta, Carlos M. Padilla, Syjuco, Albano, Mitos Magsaysay and Cagas served as interpellators. In the period of interpellation, Tupas gave way to Fariñas when it was Syjuco's turn to interpellate. Syjuco then accused Tupas of vested interest; Deputy Speaker Arnulfo Fuentebella (NPC, Camarines Sur–4th) reminded him [...] "to avoid attacking personalities," [...] <b>and</b> <b>motioned</b> to strike off Syjuco's remarks from the record for being [...] "unparliamentary language." [...] Syjuco, who called Tupas [...] "a coward," [...] was about to divulge the meeting among Tupas, Tupas Sr., and Gutierrez; Tupas said that as being his godfather at his wedding, he could not face Syjuco. Syjuco later cut short his interpellation, but after accusing Tupas anew of using the impeachment as part of his senatorial ambitions.|$|E

50|$|Newton {{asserted}} that time, space, <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> {{can be distinguished}} into absolute/relative, true/apparent, mathematical/vulgar. In so doing, he assumed that time, space, <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> are usually thought of as being related to sensible things. But they also, he assumed, have an inner nature that exists apart from a spectator's mind and has no relation to sensible things. He described an absolute time, space, <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> that are distinguished from relative or apparent time, space, <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b> Berkeley disagreed. To him, all motion is relative because the idea that Berkeley had of motion necessarily included relation. By pure space, I mean that I conceive that I can move {{my arms and legs}} without anything resisting them. Space is less pure when there is more resistance by other bodies. Space, therefore, is an idea that is relative to body <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|R
