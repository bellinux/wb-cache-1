5|$|Concerning the {{development}} of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they {{would not be able to}} get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive up to a certain limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands to also facing each other in <b>a</b> <b>pose</b> referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior.|$|E
5|$|Ingres was self-critical and {{consumed}} by self-doubt. He often took months {{to complete a}} portrait, leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding <b>a</b> <b>pose</b> to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive, three are signed and dated. Ingres was a master draftsman and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. The sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights {{of one kind or}} another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold <b>a</b> <b>pose</b> for long periods in the studio.|$|E

5|$|The scene {{changes to}} a beach-like bar {{equipped}} with cabanas and sand scattered through the floor. Each girl {{is dressed in}} beach draps and dance with a man as the scene interchanges with Fetty Wap's rap verse. A product placement for the app Friendable with the group's invitation is shown. The girls perform a dance routine in-sync as Normani and Dinah are shown individually dancing near a rock and on the sand. The video ends with each making <b>a</b> <b>pose</b> as the cinematic black bars close.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme music}} was {{composed}} by Peter Davis (who {{after the second}} series composed {{the rest of the}} series alone as principal composer), John Mealing and John G. Perry. The opening titles show the main characters striking <b>a</b> <b>pose,</b> with the name of the respective actor in a typewriter style typeface. Steven Moffat and Julia Sawalha were not very impressed with the opening titles when discussing them for a DVD commentary in 2004. They were re-recorded for series three, in the same style, to address the actors' ages and alterations to the set.|$|E
5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia stands in <b>a</b> <b>pose</b> which Etty had sketched many times, that {{of a woman with}} her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a woman in this pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish {{than the rest of the}} canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later in a studio.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the task}} model of problem posing and the format of {{assignments}} in Monsakun, there are five main constraints must be satisfied in posed problems, which are the following: (1) calculation, (2) story type, (3) number, (4) concepts/objects, and (5) sentence structure. When <b>a</b> <b>posed</b> problem satisfies all five constraints, the required problem in the assignment is successfully <b>posed.</b> When <b>a</b> <b>posed</b> problem satisfies less than five constraints, the posed problem partially fills the requirements and the unsatisfied constraints represent {{the cause of the}} inadequateness for the requirements. This also means that the posed problem is not meaningless, because it still satisfies some constraints. When <b>a</b> <b>posed</b> problem satisfies no constraint, the problem is meaningless.|$|R
5|$|The console {{versions}} of Sonic Generations were first released in North America on November 1, 2011, {{followed by a}} European release on November 4 and in Japan on December 1. The Windows version was released on November 3; it is available physically and digitally via Steam. The 3DS version was released on in North America on November 22, 2011, and in Europe on November 25. The console and 3DS versions were made available for digital download in 2012. An official strategy guide for the game was published by BradyGames. In addition to the standard retail release, a collector's edition for the console version was released in Europe and Australia. It features the game and manual in limited lenticular box art in a steelbook case, a special booklet containing various Sonic artwork, a documentary disc {{about the history of}} Sonic, Sonic Generations: 20 Years of Sonic Music, a limited and individually numbered gold ring, and a figurine of both Classic and Modern Sonic striking <b>a</b> <b>pose</b> on a ring.|$|E
5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} {{in very different}} styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in <b>a</b> <b>pose</b> that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} showing Beyoncé against a green wall and Jay-Z {{sitting on a}} chair inside a dark room. Beyoncé and Jay-Z then start to {{simultaneously}} play imaginary instruments, mimicking the song's tune. Scenes of Beyoncé are then shown in several different rooms wearing different outfits. As the chorus begins, she is shown running around and dancing out in a large sugarcane field. At {{the end of the}} chorus, she dances in a red dress in front of a pond and in a large red dress out in front of a mansion. When Jay-Z's verse begins, the two are shown alone inside a room, Beyoncé is now barefoot and bare-legged, she dances seductively around Jay-Z, and leads to the controversial oral sex scene. Beyoncé is then shown wearing a green skirt and bedazzled bra while dancing around in sand. As the song progresses, she is shown dancing alone in a dark forest wearing a sparkling black dress as fireflies circle around her head. The song ends with Beyoncé leaning back in <b>a</b> <b>pose</b> as fireflies race away.|$|E

5|$|By N42 and S89 the equestrian parade {{is at an}} end, and the {{following}} 16 figures on the north and 18 on the south are taken to be the elders of Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art. Four of these figures raise their right hand in a clenched fist gesture suggestive of <b>a</b> <b>pose</b> associated with the thallophoroi (olive branch bearers) who were older men chosen in competition for their good looks alone. No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107–114, N20–28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the lyre) and four aulos (flute) players. N16–19 and S115–118 (conjectured) perhaps, as hydriaphoroi, the water-vessel carriers, here men, rather than metic girls mentioned {{in the literature on}} the Panathenaia. N13–15, S119–121 are the skaphephoroi, the tray bearers of the honeycombs and cakes used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1–12, S122–149 are the four cows and four sheep on the north and ten cows on the south meant for sacrifice on the acropolis, presumably an abbreviated form of the hecatomb usually offered on this occasion – there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.|$|E

25|$|As {{has been}} {{established}} by X-ray analysis, Manet painted his Self-Portrait with Palette over a portrait in profile of his wife Suzanne Manet.
