5|$|Social Worker: Every {{patient is}} {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E
5|$|Among those {{held and}} {{executed}} at the Tower was Anne Boleyn. Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17thcenturies their main duty had become {{to look after}} the prisoners. The Tower was often <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> than other prisons in London such as the Fleet, where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605. Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself, and 112people were executed on the hill over 400years. Before the 20thcentury, there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green; {{as was the case with}} Lady Jane Grey, this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous. After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554, Queen MaryI imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen ElizabethI, in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name.|$|E

In 1573 the village was plundered by the Turkish beg of Esztergom (Strigonia).

Sixteen local armorers, including Johannes Moll, were actively engaged in repair work at the factory.

They were rescued by Jerzy Zakulski. He engaged his whole family in the rescue mission including his father-in-law Jan Bahr, hiding Maria and her child in both households by turns. Eventually, they took them out of the city to <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> of a cousin Zofia Strycharska in Myślenice. Both Maria and her daughter survived the war and returned to Kraków afterwards. In her letter to the Stalinist military court in Warsaw dated 23 June 1947, Maria, living at 32 Długa street at the time, insisted that the Zakulskis had all risked their lives to save theirs.|$|E
25|$|Later (in 1569), Miguel López de Legazpi {{transferred}} the Spanish headquarters from Cebu to Panay. On 5 June 1569, Guido de Lavezaris, the royal treasurer in the Archipelago, wrote to Philip II reporting about the Portuguese attack to Cebu {{in the preceding}} autumn. A letter from another official, Andres de Mirandaola (dated three days later - 8 June), also described briefly this encounter with the Portuguese. The danger of another attack led the Spaniards to remove their camp from Cebu to Panay, which they considered <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place.</b> Legazpi himself, in his report to the Viceroy in New Spain (dated 1 July 1569), mentioned the same reason for the relocation of Spaniards to Panay. It was in Panay that the conquest of Luzon was planned, and launched on 8 May 1570.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{conquest of}} Melaka. According to the Annals, the Portuguese forces, led by Afonso de Albuquerque, {{launched}} a second assault on Melaka {{during the reign}} of Ahmad Shah, the first being repulsed by the late Bendahara Tun Mutahir. The assault on the city was great on the first day, and on the second, Melaka fell to the Portuguese. However, according to Portuguese records, Albuquerque's assault on Melaka started on 25 July 1511, (on St. James Day), and the battle lasted for 15 days before the city was captured on 15 August. Also, Portuguese records, especially the ones written by Albuquerque's son, mention that the Melakan Commander-In-Chief, Ahmad Shah, fell on the field of battle.

25|$|Maximilian I shared rule {{with his}} father during the latter year of Frederick's reign, being elected King of the Romans in 1486. By {{acquiring}} the lands of the Tyrolean line of the Habsburgs in 1490 he finally reunited all the Austrian lands, divided since 1379. He also needed {{to deal with the}} Hungarian problem when Mathias I died in 1490. Maximilian reconquered the lost parts of Austria and established peace with Mathias's successor Vladislaus II at the Peace of Pressburg in 1491. However the dynastic pattern of division and unification would be one that kept repeating itself over time. With unsettled borders Maximilian found Innsbruck in the Tyrol <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> for a capital, between his Burgundian and Austrian lands, although he was rarely in any place for very long, being acutely aware of how his father had been repeatedly besieged in Vienna.|$|E
25|$|Roads are, {{by their}} nature, used by {{vehicles}} {{and it is}} clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is {{at risk of being}} further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more proximate cause. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place</b> or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be imputed objectively.|$|E

In September, Bernhardt was asked by the Minister of War to move to <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>place.</b> She departed for a villa on the Bay of Arcachon, where her physician discovered that gangrene had developed on her injured leg. She was transported to Bordeaux, where on 22 February 1915, a surgeon amputated her leg almost to the hip. She refused the idea of an artificial leg, crutches, or a wheelchair, and instead was usually carried in a palanquin she designed, supported by two long shafts and carried by two men. She had the chair decorated in the Lous XV style, with white sides and gilded trim.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an effort to give voice to an {{experience}}. The experience in question is the decision of a student to trust a practitioner. The study also describes the features which led the student to believe that the practitioner would provide a "safe place" for interaction around matters of a delicate or personal nature. This study is the gift oftwo coauthors, each with a unique story which offers description of critical incidents, and what made these events meaningful. At the heart of the study is the potential for education and its professionals to provide <b>safe</b> <b>places</b> for students. Analysis of the data determines that <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> involves two parties, one seeking <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> and another who provides the safe place-in this study, the student and the practitioner. The student, with urgency, seeks <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> to disclose personal information. In this urgency the student is confronted with features of control, comfort, respect, felt sense, and nonjudgemental listening. These features are the constitutive elements of <b>a</b> <b>Safe</b> <b>Place.</b> Capacity to recognize and construct <b>safe</b> <b>places</b> is <b>a</b> competency which the existing school lifeworld demands of today's practitioners.

As searches for missing personnel continued inside the headquarters, 42 more bodies were found and it was wrongly thought that more than 130 regular army officers had been killed by the rebels. As of 27 February, the official death toll had risen to 54. The body of BDR chief Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed was found among those of 41 other army officials. A mass grave was found inside, near the BDR hospital. A total of 42 officers were found buried inside a seven-foot-deep hole. Some bodies had been thrown into drain tunnels. Out of 58 bodies that were found, 52 were army officials. Beginning on 27 February, the government declared a three-day period of national mourning.|$|E
