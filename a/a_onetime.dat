500|$|According to Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune, [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] hearkens {{back to the}} folk-rock music Madonna {{had done}} in the past, but differs due to the usage of finger claps and some [...] "brisk strings". Kot found that with the lyrics [...] "addressing {{character}} flaws and missteps with unprecedented candor, [...] suggests how <b>a</b> <b>onetime</b> provocateur can mature and still remain interesting, if not remain {{at the center of}} pop culture as she once was." [...] Calling it the album's [...] "most successful pop moment", Evan Sawdey from PopMatters observed that Madonna made numerous references to her past with the lyrics. He listed instances like Madonna's strained relationship with her father, to the singer's narcissistic image in the media. Sawdey also believed that instead of being [...] "self-referential", the lyrics rather portrayed a more humane side of the singer.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{convention}} managers {{sought a}} Southerner as vice presidential candidate, {{to balance the}} ticket. Clay disciples such as John M. Clayton of Delaware, Willie Mangum of North Carolina and Virginia's Benjamin Watkins Leigh were discussed, but all of Clay's close associates refused or {{were believed to be}} unwilling to run. Former senator John Tyler of Virginia, <b>a</b> <b>onetime</b> Democrat who had broken with Jackson over states' rights, had been a regional Whig candidate for vice president in 1836, and had supported Clay at the convention. Harrison, out of communication in distant North Bend, was not consulted. Weed's assistant, Horace Greeley, later claimed Tyler had wept at Clay's defeat, and this had gotten him the nomination. The vote was unanimous, but Virginia's ballots were not cast. Diarist Philip Hone, following President Harrison's death after a month in office in 1841, would write of Tyler's nomination, [...] "there was rhyme, but no reason to it". [...] Michael F. Holt, who in his history of the Whig Party chronicled President Tyler's departure from it, noted, [...] "the choice of Tyler would later prove to be a disaster".|$|E

500|$|At {{the urging}} of Senator Clay, Harrison quickly called a special session of Congress. [...] With the Whigs to {{organize}} the House for the first time, Fillmore sought the Speakership, but it went to a Clay acolyte, John White of Kentucky. Nevertheless, Fillmore was made chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Harrison was expected {{to go along with}} anything Clay and other congressional Whig leaders proposed, but died on April 4, 1841, elevating Vice President Tyler to the presidency. Tyler, <b>a</b> <b>onetime</b> maverick Democrat, soon broke with Clay over congressional proposals for a national bank to stabilize the currency, which he vetoed twice, leading to his expulsion from the Whig Party. Fillmore remained on the fringes of that conflict, generally supporting the congressional Whig position, but his chief achievement as Ways and Means chairman was the Tariff of 1842. [...] The existing tariff did not protect manufacturing, and part of the revenue was distributed to the states, a decision made in better times that was by then depleting the Treasury. Fillmore prepared a bill raising tariff rates that was popular in the country, but the continuation of distribution assured a Tyler veto, and much political advantage for the Whigs. Once Tyler vetoed it, a House committee headed by Massachusetts' John Quincy Adams condemned his actions. [...] Fillmore prepared a second bill, this time omitting distribution, and when it reached his desk, Tyler signed it, but in the process offended his erstwhile Democratic allies. Thus, Fillmore not only achieved his legislative goal, but managed to politically isolate Tyler.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood married Margaret Neville [...] "Maggie" [...] Johnson (born 1931; {{then working}} for an auto parts {{suppliers}} company) on December 19, 1953 in Pasadena. They had met {{six months earlier}} {{on a blind date}} in Los Angeles, although Eastwood subsequently had a serious relationship in Seattle that summer with a young woman who became pregnant with his child—an alleged daughter who was given up for adoption, per biographer Patrick McGilligan—before Johnson announced her engagement to him in October. The marriage would not prove altogether smooth. [...] "He thought they were too young, not well enough established," [...] remarked biographer Richard Schickel in the only authorized book ever written about Eastwood. A decade later, an ongoing affair Eastwood was involved in (said to have lasted 14 years) with dancer and Rawhide stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis (who was also married yet separated) produced his earliest verified child, daughter Kimber Eastwood (born Kimber Tunis; June 17, 1964), whose existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989, when the National Enquirer revealed her identity. Biographer Marc Eliot wrote of Johnson, [...] "It is difficult to say for sure that she actually knew about the baby, although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to. Everyone on the set knew ... and it is simply too difficult to keep a secret like that when the mother and the illegitimate child live in the same small town, especially when that small town is Hollywood." [...] The source for the 1989 Enquirer article that originally broke the story claimed Johnson was aware of Kimber's existence at all times and even met Roxanne Tunis in person when making an unannounced visit to the set of Breezy in 1972. Actress Barbara Eden, <b>a</b> <b>onetime</b> Rawhide guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis, said of Eastwood's relationship with Johnson: [...] "They conducted a somewhat open marriage." ...|$|E

25|$|A severe ADAMTS13 {{deficiency}} below 5% or <10% of {{the normal}} (depending on the definitions) is highly specific for the diagnosis of TTP. ADAMTS13 activity assays {{are based on the}} direct or indirect measurement of VWF-cleavage products. Its activity should be measured in blood samples taken before therapy has started, to prevent false high ADAMTS13 activity. If a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is present an ADAMTS13 inhibitor assay is needed to distinguish between the acquired, autoantibody-mediated and the congenital form of TTP (USS). The presence of antibodies can be tested by ELISA or functional inhibitor assays. The level of ADAMTS13 inhibitor may be fluctuating over the course of disease and depends on free circulatory antibodies, therefore <b>an</b> <b>onetime</b> negative test result does not always exclude the presence of ADAMTS13 inhibitors and thereby an autoimmune origin of TTP. A severe ADAMTS13 deficiency {{in the absence of an}} inhibitor, confirmed on a second time point in a healthy episode of a possible USS patient, usually sets the trigger to perform a molecular analysis of the ADAMTS13 gene to confirm a mutation. In unclear cases a plasma infusion trial can be done, showing an USS in the absence of anti-ADAMTS13-antibodies a full recovery of infused plasma-ADAMTS13 activity as well as a plasma half-life of infused ADAMTS13 activity of 2–4 days. A deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity in first-degree relatives is also a very strong indicator for an Upshaw-Schulman Syndrome.|$|R
