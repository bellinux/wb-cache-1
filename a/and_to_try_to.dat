An additional twenty-five warships were at once outfitted {{and sent to}} join Flaccus' fleet of twenty-five warships already at Tarentum, with orders to guard the Italian Adriatic coast, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> determine Philip's intent and if necessary cross over to Macedonia, keeping Philip confined there.|$|E

5|$|James Clark Ross's 1839–43 Antarctic {{expedition}} in HMS Erebus and HMS Terror was {{a full-scale}} Royal Naval enterprise, the principal function {{of which was}} to test current theories on magnetism, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> locate the South Magnetic Pole. The expedition had first been proposed by leading astronomer Sir John Herschel, and {{was supported by the}} Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Ross had considerable past experience in magnetic observation and Arctic exploration; in May 1831 he {{had been a member of}} a party that had reached the location of the North Magnetic Pole, and he was an obvious choice as commander.|$|E

Zabala requested assistance for his wounded soldiers, which San Martín provided and he invited Zabala to share a large breakfast, which he accepted. San Martín was aware that the new enlightened ideas {{at stake in the}} Napoleonic Wars influenced many of the Spanish military, and expected to convince Zabala that absolutism was a bad cause to defend. He succeeded, as Zabala joined the patriot forces under San Martín's command during his administration in Mendoza.|$|E
5|$|Under Weinberg's {{tenure as}} director, ORNL's Biology Division grew {{to five times}} the size of the next largest {{division}}. This division was charged with understanding how ionizing radiation interacts with living things <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find ways to help them survive radiation damage, such as bone marrow transplants. In the 1960s Weinberg also pursued new missions for ORNL, such as using nuclear energy to desalinate seawater. He recruited Philip Hammond from the Los Alamos National Laboratory to further this mission and in 1970 started the first big ecology project in the United States: the National Science Foundation— Research Applied to National Needs Environmental Program.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} qualify {{on the final}} day of the 2009 campaign, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said {{anything}} short of a playoff spot in 2010 would be unacceptable. With that directive, former director of soccer Mo Johnston hired Preki and made wholesale changes to the roster to reflect the U.S. Hall of Famer's plan to play a tough, defensive style. Despite scoring troubles, TFC played well at the start, going undefeated in seven games at one time. The team struggled following the World Cup break. Sensing problems in the locker room <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> salvage the season, MLSE dismissed both Johnston and Preki on September 14, naming Earl Cochrane interim director of soccer and Nick Dasovic interim coach. The players responded to Dasovic's more open flexible style, but it wasn't enough as the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three games left in the season. Off-field issues with season-seat holders over the 2011 season ticket package added to the fans' frustrations, forcing MLSE to hold a series of town hall meetings.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Hitler {{signed the}} Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat), a {{treaty with the}} Vatican that {{required}} the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offenses. Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings. Hitler often vacillated {{on whether or not}} the Kirchenkampf (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue; in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.|$|E
5|$|In late March 1889, {{just as the}} izinDuna {{were about}} to leave London, Rhodes arrived to make the {{amalgamation}} with Cawston and Gifford official. To the amalgamators' dismay, the Colonial Office had received protests against the Rudd Concession {{from a number of}} London businessmen and humanitarian societies, and had resolved that it could not sanction the concession because of its equivocal nature, as well as the fact that Lobengula had announced its suspension. Rhodes was originally angry with Maund, accusing him of responsibility for this, but eventually accepted that it was not Maund's fault. Rhodes told Maund to go back to Bulawayo, to pose as an impartial adviser, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sway the king back in favour of the concession; as an added contingency, he told Maund to secure as many new subconcessions as he could.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} history of the park, {{visitors}} were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. Visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with the bears, who had learned to beg for food. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe bears in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. The eighth recorded bear-related death in the park's history occurred in August 2015.|$|E

In a psychiatric interview, a psychiatrist or psychologist or nurse asks a battery of questions to complete what is called a psychiatric assessment. Sometimes two people are interviewed by an interviewer, with one format being called couple interviews.
