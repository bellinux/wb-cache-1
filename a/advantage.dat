5|$|In 1997, Roberts {{stunned the}} racing world {{when he left}} Yamaha after more than 25 years {{to start his own}} {{motorcycle}} company. Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England to take <b>advantage</b> of the Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. He decided to take <b>advantage</b> of rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility and handling <b>advantage</b> of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time the motorcycle had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any <b>advantage</b> over four-cylinder bikes had been negated. The motorcycle did manage to win a pole position with rider Jeremy McWilliams taking the top qualifying position at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix against the new breed of 990cc four-stroke MotoGP motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair <b>advantage.</b> After initial research showed the blades did provide an <b>advantage,</b> the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an <b>advantage</b> and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E
5|$|In chess a minor {{material}} <b>advantage</b> {{is important}} as when material gets exchanged, the relative <b>advantage</b> becomes larger. Because new pieces come in, {{there is no}} endgame play in bughouse and material is therefore less important. It is common to sacrifice pieces in bughouse while attacking, defending or hunting down a certain piece which the partner requires.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} location-specific (L) <b>advantages</b> in the spatial distribution of multinational enterprise (MNE) R&D activity. The meaning of L <b>advantages</b> is revisited. In addition to L <b>advantages</b> that are industry-specific, the paper emphasises {{that there is an}} important category of L <b>advantages,</b> referred to as collocation <b>advantages.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Using the OLI framework, this paper highlights that the innovation activities of MNEs are about interaction of these variables, and the essential process of internalising L <b>advantages</b> to enhance and create firm-specific <b>advantages.</b> Findings – Collocation <b>advantages</b> derive from spatial proximity to specific unaffiliated firms, which may be suppliers, competitors, or customers. It is also argued that L <b>advantages</b> are not always public goods, because they may not be available to all firms at a similar or marginal cost. These costs are associated with access and internalisation of L <b>advantages,</b> and – {{especially in the case of}} R&D – are attendant with the complexities of embeddedness. Originality/value – The centralisation/decentralisation, spatial separation/collocation debates in R&D location have been mistakenly viewed as a paradox facing firms, instead of as a trade-off that firms must make. ...|$|R

5|$|Statistician Jeff Sonas, in {{examining}} data from 266,000games played between 1994 and 2001, concluded that White scored 54.1767% plus 0.001164 times White's Elo rating <b>advantage,</b> treating White's rating <b>advantage</b> as +390 {{if it is}} better than +390, or −460 if it is worse than −460. He found that White's <b>advantage</b> is equivalent to 35 rating points, i.e. if White has a rating 35points below Black's, each player will have an expected score of 50%. Sonas also found that White's <b>advantage</b> is smaller (53%) in rapid games than in games at a slower ("classical") time control. In the 462 games played at the 2009 World Blitz Chess Championship, White scored only 52.16% (W38.96 D26.41 L 34.63).|$|E

5|$|Tactically, the Persian fleet {{should have}} held the <b>advantage</b> at sea, since the Athenian {{part of the}} Greek fleet was, despite their efforts at Artemisium and Salamis, still raw in seamanship. However, whether because of their low morale, or {{because they were in}} fact outnumbered, the Persians sought instead the {{tactical}} <b>advantage</b> of joining up with the army under Tigranes, and fortifying a position. However, when the Greeks chose to fight on land, the Persians then threw away the <b>advantage</b> of their fortifications by emerging to fight the Greeks in the open field. Furthermore, as Marathon and Thermopylae had shown, large numbers conferred little <b>advantage</b> against the more heavily armoured hoplites; thus, as the battle began, it was the Greeks who had the tactical upper hand.|$|E
5|$|The first-move <b>advantage</b> in chess is the {{inherent}} <b>advantage</b> {{of the player}} (White) who makes the first move in chess. Chess players and theorists generally agree that White begins the game with some <b>advantage.</b> Since 1851, compiled statistics support this view; White consistently wins slightly more often than Black, usually scoring between 52 and 56percent. White's winning percentage {{is about the same}} for tournament games between humans and games between computers. However, White's <b>advantage</b> is less significant in blitz games and games between novices.|$|E

5|$|After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz {{variation}} 3...Ne4 which {{concentrates on}} the rapid development of pieces, but the most common move is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The Adler variation 4.Nf3 sees White seeking a spatial <b>advantage</b> in the centre with his pieces, notably the important d5-square. The Alekhine variation 4.e4 gives White an important spatial <b>advantage</b> and a strong pawn centre. The Rubinstein variation 4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+, between 6.Nbd2 and 6.Nc3. The reply 6.Nbd2 brings a positional game in which White enjoys the bishop pair and tries to break through on the queenside, while 6.Nc3 keeps the material <b>advantage</b> of a pawn {{at the cost of}} a weakening of the white pawn structure. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game (many lines can shock opponents that do not know the theory) or cripple White's pawn structure.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote <b>advantage,</b> where individuals with two different alleles have a selective <b>advantage</b> over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E

In an effort to cut the American frigate's <b>advantage</b> in speed, La Vengeance changed course to the {{south-east}} where the wind would give her an <b>advantage.</b> As he maneuvered his vessel, Pitot was able to unleash a broadside aimed at Constellations rigging. The American frigate waited to return fire until she'd gained the weather gage. Now having the <b>advantage</b> of the wind, Truxton's opening double-shotted broadside slammed into the port side of La Vengeances hull. Sailing side by side, the two frigates continued to engage each other {{for two and a}} half hours while Truxton attempted unsuccessfully to move his ship into a raking fire position. As the French tended to aim for the rigging, at one point Constellations foresails were shot away and the frigate lost her maneuverability until they could be replaced.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the <b>advantages</b> and {{limitations}} of the implementation of a community-based method in post-disaster housing reconstruction. Design/methodology/approach – The research was based on multiple case studies in the implementation of a Community-based Post-disaster Housing Reconstruction project (CPHRP) in Indonesia. Data was gathered by conducting semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey. Findings – The research reveals 22 <b>advantages</b> of a CPHRP. Four <b>advantages</b> can be categorised as highly significant. They are: create sense of ownership, fit to local culture/customs/wisdom, build beneficiaries’ confidence, and minimize corruption. There are some <b>advantages</b> that cannot be delivered if the housing reconstruction is conducted using a contractor-based approach. It was also found that psychological <b>advantages</b> are more dominant than the physical <b>advantages.</b> Despite its numerous <b>advantages,</b> CPHRP has limitations.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{examine the impact of}} the foreign {{activities}} of firms on their international competitiveness. It addresses questions such as: to what extent and under what conditions can firms compensate for deteriorating location <b>advantages</b> of their home country and maintain their lead in an industry through investment in foreign countries? Under what conditions can firms reap the benefits of a locationally advantageous foreign country? These questions are examined with reference to selected US professional service industries. The findings show that FDI weakens the link between the location <b>advantages</b> of home countries and the ownership <b>advantages</b> of firms, as it enables firms to develop <b>advantages</b> which are not directly related to the location <b>advantages</b> of their home countries. However, this impact is very moderate, and is exercised through the indirect impact of FDI on the <b>advantages</b> of firms and countries. The ownership <b>advantages</b> which firms develop in their home countries are the most critical determinant of their competitiveness. ...|$|R
