5|$|By September15, shelters {{were opened}} {{throughout}} Tinian and Saipan at local schools, most schools and all governmental buildings {{were closed and}} residents rushed to board up their homes. The American Red Cross had also mobilized on the islands by this time. Some private schools were open during the morning but let out early to <b>allow</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> return to their families before the typhoon's arrival. On Saipan, 179 residents sought refuge in shelters by the afternoon of September15, by which time heavy rain had begun falling. Only one flight was delayed by the typhoon across all the islands. The youth basketball league in the Northern Mariana Islands canceled their games for the time Choi-wan passed through the islands. At {{the height of the}} storm, a total of 270 residents sought refuge in shelters on Saipan.|$|E

On 27 January 2017, {{a total of}} 3,398 staff and students both institutions came together to craft knots on a triple-ring with red strings, which resembles the school logo. The event set a national record for the most people making knotted rings together. A dedicated maker-space was also opened on 10 March 2017.

5|$|Weak {{attacks from}} uke {{allow for a}} {{conditioned}} response from tori, and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles <b>allow</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that {{there is no need to}} adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E
5|$|Willamette {{also offers}} five 3+3 Programs to <b>allow</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> earn both an {{undergraduate}} degree and law degree {{in a total}} of six years. Through partnerships with Willamette's College of Liberal Arts, Oregon State University, OSU-Cascades, Portland State University, and University of Alaska Anchorage, students can earn a bachelor's degree and a law degree in six years, amounting to a decrease of one year from the standard seven years combined to earn both a bachelor and law degree. Both JD and joint degree students can enroll in the certificate programs, studying abroad, working at the Clinical Law Program, and taking classes from the Center for Dispute Resolution.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighth}} game, the {{competition}} {{had become more}} than a battle for hockey supremacy: it was also viewed as a battle between contrasting ways of life, particularly in the Soviet Union, where success in sport was used to promote the superiority of communism over western capitalism. An estimated 50 million Soviets watched the final contest, while in Canada, offices were closed and schools suspended classes to <b>allow</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> watch the game on television in gymnasium assemblies. The two teams ended the first period tied at two goals apiece, but Canada trailed at the second intermission, 5–3, and Soviet officials stated they would claim the overall victory if the game ended in a draw {{as a result of}} scoring more goals throughout the series. Canada rallied in the third period to tie the game with seven minutes remaining.|$|E
30|$|<b>To</b> {{maximize}} <b>student</b> comfort, reduce anxiety, {{and maximize}} idea sharing, instructors could consider <b>allowing</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> choose which other students {{they work with}} during class. Previous research suggests that <b>allowing</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> choose their own groups during active learning could be anxiety-reducing for students and particularly beneficial for female and LGBTQIA students (Cooper and Brownell 2016; Eddy et al. 2015 a; Theobald et al. 2017). However, this current study suggests that <b>allowing</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> choose whom they work with may reduce all students’ anxiety because they can choose partners who they are most comfortable with.|$|R

5|$|Housed in the Truman Wesley Collins Legal Center, Willamette's College of Law offers both {{full-time}} and part-time enrollment {{for the doctor}} of jurisprudence (JD) degree, joint-degree programs, and a Master of Laws (LLM) program. The joint-degree programs <b>allow</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> earn both a JD and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) concurrently in a four-year program, or complete a bachelor's degree and JD in six years. Willamette Law's oldest legal journal is the Willamette Law Review, which started in 1960 and is housed in the Oregon Civic Justice Center. The center is a community outreach center located in a renovated library that Willamette opened in 2008. According to Willamette's 2016 ABA-required disclosures, 52.63% of the Class of 2016 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. Of all 2016 grads who passed the bar, 84.31% had full-time, long-term, JD-required employment.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{was drawn}} into the Holley {{controversy}} during the 1824 presidential election. When no candidate achieved {{a majority of the}} electoral votes cast, the contest was resolved by the U.S. House of Representatives. Desha and the New Court partisans in the General Assembly instructed the state's congressional delegation to cast their votes for Andrew Jackson, but the delegation, led by House Speaker Henry Clay, defied these instructions and voted instead for John Quincy Adams. Because of this vote, Clay, a trustee for Transylvania and supporter of Holley, became Desha's political enemy. Desha's hostility for Transylvania and Holley worsened when, {{in the aftermath of the}} Isaac Desha trial, a student at Transylvania delivered a speech critical of the governor in the university's chapel. Although Holley was present for the speech, Transylvania historian John D. Wright, Jr. wrote that he did not know the student's topic beforehand and after hearing the speech, made no effort to condone its content. It was Holley's practice, however, to <b>allow</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> speak openly about current political matters, regardless of which position they took. Desha maintained that, because Holley had not silenced the student, he was at fault for tacitly condoning disrespectful criticism of the state's chief executive.|$|E
