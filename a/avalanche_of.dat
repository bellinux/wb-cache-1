5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E
5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E

40|$|Many natural {{processes}} on the Earth are the cyclic ones {{and they are}} self - sustaining within a system of the Sun–Earth relations. To verify our hypothesis on a cyclic occurrence <b>of</b> the <b>avalanche</b> processes and to estimate a possibility to predict avalanches as a cyclic process we had analyzed information about avalanches and meteorological processes (number <b>of</b> <b>avalanches</b> per a day, their total and maximal volumes, and daily sums of precipitation) using the method of 27 - day Sun (solar) calendars by A. Chizhevskiy. Analysis of results of such studies obtained in Khibini (Kola peninsula, for 1935 – 1986) and on a Chamginskiy mountain pass (the Sakhalin Island, Vostochno - Sakhalinskie Mountains, for 1982 – 1992) had shown that activity <b>of</b> the <b>avalanche</b> processes and the atmospheric precipitation had evident 27 - day solar cycle. Cyclicity of appearance and volume <b>of</b> <b>avalanches</b> <b>of</b> both syngenetic and epigenetic types is established {{as well as of}} the precipitation in quantitative gradations. Procedures of prediction of number and volume <b>of</b> <b>avalanches</b> and daily precipitation were developed on the basis of their relationship with the Sun cycles.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} a {{well-known}} model of genetic regulatory networks, namely that of Random Boolean Networks (RBNs), allows one to study in depth the relationship between two important properties of complex systems, i. e. dynamical criticality and power-law distributions. The study is based upon {{an analysis of the}} response of a RBN to permanent perturbations, that may lead to <b>avalanches</b> <b>of</b> changes in activation levels, whose statistical properties are determined by the same parameter that characterizes the dynamical state of the network (ordered, critical or disordered). Under suitable approximations, in the case of large sparse random networks an analytical expression for the probability density <b>of</b> <b>avalanches</b> <b>of</b> different sizes is proposed, and it is shown that for not-too-small <b>avalanches</b> <b>of</b> critical systems it may be approximated by a power law.

5|$|The <b>avalanche</b> <b>of</b> {{editorial}} opinion {{continued the}} following day, Sunday, September 21, but Eisenhower continued to withhold judgment.

Eisenhower decided to ask the Los Angeles law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher for a legal opinion, while asking the accounting firm Price Waterhouse to audit the Fund's records. Nixon, meanwhile, was encouraged by a supportive telegram from his mother and discouraged by one from former Minnesota governor Harold Stassen urging him to resign from the ticket. New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, a Nixon supporter, called to tell the senator that most Eisenhower aides favored his removal, and that if Nixon made the telecast, he should call for people to write to express their opinions. Dewey added that if the response was not strongly pro-Nixon, the senator should leave the ticket.|$|E
