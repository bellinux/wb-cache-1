2500|$|At 9 {{o'clock on}} the evening of Saturday, 6 April 1861 near Portobello Bridge, a horse-drawn bus, driven by Patrick Hardy, had just dropped off a {{passenger}} <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steep incline of the bridge when one of the horses started to rear. [...] The driver tried to turn the horses but both horses became uncontrollable with fear and backed the bus through the wooden rails of the bridge. The bus, horses and six passengers inside the bus, plunged into the dark cold waters of the canal lock, which was about 6 metres (20feet) deep, with 3 metres (10feet) of water at the bottom. [...] The conductor was able to jump clear and a passing policeman pulled the driver from the water. [...] Despite the frantic efforts of passers-by, in particular a constable and a soldier from Portobello Barracks who broke their way into the submerged bus, all inside were drowned. One of those killed was the father of the Gunne brothers, who opened the Gaiety Theatre. Two were mothers, each with a little girl, one of them a niece of Daniel O'Connell.|$|E

60|$|The midday meal finished, {{they lost}} {{no time in}} {{repacking}} <b>the</b> sled load <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river once more. The stream was now wider than before, and presently spread out into a small lake.|$|R
30|$|The {{competitive}} {{power plants}} {{are able to}} set up facilities for generating electricity from the specific sources.

60|$|In about {{a quarter}} of an hour the boys reached the island shore, at the spot where Nat's motor-boat was tied up. They helped him get in <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> engine. He had been told how they had come to the island.|$|R
60|$|Tommy {{was still}} waiting {{faithfully}} when {{the letter was}} concluded, and when Lena dropped it out she saw him pick it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steep hillside.

50|$|During {{operation}} (after charging <b>the</b> pot <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> system) {{the high}} boiling constituents are primarily {{separated from the}} charge mixture. The liquid in the pot is depleted in the high boiling constituents, and enriched in low boiling ones. The high boiling product is routed into the bottom product receivers. The residual low boiling product is withdrawn from the charge pot. This mode of batch distillation is very seldom applied in industrial processes.|$|R

6000|$|... "Youse don't know me, miss," [...] he said, and stooping {{he lifted}} {{the body of the}} Frenchman to his broad shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{hillside}} through the trackless underbrush.|$|E

In 2009, in his first competitive season as head coach, the Monarchs finished 9-2. That was the best winning record ever for a first-year program in college football's modern era. [...] The Monarchs were outscored by a total of only eight points in their two losses.|$|R

60|$|Next he {{repaired}} {{the broken}} pipe, gathered his tools together, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> trail. He walked slowly, feeling a great weariness, as {{of a man}} who had passed through a frightful crisis.|$|E
60|$|Left to themselves, {{the three}} girls swept up the chips the {{builders}} had left <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> camp-fire. Then they tidied {{up the house}} generally, and soon set about preparing the supper.|$|E
30|$|For setting <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>starting</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{sequencing}} {{batch reactor}} (SBR), reverse activated sludge of Ekbatan {{wastewater treatment plant}} was used as seed - which {{did not have any}} bulking, foaming, and pinpoint flock - in about 2 L for each SBR pilot reactors with a total volume of 20 L, and synthetic wastewater with COD of 600 ± 20 mg/L was added to the reactor.|$|R

50|$|Once {{passengers}} {{have been}} placed in the log, it enters the first room where lights shine on forest animals playing instruments. The log turns to <b>the</b> right <b>and</b> <b>starts</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> first chain lift hill, while Dudley is seen riding Horse backwards <b>up</b> <b>the</b> slope alongside riders. Snidely is later seen riding a mine cart down {{the other side of the}} lift, laughing at his accomplishment of kidnapping Nell.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} young fellow was a gentleman," [...] mused Col. Zane {{as he crossed}} the green square <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill toward the cabins. He found the old negro seated on his doorstep.|$|E
60|$|They {{took off}} their skates, {{put them on}} the sleds, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rocky and frozen watercourse. The walking was treacherous and soon Whopper went down, with Shep on top of him. The bag of apples came over both.|$|E
6000|$|This lent me wings. In two jumps I {{had grabbed}} my rifle; then, turning, I ran round the pool, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{one place in}} the steep wall where {{climbing}} was possible. Above the yells of the men I heard Dick's piercing cry: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{observer}} {{is standing}} on the Via Ostiensis {{at the foot of the}} Aventine, which is at his back. The river flows toward him. The stone bridge in evidence is the Pons Aemilius. The Servian Wall goes along the bank of the river, is pierced by the Porta Trigemina (you can see <b>the</b> three openings) <b>and</b> <b>starts</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Aventine. Beyond the gate is the Forum Boarium. In the immediate foreground are the docks, or Navalia.|$|R

6000|$|None {{attempted}} to sleep, {{and as soon}} as it became light they took picks and shovels <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> valley.

60|$|He took me up {{the open}} space, between the caves and the river, and into the forest beyond, where, in a grassy place among the trees, we made a meal of stringy-rooted carrots.

30|$|It {{is assumed}} that the {{competitive}} power plants follow the government’s financial legislations and {{have the capability to}} produce electricity using two different energy sources. They are able to set up facilities for generating electricity from the specific sources. When they install <b>and</b> <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> corresponding power generations equipment, the production capacity is ample for the market demand. That is, the production rate of the power plants is equal to the corresponding demand rate. Moreover, they have a negligible internal consumption and waste rate.|$|R
