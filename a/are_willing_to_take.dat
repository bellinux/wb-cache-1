5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> responsibility for their lives.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, in {{an article}} in The New Republic, Alexander S. Heard stated that much of Sedaris' work is insufficiently factual to justify being marketed as nonfiction. Several {{published}} responses to Heard's article argued that Sedaris' readers are aware that his descriptions and stories are intentionally exaggerated and manipulated to maximize comic effect, while others used the controversy as a springboard for discussing the liberties publishers <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> when calling books 'nonfiction'.|$|E

500|$|On September 6, 2013, Kanye West {{announced}} he would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support Yeezus, with fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar accompanying him as supporting act. The tour was met with rave reviews from critics. Rolling Stone described it as [...] "crazily entertaining, hugely ambitious, emotionally affecting (really!) and, most importantly, totally bonkers." [...] Writing for Forbes, Zack O'Malley Greenburg praised West for [...] "taking risks that few pop stars, if any, <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in today's hyper-exposed world of pop," [...] describing the show as [...] "overwrought and uncomfortable at times, but [...] excels at challenging norms and provoking thought {{in a way that}} just isn't common for mainstream musical acts of late." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 13, 2008, {{the album}} artwork was {{revealed}} on the band's website. The {{cover of the}} album was painted by artist Luke Chueh. Wentz contacted Chueh {{and asked him to}} create the piece, to which the artist agreed. Chueh recalled of the situation, [...] "They were great to work with, having given me full creative control over both the artwork and the final design of [...] cover." [...] Chueh used the title and underlying themes of the album as inspiration for the artwork. [...] "The title of the album is Folie à Deux, and when considering this with the band's popularity, I chose to focus on the idea of fandom, and how some people <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> their love/infatuation to levels that are obviously unhealthy." [...] Wentz currently owns the original painting. The disc's liner notes contain pictures of the band members with blank pages next to them; the group allowed fans to submit pictures they had drawn in the spaces and posted them to the band's website.|$|E
500|$|When Roberts & Vinter {{made the}} {{decision}} to close down New Worlds in 1963, Moorcock and Ballard considered publishing a new magazine that would be willing, as Carnell had been, to publish experimental material. [...] Moorcock assembled a dummy issue, and later described his intentions: [...] "It would be on art paper, to take good quality illustrations; it would be the size of, say, Playboy so that it would get good display space on the newsstands; it would specialise in experimental work by writers like [...] Burroughs and [...] Paolozzi, but it would be 'popular', it would seek to publicise such experimenters; it would publish all those writers who had become demoralised by a lack of sympathetic publishers and by baffled critics; it would attempt a cross-fertilization of popular sf, science and the work of the literary and artistic avant garde." [...] Moorcock also wrote a letter to Carnell setting out his thoughts on what science fiction needed: [...] "Editors who <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a risk on a story and run it even though this may bring criticism on their heads." [...] The letter was published in the final Nova Publications issue, which also carried the announcement that Moorcock would be taking over from Carnell as editor of New Worlds, though Moorcock had been unaware he would be considered for the post when he wrote his letter.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the financial transaction tax is regressive in application—particularly the Stamp Duty in the UK, which includes certain exemptions only available to institutional investors. One UK study, by the Institute for Development Studies, suggests, [...] "In the long run, a significant proportion of the tax could end up being passed on to consumers." [...] Another study of the UK Stamp Duty found that institutional investors avoid the tax due to intermediary relief, while short-term investors who <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on additional risk can avoid the tax by trading noncovered derivatives. The study concluded, therefore, [...] "The tax is thus likely to fall most heavily on long-term, risk-averse investors." ...|$|E
