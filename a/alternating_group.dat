25|$|The Mathieu {{groups can}} be {{constructed}} in various ways. Initially, Mathieu and others constructed them as permutation groups.

The matter was clarified when Ernst Witt constructed M24 as the automorphism (symmetry) group of an S(5,8,24) Steiner system W24 (the Witt design). M24 is the group of permutations that map every block in this design to some other block. The subgroups M23 and M22 then are easily defined to be the stabilizers of a single point {{and a pair of}} points respectively.|$|E
