[...] Colfer stated that the opportunity to finally sing the song [...] "really meant the world" [...] to him, and that: [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you've dreamed about for such a long time. I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> some very 'Kurtsy' things in the song, it's {{probably one of the most}} honest and close-to-heart scenes I've ever filmed or performed for that matter." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, she {{appeared}} {{at a dinner}} in London to accept the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal. She gave an interview to The Guardian in which she lamented the lack of technique in young opera singers and the dearth of good teachers. By this time {{she was no longer}} giving master classes herself; when asked by Italian journalists in May 2007 why this was, she replied: [...] "Because I'm 80 years old and I really don't {{want to have anything to}} do with opera any more, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> sit on the juries of singing competitions." [...] The Cardiff Singer of the World competition was the one that Sutherland was most closely associated with after her retirement.

2500|$|In 1998 she {{appeared}} once again alongside Shahrukh Khan in Duplicate, {{the film was}} produced by Yash Johar and was directed by Mahesh Bhatt. The film underperformed {{at the box office}} upon its release. However, Chawla won much appreciation for her performance and her chemistry with Khan was also appreciated. A critic wrote [...] "Juhi Chawla is one of my favourite actresses and she is simply wonderful here. I’m not sure how she manages to keep a straight face through some of Shah Rukh’s more insane moments, but she plays Sonia as quite a serious career woman with a tendency to lecture in English. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> prefer her romance with Shah Rukh in Yes Boss they still make a sweet couple here." [...] The same year {{she appeared}} in Hrishikesh Mukherjee's swan song Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate alongside Anil Kapoor; her performance was appreciated by the audiences and critics alike. Rediff while reviewing the film wrote [...] "Only Juhi as the daughter is not based on any character from Hrishida's collection. She carries off her role with her inevitable chirpiness, and looks very good too. Hrishida was right when he told me that Juhi's serene face suited the kind of sacrifice she would make in the film. Only Jaya Bhaduri has managed that serenity in Hrishida's films." [...] However the film flopped at the box office. The same year she also appeared in Priyadarshan's rural drama Saat Rang Ke Sapne opposite Arvind Swamy. Though the film underperformed at the box-office, Chawla's portrayal of a gypsy met with immense critical appreciation. The same year she also appeared in the Malayalam detective comedy film Harikrishnans opposite Mammootty and Mohanlal. Her performance in the film was met with appreciation. The film received a great pre-release hype due to the combined screen presence of Mohanlal, Mammootty and Juhi Chawla. Harikrishnans {{turned out to be a}} blockbuster at the Kerala box-office, it was the highest grossing Malayalam film of 1998.|$|E
