40|$|The {{capacity}} of a discrete-time multi-input multi-output (MIMO) Gaussian channel with output quantization is investigated for different receiver architectures. A general formulation of this problem is proposed in which the <b>antenna</b> <b>outputs</b> are processed by analog combiners while sign quantizers are used for analog-to-digital conversion. To exemplify this approach, four analog receiver architectures of varying generality and complexity are considered: (a) multiple antenna selection and sign quantization of the <b>antenna</b> <b>outputs,</b> (b) single <b>antenna</b> selection and multilevel quantization, (c) multiple antenna selection and multilevel quantization, and (d) linear combining of the <b>antenna</b> <b>outputs</b> and multilevel quantization. Achievable rates are studied {{as a function of}} the number of available sign quantizers and compared among different architectures. In particular, it is shown that architecture (a) is sufficient to attain the optimal high signal-to-noise ratio performance for a MIMO receiver in which the number of antennas is larger than the number of sign quantizers. Numerical evaluations of the average performance are presented for the case in which the channel gains are i. i. d. Gaussian...|$|R

30|$|We have {{proposed}} a sequential antenna selection algorithm and an adaptive transmit/receive beamforming algorithm for large-scale MIMO systems in the 60 GHz band. One constraint of the system under consideration is that the receiver can only access a linear combination of the receive <b>antenna</b> <b>outputs,</b> which makes the traditional antenna selection schemes based on the channel matrix not applicable. The proposed antenna selection method uses a bound on the largest singular value of the channel matrix based on the Gerschgorin circle. The method is particularly useful over the 60 GHz channel, which has a strong line-of-sight component, and it employs a discrete stochastic approximation technique to quickly lock onto a near-optimal antenna subset. We have also proposed an adaptive joint transmit and receive beamforming technique based on the stochastic gradient method that makes use of a low-rate feedback channel to inform the transmitter about the selected beam. Simulation results show that both the proposed antenna selection and the adaptive beamforming techniques exhibit fast convergence and near-optimal performance.|$|R
