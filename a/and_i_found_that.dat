500|$|Longtime scout Charlie Metro {{remembered the}} havoc caused by Henderson: '"I {{did a lot}} of study <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it's {{impossible}} to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{has spoken}} of the media's {{negative}} perception of him. He has been quoted: [...] "I wasn't fashionable. I never got good reviews. But I'm {{proud of the}} fact that I wasn't liked by the media... Pop music is so reactionary and bigoted. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> what's 'cool' is often very shallow and transient." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romo is a Christian and {{has spoken}} about his faith saying, [...] "My faith has grown <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> always having Jesus makes things {{a lot easier}} in my life. Having Jesus in your life gives you {{everlasting}} peace, which never goes away. It helps you handle {{the ups and downs}} of professional football." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now I make a leaf of Voices--for <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> nothing mightier {{than they}} [...] are, <b>And</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> no word spoken but is {{beautiful}} in its place.|$|R

2500|$|Similar to Mascis's guitar work, Barlow's bass lines, {{with their}} {{alternating}} heavily distorted, fast chords and pulverizing lows, draw heavily from both his hardcore past and musicians such as Lemmy from Motörhead and Johnny Ramone. [...] "Johnny Ramone is my hero. I {{wanted to make}} that rhythmic chugging sound like he got playing guitar with the Ramones. <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> I got a bigger sound by strumming farther up the neck." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to Chomsky and Herman, {{the reports}} of massive Khmer Rouge atrocities and {{starvation}} in Cambodia proved to be accurate and uninflated. Many deniers or doubters of the Cambodian genocide recanted their previous opinions, but Chomsky continued to insist that his analysis of Cambodia was without error {{based on the information}} available to him at the time. [...] Herman addressed critics in 2001: [...] "Chomsky <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the very asking of questions about...the victims in the anti-Khmer Rouge propaganda campaign of 1975–1979 was unacceptable, and was treated almost without exception as 'apologetics for Pol Pot'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book {{consumed}} Naipaul. [...] In 1983, he wrote:The book {{took three}} years to write. [...] It felt like a career; {{and there was a}} short period, {{towards the end of the}} writing, when I do believe I knew all or much of the book by heart. [...] The labour ended; the book began to recede. [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> I was unwilling to re-enter the world I had created, unwilling to expose myself again to the emotions that lay below the comedy. [...] I became nervous of the book. [...] I haven't read it since I passed the proofs in May 1961.|$|E
6000|$|... "However," [...] {{continued}} Rollo, [...] "he {{said that}} I {{might look at}} the man's fishing apparatus; <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it was different from that which the boys used in America, I might buy some of it to carry home." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{walked up}} to the oak-tree, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the bear was still firmly {{attached}} to it. His chain had been fastened loosely around the trunk; he had climbed up to the branch and pulled the chain with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{searched the}} Dundee records, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the barque 'Lone Star' {{was there in}} January, '85, my {{suspicion}} became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London." ...|$|R
2500|$|There is wide {{discrepancy}} among {{reports of}} rape and sexual assault. For example, according to the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), {{the majority of those}} assaulted in 2007 were poor women from remote areas and Dalits. SR Darapuri of the PUCL alleged, [...] "I analysed the rape figures for 2007 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 90% of victims were Dalits and 85% of Dalit rape victims were underage girls." [...] Darapuri allegations do not match with the data compiled by National Crime Records Bureau of India, which found 6.7% {{of rape and}} sexual assault victims were Dalits in 2007, where nearly 16% of Indian population is classified as Dalit. There were 391 cases of rape of Dalit victims reported in Uttar Pradesh in 2013 or about 1 per 100,000 Dalits in the state of about 200 million people (21% pf which is classified as Dalit).|$|E

5000|$|I was {{the only}} {{photographer}} they allowed on the yacht. I just kept clicking away with the camera, and they enjoyed it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> enjoyed it, <b>and</b> suddenly <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> taking pictures was {{a great way to}} live and a great way to work.|$|R
6000|$|... "My first enquiry, of course, {{was about}} you <b>and</b> O'Sullivan. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{he had never}} been heard of, but that you had lost a hand, and had been {{promoted}} to a captaincy; had been very ill, and had gone to the south of France on sick leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{talked to}} him for awhile, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> {{he was out of}} work and also out of money.

"No {{one noticed}} so small a {{creature}} as a Woggle-Bug, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the hearth was even warmer {{and more comfortable}} than the sunshine, I resolved to establish my future home beside it. So <b>I</b> <b>found</b> a charming nest between two bricks and hid myself therein for many, many months.|$|R
5000|$|Of teaching, Corpron said: ″I {{am one of}} the {{fortunate}} individuals in this world whose vocation <b>and</b> avocation merge. <b>I</b> love teaching above all else, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> as <b>I</b> have developed as a creative photographer, the work of my students has become more interesting.″ ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>found</b> {{the town}} in great excitement; un-uniformed militia were parading the streets, both white <b>and</b> colored. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the white people—democrats—were very much excited in {{consequence}} of the governor organizing the militia force of the state. ... <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> these people were determined to resist his marching the militia (to Clinton) with arms, and they threatened to kill his militiamen.|$|R
