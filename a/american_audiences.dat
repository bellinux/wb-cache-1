5|$|At {{the same}} time, record {{companies}} like Paramount Records and OKeh Records launched {{the field of}} race music, which was mostly blues targeted at African <b>American</b> <b>audiences.</b> The most famous of these acts went on to inspire much of the later popular development of the blues and blues-derived genres, including Charley Patton, Lonnie Johnson and Robert Johnson.|$|E
5|$|British and European audiences {{typically}} followed {{concert hall}} behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, {{and they were}} more reserved in their behaviour than were audiences of other forms of rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as they found that <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> were less attentive and more prone to outbursts during quiet passages.|$|E

5|$|The series proved {{popular with}} <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> and {{critical}} response, though sparse, was positive. Flash Gordon has garnered little modern critical attention.

5|$|While not {{initially}} a success with North <b>American</b> <b>audiences,</b> Angel Heart {{has gained a}} cult following.

5|$|In {{the ending}} {{that was in}} the {{original}} theatrical version, Ellen rammed the shark with Mike's boat, mortally wounding it. The shark then causes the boat to break apart with its death contortions, forcing the people on the boat to jump off to avoid going down with it. <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with the shark getting stabbed with the bow sprit and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive. This version is what Universal used on home media releases.|$|E

5|$|Necrid's design {{targeted}} North <b>American</b> <b>audiences,</b> specifically fans of American comic books. Although McFarlane received most of {{the credit}} for the character, Necrid {{was the result of a}} collaboration; Namco outlined the then-unnamed character's traits, such as his in-game role and physical build, and McFarlane's company completed the design. As a result, both companies hold a partial copyright for Necrid, with Namco's rights to the character as a derivative work of McFarlane's illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Olivier {{had been}} {{attempting}} to broaden his film career. He {{was not well}} known in the United States despite his success in Britain, and earlier attempts to introduce him to <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> had failed. Offered the role of Heathcliff in Samuel Goldwyn's production of Wuthering Heights (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film's director, William Wyler, offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella, but she refused, preferring the role of Cathy, which went to Merle Oberon.|$|E
5|$|The Watch has grossed $35,353,000 in North America and $32,914,862 {{in other}} territories for a {{worldwide}} total of $68,267,862 against {{a budget of}} $68 million. In the week before release, pre-release tracking showed that up to 25 percent of North <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> were reluctant to visit cinemas following the mass murder in a Colorado cinema the previous week. This, plus competition from the simultaneous launch of the 2012 Summer Olympics, would negatively impact ticket sales for The Watch. Tracking showed that the film could earn $13–15million during its opening weekend.|$|E

5|$|The moviemakers' new distributor, Robertson-Cole, {{was unable}} to find the right market for Heart of Juanita and The Flame of Hellgate in 1920. <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> had grown more sophisticated, yet Michelena Studios was still {{employing}} their earlier production techniques. After shooting The Flame of Hellgate, Middleton and Michelena stopped making movies altogether. She returned to her singing performances and he returned to his car sales. They reportedly divorced in the mid-1920s, though Middleton told the 1930 US Census that they were married. The union produced no children.|$|E
5|$|While not {{initially}} a success with North <b>American</b> <b>audiences,</b> Blade Runner was popular internationally and garnered a cult following. The film's dark style and futuristic designs {{have served as}} a benchmark and its influence can be seen in many subsequent science fiction films, video games, anime, and television programs. For example, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, the producers of the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica, have both cited Blade Runner as one of the major influences for the show.|$|E
5|$|According to Dance, Clemens was {{requested}} by 20th Century Fox as a love interest for Ellen Ripley. Director David Fincher initially intended to reunite Paul McGann, Richard E. Grant and Ralph Brown (from Withnail and I) with Grant playing Clemens, but Grant declined the role. Despite Alien 3 poor critical reception, Dance {{said in a}} 2014 Daily Beast interview that he considered the film superior to Aliens and its potential was hampered by 20th Century Fox. According to the actor, his role as Clemens exposed him to <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> {{and led to a}} prominent role as Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones.|$|E

5|$|Black Sabbath {{was made}} {{at the end of}} {{production}} of The Girl Who Knew Too Much during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. American International Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as {{it had to be done}} rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> which led to decreasing the amount of violence in the film. The film was first conceived under the title The Fear.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{was nervous}} about the film's {{reception}} because silent films were becoming obsolete by then, and the preview had undermined his confidence. Nevertheless, City Lights became one of Chaplin's most financially successful and critically acclaimed works. Following the good reception by <b>American</b> <b>audiences,</b> with earnings of $2 million, a quarter of which came from its 12-week run at the Cohan, Chaplin went on a sixteen-date world tour between February and March 1932, starting with a premiere at London's Dominion Theatre on February 27. The film was enthusiastically received by Depression-era audiences, earning $5 million during its initial release.|$|E
5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark {{recesses}} of the globe, including the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, and everywhere in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands untouched by modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South Pole, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E

5|$|Havins was {{influenced}} in {{her decision to}} accept the part by her husband's appreciation of the series. Like Rex, Esther is used by executive producer Russell T Davies {{as a means of}} introducing new <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> to the established mythos of Torchwood. Havins stated the character to have an unrequited love for Rex, but explained that he does not appear to notice. Response to the character varied; some critics praised her characterisation and portrayal whilst others felt her to display incompetency and to not have been taken to by the audience. The nature of her exit from the show was generally praised, though some reviewers felt it lacked the desired emotional impact.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, as a {{contract}} player for Paramount Pictures, Baker became a sex symbol after appearing as a hedonistic widow in The Carpetbaggers (1964). The film's producer, Joseph E. Levine, cast {{her in the}} potboiler Sylvia before giving her the role of Jean Harlow in the biopic Harlow (1965). Despite significant prepublicity, Harlow was a critical failure, and Baker relocated to Italy in 1966 amid a legal dispute over her contract with Paramount and Levine's overseeing of her career. In Europe, she spent the next 10 years starring in hard-edged Italian thriller and horror films, including Umberto Lenzi's Paranoia (1969) and Knife of Ice (1972), before re-emerging for <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> as a character actress in the Andy Warhol-produced dark comedy Bad (1977).|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} in Czechoslovakia, Forman sought an international distributor, who informed him that the film was too short for <b>American</b> <b>audiences</b> and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were never shown for domestic consumption. One of these scenes, which {{was included in the}} US version, involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda, the pianist, tries to pick up a buxom girl on the streets of Prague, only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four-story building in which she lives, disturbing the sleeping residents.|$|E
