In the experiments the algorithm solves random CNFs with <b>a</b> <b>planted</b> solution of any density. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: {{how likely is}} it that <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E

5|$|Unlike animals, plants lack {{phagocytic}} cells, {{but many}} plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through <b>a</b> <b>plant.</b> Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When {{a part of}} <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells {{at the site of}} infection undergo rapid apoptosis {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.|$|E
5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E
