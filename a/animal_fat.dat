5|$|In 2010 a rock {{coloured}} red, {{orange and}} yellow was unearthed. Although containers of pigments {{have been found}} previously at sites such as Skara Brae, {{this was the first}} discovery in Britain, and possibly in Northern Europe, of evidence that Neolithic peoples used paint to decorate their buildings. It is thought that the primitive paint could have been made from iron ore, mixed with <b>animal</b> <b>fat,</b> milk or eggs. Only a week later a stone with a zigzag chevron pattern painted with a red pigment was discovered nearby.|$|E
5|$|The Māori {{had many}} {{uses for the}} gum, which they called kapia. Fresh gum {{was used as a}} type of chewing gum (older gum was {{softened}} by soaking and mixing with juice of the puha thistle). Highly flammable, the gum was also used as a fire-starter, or bound in flax to act as a torch. Burnt and mixed with <b>animal</b> <b>fat,</b> it made a dark pigment for moko tattooing. Kauri gum was also crafted into jewellery, keepsakes, and small decorative items. Like amber, kauri gum sometimes includes insects and plant material.|$|E

40|$|French {{feedstuff}} manufacturers remain reticent {{about using}} <b>animal</b> <b>fats.</b> However, it {{is a valuable}} raw material providing energy and improving animal productions performances. Mixing <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> into feed should decrease the processing cost. Concerning the environmental issue, it is {{an efficient way to}} reduce animal productions carbon footprint.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to differentiate fractionated components of lard namely lard olein (LO) and lard stearin (LS) from other common <b>animal</b> <b>fats.</b> Lard fractions and <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), elemental analyzer–isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Overlay of FTIR spectra did not help to pinpoint any characteristic feature to distinguish either LO or LS from other <b>animal</b> <b>fats,</b> but overlay of DSC cooling curves helped a successful discrimination. The determination of δ 13 C from EA-IRMS showed that the values corresponding to the fractionated components of lard were significantly (p< 0. 05) {{different from those of the}} other common <b>animal</b> <b>fats.</b> GC-MS analysis showed that direct comparison of overall fatty acid data was not able to discriminate LO and LS from other <b>animal</b> <b>fats,</b> but the application of principal component analysis (PCA) to fatty acid data helped a successful discrimination...|$|R
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and {{both men and women}} of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E
5|$|Stock ducks {{would be}} chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females {{at any given}} time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, {{typically}} to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of <b>animal</b> <b>fat).</b> As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} on different properties of two kind of <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> and their suitability of using them as fuel in diesel engines. Initially, the {{physical and chemical properties}} (viscosity, low heating value (LHV) and chemical compositions) of <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> are obtained experimentally. In the second phase of work, the <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> are modified to form emulsions with water in different quantities. In the last phase, methanol is added to improve the physical properties of emulsions further. On the whole it is concluded that the <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> can be transformed into a stable biofuel emulsions with improved physical and chemical properties and used as good alternative fuel in diesel engines. An optimum formulation is obtained by mixing 15 % of water, 15 % of methanol and 2 % of surfactant. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
25|$|We {{propose that}} the {{difference}} {{is due to the}} time lag between increases in consumption of <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> and serum cholesterol concentrations and the resulting increase in mortality from heart disease—similar to the recognised time lag between smoking and lung cancer. Consumption of <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> and serum cholesterol concentrations increased only recently in France but did so decades ago in Britain.|$|E

25|$|Frying French fries in beef tallow, lard, {{or other}} <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> adds {{saturated}} fat to the diet. Replacing <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> with tropical vegetable oils, such as palm oil, simply substitutes one saturated fat for another. Replacing <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> with partially hydrogenated oil reduces cholesterol but adds trans fat, {{which has been}} shown to both raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol. Canola/Rapeseed oil, or sunflower-seed oil are also used, as are mixes of vegetable oils, but beef tallow is generally more popular, especially amongst fast food outlets that use communal oil baths. Accordingly, many restaurants now advertise their use of unsaturated oils; for example, both Five Guys and Chick-fil-A advertise that their fries are prepared with peanut oil.|$|R

25|$|That {{study also}} {{suggests}} that fat and saturated fat are not likely contributors to pancreatic cancer. <b>Animal</b> <b>fat,</b> particularly from ruminants, tends {{to have a higher}} percentage of saturated fat vs. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat when compared to vegetable fats, with the exception of some tropical plant fats; consumption of which has been correlated with various health problems. The saturated fat found in meat has been associated with significantly raised risks of colon cancer, although evidence suggests that risks of prostate cancer are unrelated to <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> consumption.|$|E

50|$|Rendered lard {{can be used}} {{to produce}} biofuel and soap. Lard is also useful as a cutting fluid in {{machining}}. Its use in machining has declined since the mid-20th century as other specially engineered cutting fluids became prominent. However it is still a viable option.

40|$|The use of {{vegetable}} oil as a fuel source in diesel engines {{is as old}} as the diesel engine itself. However, the demand to develop and utilize plant oils and <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> as biodiesel fuels has been limited until recently. The technical definition of biodiesel is: “The mono alkyl esters of long fatty acids derived from renewable lipid feedstock such as vegetable oils or <b>animal</b> <b>fats,</b> for use in compression ignition (diesel) engines ” (National Biodiesel Board, 1996). In simple terms, biodiesel is a renewable fuel manufactured from methanol and vegetable oil, <b>animal</b> <b>fats,</b> and recycled cooking fats (U. S. Department of Energy, 2006). The term “biodiesel ” itself is often misrepresented and misused. Biodiesel only refers to 100 % pure fuel (B 100) that meets the definition above and specific standards give...|$|R

Furthermore, some object to the vast amount of farming and the resulting fertilization, pesticide use, and land use conversion that would be needed to produce the additional vegetable oil. The estimated transportation diesel fuel and home heating oil used in the United States is about 160million tons (350billion pounds) according to the Energy Information Administration, US Department of Energy. In the United States, estimated production of vegetable oil for all uses is about 11million tons (24billion pounds) and estimated production of <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> is 5.3million tonnes (12billion pounds).|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel is {{commonly}} {{produced by the}} transesterification of the vegetable oil or <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> feedstock.

25|$|The exact {{distinction}} between traditional Sephardic and Mizrahi cuisines {{can be difficult}} to make, due to the intermingling of the Sephardi diaspora and the Mizrahi Jews who they came in contact with. As a general rule, however, both types reflect the food of the local non-Jewish population that each group lived amongst. The need to preserve kashrut does lead to a few significant changes (most notably, the use of olive oil instead of <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> is often considered to be a legacy of Jewish residency in an area, {{due to the fact that}} olive oil may be eaten with milk, unlike <b>animal</b> <b>fat).</b> Despite this, Sephardic and Ashkenazic concepts of kosher differ; perhaps the most notable difference being that rice, a major staple of the Sephardic diet, is considered kosher for Passover among Sephardim but it is forbidden as kitniyot by most Ashkenazim.|$|E
