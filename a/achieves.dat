5|$|All {{movements}} {{are written in}} D major, but Reger often modulates. The movements follow each other without a break. A short instrumental introduction, marked , leads to the fourth movement.

5|$|Although {{limited to}} one soprano voice, Bach <b>achieves</b> a variety of musical {{expression}} in the eight movements. All but one recitative are accompanied by the strings (accompagnato), and only movement 5 is secco, accompanied by the continuo only.

5|$|A third {{approach}} <b>achieves</b> some of {{the output}} benefits of tracking, with a lesser penalty in terms of land area, capital and operating cost. This involves tracking the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons. The angle of the axis is normally horizontal, though some, such as the solar park at Nellis Airforce Base, which have a 20° tilt, incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt.|$|E
5|$|Another {{derivative}} genre termed machinima verite, from cinéma vérité, {{seeks to}} add a documentary and additional realism to the machinima piece. L.M. Sabo's CATACLYSM <b>achieves</b> a machinima verite style through displaying and recapturing the machinima video with a low resolution black and white hand-held video camera to produce a shaky camera effect. Other element of cinéma vérité, such as longer takes, sweeping camera transitions, and jump cuts may be included to complete the effect.|$|E

5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus <b>achieves</b> this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.integrifolia has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Studies on B.integrifolia suggest that its proteoid root mat <b>achieves</b> this by chemically modifying its soil environment.|$|E
5|$|Mass is {{also the}} prime {{attribute}} by which planets are distinguished from stars. The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass for objects with solar-type isotopic abundance, beyond which it <b>achieves</b> conditions suitable for nuclear fusion. Other than the Sun, no objects of such mass exist in the Solar System; but there are exoplanets of this size.
