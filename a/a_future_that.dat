After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses {{the ability to see}} the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when he looks at him. Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he could see was the dark image of Apocalypse.|$|E
25|$|Heseltine campaigned {{briefly as}} a {{volunteer}} in the October 1951 General Election before going up to Pembroke College, Oxford, where, in frustration at his inability to be elected to the committee of the Oxford University Conservative Association, he founded the breakaway Blue Ribbon Club. Julian Critchley recounted a story from his student days of how he plotted his future {{on the back of}} an envelope, <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> would culminate as Prime Minister in the 1990s. A more detailed apocryphal version has him writing down: 'millionaire 25, cabinet member 35, party leader 45, prime minister 55'. He became a millionaire and {{was a member of the}} shadow cabinet from the age of 41 but did not manage to become Party Leader or Prime Minister.|$|E

25|$|The {{interests}} objection {{claims that}} what makes murder wrong {{is not just}} the deprivation of a valuable future, but the deprivation of <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> one has an interest in. The embryo has no conscious interest in its future, and so (the objection concludes) to kill it is not wrong. The defender of Marquis-style arguments may, however, give the counterexample of the suicidal teenager who takes no interest in his or her future, but killing whom is nonetheless wrong and murder. If the opponent responds that one can have an interest in one's future without taking an interest in it, then the defender of the Marquis-style argument can claim that this applies to the embryo. Similarly, if an opponent claims that what is crucial is having a valuable future which one would, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve (whether or not one does in fact desire to preserve it), then the defender may ask why the embryo would not, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve its future.|$|E
500|$|The team {{chose to}} centre {{the game on}} firefighters as they felt that fire was the most {{appropriate}} way to create fear and tension. In a retrospective interview, Ohshima said {{that many of the}} things done by firefighters—along with rescuing people—were [...] "the very essence of a Sonic Team game", and that they recognised that a firefighter was a hero with whom people could identify. The team wanted to make a game with a rescue theme as Naka thought there were few games based on that concept. According to Takeo Miyoshi, [...] "Our first inspiration came from the explosion and building destruction scenes of Hollywood movies. We just wanted to describe the heroism of lifesaving in that loud, explosive type of setting." [...] The developers wanted to design <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> was [...] "clean and beautiful", with sustainable energy, but where disasters still could occur, and only heroes could protect people from them. The designers envisioned that a futuristic firefighter would be acrobatic and dexterous to reach places where people were trapped.|$|E
500|$|After this point, {{the story}} {{continues}} differently {{depending on the}} Hero's alignment. If it is [...] "law", the Law Hero gets killed in a battle with the Chaos Hero, while the Hero and the Heroine go to the basement. On their way they have to kill the Chaos Hero and fight Yuriko, who {{turns out to be}} the demon Lilith in disguise; she calls the Hero [...] "Adam", and says she wanted to create a new age and live with him forever, which is why she tried to execute the Heroine. After defeating her in battle, the Hero and the Heroine reach the basement and kill the demon Asura-ou; they then go to the cathedral's roof, where they are thanked by a messenger from God. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "chaos", he and the Heroine must go to the top floor and kill the archangel Michael, and on their way kill the Law Hero; the Chaos Hero dies, too, because of the magical ring he has been wearing. On the roof, they meet Lucifer, who says that a new era will begin, where both demons and humans are free; he also warns them that God still is alive. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "neutral", he and the Heroine must kill the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, Asura-ou, and Michael, and fight Yuriko. On the roof, they meet Taishang Laojun, who thanks them and says that balance is needed to achieve happiness; he asks the Hero and the Heroine to lead humanity to <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> doesn't rely on gods or demons. The game ends with the Heroine saying that those who have died will be reborn, and that it is time for creation and rebuilding.|$|E

[...] In the earlier poem, death was somewhere in the future and life was to be enjoyed. [...] In the later poem, the poet looks back to his past where the good memories are.

2500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{criticized the}} quick and complete forgiveness {{with which the}} Amish responded, arguing that forgiveness is inappropriate when no remorse has been expressed, and that such an attitude {{runs the risk of}} denying the existence of evil, while others were supportive. Donald Kraybill and two other scholars of Amish life noted that [...] "letting go of grudges" [...] is a deeply rooted value in Amish culture, which remembers forgiving martyrs including Dirk Willems and Jesus himself. They explained that the Amish willingness to forgo vengeance does not undo the tragedy or pardon the wrong, but rather constitutes a first step toward <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> is more hopeful.|$|E
2500|$|Buddhist {{scholars}} look to this sonnet {{to illustrate}} {{that the nature}} of love lies in the awareness of life's impermanence; a lesson often learned too late. Ultimately, the one who must be loved is ourselves as we march past all the warning signs, into the black night. The curious line 'death's second self' strikes at the duality between the objective perception of death in others and the ego's interpretation of that event. In a sense, this sonnet also reaches back into pagan images of pyres and sacrifice, as well as reaching into <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>that,</b> instead of exaltations of heaven's glory, urges the reader {{to take responsibility for their}} own relationship with reality. - Austin Sirch ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{direction}} of Mbeki's vote in South Africa's 2009 general election {{was a matter}} of discussion among press and public alike. Although Mbeki had completely disassociated himself from party politics subsequent to his resignation, many suggested that COPE, composed in large part of Mbeki loyalists, would secure his mark on the ballot paper. On Election Day, 22 April, having done the deed, Mbeki announced that his vote was a secret and called on the electorate to exercise its democratic right not out of fear or historical loyalty, but for <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> it desired and a party that would further its ends. These sentiments were widely interpreted as pro-COPE; indeed, the party's First Deputy President Mbhazima Shilowa confirmed on his Facebook page that [...] "i [...] liked TM's message".

2500|$|The Conquest {{has always}} been a central and contested theme of Canadian memory—as {{exemplified}} by an episode in 2009, when re-enactors were prevented from restaging the decisive 1759 battles in Quebec. Cornelius Jaenen argues that [...] "The Conquest has remained a difficult subject for French-Canadian historians" [...] who were divided in viewing it. One group sees it as a highly negative economic, political and ideological disaster that threatened a way of life with materialism and Protestantism. At the other pole are those historians who see the positive benefit of enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule. French Canadian debates have escalated since the 1960s, as the conquest is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Québec's nationalism. Historian Jocelyn Létourneau suggested in 2009, that today, [...] "1759 does not belong primarily to a past that we might wish to study and understand, but, rather, to a present and <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> we might wish to shape and control." ...|$|E
