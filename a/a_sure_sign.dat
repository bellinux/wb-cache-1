5|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{had been}} a {{fruitful}} and successful international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that were perceived as high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft {{had been a}}ppointed {{the head of the}} new Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Britain without any prior consultation {{and at a time when}} the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist Bennett Lewis, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born Walter Zinn turned the job down.|$|E

Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce. Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking {{on an empty stomach}} was regarded as boorish and <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included Marcus Antonius, and Cicero's own son Marcus (Cicero Minor).

5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> that the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others {{were not interested in}} being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E

5|$|Despite the poetics {{attached}} to Germanicus by ancient authors, it is accepted by historians such as Anthony Barrett that Germanicus was an able general. He {{fought against the}} Pannonians under Tiberius, quelled the mutiny in the Rhine, and led three successful campaigns into Germania. As for his popularity, he was popular enough that the mutinous legions of the Rhine attempted to proclaim him emperor in AD 14; however, he remained loyal and led them against the German tribes instead. Tacitus and Suetonius claim that Tiberius was jealous of Germanicus' popularity, but Barrett suggests their claim might be contradicted by the fact that, following his campaigns in Germany, Germanicus was given command of the eastern provinces â€“ <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> he was intended to rule. In accordance with the precedent set by Augustus, Agrippa had been given command of those same provinces in the east when Agrippa was the intended successor to the empire.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII's first {{marriage}} had {{its origins in}} 1502 when his elder brother, Arthur, died. Their father, Henry VII, then betrothed Arthur's widow, Catherine of Aragon, to the future king. The betrothal immediately raised questions related to the biblical prohibition (in Leviticus 18 and 20) against marriage to a brother's wife. The couple married in 1509 and {{after a series of}} miscarriages, a daughter, Mary, was born in 1516. By the 1520s, Henry still did not have a son to name as heir and he took this as <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of God's anger and made overtures to the Vatican about an annulment. He gave Cardinal Wolsey the task of prosecuting his case; Wolsey began by consulting university experts. From 1527, in addition to his duties as a Cambridge don, Cranmer assisted with the annulment proceedings.|$|E

25|$|In 1834, Goncharov {{graduated}} from the University and returned home to enter the chancellery of Simbirsk governor A. M. Zagryazhsky. A year later, he moved to Saint Petersburg and started working as a translator at the Finance Ministry's Foreign commerce department. Here, in the Russian capital, he became friends with the Maykov family and tutored both Apollon Maykov and Valerian Maykov in the Latin language and in Russian literature. He {{became a member of}} the elitist literary circle based in the Maykovs' house and attended by writers like Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Dmitry Grigorovich. The Maykovs' almanac Snowdrop featured many of Goncharov's poems, but he soon stopped dabbling in poetry altogether. Some of those early verses were later incorporated into the novel A Common Story as Aduev's writings, <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> that the author had stopped taking them seriously.|$|E
25|$|Shen Teh is {{rewarded for}} her hospitality, as the gods {{take it as}} <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of goodness. They give her money and she buys a humble tobacco shop which they intend as both gift and test: will Shen Teh be able to {{maintain}} her goodness with these newfound means, however slight they may be? If she succeeds, the gods' confidence in humanity would be restored. Though at first Shen Teh seems {{to live up to the}} gods' expectations, her generosity quickly turns her small shop into a messy, overcrowded poorhouse which attracts crime and police supervision. In a sense, Shen Teh quickly fails the test, as she is forced to introduce the invented cousin Shui Ta as overseer and protector of her interests. Shen Teh dons a costume of male clothing, a mask, and a forceful voice to take on the role of Shui Ta. Shui Ta arrives at the shop, coldly explains that his cousin has gone out of town on a short trip, curtly turns out the hangers-on, and quickly restores order to the shop.|$|E

It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make you angry. Instead it numbs you to death with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna {{is no more than a}} novelty item." [...] Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune complimented Dunne's acting and said: [...] "Fortunately the film has Griffin Dunne. Dunne, working in a domain once ruled by Cary Grant, manages to be stuffy, naive and vulnerable but never undignified as Loudon Trott, the New York lawyer." [...] Jean Rosenbluth of Rolling Stone was harsh about the film, saying [...] "The question posed by the film's title was Who's that girl?

50|$|In the {{philosophy}} of David Hume, the way society perceives genius {{is similar to the}} way society perceives the ignorant. Hume states that a person with the characteristics of a genius is looked at as a person disconnected from society, as well as a person who works remotely, at a distance, away {{from the rest of the}} world. On the other hand, the mere ignorant is still more despised; nor is any thing deemed <b>a</b> <b>surer</b> <b>sign</b> of <b>an</b> illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish, than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters; and in business, that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy.|$|R
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of the {{presence}} of mopane worms is defoliation of mopane woodland - sometimes around ninety per cent of leaves. Fenced-in browsing animals may rely on the mopane, and on other trees favoured by the caterpillars, as an important part of their diet. Some farmers therefore view the mopane worm as competition for their livestock, and attempt to eradicate the [...] "pest" [...] with insecticides and the like. However, the caterpillar season is short, and the trees sprout the new, tender foliage which browsers prefer, so this problem can be managed in other ways, for example, by working to mutual benefit with the local caterpillar harvesters who will control the worms by harvesting them.|$|E
2500|$|The double-besomed jetted (slit) hip pocket is {{the only}} style {{understated}} enough to complement the dinner jacket. [...] Flap pockets are not considered appropriate for formal attire's refined minimalism due to their busier and bulkier design and are simply an attempt by tuxedo manufacturers to save money by using standard suit patterns (although sometimes they will trim the edges of a flap pocket so that the flap can be tucked in or removed if desired). [...] Besom welts can be of self fabric or trimmed with the lapel's silk facing, though classic menswear scholar Nicholas Antongiavanni suggests that for the English this latter touch [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of hired clothes."

[...] Finally Kuhler had to abandon free-lancing and to enter a position at American Car & Foundry (ACF) in 1944 where he developed double-deck sleepers, subway cars with standee windows and more. [...] Most of his patents were applied for while at ACF. In 1947 he was given his termination notice in one of the many reshuffles at ACF.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "afternoon" [...] series {{suggested}} a great preponderance of mere catch words, showing how slowly I {{was able to}} realise the meaning of abstractions; the phrases intruded themselves before the thoughts became defined.

These entries have forcibly shown to me the great imperfection in my generalising powers; and I am sure that most persons would find the same if they made similar trials. Nothing is <b>a</b> <b>surer</b> <b>sign</b> of high intellectual capacity than the power of quickly seizing and easily manipulating ideas of a very abstract nature.

2500|$|As Ornea himself {{recalled}} {{later in}} life, his {{confrontation with the}} biography and work of Dobrogeanu-Gherea inaugurated his progressive break with Marxism. He credited his extensive research {{into the history of}} socialism with a [...] "purification" [...] of his convictions, leading him to conclude that Leninism and the October Revolution were indefensible. As a consequence, he grew interested in Reformism, Austromarxism and the non-Leninist Orthodox Marxism of Karl Kautsky, and, according to his colleague Ion IanoÈ™i, had sympathy for the Right Opposition of Nikolai Bukharin (whom he reportedly viewed as a precursor of reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev). In the end, Ornea {{came to the conclusion that}} the Eastern Bloc regimes could not be transformed by democratic reforms, and renounced all forms of Marxism. This change reflected gradually on his work. Rizescu and literary critic Daniel Cristea-Enache both noted that, progressively, Ornea replaced the Marxist system of reference with the classical liberalism of Eugen Lovinescu and È˜tefan Zeletin. Answering on this issue, Ornea himself stated: [...] "when reediting one of my works of synthesis on the various currents of thought , I only had to perform very few modifications, <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> that my research method and the thought (vision) guiding me was not at all played out." [...] Despite such ideological choices, IanoÈ™i contends that Ornea was being secretly used by Romanian Communist Party leaders with literary or scientific ambitions, who would employ him as a ghostwriter, signing with their name works on which he had largely contributed his skills and his specialized knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|The channel's {{association}} with the Lambie-Nairn branding agency began in [...] 1991 following on from when Alan Yentob became controller of BBC2 in 1987. Upon taking up office, Alan realised that a review needed {{to be carried out}} of the TWO. The research carried out a start of the review found that viewers saw the TWO as [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "Old Fashioned", with it having a highbrow effect. To rectify this, Lambie Nairn was hired to create a new identity. The 1986 ident was replaced by the start of the highly successful series of idents involving a sans serif '2'. The idents themselves were very simple, such as Paint or Water and this changed people's perception of the channel, despite the fact that only the idents had changed. These new 2's had corporate branding on BBC2 for the first time, allowing cross channel continuity to be easily done. It also brought a unified feel to the channel. These new idents also changed the style of idents. Previously the ident was a single scene that would introduce all types of programmes. The fact that there were multiple idents allowed variation (at one point, there were 40), and for different idents to introduce different genres of programme. Also, special idents were created for themed nights and for special events such as Christmas. <b>A</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of success for these idents is that they survived the rebrand following the new BBC corporate logo in 1997. The idents simply displayed the new logo, while more idents were added to the batch.|$|E

5000|$|The {{magic number}} {{approach}} offers better guarantees that the format will be identified correctly, and can often determine more precise {{information about the}} file. Since reasonably reliable [...] "magic number" [...] tests can be fairly complex, and each file must effectively be tested against every possibility in the magic database, this approach is relatively inefficient, especially for displaying large lists of files (in contrast, file name and metadata-based methods need check only one piece of data, and match it against a sorted index).

Where file types don't lend themselves to recognition in this way, the system must fall back to metadata.

6000|$|We may {{place this}} reform {{towards the end}} of the year 1750, or the {{beginning}} of 1751, when his mind was agitated by the busy discussion which his first Discourse excited, and by the new ideas of literary power which its reception by the public naturally awakened in him. [...] "It takes," [...] wrote Diderot, [...] "right above the clouds; never was such a success."[210] We can hardly have <b>a</b> <b>surer</b> <b>sign</b> of <b>a</b> man's fundamental sincerity than that his first triumph, the first revelation to him of his power, instead of seducing him to frequent the mischievous and disturbing circle of his applauders, should throw him inwards upon himself and his own principles with new earnestness and refreshed independence. Rousseau very soon made up his mind what the world was worth to him; and this, not as the ordinary sentimentalist or satirist does, by way of set-off against the indulgence of personal foibles, but from recognition of his own qualities, of the bounds set to our capacity of life, and of the limits of the world's power to satisfy us. [...] "When my destiny threw me into the whirlpool of society," [...] he wrote in his last meditation on the course of his own life, [...] "I found nothing there to give a moment's solace to my heart. Regret for my sweet leisure followed me everywhere; it shed indifference or disgust over all that might have been within my reach, leading to fortune and honours. Uncertain in the disquiet of my desires, I hoped for little, I obtained less, and I felt even amid gleams of prosperity that if I obtained all that I supposed myself to be seeking, I should still not have found the happiness for which my heart was greedily athirst, though without distinctly knowing its object. Thus everything served to detach my affections from society, even before the misfortunes which were to make me wholly a stranger to it. I reached the age of forty, floating between indigence and fortune, between wisdom and disorder, full of vices of habit without any evil tendency at heart, living by hazard, distracted as to my duties without despising them, but often without much clear knowledge what they were."[211] ...|$|R
