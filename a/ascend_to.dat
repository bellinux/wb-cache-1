5|$|The {{management}} of narcosis {{is simply to}} <b>ascend</b> <b>to</b> shallower depths; the effects then disappear within minutes.

The decompression schedule can still be followed unless other conditions require emergency assistance.|$|E
5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers.

These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{altering}} of the qibla {{was precisely}} the reason the Rashidun caliph Umar, despite identifying the mosque which Muhammad used to <b>ascend</b> <b>to</b> Heaven upon his arrival at the Noble Sanctuary in 638, neither prayed facing it nor built any structure upon it. This was because {{the significance of that}} particular spot on the Noble Sanctuary was superseded in Islamic jurisprudence by the Kaaba in Mecca after the change of the qibla towards that site.|$|E

5|$|The kvitelach {{placed in}} the Western Wall differ from the kvitelach given in Hasidic courts, as they contain prayers, {{requests}} or messages written directly to God. These prayer notes are folded and wedged into the cracks and crevices of the Wall. The rationale for this practice has been traced to the Midrashic teaching that the Divine Presence has never moved from the Western Wall, and the Kabbalistic teaching that all prayers <b>ascend</b> <b>to</b> Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the Western Wall abuts. More than a million prayer notes are {{placed in the}} Western Wall each year.|$|E

5|$|Taibbi {{begins the}} work by quoting from his 2008 book The Great Derangement, asserting he {{predicted}} {{the onslaught of}} fake news and {{the beginnings of the}} alt-right in society. He argues such societal factors helped set the tone for a climate in which Trump could <b>ascend</b> <b>to</b> the presidency. Taibbi writes that Trump's prior experiences in reality television gave him the tools to triumph in an era of post-truth politics. He criticizes the media for its coverage of Trump, describing how the candidate's inflammatory campaign rhetoric led to increased publicity. The book documents a chronology of the author's thoughts over time as he begins to realize Trump's increasing chances of success. Taibbi reflects back on the events after the election, concluding Trump won because he was able to harness the power of television.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to <b>ascend</b> <b>to</b> its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E

This {{reduced the number of}} passengers on board to thirty-three, but the passenger occupying the jump seat continued to sit there on the next leg. The captain was the flying pilot for the segment. The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to <b>ascend</b> <b>to</b> flight level 90 (FL 90), which was received.

5|$|While {{the birth}} date of John Komnenos Asen is unknown, his origin is clearly {{documented}} in the sources. On both sides, he descended from the highest ranks of 14th-century Bulgarian nobility. He was born to Keratsa Petritsa, a daughter of despot Shishman of Vidin, and Sratsimir, the despot of Kran. John's mother was a descendant of the Asen dynasty as a grand granddaughter of Tsar Ivan Asen II. His siblings were Ivan Alexander, who would <b>ascend</b> <b>to</b> the Bulgarian throne in 1331, and Helena, who married Serbian ruler Stephen Dušan in 1332. Even though John was {{commonly referred to as}} a Komnenos in the sources, his relations to that Byzantine family are rather scarce. He had rights to that name either through his mother's descent from the Asens, themselves related to the Komnenoi, or through his marriage to Anna Palaiologina.|$|E
5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on a given day, the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to <b>ascend</b> <b>to</b> avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E
