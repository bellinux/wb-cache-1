5|$|Rutherford's Liberals self-identified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>of</b> free enterprise, in {{contrast}} to the public ownership-supporting Conservatives. Despite this, they made a limited number of large-scale forays into government operation of utilities, the most notable of which was the creation of Alberta Government Telephones. In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies. Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies. The largest of this latter group was the Bell Telephone Company, which held a monopoly over service in Calgary. Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907. The government constructed a number of lines, beginning with one between Calgary and Banff, and also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>of</b> “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E

25|$|McKinley {{relied heavily}} on finance, railroads, {{industry}} and the middle classes for his support and cemented the Republicans <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>of</b> business. His campaign manager, Ohio's Mark Hanna, developed a detailed plan for getting contributions from the business world and McKinley outspent his rival William Jennings Bryan by a large margin. This emphasis on business was in part mitigated by Theodore Roosevelt, the presidential successor after McKinley's assassination in 1901, who engaged in trust-busting. McKinley was the first President to promote pluralism, arguing that prosperity would be shared by all ethnic and religious groups.|$|E
25|$|The 1896 {{realignment}} cemented the Republicans <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>of</b> big business, while Theodore Roosevelt {{added more}} small business support by his embrace of trust busting. He handpicked his successor William Howard Taft in 1908, but they became enemies on economic issues. Defeated by Taft for the 1912 nomination, Roosevelt bolted {{the party and}} led the third party ticket of the Progressive Party. The Republicans returned to the White House throughout the 1920s, running on platforms of normalcy, business-oriented efficiency, and high tariffs. The national party avoided the prohibition issue after it became law in 1920.|$|E

Also, part of the left-wing coalition considered D'Alema far too willing to conduct backroom deals with the opposition. Some moderate journalists liked D'Alema because his presidency would have given Romano Prodi a stable government since the biggest party of the Union had not been rewarded with any institutional position.|$|E
25|$|This {{attempted}} secession lasted {{five years}} amid great {{political and military}} instability due to opposition from many sectors of society, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>of</b> Sancho's widow Maria de Molina, supported by the Castilian nobility, and the high Galician clergy. Faced with this resistance, King Dom Denis of Portugal proposed to Queen Maria de Molina that John should held for him and for his heirs the Kingdom of Galicia, where he counted with the strong support of Fernando Ruiz de Castro and other noblemen, thus granting him the title of King. In 1301, after losing {{the support of the}} King of Portugal, John was forced to abandon his claim to sovereignty in exchange for a number of minor titles, thus confirming the unity of the Crown of Castile.|$|E

The RPG stressed that it had no intentions of leaving the Presidential Majority, but also that Mba Abessole would not withdraw in favor of the PDG candidate prior to the elections. On 12 July, another Presidential Majority party, the Social Democratic Party (PSD), nominated its leader, the government minister Pierre-Claver Maganga Moussavou, as its candidate for the election.|$|E

500|$|Lamont's {{opponents in}} the {{leadership}} race were the MP Tom Harris, and her fellow MSP Ken Macintosh, both of whom had also expressed a need for Labour to change if it was to win the next election.

500|$|The {{electoral votes}} of closely contested New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would {{determine}} the election. In New York, the Tammany Democrats {{decided that they}} would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would do nothing for them. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine's mother was Irish Catholic, and he had been supportive of the Irish National Land League while he was Secretary of State. The Irish, a significant group in three of the swing states, did appear inclined to support Blaine until a Republican, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech pivotal for the Democrats, denouncing them <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion."

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the Conservatives had moved away from their one-nation {{ideology}} and were increasingly supportive of capitalism and free enterprise. During the interwar period, public fear of Communism restored the Conservative Party to one-nationism as it defined itself <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>of</b> national unity and began to support moderate reform. As the effects of the Great Depression were felt in Britain, the party was drawn to even greater levels of state intervention. The Conservative Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin pursued an interventionist style of conservatism which won them democratic support because of its wide electoral appeal. Throughout the post-war consensus of the 1950s and 1960s, the Conservative Party was dominated by one-nation conservatives whose ideas were inspired by Disraeli. The social and economic policies of the consensus appealed to the paternalism of one-nation conservatism because they appeared to provide prosperity and alleviate social problems such as poverty and disease; this was intellectually developed by the [...] "new conservatism" [...] movement, led by Rab Butler. New conservatism attempted to distinguish itself from the socialism of Anthony Crosland by concentrating welfare on those in need and encouraging people to help themselves, rather than foster dependency on the state.|$|E
500|$|The Communist Party of Albania (known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Labour of Albania after 1948) {{was founded}} in November 1941 {{in the context of}} the foreign {{occupation}} of the country, with the majority of its members including its leader, Enver Hoxha, having no connection to the Comintern. Historian Jon Halliday has commented that [...] "it was set up without any known direct contact with Moscow. It was not at all a 'Moscow creation'... the bulk of the founding leadership were middle-class intellectuals on whom the strongest influences were Western intellectual traditions." [...] Albania furthermore was the only country in Eastern Europe which had liberated itself without the presence of the Red Army on its soil. A combination of these factors led Stalin to initially have been [...] "both curious and suspicious about the only leader of a Communist regime in the Soviet bloc who escaped from any historical ties or contact with the Soviet Union." [...] This, Halliday continues, [...] "was true not just of Hoxha as an individual, but of almost the entire leading group in Albania." [...] Despite this, however, Hoxha was [...] "the quintessential Stalinist. Many of the descriptions Nikita Khrushchev used to denounce Josef Stalin... could easily be applied to Enver Hoxha." ...|$|E
