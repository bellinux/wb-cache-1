The next day, the Red Sox tagged knuckleballer R.A. Dickey for 7 runs to improve to 3-1. However, the Sox lost the third game of the series as two runs given up by Steven Wright in the first inning proved to make all the difference as the Red Sox failed to score 6+ runs in a game {{for the first time this}} season.|$|E

An overnight curfew was imposed the following day with orders for the members of the civilian government to turn themselves over to the army. Private radio stations were also shut.

Bob then steals Maggie's pacifier and tells her that she must destroy Springfield to get it back. Riders then take a ride through Springfield with references to the original opening sequence before encountering Maggie again, who mistakes their car for a new pacifier, and sucks on them repeatedly, before spitting them out (getting riders wet), onto overhead power lines and catapulting them into the Simpsons' house by crashing right through the front door. While Maggie is sucking on the riders, the aroma of baby powder is released.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} of Prism started when Perry was embarking on the California Dreams Tour. She {{began with a}} process she deemed [...] "slow cooking", which consisted of recording random [...] "fragments of ideas" [...] into her mobile phone's dictaphone application. A member of Direct Management Group, Ngoc Hoang, then transcribed the audio files, which he inserted into what Perry described as a [...] "treasure chest"; such object was consulted by Perry later on during the album's recording sessions. While Perry started recording the album officially in November 2012, accompanied by Greg Wells and Greg Kurstin, she noted {{she was still in}} a [...] "dark place", and that she had not [...] "let the light in". The sessions began again in March 2013, following a trip to Madagascar which Perry credited as having [...] "put [...] priorities in perspective", thus leading her to [...] "do more work on self". Perry also viewed a video made by Eckhart Tolle, which discusses loss. She commented: [...] "When you lose something, all your foundations crumble—but that also leaves <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>hole</b> that's open for something great to come through." ...|$|E
500|$|The next day, the vengeful Karnan {{uses the}} Nagastra to try killing Arjuna, but Krishna saves Arjuna by {{preventing}} the arrow from hurting him. Since Karnan cannot use the Nagastra more than once, {{he is unable}} to kill Arjuna. A wheel of his chariot gets stuck in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>hole,</b> and he steps down to relieve it. At that time, Arjuna, under the direction of Krishna, shoots many arrows at Karnan that severely wound him. Krishna tells Arjuna that the Dharma (noble charity) that Karnan performed during his lifetime was protecting his life. Krishna disguises as a Brahmin, goes to Karnan and asks him his virtues as donation. Out of generosity, Karnan donates all his virtues to the [...] "Brahmin". At this juncture, Arjuna shoots a few more arrows at Karnan that kill him. The Pandavas, who realise that Karnan was their eldest brother mourn his death. His mother Kunti also mourns his death, while Subhangi dies due to the trauma of her husband's death in the war. Arjuna remorses killing Karnan, until Krishna reveals that the curses by Indra and Parasurama were also responsible for his death. The film ends with Karnan meeting his father [...] the Sun in the other world.|$|E
500|$|Gillian Anderson's {{character}} Dana Scully {{would not}} be available, since the writing staff had decided before the episode was written that she would spend {{most of her time}} in the hospital. As the writing staff had a hard time coming up with a story, Spotnitz saw {{this as an opportunity to}} further evolve Doggett, the new character introduced at the beginning of the eighth season. In order to fill Anderson's void, two recurring groups of characters were brought in: Walter Skinner and The Lone Gunmen. Spotnitz noted that, [...] "we were eager to get Skinner out from behind the desk, and we were always looking for opportunities to get him out of that office and get him into the field." [...] Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, was pleased with the final product. He later complimented the work of Robert Patrick, who played Doggett, saying, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>hole</b> when Mulder was gone, but I thought that Robert came in and did a wonderful job. He brought a really good energy to the set, and it was a lot of fun getting to know and work with him." [...] In addition, Spotnitz was also eager to use The Lone Gunmen in the episode, since this the episode would mark their first scene together with Doggett. [...] Robert Patrick called the episode his [...] "favorite episode," [...] because the writers saw a chance to really create a [...] "vulnerable" [...] moment for the his character, John Doggett.|$|E

Philip French, in his review for The Observer, called the film a [...] "slick, fast-moving conspiracy thriller" [...] and the gunfight in the Guggenheim [...] "spectacular". In his review for The Independent, Anthony Quinn wrote, [...] "It's reasonably efficient, passably entertaining, and strenuously playing catch-up with the Bourne movies: flat-footed Owen doesn't look as good as Matt Damon sprinting through city streets, and the editing doesn't match Paul Greengrass's whiplash pace". The New Yorker magazine's David Denby wrote, [...] "And there's <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>hole</b> {{in the middle of the}} movie: the director, Tom Tykwer, and the screenwriter, Eric Warren Singer, forgot to make their two crusaders human beings". In his review for The New York Post, Lou Lumenick wrote, [...] "There, an anticlimactic rooftop chase reminds us that Tykwer, the German director who reinvented the Euro thriller with Run, Lola, Run a decade ago, has been far surpassed by Paul Greengrass and the Bourne adventures, yet thankfully lacking the rampant and nonsensical roller-coaster style of editing, where no shot lingers for longer than a nano-second.". A.O. Scott, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "The International, in contrast, is so undistinguished that the moments you remember best are those that you wish another, more original director had tackled". Citing the climatic shoot-out in the Guggenheim, hailed by other critics as spectacular, Scott wonders if another, such as Brian de Palma could have [...] "turned into a fugue of architectural paranoia"? ...|$|E

40|$|Structure {{transformation}} by {{heat treatment}} in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) is investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. The critical temperature for {{the collapse of}} pure SWCNT {{is as high as}} 4655 K due to strong covalent carbon-carbon bonding. Above 2000 K, the cross section of SWCNT changes from circle to ellipse. The self-repairing capability is then investigated and two efficient processes are observed for the SWCNT to repair themselves. (1) In the first mechanism, vacancy defects aggregate to form <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>hole,</b> and <b>a</b> bottleneck junction is constructed nearby. (2) In the second mechanism, a local curvature is generated around the isolate vacancy to smooth the SWCNT. Benefit from the powerful self-repairing capability, defective SWCNT can seek a stable configuration at high temperatures; thus the critical temperature for collapse is insensitive to the vacancy defect density.
