5|$|When Æthelwulf {{returned}} to England, Æthelbald refused to surrender the West Saxon throne, and Æthelwulf agreed {{to divide the}} kingdom, taking the east <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> west in Æthelbald's hands. On Æthelwulf's death in 858 he left Wessex to Æthelbald and Kent to Æthelberht, but Æthelbald's death only two years later led to the reunification of the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings (thirty-five and three, respectively) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds. Notable milestones included the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, begging, and preening began {{within the first}} six days of life. Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> nest happened within seventeen days (nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days). Improvements of flight, walking and self-feeding took place within forty days. Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages, {{to the extent of}} one of two siblings living in the same area was likely killed by the other.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo Creek {{begins in}} Hartley Township, in Union County, near the Union County/Centre County border. It flows east and {{slightly}} north between Buffalo Mountain and Branch Mountain before falling steeply through two geographical features {{known as the}} Gooseneck and Buffalo Gap. The creek then turns southeast and flows out of Hartley Township. Upon leaving Hartley Township, the creek enters Lewis Township and meanders eastward, south of Jones Mountain. It passes through the Mifflinburg Reservoir. The creek then flows into southern West Buffalo Township and northern Mifflinburg. Shortly before exiting West Buffalo Township, Buffalo Creek picks up its tributary North Branch Buffalo Creek and briefly turns northwards before turning eastward again <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> township.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the {{approaching}} Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital {{would have been}} viewed {{as an act of}} capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more important than preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance. In January 1126, {{a few days before the}} New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.|$|E

5|$|In adult house sparrows, annual {{survival}} is 45–65%. After fledging <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> {{care of their}} parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens {{as they grow older}} and more experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season. The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19years and 9months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23years. The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data, but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.|$|E
5|$|Loyalty to Loyalty was the band's {{first album}} {{to reach the}} top 50 on the Billboard 200, debuting at number 21 with 22,000 copies sold in its first week. It later dropped to number 74 the next week before leaving the chart. It {{additionally}} charted within the top 40 of several additional territories, surpassing what Robbers & Cowards achieved previously. The record debuted at number 20 in Australia before dropping to number 35 the next week <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> chart. It debuted at numbers 29 and 48 in Belgium and France respectively (whereas their previous album charted at numbers 43 and 79). However, it charted thirty-three spots lower than Robbers & Cowards in the United Kingdom, entering at number 68 in that country for one week.|$|E
5|$|NY284 {{begins at}} the New Jersey state line {{in the town of}} Minisink as a northerly {{continuation}} of that state's Route284. The route heads northwest for a short distance into the village of Unionville, where it serves as the main thoroughfare through the community. In the center of the village, the highway reaches an intersection with County Route36 (CR36, named Main Street), which heads west to the New Jersey state line and becomes CR651 upon entering Sussex County. NY284 turns north at this junction, passing a handful of homes before bending to the northwest <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> village limits for less developed areas of Minisink.|$|E

5|$|Port Newark is {{the part}} of Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal and the largest cargo {{facility}} in the Port of New York and New Jersey. On Newark Bay, it is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and serves as the principal container ship facility for goods entering <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> New York metropolitan region and the northeastern quadrant of North America. The Port moved over $100 billion in goods in 2003, making it the 15th busiest in the world at the time, but was the number one container port as recently as 1985. Plans are underway for billions of dollars of improvements – larger cranes, bigger railyard facilities, deeper channels, and expanded wharves.|$|E
5|$|Rena Marlette Lesnar (née Greek and {{formerly}} Mero and Richardson; born August 8, 1967), {{better known}} as Sable, is an American model, actress, and retired professional wrestler. She is primarily known for her time in WWE. Before gaining popularity {{in the world of}} professional wrestling, she began working for WWE in 1996. As Sable, {{she was one of the}} first WWE Divas and gained considerable popularity. After feuding with Luna Vachon, and Jacqueline, Sable became the second WWF Women's Champion after the title was reinstated into the company.

5|$|Spielberg first {{contacted}} screenwriter David Self {{to adapt}} the story into a feature film. Self wrote an initial draft that remained close to the source material and retained most of its dialogue. The screenplay was then rewritten by uncredited writers, distancing the script from the graphic novel <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> core elements of the story. Some of the harsher aspects of the story were toned down as the script became more streamlined; for example, in some early drafts of the screenplay, Sullivan became an alcoholic, but this element was ultimately absent from the final version.|$|E
5|$|The Allegheny Plateau {{formed in}} the Alleghenian orogeny some 300million years ago, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa {{collided}} with the landmass that became North America, forming Pangaea. In the dissected plateau, years of erosion have cut away the soft rocks, forming the valleys, <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> hardest rocks relatively untouched. The land on which Quehanna Wild Area sits {{was part of the}} coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America in the Pennsylvanian subperiod. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today.|$|E
5|$|The army's initial forces {{included}} the 9th Rifle Corps, the 271st and 276th Rifle Divisions, the 40th, 42nd and 48th Cavalry Divisions, and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th irregularly formed Crimean Rifle divisions (later converted into regular rifle divisions) {{and a number}} of smaller units. However, due to what Erickson describes as Kuznetsov's 'sticking blindly to the prewar plan', which anticipated a seaborne assault, <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> Perekop and Sivash approaches too thinly held, Erich von Manstein, leading the German assault, was able to push past the defenses.

5|$|The mission {{objectives}} involved {{evaluating the}} performance of the spacecraft over six orbits, as well as the effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine {{how easy it was to}} control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft to drift on-orbit.|$|E

5|$|Back at {{the regular}} front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to {{increase}} their patrol activities upon the Saïo Plateau to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces. They used shoot-and-scoot tactics, avoiding counter-battery fire <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> Italians {{with the impression that}} they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. In response, the General Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison. The Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder. Eventually the South African Air Force (SAAF) committed three Hawker Hart biplanes to regularly bomb the Saïo fortress and strafe the surrounding roads. In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in Jimma in mid June. Meanwhile, the 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and were heading southeast to cut the Saïo-Yubdo road. By {{the end of the month}} the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the Didessa River. The Italian 23rd and 26th Colonial divisions were ordered to retreat through Yubdo and make a final stand at Saïo. Heavy rain, actions of the Arbegnoch and the raids from the SAAF further complicated their situation.|$|E
