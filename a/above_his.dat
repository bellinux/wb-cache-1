5|$|His head {{hangs in}} exhaustion, {{and his hands}} bleed from the {{puncture}} wounds suffered during his nailing to the cross. His arms are placed higher <b>above</b> <b>his</b> head and strain to carry {{the weight of his}} body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, the result of the contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.|$|E
5|$|His {{shooting}} accuracy {{combined with}} his long seven-foot frame and unique shooting mechanics, such as having a release point <b>above</b> <b>his</b> head, makes contesting his jump shots very difficult.

5|$|Michel Roux {{was born}} in Charolles, Saône-et-Loire, in a room <b>above</b> <b>his</b> grandfather's charcuterie (a {{delicatessen}} specializing in meat products). He moved to Paris with his family after the war, where his father Michel set up his own charcuterie, after not taking over the family business in Charolles. His father gambled away all of the family's money, and the shop was closed {{to prevent it from}} going bankrupt. By the time Michel turned ten, his father had left the family and was not heard from again.|$|E

5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more {{so that he could}} easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just <b>above</b> <b>his</b> visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} his American university career, Tonelli returned to Australia and gained selection {{for his second}} Olympics. Having cleared the political obstacles, Tonelli was given a heavy schedule of six events: both backstroke races, the 100m freestyle and butterfly, and two relays. He made little impact in the individual events, only reaching one final. Australia lacked butterfly swimmers and Tonelli was versatile, so he swum the stroke in the medley relay. He performed <b>above</b> <b>his</b> previous record, posting a time fast enough to win silver in the corresponding individual event and helping Australia to an unexpected win. Upon returning to Australia, Tonelli retired with eleven individual Australian championships in three different strokes.|$|E

As Scully and Reyes drive away, Doggett confronts {{the woman at}} gunpoint, but she runs him over. Scully places William {{under the care of}} The Lone Gunmen, but they are soon ambushed by the Overcoat Woman. With Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) incapacitated, the woman opens {{the back door of the}} van to find John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) holding William. The woman puts a gun to Byers' head.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Bojić's birth, his parents {{were living in a}} small flat at No. 4 Sremska Street, {{situated}} just <b>above</b> <b>his</b> father's shop in Belgrade's Stari Grad. Over the next decade, they had four more children– Jelica (b. 1894), Danica (b. 1896), Radivoje (b. 1900) and Dragoljub (b. 1905). All of their children survived to adulthood. When Bojić was a child, he and his family were frequently visited by his mother's cousin Jovan Sremac, the brother of humourist Stevan Sremac. Jovan is said to have greatly influenced the young Bojić, having introduced him to Serbian folk tales and medieval legends at an early age.|$|E
5|$|Blount responded {{fairly well}} to the suspension, {{improving}} his attendance in both academic and athletic pursuits. He was reinstated by newly appointed head coach Chip Kelly in March. He attended some, but not all, voluntary workouts during the off-season, but was praised for an improved attitude by fellow members of the football program. He arrived at training camp in better physical shape than in 2008. At , he was somewhat <b>above</b> <b>his</b> optimal weight, but was slimming down, and aiming for a 2,000 yard season. Blount {{was named to the}} watchlists for the Walter Camp Award and the Doak Walker Award for the 2009 season.|$|E
5|$|Fuller painted {{other works}} for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece {{reflecting}} on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, {{and he was a}} constant visitor to her dignified studio, <b>above</b> <b>his</b> office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.|$|E

5|$|In {{his last}} act of public service, in 1839 Rowan was {{appointed}} as a commissioner to adjust land claims of U.S. citizens against the Republic of Mexico. During an adjournment {{of the commission}} in 1842, Rowan returned to Kentucky to visit relatives. While there, he fell ill {{and was unable to}} return to Washington, D.C.; consequently, he resigned his commission. Rowan died July 13, 1843. He was interred in the family burial ground at Federal Hill. In his will, Rowan specified that no marker should be placed over his grave, noting that his parents' graves had no markers, and {{he did not want to}} be honored <b>above</b> <b>his</b> parents. Several years later, members of his family placed a marker over his grave, despite his wishes. According to legend, the marker frequently tumbles from its base, purportedly a manifestation of Rowan haunting his grave.|$|E
5|$|In {{his next}} title defense, Hughes fought Gil Castillo at , {{defeating}} the former Middleweight contender via TKO. Hughes started the match {{with a big}} slam {{and then began to}} attack from Castillo's guard with elbows and punches. Hughes easily avoided any submission attempts and looked far stronger than Castillo. As he passed to half guard, Castillo was bleeding <b>above</b> <b>his</b> left eye. The challenger's only offense was a weak triangle choke that went nowhere. The round ended with Hughes on top, ground-and-pounding his opponent. Between rounds doctors ruled that the resulting cut was too severe to continue, and Hughes was declared the winner due to stoppage.|$|E
5|$|Its {{main body}} is solid {{sterling}} silver and silver gilt, while its plinth {{is made of}} malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, <b>above</b> <b>his</b> head at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E
