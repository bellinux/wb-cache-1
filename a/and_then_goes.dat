25|$|VeloBind {{is used to}} {{permanently}} rivet pages together using {{a plastic}} strip {{on the front and}} back of the document.

The excess portion of the pins is cut off and the plastic heat-sealed to create a relatively flat bind method. VeloBind provides a more permanent bind than comb-binding, but is primarily used for business and legal presentations and small publications.|$|E
25|$|In a 1997 {{paper on}} the effect of police hiring on crime rates, Levitt used the timing of mayoral and gubernatorial {{elections}} as an instrumental variable to identify a causal effect of police on crime.

The findings of this paper were found {{to be the result of}} a programming error. This was pointed out in a comment by Justin McCrary published in the American Economic Review in 2002.
