5|$|Naylor had scouted Australia {{to get an}} idea of {{locations}} and finance costs, with pre-production beginning in 2004 and filming planned for 2005. However, finding sufficient funding has been difficult. Naylor explained <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Red</b> Dwarf Dimension Jump convention that the film had been rejected by the BBC and the British Film Council. Reasons given for the rejections were that while the script was considered to be funny, it was not ready.|$|E

25|$|In January 2015, bus 617 and bus 747 were {{involved}} in separate accidents, resulting in the complete write-off of 747. 617 was repaired at the Yale Transit Yard, and returned to active service in early 2016. Nobody was seriously harmed in either accident, and both accidents were caused by other vehicles failing to stop <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> light.|$|E

25|$|When a train stopped <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> stop signal, its {{presence}} on the track started a time delay relay. At {{the conclusion of the}} time delay, the red marker light was extinguished and replaced by the miniature yellow (the upper red aspect remained lit). The train stop also lowered. The calling on aspect authorised the driver to proceed, but to be prepared to stop short of another train.|$|E

25|$|Through most of Canada, {{a driver}} may turn right <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> light after {{coming to a}} {{complete}} stop unless a sign indicates otherwise. In the province of Quebec, turning right on a red was illegal until a pilot study carried out in 2003 showed that the right turn on red manoeuvre {{did not result in}} significantly more accidents. Subsequent to the study, the Province of Quebec now allows right turns on red except where prohibited by a sign. However, like in New York City, it remains illegal to turn right on a red anywhere on the Island of Montreal. Motorists are reminded of this by large signs posted at the entrance to all bridges.|$|E
25|$|Around 316 AD, Frumentius and {{his brother}} Edesius from Tyre {{accompanied}} their uncle on a voyage to Ethiopia. When the vessel stopped <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Red</b> Sea port, the natives killed all the travelers except the two brothers, who {{were taken to the}} court as slaves. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity. Frumentius became the first bishop of Aksum. A coin dated to 324 shows that Ethiopia was the second country to officially adopt Christianity (after Armenia did so in 301), although the religion may have been at first confined to court circles; it was the first major power to do so.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not unusual}} for a young star to possess a debris disk; Zeta Doradus A is no exception, as it has been found to have an infra-red excess {{indicative}} of a disk of small bodies like comets re-emitting absorbed light <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>redder</b> wavelength. For Zeta Doradus A, the dust disk has a luminosity of 6.0 x 10−6 times the solar luminosity and a temperature of 91 ± 12 Kelvin, indicating that it lies <b>at</b> <b>a</b> separation of several AU.|$|R

25|$|At 6:43 pm, {{truck driver}} Larry Tarvin, driving down Florence, stopped <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> light at Normandie {{in a large}} white {{delivery}} truck. He was pulled from the truck {{by a group of}} men including Henry Watson, who proceeded to kick and beat him, before striking him unconscious with a fire extinguisher taken from his own vehicle. He lay unconscious for more than a minute as his truck was looted, before staggering back to his vehicle. With the help of an unknown African American named Rodney, Tarvin was able to drive his truck out of further harm's way. Just before he did so, another truck, driven by Reginald Denny, entered the intersection.|$|E
25|$|RoboMary {{can examine}} the {{computer}} brain of similar non-color-locked robots {{when they look}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> tomato, and see exactly how they react {{and what kinds of}} impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing a red tomato. RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing a red tomato, RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing a red tomato. In this way, without ever seeing a red tomato through her cameras, she will know exactly {{what it is like to}} see a red tomato.|$|E
25|$|As Bryant {{drove down}} to Seascape, he shot <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> Ford Falcon coming the other way, smashing its front windscreen. Upon {{arriving}} at Seascape, {{he got out of}} his car. A Holden Frontera 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and actually slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable. He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm. The car was going downhill so it was able to roll down the road out of sight around a corner. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.|$|E

25|$|When General Wrangel's White Army {{forces were}} decisively {{defeated}} in November 1920, the Communists immediately turned on Makhno and the anarchists once again. After refusing a direct order by the Bolshevik government to disband his anarchist army, Makhno intercepted three messages from Lenin to Christian Rakovsky, {{the head of}} the Bolshevik Ukrainian Soviet based in Kharkiv. Lenin's orders were to arrest all members of Makhno's organization and to try them as common criminals. On November 26, 1920, less than two weeks after assisting Red Army forces to defeat Wrangel, Makhno's headquarters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Red</b> Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow, and executed. Makhno escaped, but was soon forced into retreat as the full weight of the Red Army and the Cheka's Special Punitive Brigades was brought to bear against not only the Makhnovists, but all anarchists, even their admirers and sympathizers.|$|E
25|$|Nine {{months after}} the downing of Iran Air Flight 655, {{on the morning of}} March 10, 1989, Rogers' wife Sharon escaped uninjured when a pipe bomb {{exploded}} and set fire to her minivan as she sat stopped <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> light {{across the street from the}} University Towne Center shopping mall in San Diego. The van was registered in the name of Will Rogers III, and many people at the time of the bombing suspected that terrorism was involved. Five months later, the Associated Press reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had shifted focus away from terrorism towards the possibility of someone with a personal vendetta against Capt. Rogers. As of 2003, the bombing of Rogers' van remains an unsolved case, despite a major investigation involving at some time up to 300 police and FBI agents. On February 17, 1993, the case was featured on the TV show Unsolved Mysteries, but no additional information was uncovered.|$|E
25|$|At 11:0011:05p.m. (PDT), {{they were}} halted on Las Vegas Boulevard by Metro bicycle police {{for playing the}} car stereo too loudly and not having license plates, which {{were found in the}} trunk of Knight's car; the party was {{released}} a few minutes later without being ticketed. At 11:10p.m. (PDT), while they were stopped <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> light at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their left side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the women and invited them to Club 662. At 11:15p.m. (PDT), a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with an unknown number of occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side, rolled down a window, and rapidly fired gunshots at Shakur. He was hit four times, twice in the chest, once in the arm, and once in the thigh. One of the bullets went into Shakur's right lung. Knight was hit in the head by fragmentation. The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that, when he was about to ride along with the rapper in Knight's car, Shakur asked him to drive the car of Shakur's fiancée, Kidada Jones, instead, in case they needed additional vehicles for the drive from Club 662 to the hotel. The bodyguard reported in his documentary, Before I Wake, that, shortly after the assault, one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but that he never heard from the occupants.|$|E
