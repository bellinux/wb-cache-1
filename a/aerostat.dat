50|$|One {{method of}} keeping working HAWP systems aloft {{is to use}} buoyant <b>aerostats</b> {{whether or not the}} {{electric}} generator is lifted or left on the ground. The <b>aerostats</b> are usually, but not always, shaped to achieve a kiting lifting effect.

25|$|Once in Chile {{the crew}} had serious {{difficulties}} with the generation of hydrogen, due to the accidental loss {{of most of the}} sulfuric acid imported from Argentina. Bradley decided to resort to coal gas, produced in Chile and readily available, with a high percentage of hydrogen. The odyssey would have been impossible without the cooperation of Chilean authorities, who responded more favorably to Bradley's request for support than did officials in his native Argentina. The crossing of the Andes on an <b>aerostat</b> filled with coal gas was finally accomplished on June 24, 1916. At an altitude of 8,100m, the temperature dropped to -30°C. The adventure lasted {{three and a half hours}} from the moment of liftoff in Santiago to the landing in Cerro de la Cepa, Uspallata, Mendoza, Argentina. Bradley and Zuloaga were welcomed in Argentina as national heroes.|$|E

2500|$|On October 28, 2015, {{one of two}} JLENS aerostats {{being used}} to conduct a test over Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, became untethered. It was escorted by two fighter jets as it drifted at an {{altitude}} of approximately 16,000 feet towards Pennsylvania. About three hours later, it was reported by NORAD to be approaching the ground near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles north of Aberdeen. Its dragging [...] tether reportedly downed many power lines in the area, with loss of electrical power to as many as 20,000 area residents. The Pennsylvania State Police reported less than an hour later that the <b>aerostat</b> was [...] "contained". It was found tangled in trees in Anthony Township, Pennsylvania. The Pentagon suspended trials of the system after the incident until the Army completed its investigation of how the <b>aerostat</b> broke free. The program was said to be [...] "hanging by a thread" [...] after the incident. By February 2016, the investigation had found that a malfunctioning pressure sensing device caused a loss of air pressure in the tail fins, leading to the loss of aerodynamic efficiency which, along with increased wind drag, exacerbated tension on the tether to the point of breakage. [...] Following the incident, the military initially decided that the JLENS should continue with its operational exercise because of the unique cruise-missile defense capability it provides, determining that changes and procedures will enable it to safely fly again.|$|E
2500|$|The system {{features}} two tethered aerostats, roughly [...] in length, that {{float to}} {{an altitude of}} [...] for up to 30 days at a time.

[...] JLENS {{is designed to provide}} 24/7, 360-degree coverage extending [...] [...] The surveillance radar scans in all directions to pick up targets, then the targeting radar looks only in a certain segment to guide weapons to it.

2500|$|Born in {{the city}} of La Plata, Argentina on April 9, 1887, Bradley was the son of Tomás Bradley Sutton, veteran of the Paraguayan War, and Mary Hayes O’Callaghan. He began his pilot's career {{alongside}} Jorge Newbery. His brevet was the first issued following the newly created regulations of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Shortly after Newbery's death in 1914, he set out to honor his late friend by attempting to cross the Andes in an <b>aerostat.</b> Already an experienced balloonist, Bradley had made over one hundred ascensions and set records for altitude (6,900 meters), flight duration (28 hours, 10 minutes), and distance covered in-flight (900km, to [...] Rio Grande do Sul from Buenos Aires).|$|E

2500|$|Wide Area Persistent Surveillance (also Wide Area Motion Imaging) {{is a form}} of {{airborne}} surveillance system that collects pattern-of-life data by recording motion images of an area larger than a city – [...] in sub-meter resolution. This video allows for anyone within the field of regard to be tracked – [...] both live and retroactively, for forensic analysis. The use of sophisticated tracking algorithms applied to the WAMI dataset also enables mass automated geo-location tracking of every vehicle and pedestrian. WAMI sensors are typically mounted on manned airplanes, drones, blimps and aerostats. WAMI is currently in use on the souther border of the USA and has been deployed in Baltimore, Dayton Ohio as well as in Los Angeles, specifically targeting Compton. [...] Wide Area Persistent Surveillance systems such as ARGUS WAMI are capable of live viewing and recording a 68< square mile area with enough detail to view pedestrians and vehicles and generate chronographs These WAMI cameras, such as Gorgon Stare, Angelfire, Hiper Stare, Hawkeye and ARGUS, create airborne video so detailed that pedestrians can be followed across the city through forensic analysis. This allows investigators to rewind and playback the movements of anyone within this 68 square mile area for hours, days or even months at a time depending on the airframe the WAMI sensors are mounted on.

60|$|One conceives them at first, each little {{hole with}} its watchful, well-equipped couple of assassins, turning up their eyes in expectation. The wind is with our enemy, and his captive {{balloons}} have been disagreeably overhead {{all through the}} hot morning. His big guns have suddenly become nervously active. Then, a little murmur along the pits and trenches, and from somewhere over behind us, this air-shark drives up the sky. The enemy's balloons splutter a little, retract, and go rushing down, and we send a spray of bullets as they drop. Then against our <b>aerostat,</b> and with the wind driving them clean overhead of us, come the antagonistic flying-machines. I incline to imagine {{there will be a}} steel prow with a cutting edge {{at either end of the}} sort of <b>aerostat</b> I foresee, and conceivably this aerial ram will be the most important weapon of the affair. When operating against balloons, such a fighting-machine will rush up the air as swiftly as possible, and then, with a rapid contraction of its bladders, fling itself like a knife at the sinking war-balloon of the foe. Down, down, down, through a vast alert tension of flight, down it will swoop, and, if its stoop is successful, slash explosively at last through a suffocating moment. Rifles will crack, ropes tear and snap; there will be a rending and shouting, a great thud of liberated gas, and perhaps a flare. Quite certainly those flying machines will carry folded parachutes, and the last phase of many a struggle will be the desperate leap of the aeronauts with these in hand, to snatch one last chance of life out of a mass of crumpling, fallen wreckage.|$|E
60|$|These German {{airships}} {{were held}} together by rib-like skeletons of steel and aluminium and a stout inelastic canvas outer-skin, within which was an impervious rubber gas-bag, cut up by transverse dissepiments into from fifty to a hundred compartments. These were all absolutely gas tight and filled with hydrogen, and the entire <b>aerostat</b> was kept at any level {{by means of a}} long internal balloonette of oiled and toughened silk canvas, into which air could be forced and from which it could be pumped. So the airship could be made either heavier or lighter than air, and losses of weight through the consumption of fuel, the casting of bombs and so forth, could also be compensated by admitting air to sections of the general gas-bag. Ultimately that made a highly explosive mixture; but in all these matters risks must be taken and guarded against. There was a steel axis to the whole affair, a central backbone which terminated in the engine and propeller, and the men and magazines were forward in a series of cabins under the expanded headlike forepart. The engine, which was of the extraordinarily powerful Pforzheim type, that supreme triumph of German invention, was worked by wires from this forepart, which was indeed the only really habitable part of the ship. If anything went wrong, the engineers went aft along a rope ladder beneath the frame. The tendency of the whole affair to roll was partly corrected by a horizontal lateral fin on either side, and steering was chiefly effected by two vertical fins, which normally lay back like gill-flaps {{on either side of the}} head. It was indeed a most complete adaptation of the fish form to aerial conditions, the position of swimming bladder, eyes, and brain being, however, below instead of above. A striking, and unfish-like feature was the apparatus for wireless telegraphy that dangled from the forward cabin--that is to say, under the chin of the fish.|$|E
