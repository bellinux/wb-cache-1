5|$|Although he {{was also}} Prime Minister of Romania for three {{mandates}} (1918, 1920–1921, 1926–1927), his political success is not as spectacular <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> one. Averescu ended up {{as one of the}} pawns maneuvered by Brătianu. Argetoianu later repeatedly expressed his distaste for Averescu's hesitant stance and openness to compromise.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{his form}} for the Services, Hassett was {{selected}} in the Australian team for a brief five-match tour of New Zealand in February and March 1946. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> men played poorly in Australia, the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Many other {{armed forces}} see <b>the</b> squad <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{smallest}} <b>military</b> unit; some countries' armies have a pair {{consisting of two}} soldiers <b>as</b> <b>the</b> smallest <b>military</b> unit.

5|$|In {{the last}} 60 years several Commonwealth {{countries}} have introduced their own honours systems, {{separate from the}} British Honours System. Australia, Canada and New Zealand have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> Cross with their own awards. Most Commonwealth countries, however, still recognise some form of the VC as their highest decoration for valour.|$|E
5|$|The home leg of {{the tour}} was a poor end to the long and taxing Australian Services campaign. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> men played poorly in Australia, the {{national}} selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand. Johnson then helped to arrange England's first post-war tour of Australia, in 1946–47.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of Japan, Bruce served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> governor of Hokkaidō. In 1946, he was transferred to be, briefly, commander of the 7th Infantry Division which was occupying Korea. He returned to the United States in October 1947, becoming deputy army commander of the Fourth Army stationed at Fort Sam Houston in Texas.

5|$|Antigonid Macedonian kings {{relied on}} various {{regional}} officials to conduct affairs of state. This included high-ranking municipal officials, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> strategos and the politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) {{of a large}} city (polis), {{as well as the}} politico-religious office of the epistates. No evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been chosen among the same group of aristocratic philoi and hetairoi who filled vacancies for army officers.|$|E
5|$|During {{and shortly}} after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were {{inserted}} into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the populace. They were usually located near any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structures occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a moat for the castle. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and their financial and judicial roles. When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11thand 12thcenturies, settlement in those countries was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns was often linked {{with the creation of}} a castle.|$|E
5|$|Following the coup, Nhung's {{commanding}} officer, General Minh, {{became the}} President of South Vietnam, ruling through a military junta known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> Revolutionary Council.

5|$|On 17 January 1968, the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents {{of the insurgency}} numbered no more than 4–5,000. During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> wing of the party. As early {{as the end of}} the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate his relationship with the communists. His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.|$|E
5|$|On March 29, Confederate {{president}} Jefferson Davis {{called on}} the Confederate Congress to pass a conscription bill. The bill would require a three-year term of service for all able-bodied white men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35. At first, the bill was unpopular, but <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> situation grew more desperate for the Confederacy, both houses quickly passed it. Still, the measure caused some to question Davis' military decisions; among them was Burnett, usually one of Davis' staunchest allies. In an April 19, 1862 address to the legislature, Burnett denounced Davis' preference for those who were, like Davis himself, graduates of West Point. The speech drew such a vigorous positive response from the gallery that some of the most zealous had to be removed.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{among the}} German {{members of the}} {{delegation}} were Niedermayer and von Hentig.

Another creature appears, and they communicate with one another and possibly mate via light impulses. The creatures leave <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> arrives.

5|$|After {{the end of}} World War I Kilkis saw {{service in}} the Allied {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea. While supporting the French and British forces defending Sevastopol in April 1919, Kilkis observed mutinies on several French battleships. Her crew taunted the French mutineers by hanging a dummy from the yardarm. Kilkis then returned to Greece. During the subsequent Greco-Turkish War, Kilkis served in support of landings to seize Ottoman territory. On 15 May 1919, she {{and a pair of}} destroyers escorted a convoy of six transports carrying the troops that undertook the occupation of Smyrna and its environs. Kilkis carried Rear Admiral Kaloulides, who thereafter served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> governor of the city. The Ottoman Navy had been interned by the Allies after the end of World War I, and so provided no opposition to the Royal Hellenic Navy's activities.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had never}} {{finished}} high school, {{with the help of}} the GI Bill, Rothenberg completed a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in 1954. He attended graduate school at the University of Chicago, where he was recognized as an argumentative, sometimes abrasive, graduate student with a keen mind. As a graduate student, Rothenberg reviewed W.E.D. Allens Caucasian Battlefields: A History of the Wars on the Turco-Caucasian Border, 1828–1921 (Cambridge University Press, 1953) for Journal of Modern History, He wrote his 1956 masters' thesis entitled General Crook and the Apaches, 1871–1874: the campaign in the Tonto Basin. Rothenberg received his doctorate from the University of Illinois: his 1959 dissertation, Antemurales Christianitatis: then military border in Croatia, 1522–1749, was published in 1960 by the University of Chicago Press, <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Military</b> Border in Croatia, 1522–1749; he followed this with a second study, The Military Border in Croatia, 1750–1888: a study of an imperial institution in 1966, also published by University of Chicago Press. Both volumes were translated into German in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> secretary to Sir John Byng, the Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, and in July 1831 became the State Secretary to the Marquess of Anglesey, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He {{was promoted to}} colonel on 22 July 1830. In 1834 he became the Inspector-General of Police in Ulster, but was passed over for the position of Inspector-General of the Irish constabulary in 1836; the possibility of his appointment to the latter post had caused some concern among Irish Tories, who felt he was too critical of the Orange Order. He was later rumoured to {{be a candidate for}} the governorship of Dominica, in the West Indies, though this post {{does not seem to have}} materialised. In 1838 he was ordered to Canada to act as adjutant-general for the force garrisoned there after the Rebellions of 1837. When Lord Hill was retiring from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1839, Anglesey was suggested as a replacement to succeed him, although he eventually turned down the job; had he taken it up, Stovin was widely expected to become his personal secretary, the same capacity he had served in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|In 1085, when Alexios {{recovered}} the strategically important Adriatic {{port city of}} Dyrrhachium from the Normans who had occupied it, John Doukas was installed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> governor (doux) of the local province. John remained there until 1092, when he was replaced by John Komnenos, {{the son of the}} emperor's brother, the sebastokrator Isaac. His tenure was apparently very successful. John repelled the Serbian incursions from Duklja and Raška, and even, according to Anna Komnene, captured the Dukljan king Constantine Bodin (r. 1081–1101), before restoring him to power as a client of the Byzantine Empire. Thus John managed to restore order in the region of Albania and Dalmatia, which had suffered greatly during the Byzantine–Norman wars of the previous years. Surviving correspondence from the archbishop Theophylact of Ohrid is a testimony to his success; after John's departure from the post, Theophylact expressed nostalgia for the time of his governorship and asked for his advice.|$|E
