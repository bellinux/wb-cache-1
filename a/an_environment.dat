5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on August27 {{and reached the}} eastern Pacific on September7. Tracking westward, little development occurred until September18, when associated shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase. Following visible satellite trends, the National Hurricane Center deemed the disturbance organized enough to be declared a tropical depression at 0600UTC on September19, while located about 1,200mi (1930km) west-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California. In <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> of cool ocean temperatures and stable air, the depression failed to organize as it turned west-northwest.

Tracking westward, the depression {{began to move}} across waters too cool to support a tropical cyclone and into <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> of moderate shear. The low-level circulation became ill-defined and exposed, leading to degeneration to a remnant low at 0600UTC on July11 about 910mi (1465km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.

5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E

A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E
