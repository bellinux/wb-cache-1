40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{feasibility}} research was to study a novel sensor based separation method for recycling of plastic materials from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) by using eigen-frequency response of impact acoustic emission. In this research three kinds of commonly used plastics, polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and styrene-maleic-anhydride (SMA) sampled from end-of-life vehicles, were researched. Almost all the crushed plastic scraps had a flake structure, theoretically their impact response behaviors were determined by their diameters and thicknesses. The equivalent diameters of the scraps were characterized by fine sieving and their thicknesses were measured online by a 3 D laser triangulation sensor above the conveying path. Following this the scraps were free dropped one-by-one to impact with an impact passive body on which impact acoustic emission (AE) signals were generated and acquired by an <b>acoustic</b> <b>pickup</b> sensor. Thirdly, the AE signals which carried eigen-frequency response features were processed and characterized. Results demonstrated that the scraps with diameters < 8 mm were too weak for the actual devices to process; the scraps with diameter from 8 – 13 mm still generated {{quite a lot of}} AE signals of inadequate intensity. Finally the general characterization and recognition yields were 64. 6 %, 61. 7 %, and 63. 9 % of PP, ABS, and SMA in mass, respectively of tested materials...|$|E

5000|$|The Standard Series {{consists}} {{of all their}} standard active guitar, bass, and <b>acoustic</b> <b>pickups,</b> including humbucking, single coil, and bass models for 4, 5, and 6 string basses. EMG active pickups (such as the EMG 60, EMG 81, EMG 85, and EMG 89) tend to have much higher output than passive pickups of similar design (such as the EMG HZ) because of the on-board preamplifier. The high output, noise-reduction and responsiveness of EMG active pickups has made them popular with hard rock and heavy metal guitarists because they overdrive the input stage of guitar amplifiers more dramatically than a lower output pickup could. In 2012 EMG introduced a new 57/66 set to replace the outdated EMG 60 and EMG 81 configuration in which the designs were based off the James Hetfield [...] "JH Het Set" [...] to mix high output from a passive pickup with the punch of the active pickups.|$|R
5000|$|Justin first {{approached}} Mike Doolin, {{an innovative}} luthier with an excellent reputation, {{to build a}} double-neck steel-string guitar. Justin wanted a guitar with two identical DADGAD-tuned necks to expand on his unique two-handed tapping style. The challenge was to design an instrument that could handle 340 pounds of string tension and yet still be acoustically responsive. The instrument features many of Doolin's innovations, including a pinless bridge, and adjustable neck angles. Doolin and King chose an instrument with a modified jumbo-style body, cocobolo (rosewood) back and sides, and a redwood top. The redwood is incredibly strong and stable, {{while at the same}} time being dynamic and possessing a rich acoustic tone. They also decided on using B-Band <b>acoustic</b> <b>pickups,</b> which are known for their excellent fidelity. The result is an unprecedented instrument, completely unique, with a wonderful tone. This can be seen on the song [...] "Knock on Wood" [...] and [...] "Crown" [...] (unofficial title).|$|R

50|$|The Ashbory uses {{silicone}} rubber strings and an <b>acoustic</b> piezo-transducer <b>pickup</b> {{to create the}} instrument's tone. The lower string tension of the instrument means that no truss rod {{is used in the}} Ashbory's neck. Unlike electric basses and electric guitars, neither the bridge nor the neck is adjustable. The manufacturer recommends that the silicone strings be dusted with talc powder to make the strings easier to play.|$|R

5000|$|Piezoelectric pickups (also called [...] "piezo" [...] pickups) are {{non-magnetic}} pickups {{that use}} a transducer to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a musical instrument}} consisting of a physical process that acoustically generates sound from the material world (i. e. sound derived from matter such as solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) which is modified by a secondary input from the informatic world. This informatic input selects attributes such as the frequency range of the musical note being sounded, while the acoustic process is kept {{in close contact with}} the user, to ensure a high degree of expressivity. In one example, ice skates with <b>acoustic</b> <b>pickups</b> are used to play music while the skater simultaneously controls a bandpass filter with a hand-held keyer and wearable computer. Each skate works much like the bow on a violin, allowing the player to hit, scrape, rub, or “bow”, the ice in various ways to create a wide variety of musical textures. Additionally the player can select sound samples on a per-note basis and then “scratch” out a melody or harmony (playing multiple samples at once) on the ice on the rink like a team of Disk Jockeys (DJs) working together to “scratch ” an array of vinyl records. Because the grooves on an ice rink are made by the player in a freeform fashion, there is much more room for variations in musical timbres and textures than with the fixed grooves of a record. Rather than merely using the keyer to trigger musical notes through MIDI note on/note off commands, we create acoustic sound through a physical process such as skating, and then turn those physical sounds into musical notes with the handheld keyer that functions as a modifier input. This combination combines the expressivity of non-electrophonic musical instruments like the violin with the flexibility of electrophones like the sound synthesizer. As a further contribution of the paper, a general taxonomy of acoustic transducers and a link to physical organology is provided, in which the top-level of the taxonomy is the stateof-matter in which the transducer operates.

50|$|DI boxes {{can be used}} on {{instruments}} {{with electronic}} circuitry and pickups that do not contain an XLR balanced output. An example of this application would be an electric keyboard that needs to be connected to a mixing board, either directly or through an audio snake. Another example would be an <b>acoustic</b> guitar with <b>pickups,</b> an electric guitar or bass guitar, or a double bass with piezoelectric pickups. These instruments could be plugged into a DI box, and the DI signal would be mixed through a mixing console into a main or monitor mix.|$|R
50|$|Many semi-{{acoustic}} and acoustic guitars, {{and some}} electric guitars and basses, {{have been fitted}} with piezoelectric pickups instead of, or in addition to, magnetic pickups. These {{have a very different}} sound, and also have the advantage of not picking up any other magnetic fields, such as mains hum and feedback from monitoring loops. In hybrid guitars, this system allows switching between magnetic pickup and piezo sounds, or simultaneously blending the output. Solid bodied guitars with only a piezo pickup are known as silent guitars, which are usually used for practicing by <b>acoustic</b> guitarists. Piezo <b>pickups</b> can also be built into electric guitar bridges for conversion of existing instruments.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2010s, {{there is}} some {{convergence}} between the functionality of keyboard combo amplifiers and small PA systems. Some keyboard amplifiers have an XLR input for a microphone and a microphone preamplifier. To use a microphone, a preamp is generally needed to boost {{the power of the}} sigal, because mic's only output a tiny, weak signal. This input's inclusion of a preamp means that it could also be used to plug in an <b>acoustic</b> guitar's piezoelectric <b>pickup.</b> This type of keyboard amplifier {{could be used as a}} PA system by a singer-songwriter who is accompanying herself or himself on guitar and keyboards in a very small venue, such as a coffeehouse.|$|R
50|$|A {{pickup device}} is a {{transducer}} (specifically a variable reluctance sensor) that captures or senses mechanical vibrations produced by musical instruments, particularly stringed instruments {{such as the}} electric guitar, electric bass guitar, Chapman Stick, or electric violin, and converts them to an electrical signal that is amplified using an instrument amplifier (such as a guitar amplifier) to produce musical sounds through a loudspeaker in a speaker enclosure. The signal from a pickup can also be recorded directly, using a DI box (a common practice with the electric bass) or broadcast on the radio or television. Most electric guitars and electric basses use magnetic <b>pickups.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> guitars, upright basses and fiddles often use a piezoelectric pickup.|$|R
50|$|Twelve-string {{electric}} guitars feature six {{pairs of}} strings, usually with each pair {{tuned to the}} same note. The extra E, A, D, and G strings add a note one octave above, and the extra B and E strings are in unison. The pairs of strings are played together as one, so the technique and tuning {{are the same as}} a conventional guitar, but they create a much fuller tone, with the additional strings adding a natural chorus effect. They are used almost solely to play harmony and rhythm parts, rather than for guitar solos. They are relatively common in folk rock music. Lead Belly is the folk artist most identified with the twelve-string guitar, usually <b>acoustic</b> with a <b>pickup.</b>|$|R
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and <b>acoustic</b> parts—from the <b>pickup</b> needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|R
