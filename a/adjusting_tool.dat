In the solution approach presented here, instead of a cylindrical lead wire, cube-shaped metal foam plates are positioned in the tool at the point to be measured.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} and compare the 3 -dimensional intersegmental motion responses produced by 3 commonly used chiropractic adjusting instruments. METHODS: Six adolescent Merino sheep were examined at the Institute for Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia. In all animals, triaxial accelerometers were attached to intraosseous pins rigidly fixed to the L 1 and L 2 spinous processes under fluoroscopic guidance. Three handheld mechanical force chiropractic adjusting instruments (Chiropractic <b>Adjusting</b> <b>Tool</b> [CAT], Activator Adjusting Instrument IV [Activator IV], and the Impulse Adjusting Instrument [Impulse]) were used to randomly apply posteroanterior (PA) spinal manipulative thrusts to the spinous process of T 12. Three force settings (low, medium, and high) and a fourth setting (Activator IV only) were applied in a randomized repeated measures design. Acceleration responses in adjacent segments (L 1 and L 2) were recorded at 5 kHz. The multiaxial intersegmental (L 1 -L 2) acceleration and displacement response at each force setting was computed and compared among the 3 devices using a repeated measures analysis of variance (alpha =. 05). RESULTS: For all devices, intersegmental motion responses were greatest for axial, followed by PA and medial-lateral (ML) measurement axes for the data examined. Displacements ranged from 0. 11 mm (ML axis, Activator IV low setting) to 1. 76 mm (PA axis, Impulse high setting). Compared with the mechanical (spring) adjusting instruments (CAT, Activator IV), the electromechanical Impulse produced the most linear increase in both force and intersegmental motion response and resulted in the greatest acceleration and displacement responses (high setting). Significantly larger magnitude intersegmental motion responses were observed for Activator IV vs CAT at the medium and high settings (P <. 05). Significantly larger-magnitude PA intersegmental acceleration and displacement responses were consistently observed for Impulse compared with Activator IV and CAT for the high force setting (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Larger-magnitude, 3 D intersegmental displacement and acceleration responses were observed for spinal manipulative thrusts delivered with Impulse at most force settings and always at the high force setting. Our results indicate that the force-time characteristics of impulsive-type adjusting instruments significantly affects spinal motion and suggests that instruments can and should be tuned to provide optimal force delivery...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} methods for reducing milling exit burrs is to prevent the tool from exiting the workpiece. Exit here refers the condition in which a cutting edge is moving out of the workpiece while removing material. Only entrance burrs can occur under this circumstance, which are usually considered burr-free. This study proposes a set of geometric algorithms for avoiding tool exits in planar milling. Two distinct approaches are developed for tool path planning of 2 -D polygons. The first approach generates exit-free tool paths by offsetting the workpiece edges with appropriate widths of cut. The second one <b>adjusts</b> <b>tool</b> positions locally on given tool paths. In addition, a two-stage algorithm is designed for 2 -D free-form contours. The cutter locations causing the tool to exit the workpiece are first detected; then a heuristic scheme is applied to generate new cutter locations with no tool exits. Experimental results show that edge quality is significantly improved using the proposed methods.

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{presents the}} potential for improved joint integrity of friction stir welding by controlling the plasticisation temperature in the weld nugget. During a typical FSW, temperature fluctuates with position {{along the length of}} the weld. Working from a basis that for all material and tool geometries, there is an Optimal Plasticisation Temperature (OPT), this paper provides a strategy for maintaining this optimal weld temperature by adjusting selected weld input parameters ensuring consistent joint quality, irrespective of component geometry or clamp configuration. This proposed methodology can also be used to determine the OPT for different FSW tool geometries and material combinations. Advanced monitoring and control strategies are essential to ensure that FSW can be made a more robust industrial process that can keep pace with the modern demand for more consistent production and reliability of welded structures. The potential lies in the possibility for an operator to now select an OPT point for a specific approved welding program and allow the welding platform to maintain the OPT via closed-loop temperature control which <b>adjusts</b> <b>tool</b> rotation and or tool traverse speed. This paper further reports on the potential of integration of a closed-loop temperature control algorithm for FSW. The system measures the temperature inside the FSW tool using thermocouple sensors (creating the feedback signal). The controller then applies a Proportional- Integral- Derivative (PID) control algorithm which in turn drives the spindle speed (and if necessary, tool traverse speed) in order to change the energy input rate to the weld for controlling plasticisation temperature...|$|R
40|$|The welding {{procedure}} to seal copper canisters requires variable power input throughout the 45 minute long weld cycle {{to keep the}} probe temperature within the process window. By using a cascaded loop that determines the power input requirement, the controller will not be dependent on repeatability in the necessary power input between weld cycles, and the lag time in the probe temperature measurement will not be critical. Due to fast-changing thermal boundary conditions during the downward sequence, a feedforward to the power input was designed to further improve controller performance. In addition to the cascade controller <b>adjusting</b> the <b>tool</b> rotation rate, a depth controller is adjusting the axial force to control the shoulder depth. The purpose is to eliminate flash due to excessive shoulder depth and to control {{the position of the}} probe tip, which influeces {{the size and shape of}} the hook defect produced. Controlling depth is challenging for several reasons, including deflection in the welding machine and thermal expansion of the weld material, and also results in cross-coupling between axial force and spindle torque. The cross-coupling was handled by another feedforward compensator that <b>adjusts</b> the <b>tool</b> rotation rate based on the commanded axial force. The implemented controllers and feedforward compensators have been evaluated over several welds with good results, where the depth is kept within ± 0. 1 mm when the tool reaches the joint line sequence and the probe temperature is held within ± 5 °C during full circumferential welds compared to a process window of ± 60 °C...|$|R

Material and Methods To describe the adaptation and the program fidelity of the Fruitful Study. Methods/design: Mixed methods study. To assess the adaptation process we registered the mismatches and conducted a focus group. To evaluate program coverage and fidelity we conducted a cross-sectional survey. Results During the adaptation, the main mismatches were: language background and content information. Several aids were developed for making possible students’ enrollment including: access to computers; support from technicians due some studies had little experience in pursing online education (less qualitied and > 50 years/old) and; reminders for the correct implementation including (in person sessions, emails, and videos). 281 clinicians registered the program. The program coverage was higher in Bolivia, where 55. 0 % of clinicians enrolled the course, compared with 29. 3 % in Guatemala, and 25. 4 % in Paraguay. Overall, 66. 2 % students completed the training. Fidelity of the curriculum plan reached the 64 %. Conclusions Program fidelity {{was similar to the}} obtained in high-income counties.

40|$|Abstract. Generally, {{ball end}} mills {{are used for}} free-form surface {{machining}}. When machining curved surfaces with large curvature change using ball end mills, {{it is necessary to}} use tools with larger curvature of the cutting edges than the maximum curvature of the surface and minute pick feeds or to change tools for fitting the curvature of one part of the surface. However this causes poor machining efficiency. The curvature of the cutting edge of a flat end mill can be fitted to the curvature of a point on machined surfaces by <b>adjusting</b> the <b>tool</b> posture. Therefore, flat end mills can efficiently cut almost all curvature curved surfaces without tool change. This paper proposes two methods for deciding tool posture and tool path for 5 -axis control machining based on minimum cusp height.
