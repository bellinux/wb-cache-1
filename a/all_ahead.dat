25|$|Reflecting new Kei car rules, in July 1976 {{the length}} of the Hatch was {{extended}} to 3190mm (wheelbase to 2100mm), <b>all</b> <b>ahead</b> of the firewall. The new front and new large bumpers made what was an already odd-looking car even stranger. Now the Suzuki Fronte Hatch 55 (or 550), it received the three-cylinder 539cc LJ50 engine, which was a de-smogged L50 engine with an extra cylinder tacked on: it was also known as the T5A/T5B in other applications. The new model code was SH10. The inside remained nearly unchanged and the only differences at the rear was a new, larger bumper, and the change to a single strut for the rear gate for increased access. Power remained 25PS as per late 360 Hatches, but torque was up considerably. The lineup was again restricted to B, D, and T models, with the T receiving chromed rather than painted bumpers.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to {{the merger}} were widespread. Amid {{descriptions}} of the team as a [...] "super-team" [...] from at least one analyst were [...] manager Bjarne Riis' claims that he simply looked forward to defeating them. Cervélo co-founder and former [...] manager Gerard Vroomen saw the merger on a strictly business level, with neither side having sufficient resources to field a team at the level they would like, while cooperatively they would. Trek had been bike supplier for both teams in 2011, and funneling money they would normally spend on two teams into one, coupled with an expected reduction in support from the electronics company RadioShack, would {{make it all the}} simpler for them to back a top-level team. The merger also drew criticism, as the two sides' initial press releases describing it did not make it seem that they were in agreement over their perception of the merger and the newly combined entity. The fact that neither ridership nor lower-level management nor ousted sponsors seemed to know about the move at <b>all</b> <b>ahead</b> of time also drew criticism.|$|E

500|$|Veuchelen {{earned the}} {{majority}} of points on offer for the mountains classification, summiting the stage's first three climbs, cresting them <b>all</b> <b>ahead</b> of Lelay and Arashiro. [...] riders began to step up the pace {{on the front of}} the peloton, looking to set up the basis for an eventual attack at Mende by Valverde. With around [...] to go, 's Blel Kadri exited the race, after breaking his left scapula in a crash. On the Côte de l'Estrade, 's Kevin Seeldraeyers and 's Laurens ten Dam attacked off the front of the main field, and set off in chase of the lead quartet. As Veuchelen continued to rack up points towards a mountains classification lead, Seeldraeyers and ten Dam continued to close on the lead group, and with around [...] remaining, they latched on to the group as they were on the outskirts of Mende. The peloton caught all bar Veuchelen a short time later, with Veuchelen relenting to the foot of the final climb of the Côte de la Croix-Neuve–Montée Laurent Jalabert, before he too was engulfed by the main field through the advancing pace of several teams {{on the front of the}} pack.|$|E
