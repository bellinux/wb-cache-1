Thefocus here is on the company's corporate development, with particular emphasison Studiocanal's acquisition of sales and distribution interests across Europe andbeyond, and with its subsequent move into television production. A study ofStudiocanal reveals {{a great deal about}} the current state of the European film andtelevision industries and allows us to rethink traditional ideas about the relationshipbetween Hollywood and Europe...|$|E

5000|$|Industrialists in {{the area}} {{combined}} to finance the construction <b>of</b> a <b>canal</b> from Pontnewynydd, a little north-west of Pontypool, to Newport, and a second arm from near Crumlin, through Rogerstone to join the first <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canal</b> at Crindau, close to Newport. Each <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canal</b> was 11 miles in length. The canal was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1792, and the Act included permission to build connecting tramways or plateways (or alternatively [...] "stone roads") to pits within seven miles <b>of</b> the <b>canal,</b> and to raise £120,000. The estimated cost was £106,000, and such was the enthusiasm for the scheme that the capital was all subscribed before the Act was passed.|$|R

500|$|The canal was {{commissioned}} in 1791 by local landowners and businessmen and built between 1791 and 1808, during the Golden Age <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> building, {{at a cost}} of £127,700 (£ today). [...] Originally designed for narrow gauge boats, during its construction the canal was altered into a broad gauge canal to allow an ultimately unrealised connection with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. [...] The canal company later converted into a railway company and built a railway line close to the canal's path, which required modifications to the Salford <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canal.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of a new physical maneuver in the treatment of the apogeotropic variant <b>of</b> horizontal <b>canal</b> benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Study Design: Case review. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Patients: The diagnosis <b>of</b> apogeotropic horizontal <b>canal</b> benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was based on the history of recurrent sudden crisis of vertigo associated with bursts of horizontal apogeotropic paroxysmal nystagmus provoked by turning the head from the supine to either lateral position. The patients were three men and five women ranging in age from 31 to 73 years (average, 49. 2 yr). Interventions: All patients were treated with a repositioning maneuver based on the hypothesis that the syndrome is caused by the presence of free-floating dense particles inside the endolymph <b>of</b> the anterior <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the horizontal <b>canal.</b> The maneuver favors their shifting into the posterior <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canal.</b> Patients were reexamined immediately after the treatment and underwent Gufoni's liberatory maneuver for the geotropic variant <b>of</b> horizontal <b>canal</b> benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Main Outcome Measure: The treatment outcome was considered as responsive when, after one repositioning maneuver, nystagmus shifted from apogeotropic to geotropic. Results: The repositioning maneuver resulted in a transformation from the apogeotropic variant into a geotropic variant <b>of</b> horizontal <b>canal</b> benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in all patients. Conclusion: This maneuver represents a simple and effective approach to the treatment of the apogeotropic variant <b>of</b> horizontal <b>canal</b> benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. It favors the shifting of the canaliths from the anterior into the posterior <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the horizontal <b>canal</b> from where they can migrate into the utricle with Gufoni's maneuver...|$|R
40|$|Seven of the 20 {{patients}} had trunk oscillations during {{the act of}} sitting up and {{for a short time}} immediately afterwards. Based on their findings, the authors propose a new type of BPPV, the so-called Type 2 BPPV (typical complaints of BPPV, no nystagmus in Dix-Hallpike positions but short vertigo spell while sitting up), which {{may be the result of}} chronic canalolithiasis within the short <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> a posterior <b>canal.</b> Furthermore, the authors suggest that Type 2 BPPV, which could be identical to sBPPV or constitute a major subgroup of it, occurs frequently among patients with vertigo. For therapy, the authors recommend repetitive sit-ups from the Dix-Hallpike positions to liberate the short <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the posterior <b>canal</b> from canaloliths...|$|R

50|$|The Kiltuish River {{originates}} in the Kitimat Ranges {{west of the}} Kowesas River and {{just north of the}} source of the Khutze River.

500|$|After {{several years}} of construction, on 9 January 1794 an {{agreement}} was reached with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Company to create a link from the Bolton <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canal</b> to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Red Moss, near Horwich. [...] This agreement required significant design changes to allow the canal to carry the wider boats used on the broad gauge Leeds and Liverpool Canal, which included a change to broad locks. [...] Benjamin Outram was employed to inspect the works, and reported {{on the cost of}} this conversion as being £26,924. [...] Although the necessary changes were implemented, the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was altered and the link was not built. [...] In the same year the Haslingden Canal link to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was proposed, from the Bury <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canal.</b> [...] Although authorised by an Act of Parliament, it too was never built. [...] The canal company remained hopeful of a link between the two canals, but all hope of this was lost when on 21 June 1819 an Act of Parliament was enacted to create a link between the Leigh extension <b>of</b> the Bridgewater <b>Canal,</b> and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.|$|R
500|$|There {{are several}} notable {{features}} along the canal, including Prestolee Aqueduct and Clifton Aqueduct, {{both of which}} are Grade II listed structures. Nob End Locks (sometimes referred to as Prestolee Locks) sit at the junction <b>of</b> the three <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canal</b> at Nob End. They comprise two sets of three staircase locks, separated by a passing basin. These locks served to lower the level <b>of</b> the <b>canal</b> by [...] over a distance of [...] The upper staircase is still visible, but most of the lower staircase was filled in {{at some point in the}} 1950s, and much of the stonework was removed.|$|R
500|$|The Manchester and Bolton Railway was {{a railway}} in the {{historic}} county of Lancashire, England, connecting Salford to Bolton.

The [...] long railway was originally to have built upon most of the line <b>of</b> the <b>canal,</b> but it was eventually built alongside the Salford and Bolton <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>canal.</b> The Act <b>of</b> Parliament also allowed {{the construction of a}} connection to Bury, but technical constraints meant that it was never built.|$|R
