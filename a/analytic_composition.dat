40|$|This Thesis {{deals with}} the problem of the quality control and {{monitoring}} and the related energy consuming aspects in industrial multicomponent distillation columns. These have important relevance especially in case of units subjected to important changes in operating conditions which manifests in fluctuation of the product concentration. Due to the low reliability of the seldom available and delayed <b>analytic</b> <b>composition</b> measurements, they cannot be employed for an efficient online monitoring of the separation. Instead, this Thesis proposes the use of composition observers with passive innovation mechanism and driven by temperature measurements. The passive structure allows {{to limit the number of}} ODEs to be online integrated, which is a central issue to obtain a product suitable for the industrial implementation. The design of this passive structure involves the choice of number and location of the temperature sensors, the choice of the innovated component and the set of modeled components in the (possibly simplified) estimation model. This issue is addressed with a simple and systematic methodology that employs steady state information about the per-component temperature gradient of the column and detectability measures and conditions. Differently from the majority of the works in literature, the proposed methodology allows also to assess the feasibility of obtaining good estimation performance using the available temperature sensors in real columns. Even the <b>analytic</b> <b>composition</b> measurements cannot be employed for quality control in feedback control loops mainly due to delay problems. Instead, temperature feedback controllers are usually used. But even if the temperature sensor is well located (and in this Thesis a criterion for sensor location is suggested based on an extension of the slope criterion to the multicomponent case), when the operating conditions undergo changes, the indirect regulation of the product quality cannot be achieved, with alternating periods of under and over-purification that also adversely affect the energy requirement for the column functioning. Thus, in this Thesis an application oriented solution is proposed consisting in adding a feedforward temperature setpoint compensation that guarantee a close quality regulation, including a more efficient management of the energy, under the changing operating modes of the column. The methodologies and techniques proposed and described in this Thesis are tested with an industrial multicomponent IC 4 -NC 4 splitter located at the Sarlux Refinery (Sarroch, Italy), which, motivated by the good results, has already implemented the composition estimator and is going to implement the feedforward setpoint compensator...|$|E

No percurso da pesquisa, trabalhei com a anÃlise do discurso e a tÃcnica da anÃlise de conteÃdo, adentrando nos documentos oficiais constituintes /instituintes da polÃtica educacional.

Os discursos sobre a qualidade na educaÃÃo sÃo, aqui concebidos, enquanto acontecimentos histÃricos e sociais, estudando-se a partir deles as estratÃgias ideolÃgicas do neoliberalismo no contexto da mundializaÃÃo do capital, que instaurou uma nova ordem no cotidiano escolar em nome da eficiÃncia, da eficÃcia e da efetividade, em detrimento do saber libertÃrio e emancipatÃrio.

Assim sendo, como {{principal}} constataÃÃo deste estudo destaco que o discurso do Plano de Desenvolvimento da Escola incorporou o discurso oficial da polÃtica pÃblica de educaÃÃo da dÃcada de 1990, baseado nos termos: qualidade, eficiÃncia, eficÃcia, efetividade, modernizaÃÃo, gerenciamento, cliente, clientela e organizaÃÃo.

For so much, I defined as phenomenon of the study the "Plano de Desenvolvimento da Escola", PDE, a federal program implanted by the "Fundo de Fortalecimento da Escola" - FUNDESCOLA, which in the CearÃ' s context, incorporated to the dynamic of reform of the public education. In the course of the research, I worked with the analysis of the speech and the technique of the content's analysis, penetrating in the official documents constitutelinstitute of the educational politics. In the undertaken analysis, I looked for to recover the speech while discursive materiality: bearer of contradictions, ideological load and relation of power. The speeches about the quality in the education are here conceived like historical and social events, being studied starting from them the ideological strategies of the neoliberalismo in the context of the globalization of the capital, that established a new order in the daily school on behalf of the efficiency, efficacy and the effectiveness, in detriment of the liberated and emancipated knowledge. Those ideological mechanisms are not put in an immediate form like ended data, but they are diluted in a not reflexive practice, so, I tried to study them for the methodological direction of the Analysis of the Speech complemented with the content analysis in the sense of decomposing your theoretical elements, making explicit your structure, for best to understand them. Like this, as main verification of this study detaches that the speech of the "Plano de Desenvolvimento da Escola" incorporated the official speech of the public politics of education of the decade of 1990, based on the terms: quality, efficiency, efficacy, effectiveness, modernization, administration, customer, clientele and organization. The constitution of those statements gives the conceptual terminology by a formation discursive unidirectional, revealed as knowledge pattern and educational practice, passively it accepts for the social actors in your daily ones. The official documents, representative of the educational guidelines and of the institutional decisions with relation to the quality in education denote the intentions of the public politics' formulators: to homogenize the guidelines and practices in the state public schools, in way to not to allow other speeches of revolutionary character or emancipator, hurting the possibilities of a real autonomy, participation and political praxis inside the schoo...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{integrated}} {{evaluation of}} geology, aerogammaspectrometry and aeromagnetometry of the Sul-Riograndense Shield is permitted by the advanced stage {{of understanding of}} the geology and geochronology of the southern Brazilian Shield and a 2010 airborne geophysical survey. Gamma rays are registered from the rocks near the surface and thus describe the distribution of major units in the shield, such as the Pelotas batholith, the juvenile São Gabriel terrane, the granulite-amphibolite facies Taquarembó terrane and the numerous granite intrusions in the foreland. Major structures are also observed, e. g., the Dorsal de Canguçu shear. Magnetic signals register near surface crustal <b>compositions</b> (<b>analytic</b> signal) and total crust composition (total magnetic signal), so their variation as measured indicates either shallow or whole crustal structures. The Caçapava shear is outstanding on the images as is the magnetic low along the N-S central portion of the shield. These integrated observations lead to the deepening of the understanding of the largest and even detailed structures of the Sul-Riograndense Shield, some to be correlated to field geology in future studies.

40|$|Mining is {{different}} from most businesses because knowledge of the product is essentially based on estimates, which {{by their very nature}} include a degree of uncertainty (Dominy, Noppé, & Annels, 2004). The risks associated with mining are varied and complex, where the dominant source of risk is the orebody itself (Snowden, Glacken, & Noppé, 2002). The modeling of orebody geology is the basis for all prediction of in-situ grades, mineral resources and recoverable ore reserves, as well as mine design and long term production forecasting. The Lower Rhine Basin is a rift basin located in northwest Germany which hosts several large lignite seams of considerable economical importance. One of these massive lignite deposits - the Garzweiler open cast mine - is containing marine and fluvial sand intrusions which are significantly affecting the reserve estimation and the operational processes. The current model based on a deterministic "best guess" approach fails to properly predict these sand partings within the lignite seams. Probabilistic or stochastic models can provide an alternative. The aim of this thesis is to elaborate a first appraisal of the possibilities for RWE Power AG to apply geostatistical modeling at its Garzweiler lignite operation. An analysis is made of the available datasets and of the applicable geostatistical methods, including their strengths and shortcomings. This exercise of applying the relevant geostatistical methods to the different datasets provides new insights for predictive modeling. On this basis, recommendations are formulated for geostatistical modeling methods applicable to the unmined area of the Garzweiler mine. Data collection is not an aim in itself. Purposeful data collection presupposes a theory or a model which gives meaning and significance to raw data by processing them as information that is useful and needed for a specified goal. In the context of this project, this goal is the accurate prediction of the composition of a lignite seam. The different data types are thoroughly described and their strengths and limitations are clearly indicated. From {{the point of view of}} geostatistical modeling, the current practice of collecting and processing surveying data has potential for improvement, because of the limited applicability of the existing data. While collecting surveying data demands great effort, production data - digitally stored and therefore easily automated - are readily available at no cost. A continuous, automated input of available production data creates a model with permanently updated geostatistical predictions and therefore a reduction of the empirical error. In addition, drill data provide information for a wider area about not only the coal / sand ratio, but also on the ash content of the lignite. Ideally, this geostatistical model should be complemented with the KOLA data - online <b>analytics</b> of coal <b>composition.</b> The KOLA data themselves can be used for predictive purposes, but above all they possess the unique advantage of being able to validate the predicted ash content. However, practical obstacles prevent an effective use of these data. The ordinary kriging method is widely in use and in general gives good predictions. These predictions are accompanied by an estimated error. In the context of the stationarity assumption - one of the fundaments of kriging - a significant limitation arises: ordinary kriging is poorly able to cope with sudden “structural” changes. Introducing an automation step will generate a model where continuous input and usage of the available data will result in permanently updated geostatistical predictions and a reduction of the empirical error, particularly in changing environments. The indicator approach, though not providing accurate predictions, does have the virtue of signaling areas with specific features. As opposed to kriging, simulation does not require a normally distributed dataset. The creation of multiple realizations gives a better feeling for possible scenarios of future mining. Simulation applied to ash content data presents promising results. Resource EngineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
