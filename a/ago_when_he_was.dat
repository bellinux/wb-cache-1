5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 April 2008, President Uribe {{revealed}} that a former paramilitary fighter had accused him of helping to plan the 1997 massacre of El Aro, a charge which he said was under official investigation. Uribe described the accuser as a [...] "disgruntled convict with an axe to grind", denied the charges and said there was proof of his innocence. The Colombian newsweekly Revista Semana reported that the paramilitary in question, Francisco Enrique Villalba Hernández, had not mentioned Uribe during previous declarations made {{more than five years}} <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sentenced for his own role in the massacre. The magazine also listed a number of possible inconsistencies in his most recent testimony, including the alleged presence of General Manosalva, who had died months before the date of the meeting where the massacre was planned.|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot detach it, sir," [...] I answered. [...] "The {{bracelet}} has a Bramah lock, and Lord Chelsford has the key. He {{used to wear}} it {{many years}} <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Queen's messenger." ...|$|E
60|$|He ordered dinner, and {{sat down}} in the very corner, at the very table perhaps! (things did not {{progress}} much at the 'Disunion,' a Club of almost Radical principles) at which he and young Jolyon used to sit twenty-five years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taking the latter to Drury Lane, during his holidays.|$|E
5000|$|Tayao {{conceptualized}} {{the project}} 8 years <b>ago,</b> back <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still active with Queso.

6000|$|Long <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> famous {{among his}} {{earliest}} competitors {{as a youth}} of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been read at his father's grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets, among the heavy shadows, with {{the moon and the}} clouds sailing on high above him. [...] "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though <b>he</b> <b>were</b> dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he didn't tell me. He {{was talking}} to a friend of his. He thought I was reading my book. So I was--but I heard it all. It was more {{interesting}} than my book.

6000|$|Pluffles' {{weakness}} was {{not believing}} what people said. He preferred {{what he called}} [...] "trusting to his own judgment." [...] He had as much judgment as he had seat or hands; and this preference tumbled him into trouble once or twice. But the biggest trouble Pluffles ever manufactured came about at Simla--some years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> four-and-twenty.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure. You are {{the son of}} Peter Cragg, my father's brother, who {{returned}} to Ireland many years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a young man.

5000|$|Evans remarks {{upon the}} song [...] "Why soe pall and wan fond louer" [...] and notes {{that it was}} {{probably}} written and known prior to its appearance in John Suckling's play Aglaura, based on the character Orsames's comments to it: [...] "I little foolish counsel, Madame, I gave / a Friend of mine four or fives years <b>ago</b> / <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> falling into a consumption." [...] Evans notes that the song was easy to perform, {{so that it could}} be sung by regular members of the acting company (rather than a professional singer). [...] L.A. Beaurline states that this setting of [...] "Why So Pale and Wan" [...] is the earliest existing musical setting of this lyric.|$|R

60|$|He {{said he was}} {{surprised}} {{that a man who}} could be so sensible, occasionally, as myself, could have patience to even think of such old-womanish nonsense.

60|$|The {{answer is}} a very simple one. Mr. Roosevelt works systematically, as do all who want their labor to amount to something. Years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{physically}} weak, he determined to make himself strong. He persisted in vigorous exercise, especially in the open air, {{and in the end}} attained a bodily health which any ordinary man may well envy.|$|E
60|$|He blamed {{himself for}} having done this last, however, afterwards. He {{seemed to think}} that he could have avoided this expense by {{assuming}} ignorance of the German language.

5000|$|Professor Gordon Naismith is {{an average}} man in most respects, {{except that he}} has {{exceptional}} reflexes, {{and he has no}} memory of his life prior to four years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> believes <b>he</b> <b>was</b> involved in a plane crash. During one of his classes a student asks a disturbing question: “What is a zug?” The question triggers a series of violent incidents, and Naismith is framed for a murder. He learns that the student is not human, but rather an [...] "Ugly", and that <b>he</b> himself <b>is</b> a [...] "Shefth", a member of the warrior class from Earth's far future. In that future, a Time Barrier was constructed to keep violent aliens called Zugs in the past. The future humans supposedly want a Shefth to go kill a Zug which survived the Time Barrier. The Uglies take Naismith to the future, where Naismith learns that most humans died during a plague. The Uglies catch Naismith; he escapes onto a half-finished time machine which doesn’t go through time but oscillates through the core of the Earth before popping out the other side. Naismith is rescued by a girl who takes him to the point in time when the Time Barrier <b>is</b> erected; here <b>he</b> <b>is</b> expected to kill the surviving Zug.|$|R
50|$|The next day, Ben {{goes back}} to school, and has trouble {{adjusting}} to normal life again. After a bad day he gets bullied by Cash (Tyler Patrick Jones) and JT (Tyler Foden) and two girls he tried to flirt with earlier in the movie resulting in Greymatter (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) getting his revenge on the bullies by causing complete chaos at the diner where Ms. Dalton (Aloma Wright) works. Later he and Gwen Tennyson (Haley Ramm) go over and reveals the same villain Ben defeated earlier. Max Tennyson (Lee Majors) identifies him as Eon (Christien Anholt), an alien called a Chronian from an unknown dimension, who the Plumbers captured almost two centuries <b>ago.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> arrived, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> half dead and brought a device with him called the Hands of Armageddon, which would open a time rift to his home dimension and unleash his race upon Earth if activated.

The guard tells Max not to let Eon find the hardware store, where the Hands <b>were</b> kept. Before <b>he</b> dies, the Plumber warns Ben that Eon is after him.|$|R

60|$|Isaac Worthington {{laid his}} silk hat on the table, and sat down. He looked very haggard and worn in that light, very unlike the first citizen who had entered Brampton in triumph {{on his return}} from the West not many months before. The long strain of a long fight, {{in which he had}} risked much for which he had labored a life to gain, had told on him, and there were crow's-feet at the corners of, his eyes, and dark circles under them. Isaac Worthington had never lost before, and to destroy the fruits of such a man's {{ambition}} is to destroy the man. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> not as young as <b>he</b> had once <b>been.</b> But now, in the very hour of defeat, hope had rekindled the fire in the eyes and brought back the peculiar, tight-lipped, mocking smile to the mouth. An hour <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> pacing Alexander Duncan's library, the eyes and the mouth had been different.|$|R

Nikolai played the role of Leksa, as a substitute for the actor Sergey Fyodorovich Shishkov (of the Shishkov gypsy dynasty) who had become ill. He then played the role of Leksa for many years, and later, as he grew older, played the role of Badi in this play as well.|$|R
6000|$|Like a true philosopher, Flambeau had no aim in his holiday; but, {{like a true}} philosopher, he had an excuse.

Years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> a king of thieves and the most famous figure in Paris, he had often {{received}} wild communications of approval, denunciation, or even love; but one had, somehow, stuck in his memory. It consisted simply of a visiting-card, in an envelope with an English postmark. On the back of the card was written in French and in green ink: [...] "If you ever retire and become respectable, come and see me. I want to meet you, for I have met all the other great men of my time. That trick of yours of getting one detective to arrest the other was the most splendid scene in French history."

Jan is greeted by the archetypical god of universal jokes, The Trickster, who torments Jan with a goblet. Jan tells Ace that he once stole such a goblet from the Church of the Vacuum. Jan doesn't agree with their concepts of sacrifice, because long <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> and Christopher <b>were</b> drafted, they volunteered for experimental drug trials, but Jan lost his nerve at the last moment and Christopher took his for him, with the result that he gained psychic abilities and lost his gender.

Christopher holds it off while the others escape, but his body is killed in the process.|$|R
