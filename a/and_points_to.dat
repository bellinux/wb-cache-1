5|$|The second barcarolle, {{dedicated}} to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and more ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 {{in the middle of}} the piece.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory {{has proven}} to be {{important}} for studying the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, and there is a duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Kronan {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and most}} heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could be held responsible for the Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a more nuanced picture, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E

25|$|The early {{influence}} of Wagner on Parry's {{music can be}} heard in the Concertstück for orchestra (1877), the overture Guillem de Cabestanh (1878), and especially in Scenes from Prometheus Unbound (1880). Dibble notes a more thoroughly absorbed Wagnerian influence in Blest Pair of Sirens, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the {{influence of}} Brahms on such works as the Piano Quartet in A flat (1879) and the Piano Trio in B minor (1884).|$|E
25|$|Sociologist Rodney Stark in {{his book}} The Rise of Christianity has also argued that—contrary to popular belief—Christianity was not a {{movement}} of the lower classes and the oppressed, but instead of the upper and middle classes in the cities and of Hellenized Jews. Stark also discusses the exponential nature {{of the growth of}} religion <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a number of advantages that Christianity had over paganism to explain its growth.|$|E

25|$|Close {{proximity}} {{to a large}} commercial centre (Olisipo) founded by Turduli tribes {{in the first half}} of the first millennium A.D., meant that the region of Sintra was influenced by human settlement throughout various epochs, cultures that have left remains in the area to this day. The toponym Sintra derives from the medieval Suntria, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> an association with radical Indo-European cultures; the word translates into bright star or sun, commonly significant in those cultures. Marcus Terentius Varro and Cadizian Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella designated the place the sacred mountain and Ptolemy referred to it as the mountains of the moon.|$|E

He feels {{the effects of}} the poison and strikes a gong, but Pythia appears. As Candaules writhes in the throes of death, Gyges and his courtiers rush in. Gyges goes to help the King, but Pythia forces him to confess that Gyges is the rightful monarch. Gyges takes the King's crown and presents it to Nisia who, surprised, looks at Pythia, who reminds her of her prediction.|$|E

25|$|According to Norman Stillman, the {{incident}} cannot {{be judged by}} present-day moral standards. Citing Deut. 20:13–14 as an example, Stillman states that the slaughter of adult males and the enslavement {{of women and children}} – though no doubt causing bitter suffering – was common practice throughout the ancient world. According to Rudi Paret, adverse public opinion was more a point of concern to Muhammad when he had some date palms cut down during a siege, than after this incident. Esposito also argues that in Muhammad's time, traitors were executed <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> similar situations in the Bible. Esposito says that Muhammad's motivation was political rather than racial or theological; he was trying to establish Muslim dominance and rule in Arabia.|$|E
25|$|The team {{reported}} that they had been able to identify compound nuclei fissioning with half-lives > 10−18 s. This result suggests a strong stabilizing effect at Z=124 <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the next proton shell at Z>120, not at Z=114 as previously thought. A compound nucleus is a loose combination of nucleons that have not arranged themselves into nuclear shells yet. It has no internal structure and is held together only by the collision forces between the target and projectile nuclei. It is estimated that it requires around 10−14s for the nucleons to arrange themselves into nuclear shells, at which point the compound nucleus becomes a nuclide, and this number is used by IUPAC as the minimum half-life a claimed isotope must have to potentially be recognised as being discovered. Thus, the GANIL experiments do not count as a discovery of element 124.|$|E
25|$|Above the Sovereign, {{the second}} tier {{contains}} the icons {{of the twelve}} great feasts. There are two large icons above the Royal Door, that divide the three central tiers of the iconostasis into two equal parts. Six icons, related {{to the life of}} Mary, appear {{on the left side of}} the Feasts tier. These icons depict scenes related to Mary. On the far left there is the Nativity of the Theotokos, which has Saint Anne sitting in the center, holding the newborn Mary on her lap. An angel holds a wreath of glory above them, and the Holy Spirit shines in the shape of the Eye of Providence on the top of the composition. The Greek Catholic Church celebrates Mary's birth on September 8. The second icon from the left depicts the Presentation of Mary, celebrated on November 21. This is the feast with which the cathedral was associated. In the painting the child Mary steps forward to Zechariah, the priest of the temple in Jerusalem. The next image illustrates the scene of the Annunciation, when Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary to announce to her that she is conceived with Jesus. Gabriel holds a white lily in his left hand, <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the sky with his right. The beam of light, coming down from God via the dove of the Holy Spirit onto Mary, symbolizes that the Holy Virgin became pregnant by God himself through the Holy Spirit. The Annunciation is celebrated nine months before the birth of Jesus, on March 25. The next icon depicts the Visitation, when Mary visits her cousin, Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John the Baptist. Traditionally the icon of the Visitation portrays the two pregnant women, Mary and Elizabeth hugging each other. In Hajdúdorog this scene is quite different: Elizabeth does not even appear in the painting. Mary, on the right, brings two white doves in a basket as gifts to her cousin. The family members introduce the newborn John to her. March 31 is the feast day of the Visitation. The fifth icon on the tier is the flight to Egypt. This is the only scene on the Feasts tier which cannot be associated with any religious feast. Joseph leaves Bethlehem with Mary and Jesus after learning that King Herod wants to massacre all the newborns in Judea. The last icon on the Marian part of the Feasts tier is the Dormition, the death of Mary. The Holy Virgin, in a white shroud, lies in the center of the image. Jesus casts light on his mother from Heaven as a symbol of her eternal life and her assumption. The Greek Catholic Church commemorates Mary's death on August 15.|$|E

500|$|According to Guðbrandur Vigfússon, {{the concept}} of the einherjar links {{directly}} to the Old Norse name Einarr. Vigfússon comments that [...] "the name Einarr is properly = einheri", <b>and</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a relation to the term with the Old Norse common nouns einarðr (meaning [...] "bold") and einörð (meaning [...] "valour").|$|E
