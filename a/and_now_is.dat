5|$|For Greece {{is already}} entirely obedient to you, {{and will remain}} so: the Achaeans from genuine affection; the Aetolians from the terror which their {{disasters}} in the present war have inspired them. Italy, and your crossing into it, {{is the first step}} in the acquirement of universal empire, to which no one has a better claim than yourself. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> the moment to act when the Romans have suffered a reverse.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{additions}} to the Board of Trade Building moved the agricultural and financial trading floors out of the original trading room and into new spaces in the {{additions to}} the building's rear in the 1980s. In 2004 the historic 1930 trading floor, already substantially altered (and unused {{for more than two}} years), was demolished and its pits filled with concrete. It was renovated in a modern style <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> leased to a privately owned options trading firm.|$|E

5|$|On September 3, 1895 {{the first}} wholly {{professional}} game was played, in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, between the Latrobe Athletic Association and the Jeannette Athletic Club. Latrobe won the contest 12–0. During this game, Latrobe's quarterback, John Brallier {{became the first}} player to openly admit to being paid to play football. He was paid $10 plus expenses to play. In 1897, the Latrobe Athletic Association paid all of its players for the whole season, becoming the first fully professional football team. In 1898, William Chase Temple took over the team payments for the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, a professional football team based in Pittsburgh from 1895 until 1900, becoming the first known individual football club owner. Later that year, the Morgan Athletic Club, on the South Side of Chicago, was founded. This team later became the Chicago Cardinals, then the St. Louis Cardinals <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> known as the Arizona Cardinals, making them the oldest continuously operating professional football team.|$|E
5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} {{that if they}} can find the Isolus pod and provide it power, the alien will leave Chloe. A frantic Chloe draws the TARDIS and the Doctor, trapping them both {{in one of her}} sketches and forcing Rose to try to find the pod herself. She rationalises that the pod is located on the hottest spot on the street, a patch of freshly laid tar, and is able to dig it up. Meanwhile, Chloe has caused the entire crowd at the Olympic stadium to disappear <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> set on making everyone in the world disappear. Rose tries {{to find out how to}} power the pod, and uses visual indications from the Doctor's picture to understand that the pod needs heat mixed with emotion. Rose throws the pod towards the Olympic Torch - a symbol of hope, courage, and love - as it passes down the street. The missing children and the crowd at the Olympics reappear, and Rose realises that the drawing Chloe had made of her father will similarly come to life. Rose and Chloe's mother are able to calm Chloe by singing the Kookaburra song, causing the unseen monster - having fed off of Chloe's emotions and fears - to disappear.|$|E
