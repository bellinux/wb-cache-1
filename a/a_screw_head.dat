40|$|Calcaneal {{osteotomy}} {{is often}} performed {{to correct the}} align-ment of the hindfoot and the weight-bearing axis of the lower limb. It is commonly undertaken {{in combination with other}} bony or soft tissue procedures in correction of a more global foot deformity. The operative approach, the position of the osteotomy, the direction of the shift, and the mode of fixation are all subject to considerable variation. Historically, fixation of a calcaneal osteotomy with <b>a</b> <b>headed</b> <b>screw</b> has been associated with high rates of compli-cations due to posterior heel pain from prominent <b>screw</b> <b>heads,</b> requiring secondary surgery for screw removal. In our unit, the method of fixation has changed over time and according to surgeon preference while the operative approach and the technique utilized have remained rela-tively unchanged, which provided a good opportunity to compare the outcome of calcaneal osteotomy with respect to fixation methods utilized. These included fixation using <b>a</b> <b>headed</b> <b>screw,</b> <b>a</b> headless conical <b>screw,</b> or <b>a</b> laterally applied stepped locking plate. We also present the medium-term results in 67 calcaneal osteotmies using our standard operative approach.

40|$|Abstract: Removal {{of metal}} {{implants}} {{is a common}} procedure that is performed {{for a variety of}} indications. However, problems such as <b>a</b> buried <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> may occasionally arise and render hardware removal difficult or even impossible. The problem is further compounded when the initial screw was inserted percutaneously or via a minimally-invasive (MIS) technique. In the present paper, we introduce a novel, minimally invasive technique to remove buried cannulated screws which obviates the need for excessive extension of the skin incision, surgical exploration, soft tissue dissection or excess bone removal, which surgeons may otherwise have to undertake to uncover the buried <b>screw</b> <b>head.</b> This technique is especially useful in removing cannulated screws which have been inserted using small stab incisions and MIS techniques initially. This technique {{can be applied to the}} removal of buried cannulated screws which are placed into any bone in the body...|$|R

50|$|Persons {{wishing to}} make {{adjustments}} to the Model 241's barrel tightening mechanism must become familiar {{not only with the}} use of the dual-sided nut (that fits in the hole in the front of the receiver) but also how that nut is locked in-place (so that it will not accidentally turn once it has been set as desired). What appears to be <b>a</b> flat blade <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> on the right side of the Model 241's receiver, that can easily be mistaken as <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> to lock the dual-sided nut in place, is actually a cosmetic affectation on what has sometimes been described as a 'slug' (instead of having threads on its sides as would <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> it has smooth sides). While the slug does indeed press (inside the receiver) against the outside of the dual-sided nut (and thus keeps the dual-sided nut from rotating) it does not have its pressure against the outside of the dual-sided nut adjusted by rotating (as it would were it <b>a</b> <b>screw)</b> but instead the slug is held pressing against the outside of the dual-sided nut by first being simply pushed against the outside of the dual-sided nut (by pressing down on the slug's flat blade <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> appearance on the right side of the receiver) and then <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> (the actual locking-screw) presses against the side of the slug (inside the receiver) and thus prevents it from moving. That locking-screw is oriented such that it comes in (to press against the side of the slug) from the direction of the front face of the receiver (and so is only visible when the barrel is separated from the receiver).|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} our study {{demonstrate}} that PETS is a minimally invasive and safe technique for treating LLD by creating a growth inhibition of the longer limb. The screws can {{be placed in a}} parallel or crossed pattern and it may be beneficial to countersink the <b>screw</b> <b>heads,</b> particularly if they are placed in a parallel fashion to decrease the risk of pain from <b>a</b> prominent <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> irritating the soft tissues. Clinicians may use the growth predictor method of choice with the understanding {{that there may be a}} large variability in the result, but usually the variability is not clinically significant. We found that the Green−Anderson and Moseley methods tended to underpredict and the Paley method tended to overpredict the final LLD. Several studies have reported that PETS creates delayed growth inhibition and recommend performing PETS between 6 and 12  months earlier than the estimated optimal timing for epiphysiodesis [5, 8, 18]. We believe that PETS is reversible by removing the screws and are now performing the PETS 12  months earlier than the estimated optimal timing for epiphysiodesis. We believe that PETS creates growth inhibition by locking the epiphysis to the metaphysis with screw threads on both sides of the growth plate. Although we have not used fully threaded 7.3 -mm cannulated screws, we believe that fully threaded screws would be equally successful and would decrease the problems associated with screw removal.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the <b>head</b> of the <b>screw.</b> The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example <b>a</b> flat <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> uses <b>a</b> flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the <b>screw</b> <b>head.</b> This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> require <b>an</b> extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R

5000|$|Assembly of <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> {{connection}} {{requires some}} care in workmanship to ensure proper removal of insulation, containment of all wire strands, and the adequate tightening of the screw.
