500|$|For {{the scene}} in which the Doctor, Amy, and River are riding on horses, the close-ups of the {{characters}} riding were filmed by having the actors sit on a saddle mounted {{on the back of}} a truck and <b>act</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were riding horses. Gillan called this the [...] "strangest thing" [...] she had ever done, and was sure she [...] "looked ridiculous". They were filmed performing this as the truck drove to achieve the effect of the passing country. Wide shots were taken of stunt doubles of the three actors riding real horses. This scene was filmed on 1 February 2010.|$|E
500|$|Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times {{called the}} cast [...] "the usual all-formula grab-bag", and The Washington Posts Richard Harrington said the human actors are all bland. [...] Berardinelli {{described}} the characters as [...] "a group of morons who <b>act</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> flunked kindergarten" [...] but said Aniston [...] "might be competent" [...] {{in a better}} film. Weiskind instead called Aniston's character a [...] "Beverly Hills brat" [...] who audiences will want to die. [...] Of Davis, Harrington wrote that he [...] "imbues a weak character with a strong presence", saying the film is only interesting while Davis is on-screen. [...] Harrington concludes that the film is notable only for Davis' performance. [...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the leprechaun [...] "no more than dangerously cranky" [...] and reminiscent of Chucky from Child's Play; Hicks also described the leprechaun as similar to Chucky.

2500|$|In contrast, {{there seems}} to be bands that appear to be more lighthearted and less {{concerned}} over being described as deathcore. Scott Lewis of the San Diego-based deathcore band Carnifex started [...] "We're not one of those bands trying to escape the banner of deathcore. I know a lot of bands try and <b>act</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have a big problem with that, but if you listen to their music, they are very 'deathcore.'

2500|$|Halloween Horror Nights IV was {{the first}} year to {{introduce}} a [...] "scare zone", a name given to specific outdoor areas that feature costumed characters that fit the theme {{with the intent of}} scaring people who walk through the areas. To get to certain areas of the park, it is necessary to travel through these scare zones. In 2012, Orlando re-envisioned the scare zones as [...] "street experiences," [...] claiming that scare actors were no longer restricted to specific [...] "zones." [...] Instead, {{there were a number of}} [...] "hordes" [...] which would change their location in the park every 90 minutes. [...] By 2014, the traditional scare zones returned with The Purge: Anarchy (inspired by [...] ), Face Off: In the Flesh, Bayou of Blood, and MASKerade: Unstitched. However, Hollywood Horror Nights in California still has specific scare zones, that range in themes. While actors cannot touch you, many of them can surround you at one time. Many actors in these areas have props like bats, chainsaws and fake guns and can <b>act</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are going to attack you with their [...] "weapons". Many times actors will place the chainsaws against the cement to produce sparks to scare audiences. Actors are also allowed to chase visitors in and out of the scare zone.|$|E

50|$|In a {{crossover}} dribble, {{the ball}} handler changes {{the ball from}} one hand to the other using a single dribble. The crossover is a fundamental dribbling technique in basketball used to keep {{the ball in the}} hand farthest from the defender (preventing a steal) while maintaining a desired speed and orientation on the court. It is very efficient when executing a drive. Make the crossover, get around your defender, and drive to the basket. A crossover functions best when the ball handler looks and <b>acts</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are headed in one direction, before crossing over to the other direction. This can often be achieved by a simple head fake, or a step in that intended direction. Some of the players famous for their crossover dribble include Allen Iverson, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry, and Kobe Bryant.|$|R

As he put it, [...] "The Democrats have it and the Republicans don't." [...] He suggested that ORCA's ability to affect the outcome had been over-hyped by the Romney campaign, as there was only so much that could be done on election day itself: [...] "On short notice, you can send robocalls, reorder a call list and employ paid phone banks, but you are not radically changing the shape of the electorate. <b>They</b> <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had invented the wheel, but really all it would have been was a slightly better tread on the tire." ...|$|R

His songs were already kid friendly with catchy lyrics and simple melodies punctuated with penny whistles and ship bell sound effects. Conversely, Koo Koo Kanga Roo, a children-oriented comedy synthpop duo, made a successful crossover from performing children's events into touring with adult rock and punk bands such as Reel Big Fish and Frank Turner. In Canada, artists such as The Kerplunks have paved modern pathways to the genre following in the footsteps of Raffi, Fred Penner and Sharon, Lois & Bram.|$|R
