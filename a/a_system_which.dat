5|$|Although {{decentralization}} {{of state}} power within the provinces occurred in the early Ming, the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s. By the late Ming dynasty, there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys, <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>which</b> reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment.|$|E
5|$|Another {{change was}} the {{transition}} to the use of judges as the electoral returning officer for South Australia. This was done to impose state control on <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>which</b> had effectively combined the administration of the national and state electoral rolls. On 27 May 1925, Denny arranged the appointment of Judge Herbert Kingsley Paine of the Insolvency Court to be appointed as Electoral Officer for the state, replacing Charles Mathews, a state public servant who had held the position since 1907. Denny had previously worked for Paine as a legal associate.|$|E

In 2007, {{in an effort to}} reduce car traffic in the city, he introduced the Vélib', <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>which</b> rents bicycles for the use of local residents and visitors. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.|$|E

5|$|The National Register of Electors is a continuously-updated {{permanent}} {{database of}} eligible electors for federal elections in Canada maintained by Elections Canada. It {{was established in}} December 1996 when Bill C-63 was granted royal assent by the Governor General of Canada, and the preliminary National Register of Electors was populated with data in April 1997 during the final Canada-wide enumeration. It replaced <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>which</b> required door-to-door enumeration of eligible electors for each electoral event. The database contains basic information about electors: name, address, sex, and date of birth. An elector may register or update their personal information between elections, or may request to be excluded from it per the Canada Elections Act.|$|E
