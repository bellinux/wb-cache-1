5|$|During the Han dynasty under Han Wudi (141–87 BCE), the Chinese {{government}} {{united and}} became powerful enough that China began to successfully indulge in imperialistic endeavors with its neighboring nations in East Asia. Han China's imperialism was a peaceful tributary system, which focused mainly on diplomatic and trade relations. The {{growth of the}} Han Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange with {{virtually all of the}} known world as reached from <b>Asia,</b> <b>and</b> Chinese silks spread through <b>Asia</b> <b>and</b> Inner <b>Asia</b> <b>and</b> even to Rome. The early T'ang dynasty saw China as even more responsive to foreign influence and the T'ang dynasty becoming a great empire. Overseas trade with India and the Middle East grew rapidly, and China's East and Southern Coasts, once distant and unimportant regions, gradually became chief areas of foreign trade. During the Song Dynasty China's navy became more powerful thanks to technological improvements in shipbuilding and navigation, and China's maritime commerce also increased exponentially.|$|E

During the decade, intermediate inputs from Japan’s computer and electronic equipment (14) and motor vehicles (16) sectors to their counterparts in <b>Asia</b> 7 <b>and</b> the US were replaced by domestic supplies, reflecting the increasing localization of production overseas by Japanese multinationals.|$|R
