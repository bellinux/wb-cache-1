I felt my chariot wheels were on the right road to fame and honour, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> drove on like another Jehu!" [...] Possibly {{as a result of}} the criticism in The Times, Freeling asked Etty to overpaint the figures in the foreground of Cleopatra. In 1829, after Etty had become a respected artist, Freeling allowed the restoration of the figures to their original condition.|$|E
500|$|Asked at {{the hearing}} by Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{attorney}} Roger Robb whether he was planning [...] "to suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States", Teller replied that:I {{do not want to}} suggest anything of the kind. I know Oppenheimer as an intellectually most alert and a very complicated person, and I think it would be presumptuous and wrong on my part if I would try in any way to analyze his motives. But I have always assumed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> assume that he is loyal to the United States. I believe this, and I shall believe it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.He was immediately asked whether he believed that Oppenheimer was a [...] "security risk", to which he testified: ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{am not in}} a {{position}} to corroborate Mr Lyons' account of being corrected, prompted and advised by Garda officers and his description of learning from them about the details of the admissions they were seeking. However Mr Lyons' account to me in our interview supported and was consistent with the earlier impressions I had gained from reading the case papers. In my earlier report I noted that the materials then available to me raised questions about whether the details of Mr Lyons' final admissions could have derived from the content of questions put to him during the day, rather than his knowledge and memory, and about whether he was unusually suggestible. Following my interview with Dean Lyons and his parents, these concerns are substantially strengthened <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> think that it is very likely that his detailed admissions were unreliable." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the third}} edition was {{published}} in 1845, Balzac {{was in love with}} his own creation. He had written two years earlier to Hańska: [...] "There's no doubt about it – it is a magnificent poem. I had never really read it before.… The passion is sublime, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> understand why you have a cherished and special devotion to this book.… All in all, I am very pleased with it." [...] In a preface to the third edition, he described his plans for a part of La Comédie Humaine called Scènes de la vie militaire (Scenes from Military Life). In addition to Les Chouans with its focus on guerrilla combat, he planned another called Les Vendéans about the earlier full-scale civil war. Although in 1844 he discussed traveling to western France to write the book, it was never written.|$|E
500|$|At the {{hospital}} of La Pitié, he studied under internal pathologist Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis, who demonstrated the ineffectiveness of bloodletting, {{which had been}} a mainstay of medical practice since antiquity. Dr. Louis {{was one of the}} fathers of the méthode expectante, a therapeutic doctrine that states the physician's role is {{to do everything possible to}} aid nature in the process of disease recovery, and to do nothing to hinder this natural process. Upon his return to Boston, Holmes became one of the country's leading proponents of the méthode expectante. Holmes was awarded his M.D. from Harvard in 1836; he wrote his dissertation on acute pericarditis. His first collection of poetry was published later that year, but Holmes, ready to begin his medical career, wrote it off as a one-time event. In the book's introduction, he mused: [...] "Already engaged in other duties, it has been with some effort that I have found time to adjust my own mantle; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> willingly retire to more quiet labors, which, if less exciting, are more certain to be acknowledged as useful and received with gratitude".|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{included}} Piz dancing humorously at {{the fraternity}} party because he [...] "could watch {{it over and}} over", and there were roughly fifteen minutes of footage of him dancing. The band that plays at the party, the Diamond Smugglers, is from Thomas's hometown of Austin, Texas, and they played at Thomas's wedding and 40th birthday party. The scene near the end with Logan smashing a police car to get intentionally thrown in prison confused the crew, who doubted its artistic and technical plausibility. However, Thomas {{was pleased with the}} final output, and producer Dan Etheridge called it [...] "one of the most compact and interesting visual storytelling pieces in the episode." [...] The episode went over budget. In this episode, Mac wears a shirt that says [...] "Ask Me About My STD", something which several critics commended for its comedic value. Thomas {{came up with the idea}} for the shirt and hired one of the other guest actors in the scene for another episode, commenting [...] "It's funny, I actually made that up, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> have one, too." [...] In addition, because Thomas was so pleased with the acting in the scene from the boy who hands Mac a whiskey, he hired the actor for a role in a subsequent episode as an important witness to Dean O'Dell's death.|$|E
