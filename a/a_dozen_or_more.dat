5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E
5|$|A further {{elaboration}} on {{this story}} is possibly found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia {{as if it were}} a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's ancient city walls. The evidence of <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} private radio {{stations}} in New Brunswick, {{with each of the}} three major cities having <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> stations. Most smaller cities and towns also have one or two stations. Due to all this many Regional interests, were crested in New Brunswick.|$|E

25|$|Because {{defense is}} so important, and because shogi pieces are {{relatively}} slow movers, the opening game {{tends to be}} much longer in shogi than in international chess, commonly with <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> moves to shore up defenses before the initial attack is made.|$|E
25|$|In 1945–46, {{his next}} {{exposure}} to numismatics was a friend’s home in which <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> Indian cents were embedded face-up {{in a concrete}} walk near the front door. In 1948, {{his family moved to}} Forty Fort, Pennsylvania (about an hour away from Honesdale).|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Sassenrath founded REBOL Technologies, {{a company}} he still runs. He has {{released}} several versions of REBOL and produced additional {{products such as}} REBOL/View, REBOL/Command, REBOL/SDK, and REBOL/IOS. He has also written thousands of pages about REBOL, hundreds of script examples, and <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> REBOL applications.|$|E

25|$|Observers {{as well as}} pilots {{could become}} aces. Victories could be shared, and counted as an {{addition}} of one to the score of each 'victor' rather than being divided fractionally. In some cases, a single destroyed German or Austro-Hungarian aircraft could add to the scores of half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> French fliers.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> {{detectors}} may {{be connected}} via wiring or wirelessly such {{that if one}} detects smoke, the alarms will sound on all the detectors in the network, improving the likelihood that occupants will be alerted even if smoke is detected far from their location. Wired interconnection are more practical in new construction than for existing buildings.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} comprising Norwood {{was originally}} settled about 1670 by <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> families {{mostly from the}} Dutch Republic, who purchased the land under the Tappan Patent. About that time a grant was also given by Philip Carteret, Governor of the Province of East Jersey, {{during the reign of}} King Charles II of England. The Lenni Lenape Native Americans roamed the valley.|$|E
60|$|This {{marvel of}} art was, briefly, {{a sort of}} heavenly cobweb. It was a gossamer texture of {{precious}} manufacture, artistically festooned in <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> flounces <b>or</b> <b>more.</b>|$|R

25|$|Customarily, woven {{patterns}} and dyed repeat patterns are considered informal. Formal kimonos have free-style designs dyed {{over the whole}} surface or along the hem. During the Heian period, kimonos were worn with up to <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> colorful contrasting layers, with each combination of colors being a named pattern. Today, the kimono is normally worn with {{a single layer on}} top of one or more undergarments.|$|E
25|$|Sir Lancelot, in the early-thirteenth century pre-cyclic Old French romance Lancelot, spends {{almost the}} entire length of the romance incognito, taking on <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> knightly disguises before the end of the tale, in an effort not to be recognised. He even arrives at the royal court where his return should be welcomed, {{disguised}} as a fool; a court where there is a growing romantic attachment between himself and the queen, although she does not recognise him. In this case, of course, the queen is Guinevere.|$|E
25|$|During its height, the Detroit Publishing Company drew upon 40,000 negatives for its {{publishing}} effort, and had {{sales of}} seven million prints annually. Traveling salesmen, mail order catalogues, {{and a few}} retail stores aggressively sold the company's products. The company maintained outlets in Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, London, and Zurich, and also sold their images at popular tourist spots and through the mail. At the height of its success, the company employed some forty artisans and <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> traveling salesmen. In a typical year they would publish an estimated seven million prints.|$|E

60|$|Lemoine and {{his wife}} had protested and been silenced: men had {{struggled}} and women had fought--some of them like wild cats--in trying to get away. Now there were only half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> so <b>more</b> to docket. Fleury swore, for he was tired and hot.|$|R
25|$|American white {{pelicans}} like to {{come together}} in groups of <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> birds to feed, as they can thus cooperate and corral fish to one another. When this is not easily possible – for example in deep water, where fish can escape by diving out of reach –, they prefer to forage alone. But the birds also steal food on occasion from other birds, a practice known as kleptoparasitism. White pelicans are known to steal fish from other pelicans, gulls and cormorants {{from the surface of}} the water and, in one case, from a great blue heron while both large birds were in flight.|$|E
25|$|Crisp {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} to Griffith for several years and learned much during this time from Griffith, an early master of film story telling who was influential in advancing a number of early techniques, such as cross cutting in editing his films. This experience fostered a similar passion in Crisp to become a director in his own right. His first directing credit was Little Country Mouse, made in 1914. Many directors (and actors) would find themselves turning out <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> films in a single year at this time. Over the next fifteen years, Crisp directed some 70 films in all, most notably The Navigator (1924) with Buster Keaton and Don Q, Son of Zorro (1925) with Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E
25|$|Today, modern {{bookbinding}} {{is divided}} between hand binding by individual craftsmen {{working in a}} one-room studio shop and commercial bindings mass-produced by high speed machines in a production line factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from {{one of a kind}} custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. A step up to the next level of mechanization is determined by economics of scale until you reach production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory employing <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> workers.|$|E
60|$|I {{stuck out}} my head, and escaped by a hair's-breadth. This time I drew <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> shots <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> {{and heard the}} Selenites {{shouting}} and twittering as if with excitement as they shot. I picked up jacket and crowbar again.|$|R
6000|$|Having made this, to me, odd remark, the {{commander}} disappeared from view inside {{the shelter of}} boughs, and Sergeant Corney led me <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> yards <b>or</b> <b>more</b> from what might by courtesy have been called [...] "headquarters," [...] when he halted to say, gravely: ...|$|R

25|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone was}} laid at 1.30pm on Monday 26 July 1869. A large crowd {{gathered at the}} site, so that the area reserved for the ceremony had to be roped off. Countess Augusta of Dartmouth and Rev. Richard Collins, vicar of Kirkburton, led the procession, followed by the Earl of Dartmouth and the Rev. R.B. Thompson who {{was to be the}} first incumbent of Thurstonland Church. Then came more than 20 clergymen, churchwardens and <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> VIPs who all crowded into the enclosure. Among the VIPs were Lieutenant-Colonel Bradbury JP, William Brooke JP, Captain Legge, Adjutant Legge, Major Brooke, George Wood Jenkinson (1838–1898) the Thurstonland churchwarden, and W.S. Barber the architect. In the newspaper reports, James Mallinson is not mentioned as being present. The choir, the band, the Sunday School children and the spectators arranged themselves outside the ropes.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{a railway}} line once ran through Potsdamer Platz itself. This was a {{connecting}} line opened in October 1851 and {{running around the}} city just inside the customs wall, crossing numerous streets and squares at street level, and whose purpose was to allow goods to be transported between the various Berlin stations, thus creating a hated traffic obstruction that lasted for twenty years. Half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> times a day, Potsdamer Platz {{ground to a halt}} while a train of 60 to 100 wagons trundled through at walking pace preceded by a railway official ringing a bell. The construction of the Ringbahn around the city's perimeter, linked to all the major stations, allowed the connecting line to be scrapped in 1871, although the Ringbahn itself was not complete and open for all traffic until 15 November 1877.|$|E
25|$|The {{area was}} first {{occupied}} by the Esselen indigenous people, who harvested acorns on the nearby mountain slopes. The area's terrain is mostly steep, rocky, semi-arid except for the narrow canyons, and inaccessible, making long-term habitation a challenge. A large boulder with <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> deep mortar bowls worn into it, known as a bedrock mortar, is located in Apple Tree Camp on the southwest slope of Devil's Peak, north of the Camp Pico Blanco. The holes were hollowed out over many generations by Indians who used it to grind the acorns into flour. Other mortar rocks have also been found within the Boy Scout camp at campsites 3 and 7, and slightly upstream from campsite 12, while a fourth is found on a large rock in the river, originally above the river, between campsites 3 and 4. Much of the native Indian population had been forced into the Spanish mission system by about 1822, {{when most of the}} interior villages within the current Los Padres National Forest were uninhabited.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the {{increasing}} software size meant large packages like Windows or Adobe Photoshop required <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> disks <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> In 1996, {{there were an}} estimated five billion standard floppy disks in use. Then, distribution of larger packages was gradually replaced by CD-ROMs, DVDs and online distribution.|$|R
