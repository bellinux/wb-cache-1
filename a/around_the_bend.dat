5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy led his men <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bend,</b> {{carefully}} {{keeping them}} behind cover, then sent Coey {{out into the}} open riverbed to give treatment. With his Red Cross flag clearly visible, Coey came out from cover and made for the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body fell at du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy {{took his}} men <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> behind cover, then sent his American medic, Corporal John Alan Coey of Columbus, Ohio, {{out into the}} open {{streambed}} to render medical assistance. Though his prominent Red Cross flag was clearly visible, the hidden cadres immediately opened fire on Coey, who was killed almost instantly by a shot through the head. His body fell at du Plooy's feet. The stand-off continued {{for the rest of the}} day, during which time du Plooy and one other RLI man were wounded. The security forces were only able to gather their dead for evacuation when darkness fell. During the night, the Rhodesians deployed stops in ambush positions around the insurgents' position to prevent an escape. When the guerrillas attempted to sneak through the security force perimeter in the early hours, they ran into Corporal Jannie de Beer's RLI men and a fire fight ensued; the nationalists shot de Beer dead and wounded one of his troopers as they broke through and quickly left the area. The morale of 2 Commando's men took a noticeable hit after this unsuccessful Fireforce in which the cadres had killed four Rhodesian soldiers and wounded four more.|$|E
25|$|At about 07:50 the {{southern}} outskirts of Haderslev, a Danish 37mm anti-tank gun {{with a crew}} of five attacked the approaching armour. Two tanks lined up adjacent {{to one another and}} opened fire. The Danes landed all three of their shots -one in a tank's tracks- but two of the gun crew were killed and the rest wounded. One tank then drove over the gun. Just <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> the wagon roadblock on Sønderbro Street covered by two 20mm cannon and a machine gun put up resistance. The Germans laid down heavy fire and a Danish soldier was killed and two more wounded, but the Germans were effectively pinned down. The fighting continued for ten more minutes until the order to surrender was received from Copenhagen by telephone. The Germans were then allowed to proceed into the town of Haderslev, but the Danish garrison stationed there had not received the order to surrender and fired on the Germans. Two German tanks and a motorcycle proceeded unsuspecting towards the barracks, which were defended by the anti-tank unit from Lundtoftbjerg. They opened fire, killing the motorcyclist and blowing the tracks off one tank, sending it crashing into a house. However, the Danish garrison capitulated at 08:15 when the order to surrender from Copenhagen finally came through. One Danish soldier was killed while defending the barracks; three Danish civilians were killed in the crossfire.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} morning Broderick moved the company down the spur line {{in order to}} establish a firm base, while Beale moved 5 Platoon forward. Four 7.62mm L4A4 Bren light machine-guns were incorporated into the patrol. The Australians encountered a track, beyond which lay the river, while to the north across a shallow creek, movement of the Indonesians could still be heard. The presence of the Indonesians so close to the Australian position made the chances of detection too great and as such no more troops were brought forward. Instead, Beale deployed his platoon into two positions, one covering the track with two Brens in order to secure it from the Indonesians in the re-entrant, as well as another position on a bend in the river. Only the sentry on the right-hand flank, Private Lawrence Jackson, could see <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bend,</b> which narrowed to just [...] at that point.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "neo-operatic" [...] {{opening track}} [...] "Foolish Love", {{arranged}} by Van Dyke Parks, {{was described by}} Allmusic contributor Matthew Greenwald as a [...] "lush, orchestral-soaked ballad, with incredible strings". He asserted that Wainwright's lyrics {{took the form of}} a letter to himself, defining his goals and [...] "sense of purpose". The song [...] "Danny Boy", with its [...] "fabulous wordplay that stays literate and easy to understand at the time", contains [...] "subtle" [...] horn lines and sampled percussion. The song alludes to Wainwright's homosexuality, which Greenwald considered a [...] "brave move". According to biographer Kirk Lake, [...] "Danny Boy" [...] is a companion piece to [...] "Foolish Love" [...] and together they represent the start and end of a relationship between a gay and a straight man. Danny, the straight [...] "drug-addled" [...] title figure with whom Wainwright had a three-year relationship, is the subject of both songs in addition to others on the album; he appears in the album's collage artwork.

40|$|Current {{crowding}} in <b>the</b> <b>bends</b> of superconducting nano-structures not only restricts measurable critical current in such structures but also redistributes local probabilities for {{dark and light}} counts to appear. Using structures from strips {{in the form of}} a square spiral which contain <b>bends</b> with <b>the</b> very same curvature with respect to the directions of bias current and external magnetic field, we have shown that dark counts as well as light counts at small photon energies originate from areas <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bends.</b> <b>The</b> minimum in the rate of dark counts reproduces the asymmetry of the maximum critical current density as function of the magnetic field. Contrary, the minimum in the rate of light counts demonstrate opposite asymmetry. The rate of light counts become symmetric at large currents and fields. Comparing locally computed absorption probabilities for photons and the simulated threshold detection current we found the approximate locations of areas near bends which deliver asymmetric light counts. Any asymmetry is absent in Archimedean spiral structures without bends...|$|R
