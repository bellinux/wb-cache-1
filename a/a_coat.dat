5|$|William the Conqueror, {{the first}} Norman king of England, had <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> of arms with two lions. Richard the Lionheart used such <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> of arms with two lions {{on a red}} field (Loomis 1938, 47), from which the three lions of the coat of arms of England derive. However, {{there is no proof}} that William's arms were not {{attributed}} to William after his death (Boutell, 18).|$|E

50|$|The coat of the {{domestic}} dog (Canis lupus familiaris) refers to the hair that covers its body. <b>A</b> dog's <b>coat</b> may be <b>a</b> double <b>coat,</b> {{made up of a}} soft undercoat and a tougher topcoat, or <b>a</b> single <b>coat,</b> which lacks <b>an</b> undercoat. Double <b>coats</b> have <b>a</b> top <b>coat,</b> made of stiff hairs to help repel water and shield from dirt, and an undercoat to serve as insulation. The terms fur and hair are often used interchangeably when describing <b>a</b> dog's <b>coat,</b> however in general, <b>a</b> double <b>coat,</b> e.g., like that of the Newfoundland and most mountain dogs, is referred to as <b>a</b> fur <b>coat,</b> while <b>a</b> single <b>coat,</b> like that of the Poodle, is referred to as <b>a</b> hair <b>coat.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for producing <b>a</b> <b>coating</b> of <b>a</b> pasty and/or liquid medium on an edge {{surface of a}} component.

5|$|Although the Congress of Tucumán {{had already}} formalized {{the flag of}} Argentina, the Army of the Andes did not use it, {{choosing}} a banner with two columns, light blue and white, and <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> of arms roughly similar to the Coat of arms of Argentina. The army {{did not use the}} flag of Argentina because it was not exclusively an Argentine army.|$|E
5|$|Branham's {{father was}} an alcoholic, and William Branham often talked about how his {{upbringing}} was difficult and impoverished. As a child, he would often wear <b>a</b> <b>coat,</b> held closed by safety pins, without a shirt underneath. Some have called his claims of poverty into question, because, among other things, {{he was able to}} purchase a new car when he was 18 years old.|$|E
5|$|In August 1536, the {{new city}} was besieged by the troops of Manco Inca, {{the leader of}} an Inca {{rebellion}} against Spanish rule. The Spaniards and their native allies, headed by Pizarro himself, defeated the rebels after heavy fighting in the city streets and its surroundings. On November 3, 1536, the Spanish Crown confirmed the founding and, on December 7, 1537, emperor Charles V granted <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> of arms to the city.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Begun had two {{concepts}} {{in mind for}} a different recording medium. One was to find <b>a</b> means for <b>coating</b> <b>a</b> ductile nonmagnetic metal wire with <b>a</b> metallic magnetic <b>coating.</b> The other was to <b>coat</b> <b>a</b> non-metallic tape with <b>a</b> magnetic <b>coating.</b> He placed the work on wire in the Research Department of Brush Development Company, and contracted with Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio, for work {{on the development of}} <b>a</b> <b>coated</b> non-metallic tape.|$|R

5|$|The shield is {{the normal}} device for {{displaying}} <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> of arms. Clergy have used less-military shapes {{such as the}} oval cartouche, but the shield {{has always been a}} clerical option. Clergy in Italy often use a shield shaped like a horse's face-armor. Clergy in South Africa sometimes follow the national style using a Nguni shield. Women traditionally display their coats of arms on a diamond-shaped lozenge; abbesses follow this tradition or use the cartouche.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{independence}} of Belarus from the Soviet Union, the country resurrected national symbols that were used before the Soviet era. These included a flag of red and white stripes and <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> of arms consisting of a charging knight on horseback. These national symbols were replaced by Soviet-era symbols in a disputed 1995 vote. Those two symbols, along with the national anthem, are the constitutionally defined national symbols of Belarus.|$|E

5|$|After the {{university}} moved to Hamilton in 1930, {{the university}} petitioned Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh for <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> of arms. The request was granted {{on behalf of}} The Crown on 20 October 1930. In 1997 the Board of Governors introduced a simplified shield design, which recognized the tradition of McMaster’s heraldry while {{improving the quality of}} print and electronic reproduction.

5|$|As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some {{similarity}} {{with the}} flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, {{blue and red}} tricolor, but {{that is where the}} similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, the ratio of the stripes were set at 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was set at 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the coat of arms is only changed {{in the middle of the}} flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces. For Venezuela, the basic design was to have all three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to change their flag with white stars instead of <b>a</b> <b>coat</b> of arms. <b>A</b> <b>coat</b> of arms was not added to the national flag 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the coat of arms. The position of the coat of arms on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms at the very top hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.|$|E
50|$|Sealcoat or {{pavement}} sealer is <b>a</b> <b>coating</b> for asphalt-based pavements. Sealcoating is {{marketed as}} <b>a</b> protective <b>coating</b> that extends {{the life of}} asphalt pavements. There is not any independent research that proves these claims.|$|R
