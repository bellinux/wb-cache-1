40|$|The UK is {{considered}} a ‘male breadwinner/female part-time carer’ state due {{to men and women}} conforming to stereotypical gender roles within partnerships, and welfare policies reflecting and reinforcing this gender division. Using data from the General Household Surveys 2001 and 2002, this article shows that mothers continue to be markedly disadvantaged in participating in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> compared to women who have never had children. This is mostly because they take on caring roles at the expense of paid work, but also because where women earn much less than their partners, {{they are more likely to}} depend on them for pension provision. Female breadwinners are likely to be low earners, and so, in contrast with men, their status as “breadwinner” does not usually imply pension accumulation. Consideration of the impact of the institutional framework of pension provision requires an understanding of inequalities within couples and societal expectations of mothers’ caring responsibilities...|$|E

40|$|Many {{third world}} {{countries}} face rapid population aging over the coming decades. The demographic trend poses two significant policy challenges – sustaining strong economic growth and establishing effective economic support systems for the elderly. This paper shows that the demographic transition presents two opportunities for more rapid economic growth, or “dividends”. The first dividend arises because of {{the rapid growth of}} the productive population relative to the consuming population. The second dividend arises because population aging provides a powerful force for saving and asset accumulation. The second dividend will not be realized, however, if old-age security relies on transfer systems. In this paper our emphasis is on familial transfer systems rather than public systems. We show the importance of early reform that emphasizes the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> assets rather than continued reliance on the family. Given appropriate policies, population aging could lead to wealthier and more prosperous societies...|$|R
40|$|Gender {{differences}} in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> savings are well documented. Work in this field has concluded that while differing lifetime work profiles (and family history) explained much of the difference, other factors such as pension knowledge and confidence in decisionmaking, may also be significant. This research, funded by the Fawcett Society in association with Scottish Widows, explores some of these factors {{through the use of}} 30 semi-structured interviews and a focus group with women (aged 24 - 39) about their attitudes and motivations towards pension saving. It concentrates on discussions around pension knowledge, advice and decision-making, and identifies challenges in relation to women’s pension knowledge and the use of male ‘role models’ in making decisions. The paper then explores potential policy mechanisms to enhance women’s pension saving for retirement, including the manner in which information and advice is provided and strategies to improve confidence in pension decision-making. ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we study}} labour markets, pension systems, {{and the interaction}} between the two. In the second chapter after the introduction we study the effects of fiscal changes in an overlapping-generations model. A labour tax increase reduces welfare more than a consumption tax increase and a tax swap makes all new-born generations better off. However, during transition it opens up a welfare gap between the retired (worse off) and the working (better off). In the third chapter we study the intergenerational effects of unemployment caused by wage rigidity on the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> entitlements. We build an overlapping-generations model in which unions set the wages and firms pick employment. The pension system has an effect on steady state outcomes of labour market variables, but pension systems matter less for the transitional dynamics. The fourth chapter analyses euro area Beveridge curves over the past 25 years. We find an outward shift of the aggregate euro area, Spanish and French Beveridge curves since the onset of the crisis, but an inward shift for Germany. Examining the factors underlying the observed developments we find (tentative) evidence for skill, sectoral and geographical mismatch. In the fifth chapter we estimate wage equations to test for changes in the responsiveness of wages to unemployment using euro area panel estimates. Wages are less responsive at high levels of unemployment. Additionally, differences in bargaining position — in particularly differences between unionised vs. non-unionised labour and permanent vs. temporary jobs — explain {{a large part of the}} downward wage rigidity...|$|R

The project ‘Family, Work and Quality of Life’ explored changes in economic and social roles across four birth cohorts passing through mid-life (45 – 59 / 64 years) in Britain. The relationship between multiple role responsibilities and a range of indicators of quality of life, including material resources, health and engagement in social activities were investigated. The research was based upon secondary analysis of four different surveys: the 2000 British Household Panel Study, the 1994 – 95 Family and Working Lives Survey, the 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000 General Household Surveys, and the longitudinal Retirement Survey (1988 / 89 and 1994). A particularly interesting finding is that being ‘caught in the middle’, in terms of having simultaneous care-giving responsibilities to dependent children and frail parents whilst in paid work, has been atypical. Only one-in-nine British women, and one-in-ten British men, aged 45 – 49 years (born in 1941 – 45) occupy all three roles concurrently, but multiple role occupancy is increasing across cohorts, particularly the combination of caring and paid work. Role occupancy significantly affects the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> entitlements (particularly second-tier pensions), with the effect that many women who have fulfilled the important social roles of carer and parent will face a low income in old age. Where adverse health outcomes were found, parental role in mid-life was most frequently associated with such poor health, suggesting that continued parental demands in mid-life may have negative health consequences...|$|R
40|$|This {{is one of}} {{a series}} of {{analytic}} papers that supported the OECD’s ageing study, a “horizontal ” project in the sense that it involved a number of OECD directorates. The results of the entire project are summarised in Maintaining Prosperity in an Ageing Society, OECD 1998. In particular, Chapters II and IV of Maintaining Prosperity drew on this paper. The paper evaluates the economics of foreign investment regulation for pension funds, with a focus on developing countries, where fully-funded pension systems are being started de novo. The analysis produces three observations. First, the benefits of global portfolio diversification apply particularly to developing-country pension assets because the volatility of asset returns is high while the risk tolerance of pensioners is low. Second, restrictions of foreign investment by domestic pension funds can hardly be justified on grounds of financial-development arguments: cross-country evidence suggests little support for the claim that the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> assets would provide strong externalities for financial development. Moreover, the home bias generally observed in pension fund investment should translate into sufficient potential demand for domestic financial assets so as to deepen markets and develop the institutional infrastructure. Third, a case for initial localisation requirements, however, can be derived from the fiscal costs of moving from unfunded to fully-funded pension systems if a rise in domestic interest rates due to fiscal illusion and domestic tax collection costs are important.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{demographic}} {{change and the}} fact that the benefits of a growing proportion of pensioners must be financed by fewer and fewer contributors, poses major problems for the German pay-as-you-go pension scheme. For this reason, the 2001 pension reform entailed a reduction in the level <b>of</b> statutory <b>pensions</b> and strengthened the funded second and third pillars <b>of</b> old-age <b>pension</b> provision. The 'Riester pension', introduced in 2001, aimed at encouraging the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> additional private <b>pensions,</b> and therefore created a voluntary but highly subsidized private pension supplement. The savings incentives - flat-rate benefits and tax breaks – created by the reform were intended to motivate people in the public retirement insurance scheme to compensate for reductions in relative statutory pension levels by paying into private pension funds. 1 State subsidizes for Riester pensions are substantial: Contributions made by people on low earnings and parents attract subsidizes of over 50 per cent - in other words, the state delivers more than half of the savings put aside by these groups of people. How did these subsidies affect the savings behaviour of German private households? This paper uses the Riester pension as an ‘experiment’ that sheds light on how savings incentives work...|$|R
40|$|The {{current state}} and {{problems}} <b>of</b> the <b>Pension</b> Fund <b>of</b> Ukraine have been highlighted. The {{formation of the}} budget of this financial institution has been analyzed. It is emphasized that the effective functioning <b>of</b> the <b>Pension</b> Fund <b>of</b> Ukraine is an important condition for sustainable human development, and in view of this factors influencing the process of its improvement have been identified. Firstly, this is {{a decrease in the}} number of the working population against the increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> recipients, which directly affects the system <b>of</b> mandatory <b>pension</b> insurance. It is found that the effectiveness of the latter can be guaranteed by two conditions: excess of the working population over the number of persons of retirement age and fair payment of insurance premiums. Secondly, it is the population age structure. In this context it is noted that for our state it is economically advantageous to have a lot of working pensioners because they themselves form the pension they receive. Thirdly, it is the level of remuneration. A serious aspect of the problem is the shadowing of incomes and shifting of personal responsibility for the own well-being to the state. Therefore, it is proposed at the legislative level to develop a procedure of a gradual increase of wages and raising the share of the latter in the cost of goods or services. Fourthly, it is a low level of income among the majority of people of retirement age. Therefore, as an alternative source of rising funds for making pension payments there determined an <b>accumulation</b> system <b>of</b> mandatory <b>pension</b> insurance. Fifth, it is the differentiation of the rate <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> payments. It is claimed that the rate <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> should be the same for the people who paid equal premiums.

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1999, {{and in the course}} of macroeconomic growth, the age of access to retirement was rendered more flexible, according to contributions’ profiles. In this sense, a new law made it possible for workers at least 55  years old and a working career of 30 complete calendar years to become eligible for pension benefits. Even though there was a reduction factor linked to early retirement pensions, this flexibility imposed significant financial pressure on the Social Security system. As a consequence, the legal norms that allowed access to a pension before the worker reached the legal retirement age were suspended in 2005. Early retirement schemes became once again possible in 2007, over a new law that was published for discussion in November 2006, but with severe penalties imposed to pensions.

It consists of structure maintenance, providing the activity, implementation of the program, regime, and objectives {{in order to achieve}} the desired result. Due to this, the compulsory cumulative pension system management processes have their own characteristics. These processes, on the one hand, are aimed at the regulation of activities of subjects of the system and its participants, and on the other hand, at the management of certain economic entities. In addition, an author has identified the separate governmental level – regulation, control and supervision – in the sphere of state formation and investment <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> savings. Furthermore, regulations in the field <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> have been studied by the author. The scheme of formation and use <b>of</b> compulsory <b>pension</b> savings has been analyzed according to its role in control processes. Levels <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> provision system in Ukraine have been clarified: the solidarity system <b>of</b> compulsory state <b>pension</b> insurance, which is based on principles of solidarity and subsidies, and the implementation <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> payments and social services at the expense <b>of</b> the <b>Pension</b> Fund; the funded system <b>of</b> compulsory state <b>pension</b> insurance, based on the principles <b>of</b> the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> funds of insured persons and Saving Fund or the relevant non-state pension funds; non-state pension system, which is based on the principles of voluntary participation of citizens, employers and their associations in the formation <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> savings in order to obtain pension benefits by citizens under the conditions and in the form, which is prescribed by the legislation on private pension provision.

Recent research has focused on incentives stemming from the social security system that influence the worker’s decision to retire. Defined benefit systems (both public and private) often contain penalties for postponing access to pensions or continuing to work while receiving a pension. In contrast, the tight link between contributions and accumulations and actuarial conversion <b>of</b> <b>accumulations</b> into <b>pensions</b> in privately managed defined contribution systems may lead workers to postpone pensions or to continue working withdrawals begin. The experience of Chile, which implemented its new system offers an opportunity to test if the change in incentives has indeed produced the expected change in retirement behavior. Using probit analysis of household survey data from to 2002, we estimate the impact <b>of</b> the <b>pension</b> reform on the probability of 1) becoming a pensioner and 2) dropping out of the labor force, for older workers. We find strong effects of the new system on both propensities, in the aggregate and at the individual level after controlling for individual and macro-economic variables. In particular, restricted access to early pensions and the exemption of pensioners from the pension payroll tax appear to exert a powerful effect on labor force participation rates...|$|R
