Subsequently, the singer appears in black hotpants and a blonde blouse {{in front of a}} neon-lightened X sign in the background, flirting with one male. For the first refrain, she and her background dancers perform hand choreography. Following this, Inna and others are seen on {{what appears to be a}} runaway, with rain coming out from above; similar neon signs are shown in the background. After Yandel's cameo appearance, the video ends with Inna and her dancers further performing to the track.

5|$|In 2004, Eve's vengeful, adoptive sister, Liz Sanbourne, discovers Irma's existence, {{and brings}} her to Harmony to destroy Eve's life by {{revealing}} her past to her family. Irma tells them Eve {{was once a}} prostitute and drug addict while living in Boston, and {{was involved in a}} relationship with Julian, who is T.C.'s sworn enemy. The revelations destroy Eve and T.C.'s marriage. Despite her Christian upbringing, Irma is often foul-mouthed; she frequently calls Eve a whore or <b>a</b> <b>slut.</b> When Eve's daughter Simone tells Irma she is a lesbian, Irma, who has previously been kind to her, tells Simone homosexuality is vile and disgusting, and orders her to leave and never return. Irma was portrayed by actress Marla Gibbs on a recurring basis in 2004 and 2005. Gibbs viewed Irma as a malicious character, and was surprised at fans' positive feedback.|$|E
25|$|At Briarcliff, Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) takes Lana's secret {{notes about}} the asylum. Lana retorts {{that she can}} still {{remember}} {{what has happened to}} her, prompting Sister Jude to ask Dr. Arden (James Cromwell) to give Lana electroshock treatment. Asked to assist in administering the electroshock, Sister Jude is disturbed by the violence of the resulting treatment. In the woods, Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe) asks Dr. Arden to tell her the identity of the creatures in the woods who savagely eat the meat she prepares for them. Later, Shelley (Chloë Sevigny) offers herself to Dr. Arden in return for fifteen minutes outside. He rebuffs her, calling her <b>a</b> <b>slut</b> and a whore, leading Shelley to argue that women face a double standard with their sexuality, and that she was committed by her promiscuous husband who hypocritically forbade her from engaging in extramarital sex.|$|E

However, Chief Running Water informs him that his mother is <b>a</b> <b>slut</b> and that he saw her with Chef later that night at the dance. Chef tells Cartman that his mother preferred Mr. Garrison over him. At a bar, Mr. Garrison admits to Cartman that he had sex with Mrs. Cartman, but then argues [...] "But who here didn't!?", to which Mayor McDaniels, Principal Victoria, Jesus and Father Maxi share guilty glances with each other.

Hoping to spare Kenny's feelings, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman decide to warn him. To their bewilderment, Kenny's {{reaction}} is excitement and happiness. Kenny invites Tammy to go with him to T.G.I.

Not noticing his delight, she explains that the only reason she did it was because she became aroused after watching the Jonas Brothers perform. Consequently, Kenny, hoping she will give him a [...] "B.J." [...] as well, takes Tammy to a Jonas Brothers concert at the Pepsi Center.

500|$|... "The Way You Love Me" [...] is an R-dance-pop song which {{displays}} {{influences of}} electro, and rock music. It features a [...] "squealing" [...] synth, a banging fast-paced beat, screaming, rough {{as well as}} at times hoarse vocals and blaring sonics. According to the staff members of Idolator, the beat in the background is augmented by hand-claps similar to that of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008) by Beyoncé Knowles, most noticeable toward the end. According to a press release by Interscope Records, the song's lyrics make reference to a [...] "raw infectious club-thumping message to female empowerment" [...] and about being in a committed relationship. She further said the sentiment reflected in the song is [...] "exactly what her girls are apt to shout behind closed doors" [...] and that the lyrics are meant to reflect a woman's many moods and shifting desires: [...] "I write from a female perspective, but I'm also telling men what women are really thinking and feeling about them.

500|$|While most child {{characters}} {{on the show}} are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really talk when they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the character, and Time magazine described Kenny and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode [...] "The Ring", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed {{to find out that}} she has a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>slut.</b> Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to take better care of themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her [...] "guardian angel"), as revealed in [...] "The Poor Kid." [...] In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.|$|E

500|$|When Leigh {{returned}} from the beach, she was bleeding between her legs, distressed, crying and seeking assistance. Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh {{and find out what}} had happened to her; Leigh [...] "asserted she had been raped", replying [...] " [...] fucked me" [...] and [...] "I hate him". After witnessing Leigh's complaints, Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys [...] "she's a bit of <b>a</b> <b>slut</b> and why don't all of us have a go". Nineteen-year-old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh, placed his arm around her and asked her for sex. Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused, and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh. They yelled abuse, kicked her, poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her. Several people witnessed the assault, yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police, her parents or other adults. The assaults continued for approximately five minutes; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys, missing them. Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left, which either hit her in the leg or missed, according to different witness accounts. The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge, and similar assaults continued. Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10:30pm. Leigh's stepfather arrived at the party to pick her up at 10:50pm. He and several of the party-goers searched for Leigh, but she could not be found. After repeated search attempts, Leigh's mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home, assuming she had gone to a friend's house for the night. Leigh's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning, aided by several youths from the party. Her body was found in the sand dunes about [...] north of the surf club. Leigh's invitation to attend the party was still in her pocket.|$|E

While Beavis is conscious of his mother's promiscuity, it doesn’t seem to bother him much, as he often laughs along in agreement whenever Butt-Head brings it up (in fact, when Butt-Head refers to Beavis' [...] mom as a whore, Beavis nonchalantly says [...] "She's not a whore, she's <b>a</b> <b>slut,</b> she doesn't charge for it").

[...] Radical feminist and noted critic of pornography Andrea Dworkin said [...] "it is a convention of pornography that the sperm is on her not in her.
