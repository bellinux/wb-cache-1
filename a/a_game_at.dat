5|$|Cowan {{was born}} on 10 May 1901 in Chesterfield, but moved further north in his early years and was raised in Adwick le Street near Doncaster. He did not play {{football}} as a child, only gaining {{an interest in the}} sport when he took part in <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> a local park aged 17. He then started to play for local teams, including Adwick Juniors, Bullcroft Main Colliery and Denaby United and had an unsuccessful trial at Huddersfield Town.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's home colours {{have been}} the {{inspiration}} {{for at least three}} other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip. In 1920, Sporting Clube de Braga's manager returned from <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of Os Arsenalistas. These teams still wear those designs to this day.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of August, Hansen injured his shoulder and was optioned to Jersey City in favor of Sal Maglie, where he appeared in five games (1–3, 7.31 ERA). After serving seven months in the military, Hansen asked the team to voluntarily retire him in early 1946 due to his father's severe illness. He did not appear in <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> any level during the 1946 season, but stated {{that he did not}} plan to give up baseball as a career.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his graduation, he ranked third in career tackles in school history, behind Anderson and Ron Simpkins. He has since been passed by Jarrett Irons and Sam Sword, and he stands fifth with 220 tackles. In terms of tackles and assists combined, Morrison once totaled 23 in a November 14, 1992 game against the Illinois Fighting Illini {{football}} team, which stands as a Michigan Football record for <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> Michigan Stadium. Morrison suffered compartmental syndrome in his calf, which necessitated surgical repair to stop internal bleeding, during his 1990 freshman season, for which he earned a medical redshirt season by the NCAA. As a sophomore (redshirt freshman), he sat out four games with a broken leg. In 1993, he missed the first seven games with a broken foot.|$|E

5|$|Before {{what was}} the second largest crowd to witness <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> the Glass Bowl, Toledo {{defeated}} the Bowling Green Falcons 19–13 to win the Peace Pipe. After a Rusty Hanna field goal gave the Rockets an early 3–0 lead, a pair of Erik White touchdown passes gave the Falcons a 13–3 halftime lead. However, the Toledo defense shutout the Bowling Green offense in the second half, and the Rockets came back to win 19–13. Points were scored in the third on a seven-yard touchdown run by Kevin Meger and a one-yard Troy Parker touchdown run. Hanna added a field goal in the fourth. The victory improved Toledo's all-time record against Bowling Green to 22–29–4.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ever game played in Tuscaloosa, the Birmingham Athletic Club (B.A.C.) {{defeated}} Alabama 4–0 at The Quad {{on the campus of}} the University of Alabama. In a game controlled by both defenses, the only points came on an Athletics touchdown in the second half. With the loss, this and later the 1895 and 1955 squads represented the only seasons Alabama failed to win <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> Tuscaloosa during a season that at least one game was played there.|$|E
5|$|Lasker {{finished}} second in an international tournament at Amsterdam, ahead of some well-known masters, including Isidore Gunsberg (assessed as the second strongest {{player in the world}} at that time by Chessmetrics). In 1890 he finished third in Graz, then shared first prize with his brother Berthold in a tournament in Berlin. In spring 1892, he won two tournaments in London, the second and stronger of these without losing <b>a</b> <b>game.</b> <b>At</b> New York City 1893, he won all thirteen games, {{one of the few times}} in chess history that a player has achieved a perfect score in a significant tournament.|$|E

5|$|Robinett, as a {{means to}} {{maintain}} his name on his game, included a hidden message in Adventure identifying himself as the creator, inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles. In discussing the game in 2015, Robinett considered the message {{as a means}} of self-promotion, noting that he had been paid only around $22,000 a year from Atari without any royalties, while Atari would sell a million units of <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> $25 a piece. This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.|$|E
5|$|The Pilots' first Opening Day {{starting}} pitcher was Marty Pattin, {{who received the}} win in a 43 victory against the California Angels. After the team's move to Milwaukee in 1970, Lew Krausse Jr. was charged with the loss in <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> Milwaukee County Stadium vs. the Angels. Ben Sheets holds the club record for most Opening Day starts with six, from 2002 through 2005 and again in both 2007 and 2008. Sheets has a 30 record as a starter on Opening Day, the franchise's best record. Marty Pattin and Mike Caldwell also have perfect records; both won each of their two starts. The Brewers' 17 Opening Day losses by starters are distributed among 16 different pitchers, each having lost one game, excluding Yovani Gallardo, who has lost two.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rivalry}} was {{somewhat}} subdued by the lopsidedness {{of the two}} teams records, the rivalry did provide some moments. On April 15, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilled Chase Utley in the back, after a few Mets pitchers {{had been hit by}} the Phillies. On August 25, during <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> Citizens Bank Park Phillies coach Larry Bowa started yelling out of the dugout after a quick pitch by Mets reliever Hansel Robles while Darin Ruf was in the box not looking up and not ready for the pitch. Bowa also yelled at Mets 1st baseman Daniel Murphy over a perceived slight by Murphy's bat flip earlier in the game during a home run. Benches cleared as Bowa threatened Murphy with retaliation and was ultimately ejected from the game.|$|E

5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E
5|$|Celeste gives Natasha the waitressing job at Charlie's and {{she moves}} in with Summer and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), after her house is sold. Natasha also decides {{to drop out}} of her {{university}} course, upon realising that it is not right for her. Natasha meets Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory) at Charlie's and offers to help him solve a maths equation, but he dismisses her. When she solves the problem, he invites her to a maths club. Natasha later transfers to his calculus course and Ed helps her with conditional probability, which they use to predict the outcome of a game of cards. They decide to play a game of Blackjack with a group of guys at Charlie's, but are forced to stop when a couple of police officers walks in. Natasha convinces Ed to hold <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> the Men's Shed, so they can continue to test the theory and make some money. Andrew comes up with an idea to use the theory to make an odds calculator mobile app. When Natasha goes to asks Ed about the idea, he introduces her to the hobby of LARPing, before agreeing to sign Andrew's contract.|$|E
5|$|Playing in his 14th {{and final}} NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history (a record since broken by Kobe Bryant). That year, Jordan {{was the only}} Washington player to play in all 82 games, {{starting}} in 67 of them. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free throw line. Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times. On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out, and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>at</b> home and 19,311 on the road. However, neither of Jordan's final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and Jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. At several points he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of the number one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft, Kwame Brown.|$|E
