5|$|A {{railway station}} opened in Banagher in 1884 as the {{terminus}} for the Clara to Banagher {{line of the}} Great Southern & Western Railway Company. It operated both a passenger <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> service until 1947, when the passenger service was withdrawn. The station closed completely in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the growth}} of Portishead's {{population}} {{can be attributed to the}} development of the former docks into a vibrant community. The former deep-water dock, used to supply coal <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> to the power stations, has been fully redeveloped into a modern marina with 250 pontoon berths.|$|E
5|$|The site, a {{steeply sloping}} {{hillside}} between a main railway line {{and one of}} Brighton's main roads, had been {{the home of a}} railway locomotive works <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> yard for more than a century. High-density housing was built {{at the same time and}} surrounded the railway buildings. From the 1960s, the area fell into decline: the works <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> yard were closed and demolished, and most of the housing was cleared. This left large areas of derelict land which attracted small-scale redevelopment and transient commercial enterprises. Proposals for redevelopment were made from the 1980s onwards; in 2001 a master plan was granted planning permission by Brighton and Hove City Council. Site clearance work followed, and construction began in 2004.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the House of Saud's nineteenth century (1806) control over Mecca and Medina, they demolished many of the religious buildings including tombs and mosques, whether inside or outside the Baqi, in accordance with their doctrine.

5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> to old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
5|$|In many ways, {{life for}} peasants in the {{countryside}} during the Song dynasty was similar to those living in previous dynasties. The people spent their days ploughing and planting in the fields, tending to their families, selling crops <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> at local markets, visiting local temples, and arranging ceremonies such as marriages. Cases of banditry, which local officials were forced to combat, occurred constantly {{in the countryside}}.|$|E
5|$|It had {{two main}} limitations. The first {{was that the}} Carlisle line was very {{circuitous}} compared with the competing Caledonian Railway (CR) route via Beattock, which also served Edinburgh; the route also depended on running over the CR from Gretna Junction to Carlisle, and needed accommodation at Carlisle station. The CR was to prove a formidable competitor for Anglo-Scottish traffic, both passenger <b>and</b> <b>goods,</b> and much energy and money were expended in securing exclusive territory for the G, and in keeping the CR out.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributors}} to globalization was the Triangular Trade and how it connected the world. The Triangular Trade or Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three {{areas of the world}} through trade. Once traded, items <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> were shipped {{to other parts of the}} world, making the triangle trade a key to global trade. The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.|$|E
5|$|Passenger trains {{generally}} {{served the}} station only on weekdays, although between 1903 and 1922 trains also ran on Sundays. While {{the village of}} Westcott was small, the proximity of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild's estate at Waddesdon Manor made Westcott one of the busier stations on the branch in terms of passenger <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> traffic.|$|E

At the south end were two bay platforms, between platforms 5 and 6, used for short trains <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> vans.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} the 16th {{and the end of}} the 18th century was {{characterized}} by the existence of self-sufficient regional economies separated by considerable distances, a lack of road, maritime or river communications, and the hazards and hardship of land transport. By the end of the 18th century, a significant national economy came into being, as Argentina developed a market in which reciprocal flows of capital, labour, <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> could take place on a significant scale between its different regions, which it had hitherto lacked.|$|E
5|$|The town's former, and only, {{railway station}} {{was on the}} Castle Cary Cut-Off, once part of the Great Western Railway.

5|$|The {{traditional}} {{modes of}} transportation are bullock carts. It is recorded that {{as late as}} the 1950s, landlords and rich farmers travelled mostly by bullock carts with the exception of rare long journeys which they undertook by buses or motor vehicles. Kumbakonam has an efficient local bus transportation system. The mofussil bus stand is located in the south-east of Kumbakonam and is situated just opposite to the Arignar Anna Bus Stand where the long-distance buses are stationed. There are occasional ferries that transport people <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> across the Cauvery. Till the beginning of the 20th century, students of the Government Arts College used to cross the Cauvery on coracle ferries in order to attend college. Since the construction of a bridge in 1944, the practice of transporting men <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> by coracles has greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|War {{came to the}} Kitkehahkis on the Republican in 1798. The Omahas, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Chief Blackbird, had become perhaps the most powerful group in Nebraska. They were located at the junction of the French trade route up the Missouri River and an overland route across northern Iowa whereby the Sac and Fox brought British arms <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> westward. This allowed them to levy tribute and exercise control over trade on the Missouri.|$|E
5|$|What {{had begun}} as a Salt Satyagraha quickly {{grew into a}} mass Satyagraha. British cloth <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, {{including}} censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.|$|E

"Peace, Fairness, <b>and</b> <b>Good</b> Government": In {{this section}} Saul argues {{that instead of}} the phrase [...] "peace, order, <b>and</b> <b>good</b> government", which appears in {{and has become a}} touchstone of the 1867 Canadian Constitution, the phrase that {{dominated}} previous Canadian documents was [...] "peace, welfare, <b>and</b> <b>good</b> government".
