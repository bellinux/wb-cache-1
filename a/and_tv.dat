40|$|Recent {{development}} of autonomous vehicle (AV) provides new travel opportunities for citizens, <b>and</b> traditional vehicles (<b>TVs)</b> {{will still be}} used for a long time. Therefore, it is highly possible that both AVs <b>and</b> <b>TVs</b> will be used as travel modes in a city. In a transportation system with both AVs <b>and</b> <b>TVs,</b> the traffic pattern is worthy of studying. This paper investigates user equilibrium traffic pattern based on the traditional bottleneck model considering AVs <b>and</b> <b>TVs.</b> For both <b>TVs</b> <b>and</b> AVs, travel costs include queuing delay and schedule delay. However, they also have different components of travel costs; more specifically, for AVs, passengers have to pay a riding fare, <b>and,</b> for <b>TVs,</b> travelers encounter a walking time cost after parking their cars. For different combinations of travel demands and riding fare of AVs, analytical solutions of three different user equilibrium traffic patterns are obtained. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the analytical models. Sensitivity analyses are examined to show the impacts of AV’s time-dependent fee and trip-based fixed fee on the traffic pattern and travel costs...|$|R
