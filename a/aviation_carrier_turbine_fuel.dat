5000|$|JP-5:is {{a yellow}} kerosene-based jet fuel {{developed}} in 1952 {{for use in}} aircraft stationed aboard aircraft carriers, where the risk from fire is particularly great. JP-5 is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, containing alkanes, naphthenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons that weighs [...] and has a high flash point (min. 60 C). Because some US naval air stations, Marine Corps air stations and Coast Guard air stations host both sea-based and shore-based (e.g., [...] "land based") naval aircraft, these installations will also typically fuel their shore-based aircraft with JP-5, thus precluding {{the need to maintain}} separate fuel facilities for JP-5 and non-JP-5 fuel. In addition, JP-5 may well have been used by other countries for their military aircraft. Its freezing point is âˆ’46 C. It does not contain antistatic agents. JP5 is also known as NCI-C54784. JP-5's NATO code is F-44. It is also called AVCAT fuel for <b>Aviation</b> <b>Carrier</b> <b>Turbine</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E

40|$|A fuel quality {{processing}} {{study to}} provide a data base for an intelligent tradeoff between advanced turbine technology and liquid fuel quality, and also, to guide the development of specifications of future synthetic fuels anticipated {{for use in the}} time period 1985 to 2000 is given. Four technical performance tests are discussed: on-site pretreating, existing refineries to upgrade fuels, new refineries to upgrade fuels, and data evaluation. The base case refinery is a modern Midwest refinery processing 200, 000 BPD of a 60 / 40 domestic/import petroleum crude mix. The synthetic crudes used for upgrading to marketable products and <b>turbine</b> <b>fuel</b> are shale oil and coal liquids. Of these syncrudes, 50, 000 BPD are processed in the existing petroleum refinery, requiring additional process units and reducing petroleum feed, and in a new refinery designed for processing each syncrude to produce gasoline, distillate fuels, resid <b>fuels,</b> and <b>turbine</b> <b>fuel,</b> JPGs and coke. An extensive collection of synfuel properties and upgrading data was prepared for the application of a linear program model to investigate the most economical production slate meeting petroleum product specifications and <b>turbine</b> <b>fuels</b> of various quality grades. Technical and economic projections were developed for 36 scenarios, based on 4 different crude feeds to either modified existing or new refineries operated in 2 different modes to produce 7 differing grades of <b>turbine</b> <b>fuels.</b> A required product selling price of <b>turbine</b> <b>fuel</b> for each processing route was calculated.

40|$|Current {{aircraft}} <b>turbine</b> <b>fuels</b> do {{not present}} {{a significant problem}} with fuel thermal stability. However, <b>turbine</b> <b>fuels</b> with broadened properties or nonpetroleum derived fuels may have reduced thermal stability because of their higher content of olefins, heteroatoms, and trace metals. Moreover, advanced turbine engines will increase the thermal stress on fuels because of their higher pressure ratios and combustion temperature. In recognition {{of the importance of}} this problem, NASA Lewis is currently engaged in a broadly based research effort to better understand the underlying causes of fuel thermal degradation. The progress and status of our various activities in this area are discussed. Topics covered include: nature of fuel instability and its temperature dependence, methods of measuring the instability, chemical mechanisms involved in deposit formation, and instrumental methods for characterizing fuel deposits. Finally, some preliminary thoughts on design approaches for minimizing the effects of lowered thermal stability are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of fuel stability was conducted in an apparatus which simulated an aircraft gas <b>turbine</b> <b>fuel</b> system. Two fuels were tested: Jet A and Number 2 Home Heating oil. Jet A is an aircraft gas <b>turbine</b> <b>fuel</b> currently in wide use. No. 2 HH was selected to represent the properties of future <b>turbine</b> <b>fuels,</b> particularly experimental Reference Broad Specification, which, under NASA sponsorship, was considered as a possible next-generation fuel. Tests were conducted with varying fuel flow rates, delivery pressures and fuel pretreatments (including preheating and deoxygenation). Simulator wall temperatures were varied between 422 K and 672 K at fuel flows of 0. 022 to 0. 22 Kg/sec. Coking rate was determined at four equally-spaced locations {{along the length of}} the simulator. Fuel samples were collected for infrared analysis. The dependence of coking rate in Jet A may be correlated with surface temperature via an activation energy of 9 to 10 kcal/mole, although the results indicate that both bulk fluid and surface temperature affect the rate of decomposition. As a consequence, flow rate, which controls bulk temperature, must also be considered. Taken together, these results suggest that the decomposition reactions are initiated on the surface and continue in the bulk fluid. The coking rate data for No. 2 HH oil are very highly temperature dependent above approximately 533 K. This suggests that bulk phase reactions can become controlling in the formation of coke...|$|R
