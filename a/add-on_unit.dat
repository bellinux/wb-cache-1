40|$|In {{the primary}} {{experiment}} of the spin stabilized San Marco D/L spacecraft, the drag effects {{on a light}} spherical shell coupled to a relatively massive center body will be measured. To achieve the precise mass property control, the centroids of both the shell and the center body must coincide {{with each other and}} with the center of pressure of the shell. Precise spin balancing is needed for launch and orbital stability, and the deployable antennas need accurate alignment. Corrective measures, developed after the preliminary mass measurements showed flaws in the mass property control, are described in detail. Inertia booms and a yo-yo despin system were developed as <b>add-on</b> <b>units,</b> spin balance measurements about all three geometric axes were used to define weight minimized correction within the outer shell envelope, and boom tip mass differentials were optimized for the most favorable inertia ratio margin achievable within the mission weight constraints.

40|$|Ten {{heat pump}} water heaters (HPWH) {{were placed in}} an {{environmentally}} controlled test facility and run through a durability test program of approximately 7300 duty cycles (actual cycles accumulated ranged from 6640 to 8324 for the ten units). Five of the units were upgraded integral types (HPWH mounted on storage tank, no pump) from the same manufacturer as those tested in our first durability program in 2001 (Baxter and Linkous, 2002). The other five were ''add-on'' type units (HPWH with circulation pump plumbed to a separate storage tank) from another manufacturer. This durability test was designed to represent approximately 7 - 10 years of normal operation to meet the hot water needs of a residence. The integral units operated without incident apart from two control board failures. Both of these were caused by inadvertent exposure to very hot and humid (> 135 F dry bulb and > 120 F dew point) conditions that occurred due to a test loop failure. It is not likely that any residential water heater would be installed where such conditions were expected so these failures are not considered a long-term reliability concern. Two of the integral HPWHs featured a condensate management system (CMS) option that effectively eliminated any need for an evaporator condensate drain, but imposed significant efficiency penalties when operating in high humidity ambient conditions. The <b>add-on</b> <b>units</b> experienced no operational failures (breakdowns with loss of hot water production) {{during the course of}} the testing. However, their control systems exhibited some performance degradation under the high temperature, high humidity test conditions [...] HPWHs would shut off with tank water temperatures 15 - 20 F lower than when operating under moderate ambient conditions. One unit developed a refrigerant leak during the test program and lost about 50 % of its charge resulting in reduced efficiency. Efficiency measurements on all the integral units and four of the <b>add-on</b> <b>units</b> showed significantly higher efficiencies than conventional electric water heaters (EWH). DOE Simulated Use Tests conducted prior to starting the durability testing resulted in energy factors (EF) of about 2. 3 for the integral design and 1. 4 for the add-on design compared to the minimum value of 0. 86 prescribed for EWHs. Based on the experience from this and the previous durability testing, there is no evidence that strongly suggests that any of the HPWHs suffered significant performance degradation after undergoing over 7000 water heat cycles...|$|R
50|$|The {{discovery}} of near-infrared energy is ascribed to William Herschel in the 19th century, {{but the first}} industrial application began in the 1950s. In the first applications, NIRS was used only as an <b>add-on</b> <b>unit</b> to other optical devices that used other wavelengths such as ultraviolet (UV), visible (Vis), or mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometers. In the 1980s, a single-unit, stand-alone NIRS system was made available, but the application of NIRS was focused more on chemical analysis. With the introduction of light-fiber optics in the mid-1980s and the monochromator-detector developments in early-1990s, NIRS became a more powerful tool for scientific research.|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point of this dissertation is the observation that today {{a vast amount of}} 'PV powered' products are already on the market. However, in these PV powered products quite often the choice of PV cells seems random and PV cells function mostly as <b>add-on</b> <b>units</b> to give the product a 'green' energy image. Because of this 'add-on' approach, the PV cells remain foreign bodies which are not well-integrated into the total product design. As a result in today's PV powered products often a sub-optimal matching between the PV cell characteristics, energy storage and the product user contexts. Therefore, the keyword to obtain a mature and sustainably designed PV powered product will be matching. As a result the research question is formulated as: What systematic matching can be achieved between the elements and interfaces of the energy chain of photovoltaic powered mobile/wireless products? The emphasis of this dissertation will be on the optimal matching in the energy chain of PV powered products. For this purpose, an Energy Matching Model of the energy chain is developed. This dissertation will present how, why and under what circumstances a novel Energy Matching Model and associated Figure of Matching algorithm can support industrial designers in developing sustainable photovoltaic powered products. This PhD research project is executed {{within the framework of the}} SYN-Energy program which explores the feasibility of a transition towards the use of photovoltaic (PV) cells in consumer and professional products.

40|$|For the Sixth Consecutive year, Nebraska 2 Ì† 7 s {{agricultural}} {{real estate}} values rose in 1992. According to the 1993 UNL Nebraska Farm Real Estate Market Survey, the increase was just over 4 percent for the year ending February 1, 1993. Still, the 1993 all-state average value remains 30 percent below the peak level of value reached in 1981. Not {{all areas of the}} state experienced land increases during 1992. All-land average values remained essentially unchanged during 1992 in the northwest, north, and southwest areas of Nebraska while gains of 5 to 7 percent were recorded in the eastern third {{of the state and the}} south. Weather appears to have been a major contributing factor to this geographic pattern of value changes. Observes of the market see a supply that is not very price responsive; most land comes on the market because of estate settlement or retirement of the owner-operator. On the demand side, active farmers/ranchers dominate the market as they seek <b>add-on</b> <b>units.</b> In turn, the market tends to be one of parcels rather than complete operating units. Despite a favorable mortgage financing environment in 1992, a substantial share of the transactions continued to be cash purchases with no debt being incurred. Cash rental rates for 1993 tended to be higher than year-earlier levels in those parts of the state where values had also increased. Elsewhere, rates were stable to slightly below 1992 levels. For many land types and areas of the state, the 1993 cash rent levels are at, or even exceeding, previous historical highs. Average annual net percentage rates of return on {{agricultural real estate}} tend to fall in a range of 4 to 6 percent of current market value. These rates appear to be somewhat low relative to other investment alternatives, and reflect the fact that the market for agricultural real estate is multi-faceted with both economic and noneconomic motives influencing market value...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces the}} Explicit Reference Governor: {{a simple and}} systematic <b>add-on</b> control <b>unit</b> that provides constraint handling capabilities to any pre-stabilized nonlinear system by suitably manipulating its applied reference. The main innovation of the proposed framework is that constraint satisfaction is ensured without having to solve implicit equations. As a result, the Explicit Reference Governor is particularly well suited for applications with limited computational capabilities. The basic idea behind the scheme consists in manipulating the derivative of the applied reference so that, {{at any given time}} instant, the currently applied reference will not cause a violation of constraints anytime in the future. The theory behind the proposed framework is presented in general terms and is then detailed to provide specific design strategies. Possible extensions to ensure robustness are also proposed. In addition to introducing the general theory of the Explicit Reference Governor, the dissertation illustrates its step-by-step implementation on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
