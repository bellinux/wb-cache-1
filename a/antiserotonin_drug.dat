40|$|The {{effect of}} {{endotoxin}} {{on the body}} temperature of mice was studied in animals housed without bedding at an environmental temperature of 15 C. Rectal temperatures were measured during the initial 3 to 5 hr of exposure. Doses of endotoxin ranging from 0. 01 to 1 ld 50, as determined for mice maintained at 25 C, produce a hypothermia in proportion to dose. Concurrent injection of tryptophan magnified this response in a dose-dependent manner. Cyproheptadine, an <b>antiserotonin</b> <b>drug,</b> antagonized both the hypothermia produced by serotonin alone, and the augmentation of hypothermia produced by tryptophan in endotoxin-poisoned mice. α-Methyltryptophan, an analogue of the amino acid that is known to induce tryptophan pyrrolase, also antagonized the increased hypothermia produced by tryptophan. These data support a previous suggestion that inhibition of tryptophan pyrrolase in endotoxin-poisoned mice {{has the effect of}} funneling injected tryptophan into the serotonin pathway...|$|E
40|$|Severe {{hypoglycemia}} {{and increased}} deaths were observed among two strains of endotoxin-poisoned mice within 3 to 6 hr after tryptophan injection. Sensitivity to tryptophan could be demonstrated in Rockland Farms mice by 4 hr after endotoxin and in Carworth Farms (CF- 1) mice by 10 hr after endotoxin. If allopurinol {{was given to}} CF- 1 mice concurrently with endotoxin, severe hypoglycemia and increased deaths were observed when tryptophan was given only 4 hr after the bacterial poison. Cyproheptadine, an <b>antiserotonin</b> <b>drug,</b> decreased {{the number of deaths}} as well as the depletion of blood glucose in both strains of endotoxin-poisoned mice given a delayed injection of tryptophan. In most instances, liver glycogen was depleted by 8 to 10 hr after endotoxin. Correlation of liver glycogen levels with sensitivity to tryptophan was not as consistent as the correlation between blood glucose levels and hyperreactivity to the amino acid. The data show that severe hypoglycemia is a significant factor which must be considered in resolving the basis for increased deaths among endotoxin-poisoned mice given tryptophan...|$|E
40|$|Pulsating {{mammalian}} myocardial {{cells were}} found to be highly susceptible in tissue culture to rapid destruction by streptolysin O. Cessation of beating occurred almost immediately, followed within minutes by multiple cell membrane bleb formation. Parallel with these changes, the cytoplasm became intensely granular and the nuclear membrane apparently thickened when viewed by phase microscopy. At the ultrastructural level, the cell membrane blebs {{were found to}} contain relatively small numbers of granular fragments. The endoplasmic reticulum of damaged heart cells was quite swollen, and its contents were considerably condensed. The myofibers were not strikingly altered, but cytoplasmic and mitochondria vacuoles were rather abundant. Cardiac endothelial, kidney epithelial, and fibroblast cells were also susceptible to lysis by this toxin, but the reactions occurred more slowly or bleb formation was less evident. An <b>antiserotonin</b> <b>drug</b> known to be protective against streptolysin-O in vivo (UML- 491), did not protect against killing of cardiac cells at the tissue culture level. Serotonin could not be detected in the culture fluid after lysis of cardiac cells by streptolysin O...|$|E
40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] uveitis is an important cause of blindness in young adults. The need for a comprehensive search for an aetiological 'antigen' is stressed. A source of adjuvant, disturbance in host immunology and any associated syndromes are also sought. Treatment then involves elimination of 'antigen', suppression of host hypersensitivity and the enhanced vascular permeability, and improvement of host resistance. The value of antihistamine and <b>antiserotonin</b> <b>drugs</b> in successful treatment is emphasized. Publisher’s versio...|$|R
40|$|Calves were {{sensitized}} {{to horse}} serum in Freund's complete adjuvant and {{were subjected to}} acute systemic anaphylactic shock. Increased packed cell volume and potassium ion concentration together with severe neutropenia were observed to accompany the systemic hypotension. The hemoconcentration and hyperkalemia were not inhibited by antihistaminic or <b>antiserotonin</b> <b>drugs,</b> but were strongly inhibited by pretreatment of the calves with sodium meclofenamate and by disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) given simultaneously with diethylcarbamazine (DECC). In contrast there was no measurable diminution of the leukopenia by any inhibitor drug tested...|$|R
40|$|A cold {{alcoholic}} extract {{of human}} and albino rat skin, epidermis and dermis, contains prostaglandin (PG) activity as measured by rabbit duodenum assay in presence of antihistaminic, anticholinergic and <b>antiserotonin</b> <b>drugs.</b> The PG on purification by TLC are almost entirely recovered {{in the region of}} PGE's. The normal human thigh skin (biopsy) contains 760 to 2140 nanograms PG (expressed as PGE 1) per gram wet skin. The albino rat skin, epidermis and dermis, contains 732 ± 107, 1539 ± 289 and 582 ± 74 nanograms per gram wet tissue of PG (expressed as PGE 1) respectively. UV-irradiation of albino rat by erythemal doses (2 – 8 MED) results in a several fold increase in both epidermal and dermal PG. It is suggested that skin prostaglandin may {{play an important role in}} elicitation of erythema following UV-irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Using {{substrate}} induction as a tool, {{we attempted}} to determine the role of tryptophan pyrrolase in the response to endotoxin in mice. Previous results {{have shown that the}} administration of the ld 50 of endotoxin lowers tryptophan pyrrolase activity. α-Methyltryptophan was found to maintain tryptophan pyrrolase activity above control levels in endotoxin-poisoned mice without increasing survival. 5 -Hydroxytryptophan, by contrast, lowered tryptophan pyrrolase activity but did not sensitize mice to endotoxin. These results suggest that tryptophan pyrrolase per se does not play a unique role in survival of mice poisoned with endotoxin. This enzyme, however, may reflect the fate of other liver enzymes inducible by adrenocorticoids. In mice given concurrent injections of tryptophan and endotoxin, tryptophan pyrrolase activity was elevated to a level intermediate between that of normal mice and that of mice given tryptophan alone. The mice injected with tryptophan and endotoxin also had about the same mortality as mice given endotoxin alone. Mice treated with tryptophan 4 hr after endotoxin, {{at a time when the}} substrate did not fully elevate tryptophan pyrrolase activity, died convulsively and in larger numbers than those given endotoxin alone. This effect was reversed by prior treatment with cyproheptadine, an <b>antiserotonin</b> <b>drug.</b> These results indicate that the depression of tryptophan pyrrolase activity previously observed in vitro after injection of endotoxin reflects an actual decrease in the in vivo activity of the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate whether 3 -methylindole (3 -Mi), a tryptamine analogue, could cause pulmonary injury in calves other than by cytotoxicity. Injection of 3 -Mi resulted in a marked increase of respiratory rate, decrease of tidal volume and increase in minute ventilation. Pulmonary mechanics values were also profoundly affected, lung dynamic compliance being reduced to approximately one-third of its baseline value and total pulmonary resistance being increased two-fold. Arterial oxygen partial pressure was dramatically reduced. Successive challenges with 3 -Mi after physiological saline pretreatment resulted in quantitatively identical alterations of pulmonary function values. Conversely, all these ventilatory, mechanical and gas exchange changes were abolished by pretreatment with serotonergic antagonists. It was concluded that intravenous administration of 3 -Mi to healthy calves induced immediate and reversible bronchoconstriction which affected both central and peripheral airways. Because the effect was abolished by pretreatment with <b>antiserotonin</b> <b>drugs,</b> it is suggested that 3 -Mi acts either directly by stimulating serotonergic receptors or indirectly through the release of serotonin from platelets. Current concepts of the physiopathological cascade underlying the toxicity of 3 -Mi should, therefore, be re-evaluated in the light of this pharmacological mechanism. Peer reviewe...|$|R
