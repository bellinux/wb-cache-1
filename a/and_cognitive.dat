40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} was performed aiming at studying {{the effects of}} teaching <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> meta <b>cognitive</b> strategies on self-regulation learning of girl students in orphanage centers and at guidance school level. The sample included 20 girl students living in residential centers supervised by Tehran Welfare Organization; 10 of which were assigned in experimental group and 10 in control group. The standardized motivational strategies questionnaire (MSLQ), was administered as pre-test and post-test to collect data. In this process, after the experimental group took the pre-test, they were assigned in an 8 -session course in which they learned <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> meta <b>cognitive</b> strategies <b>and</b> then the post-test was administered for both experimental and control groups and their scores were compared by T-test. The results showed that: There's {{no significant difference between}} the self-regulated learning of orphan girl students who took the <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> meta <b>cognitive</b> learning course <b>and</b> that of those who didn’t take the course. There's {{no significant difference between the}} test anxiety of the orphan girl students who took the <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> meta <b>cognitive</b> learning course <b>and</b> that of those who didn’t take the course. There's no significant difference in applying the cognitive strategies by the orphan girl students who took the <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> meta <b>cognitive</b> learning course <b>and</b> those who didn’t take the course. There's no significant difference in applying the meta cognitive strategies by the orphan girl students who took the <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> meta <b>cognitive</b> learning course <b>and</b> those who didn’t take the course...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between goal orientation and learning strategies with academic stress in university students(150 male and 150 female) which were selected among 4 college by cluster sampling method. Goal orientation questionnaire (Button, Mathieu and Zajac, 1996) and learning strategies questionnaire (Pintrich and Degroot, 1990) and academic stress questionnaire (Gadzella, 1991) were used as the research instrument. Finding show that there was a positive meaningful relationship between learning goal orientation with learning strategies (<b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> met <b>cognitive)</b> <b>and</b> academic stress. Also there was negative meaningful correlation between performance goal orientation <b>and</b> learning strategies (<b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> Meta <b>cognitive).</b> These finding also reveals that learning strategies (<b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> Meta <b>cognitive)</b> have negative meaningful correlation with academic stress. Finally findings displays that academic stress is predictable through linear regression of goal orientation component and learning strategies. So totally these variables were explained 9 / 6 percent of the variance of academic stress...|$|R

5|$|Cerebral malaria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{neurological}} disabilities in African children. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.|$|E
5|$|During childhood, malaria causes anemia {{during a}} period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage {{resulting}} from cerebral malaria. Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> deficits, behavioural disorders, and epilepsy. Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.|$|E

5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E

5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E

5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes emotional <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> effects such as euphoria, {{change in}} desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E

5|$|In 1987 Nuttin {{published}} his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 {{with the help}} of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.|$|E

Education may be more helpful to people with stage I cancer and their carers, and coping-skills training may be more helpful at stages II and III.|$|E
