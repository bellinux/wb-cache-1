40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{influence}} of different degrees of additional illumination on visual caries detection using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). Two calibrated examiners assessed 139 occlusal surfaces of extracted permanent molars using a standard operation lamp with or without an <b>additional</b> <b>headlamp</b> providing three default brightness intensities. Histology served as the gold standard. Pooled data showed no differences in sensitivities. Specificities were not influenced by additional light. The area under the curve for the Marthaler classification D 3 threshold was significantly lower when an additional strong headlamp was used (0. 59 compared to 0. 69 - 0. 72 when reduced illumination intensities were used). One of the two examiners also had a significantly lower sensitivity for the D 1 threshold when an <b>additional</b> <b>headlamp</b> was used. The use of additional white light led to a reduced detection of dentine lesions...|$|E
40|$|Bright {{white light}} sources are of {{significant}} importance for automotive front lighting systems. Todays upper class vehicles mainly use HID or LED as light source. As a further {{step in this}} development laser diode based systems offer high luminance, efficiency and allow the realization of new styling concepts and new dynamic lighting functions. These white laser diode systems can either be realized by mixing different spectral sources or by combining diodes with specific phosphors. Based on the approach of generating light using a laser and remote phosphor, lighting modules are manufactured. Four blue laser diodes (450 nm) are used to activate a phosphor coating and thus to achieve white light. A segmented paraboloid reflector generates the desired light distribution for an <b>additional</b> car <b>headlamp.</b> We use high speed milling and selective laser melting to build the reflector system for this lighting module. We compare the spectral reflection grade of these materials. Furthermore the generated modules are analyzed regarding their efficiency and light distribution. The use of Rapid Prototyping technologies allows an early validation of the chosen concept and is supposed to reduce cost and time in the product development process significantly. Therefor we discuss costs and times of the applied manufacturing technologies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{measured}} {{direct and}} rearview-mirror glare illuminances produced by low-beam headlamps {{in a sample}} of 22 passenger vehicles. The glare illumi-nances were measured for 12 common glare situations that were de ned by a full factorial combination of three scenarios (oncoming driver, center rearview mirror of a preceding driver, or driver-side mirror of a preceding driver one lane to the right), two longitudinal distances (25 m or 50 m), and two vertical locations (illuminated vehicle being either a car or a light truck/van/sport utility vehicle). The measurements were made outdoors at night on asphalt pavement. The median illuminances (not taking into account window transmittance or mirror re ectance) ranged from 0. 5 lux for an oncoming driver of a light truck/van/sport utility vehicle at a distance of 50 m, to 3. 4 lux at the driver-side mirror of a preceding car at 25 m one lane to the right. The ratios of the maxima and the minima measured for each of the 12 glare situations were large, ranging from about 5 : 1 to 36 : 1. The median actual illuminances were compared to the median expected illuminances based on a recent, laboratory-measured, representative sample of US low-beam patterns, taking into account the possible effects of dirt, voltage, misaim, and pavement re ectance. This analysis indicates that the actual illuminances could be very well modeled using the laboratory-measured beam patterns and assuming a linear relationship between the light output of clean and dirty <b>headlamps.</b> <b>Additional</b> analyses evaluated the relationships between headlamp mounting height and glare illuminance. 1...|$|R
