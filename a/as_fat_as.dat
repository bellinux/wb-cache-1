5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} <b>as</b> <b>fat</b> <b>as</b> possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his first}} {{appearance}} against more experienced hurdlers, Faugheen contested the Ascot Hurdle over 2m [...] f on 22 November 2014. As in most of his previous races, he took the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, winning by three and three-quarter lengths from the Nicky Henderson-trained Blue Fashion. Mullins later said: [...] "Dan Skelton, who stood in for me on the day, remarked to Ruby (Walsh) that he'd never saddled a horse <b>as</b> <b>fat</b> <b>as</b> that for a big race. If {{he can do that}} with that amount of condition on him there must be huge improvement in him". After the race the William Hill made Faugheen 9/4 favourite for the 2015 Champion Hurdle.|$|E
2500|$|Hearing Callas in Norma in 1952] was a shock, a {{wonderful}} shock. You just got shivers {{up and down}} the spine. It was a bigger sound in those earlier performances, before she lost weight. I think she tried very hard to recreate the sort of [...] "fatness" [...] of the sound which she had when she was <b>as</b> <b>fat</b> <b>as</b> she was. But when she lost the weight, she couldn't seem to sustain the great sound that she had made, and the body seemed to be too frail to support that sound that she was making. Oh, but it was oh so exciting. It was thrilling. I don't think that anyone who heard Callas after 1955 really heard the Callas voice.|$|E

The procedure does not require general anesthesia and risks of an allergic reaction are minimal due {{to the use of the}} patient's own tissue used as the facial injection.|$|R
