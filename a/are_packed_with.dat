[...] Anthony Peronto of Christian Music Zine rated the album 4.75 out of five, and said that [...] "loosely inspired by the book of Ecclesiastes, Gravity is so far the most important CHH album ever made and bridges the gap between Christian and the secular rap scenes." [...] At Cross Rhythms, Steve Hayes wrote that this is Lecrae's [...] "finest project to date", called it [...] "brilliantly produced [...] explosively impacts the listener", and said the release would be [...] "enjoyed for years to come." [...] New Release Tuesday's Mark Ryan noted that [...] "there are 3 or 4 songs too many on the album that detract from the album as a whole", which is the reason he did not [...] "get overly excited", but he did affirm that [...] "fans and newcomers alike will enjoy the album".|$|E
500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records <b>are</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience than I thought it would be." ...|$|E

[...] The cylinders <b>are</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> porous materials (e.g. kapok fibre, diatomaceous earth, or (formerly) asbestos), then filled to around 50% capacity with acetone, as acetylene is soluble in acetone.

However, a problem arises with the improper disposal either by burning or disposing as normal household waste.|$|E
2500|$|Age of Mythologys {{graphics}} were {{praised by}} the majority of reviewers. IGN reviewer Steve Butts stated that [...] "some fantastic effects and believable animations make this one a joy to watch. The differences between the armies and environments are awesome."

Meanwhile, GameSpot reviewer Greg Kasavin also rated the graphics 9 out of 10, stating that [...] "Age of Mythology is a great-looking game, filled with bright colors and carefully detailed animations." [...] Game Revolution also appreciated Age of Mythologys graphics, stating in their review that the [...] "new 3D landscape looks good", and including graphics as one of the positives in the review summary. PC Gamer reviewer William Harms admired the graphics, [...] "The environments, units, and buildings <b>are</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> detail," [...] and excitedly commented on the effects: [...] "What really impressed me, though, were the game's animations.

2500|$|Leskov was {{continuously}} {{experimenting with}} forms, his most favourable being [...] "the chronicle" [...] which {{he saw as}} a healthy alternative to orthodox novel. [...] "Things pass by us and I'm not going to diminish or boost their respective significance; I won't be forced into doing so by the unnatural, man-made format of the novel which demands the rounding up of fabulas and the drawing together of plotlines to one central course. That's not how life is. Human life runs on {{in its own way}} and that's how I'm going to treat the roll of events in my works," [...] he once wrote. Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary's biographer Semyon Vengerov found in Leskov traits common to Alexander Ostrovsky, Aleksey Pisemsky and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. [...] "But the most astounding feature in him is what Turgenev called his 'inventiveness'. Some of Leskov's 5–6 page stories <b>are</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> plotlines that could have filled volumes. This is especially true for The Enchanted Wanderer where each new turn brings out another fascinating scene, with its own new set of colours. Apart from his large anti-nihilistic novels (No Way Out, At Daggers Drawn), less successful artistically, Leskov's prose is remarkably concise and totally devoid of filler and ballast," [...] Vengerov added.|$|E

I will not conceal {{the fact that}} miniature figures of the Lion of Lucerne are to be had in them. Millions of them. But they are libels upon him, every one of them. There is a subtle something about the majestic pathos of the original which the copyist cannot get. Even the sun fails to get it; both the photographer and the carver give you a dying lion, and that is all. The shape is right, the attitude is right, the proportions are right, but that indescribable something which makes the Lion of Lucerne the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world, is wanting.|$|E
