5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century Madagascar had {{the most}} {{developed}} and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals <b>as</b> <b>teachers,</b> and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{offering}} vocational training {{was part of}} a larger challenge for Morgan in her first few years at the university. Because of the school's status as a land-grant university, the program was required to follow California State Department of Education directives to produce graduates trained <b>as</b> <b>teachers,</b> agricultural extension specialists and dietitians. However, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the university in the early 20th century, saw those fields as vocations, and he encouraged Morgan to continue her focus on science.|$|E
5|$|To escape racial discrimination, his {{children}} passed into white society: the four surviving sons married white spouses; his unmarried daughter {{lived with a}} brother. They worked <b>as</b> <b>teachers,</b> a lawyer, and business people. Smith's unique achievements as a pioneering African-American doctor were rediscovered by 20th-century historians. They were relearned by his descendants {{in the twenty-first century}} when a three-times-great-granddaughter took a history class and found his name in her grandmother's family bible. In 2010, several Smith descendants commissioned a new tombstone for his grave in Brooklyn. They gathered to honor him and their African-American ancestry.|$|E

5|$|According to some sources, the Poles resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} because, before the war, Poles had a privileged position. Then, {{in the space}} of a few days, Jews and other minorities from within Poland occupied positions in the Soviet occupation government—such <b>as</b> <b>teachers,</b> civil servants and engineers—that they allegedly had trouble achieving under the Polish government. What to the majority of Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Zwingli had accused mendicant orders of {{hypocrisy}} and demanded their abolition {{in order to}} support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossmünster and Fraumünster and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraumünster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance Katharina von Zimmern) and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the Prophezei (Prophecy) or Carolinum, at the Grossmünster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud <b>as</b> <b>teachers.</b> It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The Zurich Bible translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by Christoph Froschauer, bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school. Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, {{before his}} father imposed {{a ban on}} {{competitive}} cricket, Constantine had played briefly for Shannon Cricket Club; {{he returned to the}} club in 1920. Initially, he appeared in the second team, but after scoring 50 runs in an hour during his third game, was promoted to the first eleven. Cricket in Trinidad at the time was divided along racial lines; Shannon was mainly for black lower middle-class players such <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> or clerks. The club was competitive and highly motivated, partly as a reaction to the racial discrimination that its players and supporters encountered in their daily lives. Constantine's cricket thrived in this atmosphere, and the club helped to form some of his political views. He particularly noticed that in Trinidadian and West Indian cricket, white and light-skinned players were often favoured over black players of greater ability.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s, List {{initially}} {{devised the}} idea that ancient German society had been led by a hierarchical system of initiates, the Armanenschaft, an idea which had developed into {{a key part of}} his thinking by 1908. List's image of the Armanenschaft's structure was based largely on his knowledge of Freemasonry. He claimed that the ancient brotherhood had consisted of three degrees, each with their own secret signs, grips, and passwords. He believed that the Armanenschaft had societal control over the ancient German people, acting <b>as</b> <b>teachers,</b> priests, and judges. In List's interpretation of history, the Christian missionaries persecuted the Armanenschaft, resulting in many fleeing northward into Scandinavia and Iceland. He believed that they developed a secretive language for transmitting their teachings, known as kala.|$|E
5|$|Letitia Woods Brown (née Letitia Christine Woods) {{was born}} on October24, 1915, to Evadne Clark Adam Woods and Matthew Woods in Tuskegee, Alabama, U.S. One of three daughters, Letitia was the second child. The Woodses were a middle-class family; both parents worked <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), an {{industrial}} college established by Booker T. Washington. Matthew Woods was educated at the Tuskegee Institute. Letitia's mother Evadne Woods was one of twelve children born to Lewis Adams and Theodosia Evadne Clark. Her father Lewis Adams was a former slave who became a Tuskegee Normal School trustee and a commissioner in 1881. They all served as educators throughout the southern USA.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Marx's childhood. The third of nine children, he became the oldest son when his brother Moritz died in 1819. Young Marx and his {{surviving}} siblings, Sophie, Hermann, Henriette, Louise, Emilie and Caroline were baptised into the Lutheran Church along with their mother in August 1824. Young Marx was privately educated by his father until 1830, when he entered Trier High School, whose headmaster, Hugo Wyttenbach, {{was a friend of}} his father. By employing many liberal humanists <b>as</b> <b>teachers,</b> Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance.|$|E

5|$|St Hill {{was born}} in Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1904, and {{according}} to the writer C. L. R. James, his family were lower middle-class. His brothers, Wilton and Cyl played cricket for Trinidad; in addition, the former played Test matches for the West Indies. St Hill first played in the Bonanza Cup, Trinidad's main cricket competition, for a club called Durban Cricket Club in 1922; critics judged him to be promising, but he had little success. The following year, he moved to play for Shannon. Cricket in Trinidad at the time was divided along racial lines. Shannon was a club associated with black lower middle-class players such <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> or clerks. The team contained many strong bowlers, and St Hill opened the bowling.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{hoped to}} earn {{most of her}} college {{expenses}} through teaching {{in one of the}} institute’s lower departments. But because of its policy against employing first-year students <b>as</b> <b>teachers,</b> the only work Stone could get other than teaching at district schools during the winter break was house keeping chores through the school’s manual labor program. For this she was paid three cents an hour—less than half what male students received for their work in the program. Among measures taken to reduce her expenses, Stone prepared her own meals in her dormitory room. In 1844 Stone was given a position teaching arithmetic in the Ladies Department, but again received reduced pay because of her sex.|$|E

5|$|The archdiocese offers {{religious}} education classes {{in all of}} its 111 parishes for children who attend public and other non-religious schools. According to the 2007 Official Catholic Directory, there were 95,837 students enrolled in these classes. This same source lists <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> 2760 laity, 58 religious sisters, and 43 priests and religious brothers. Religious education classes are also offered to adults throughout the archdiocese. In 1997, Archbishop Favalora adopted a policy requiring all volunteers, employees, teachers and priests to be fingerprinted and have a background check before they could work with children. Several years later, this policy was enshrined and adopted by all U.S. Bishops in the Charter for Protection of Young People.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson {{made her}} first {{priority}} {{the raising of}} the school leaving age. This required the recruitment and training of thousands of extra teachers, and creating classroom space for almost 400,000 extra children. Under the Emergency Training Scheme (ETS), ex-servicemen and women were given grants to train <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> on an accelerated one-year programme; more than 37,000 had been or were being trained {{by the end of}} 1946. The rapid expansion of school premises was achieved by the erection of temporary huts—some of which became long-term features of schools. Wilkinson was determined that the higher leaving age be implemented by 1 April 1947—the date set by the 1944 Act—and in the face of parliamentary scepticism insisted that her plans were on track. Final cabinet approval to honour the April date was given on 16 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|These fashions {{permeated}} noble households, where resident musicians were employed, including viol and lute players. As {{elsewhere in}} Europe, musical ability {{became one of}} the major achievements expected of a nobleman or woman. Musicians were clearly employed <b>as</b> <b>teachers</b> for the children of the household, both male and female. There is evidence for the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of lessons being given in a variety of instruments and singing, and of the purchase of sheet music and instruments (including the virginals and harpsichords). In the Highlands clan chiefs continued to employ harpists, and increasingly, pipers as fili and bards, whose prowess and ability to glorify their ancestors was a key element in underlying a clan's status and heritage into the seventeenth century. The earliest printed collection of secular music in Scotland was by publisher John Forbes in Aberdeen in 1662. Songs and Fancies: to Thre, Foure, or Five Partes, both Apt for Voices and Viols, known as Forbes' Cantus, was printed three times in the next twenty years. It contained 77 songs, of which 25 were of Scottish origin.|$|E
