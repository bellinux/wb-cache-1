5000|$|Apparently Confederate pickets {{failed to}} respond to the {{presence}} of the Union raiding party because they assumed that the Union soldiers were a party of Wright's Cavalry that recently passed through the area were returning for some reason. It was often difficult to distinguish Union soldiers from Confederates during this period of the war. Some Confederates in Arkansas were wearing clothing manufactured at Confederate depots made out of English <b>army</b> <b>cloth.</b> Confederates had received a supply of British cloth through the Union blockade to Confederate depots in Texas, and a supply of uniforms made from this cloth had been forwarded to Arkansas. Jackets made from this material were hard to distinguish from Federal infantry and mounted service jackets. To add to the confusion, some Confederate units, such as Confederate General Joe Shelby's Missouri Cavalry Brigade had become known for dressing in captured Union uniforms.Confederates {{on the west side of}} the river apparently thought that the Union cavalrymen were fellow Confederates and made no attempt to resist them. The written report that the two lieutenants explained, [...] "When we came to the fork of Long View and Camden Road, which is some two miles from Long View, we took four prisoners, and learned from them that there had been a train of nine wagons and 25 men passed out a short time ahead of us. We sent a party out after them, burnt the wagons, and captured the men. We learned from them that there was a large train crossing, which had come out from Monticello that day. We moved on, and reached their camp just at dark. We charged into their camp, surrounded them, and demanded their surrender, and ordered them to fall into line. We coming on them so unexpectedly, and they being in such confusion, they obeyed immediately. There were 250 men, 7 or 8 officers. We destroyed their bridge, threw about 175 or 200 stand of arms in the river, burnt 30 wagons, which were loaded with baggage and camp equippage, also ammunition; took some 300 horses and mules. We then mounted our prisoners, and returned to our most worthy commander all O. K." ...|$|E

As he instructs the leaders, it dawns on them that Caelum is not the StarSon mentioned on the Maze Gate, but Drago is. Isfrael helps the <b>army</b> construct <b>cloth</b> for portable tents so they can venture across the plains and the groups separate.|$|R
5000|$|An {{account of}} Wuqi (Wu Ch'i, in Wade-Giles Romanization) in 1936 {{can be found}} in Edgar Snow's [...] "Red Star over China". At the time, it was the main {{industrial}} center of the communist-controlled Shaanxi/Gansu/Ningxia borderlands area, This is where the Red <b>Army's</b> arsenal. <b>cloth,</b> uniform, shoe and stockings factories were at the time. As Edgar Snow noted, the arsenal's products were mostly used to arm the Red guerilla fighters, while the regular Red Army units mostly used weapons captured from the enemy (Kuomintang and warlord) troops.|$|R
50|$|The US <b>Army</b> wore blue <b>cloth</b> helmets of {{the same}} pattern as the British model from 1881 to 1901 {{as part of their}} full dress uniform. The version worn by cavalry and mounted {{artillery}} included plumes and cords in the colors (yellow or red) of their respective branches of service.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 18th century, epaulettes {{had become the}} {{distinguishing}} feature of commissioned rank. This led officers of military units still without epaulettes to petition {{for the right to}} wear epaulettes, to ensure that their status would be recognized. [...] During the Napoleonic Wars and subsequently through the 19th century, grenadiers, light infantry, voltigeurs and other specialist categories of infantry in many European <b>armies</b> wore <b>cloth</b> epaulettes with wool fringes in various colours to distinguish them from ordinary line infantry. [...] "Flying artillery" [...] wore [...] "wings", similar to an epaulette but with only a bit of fringe on the outside, which matched the shoulder seam. Heavy artillery wore small balls representing ammunition on their shoulders." ...|$|R
50|$|The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company {{played an}} {{important}} role in the war effort during the First World War. Many of the industries in Ipswich suffered during the war due to reduced numbers of employees and minimised profits, but the Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company was an exception; the high number of female employees ensured minimal staff reductions caused by the war. The factory was extremely busy throughout the war making <b>army</b> blankets and <b>cloth</b> for military uniforms.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War in 1861, the Fries factory began to supply wool and cotton goods for the Confederate <b>Army</b> and <b>cloth</b> for uniforms, working round the clock throughout the war. In 1861, Henry Fries corresponded with North Carolina governor Henry T. Clark concerning his problems supplying the army with adequate materials. During 1863 and 1864, private houses all around the town were used to dry Fries' cloth before it was made into oilcloth, children in the town wore wooden shoes to save leather for war supplies, and children and elderly townspeople were all involved in preparing different materials for the war effort. As the war progressed, army wool suppliers such as the Fries Cotton Mill were accused of profiteering, with profits from sales to the Confederate government reaching 67%. Governor Zebulon B. Vance publicly denounced these practices in the legislature, to strong objections from the mill owners, with Frank Fries describing Vance's comments as [...] "very sweeping" [...] and stating in a letter that the state's millers [...] "are not more incorrigible than other classes of our citizens". Fellow mill owner and North Carolina secessionist leader John A. Young challenged Vance from the floor of the State Senate and forced a retraction of his comments.|$|R
5|$|The {{governor}} of Louisiana, Bernardo de Gálvez, was named Field Marshal of the Spanish colonial army in North America. In 1779, Galvez and his troops, composed of Puerto Ricans {{and people from}} other Spanish colonies, distracted the British from the revolution by capturing Pensacola, {{the capital of the}} British colony of West Florida and the cities of Baton Rouge, St. Louis and Mobile. The Puerto Rican troops, under the leadership of Brigadier General Ramón de Castro, helped defeat the British and Indian army of 2,500 soldiers and British warships in Pensacola. Galvez and his multinational army also provided the Continental <b>Army</b> with guns, <b>cloth,</b> gunpowder and medicine shipped from Cuba up the Mississippi River. General Ramón de Castro, who was Galvez's Aide-de-camp in the Mobile and Pensacola campaigns, became the appointed {{governor of}} Puerto Rico in 1795.|$|R
5000|$|U.S. Air Force utility uniforms, {{also known}} informally as [...] "fatigues," [...] have {{continuously}} evolved since the Air Force became an independent service in 1947. Until the late 2000s, USAF utility uniforms {{were the same}} as those of the U.S. Army, with the exception of unique USAF insignia. In the 1960s, this was a solid green uniform, differing from its <b>Army</b> counterpart with <b>cloth</b> white insignia on an ultramarine blue background for [...] "U.S. AIR FORCE" [...] and last name nametapes above the pockets, white collar rank insignia on a green background for officers (with the exception of yellow thread replicating gold for rank insignia for 2nd Lieutenants and Majors) and blue and white sleeve rank insignia for enlisted, a full color patch of the major command (i.e., SAC, TAC, MAC, ATC, etc.) worn on the right pocket, and a blue belt. As the Army transitioned to black and brown subdued insignia on a green background on their utility uniforms in the late 1960s and 1970s, the Air Force effected a similar transition to subdued insignia in the 1980s, transitioning to blue or brown on a green background and with subdued major command patches also employing subdued reds and black.|$|R
5000|$|By 1705, {{when he was}} in his mid-thirties, Brerewood {{was already}} a man of {{considerable}} personal fortune. Having trained as a linen Draper, or cloth merchant, he followed the money into cloth brokering and international trade. As early as 1700 he had established himself as an army regimental agent, the civilian employed by the colonel in charge of each regiment to act as paymaster and to provide uniforms. An agent earned a few hundred pounds a year in standard allowances but made his real money selling the <b>army</b> his <b>cloth</b> and lending money to officers at exorbitant rates. A single clothing assignment to a regiment might bring Brerewood thousands of pounds, and he loaned money with one hundred percent penalties for late repayment.In the years before the Pitkin Affair broke, Brerewood served as an agent to some of the leading army commanders of the day. He was the paymaster for the Duke of Marlborough’s battalion in England while Marlborough was the commander-in-chief of the English army fighting in the Netherlands against the French during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1712). He also acted as agent for the regiments of the Duke of Schombergh; of Colonel Cadogen, the commander of a cavalry company; of Lieutenant-Colonel John Bristow of the First Foot Guards; and of the Duke of Northumberland, who would become Brerewood’s particular patron.Obtaining agencies of such prominence required Brerewood to have the patronage of men of the highest rank and to have the wherewithal to bear the cost of clothing assignments for the years it took to recoup the investment from the soldiers’ off-reckonings, or the amount deducted from their pay for uniforms and equipment. Coming from a prominent family, Brerewood did not lack for either connections or wealth. He had apprenticed with his prosperous uncle, a linen draper in London. He had two houses in London: one in town and another in the village of Turnham Green on the western outskirts of the city. He also held a number of properties in Chester, including two shops in the commercial centre. He engaged in trade to continental Europe and the American colonies, and he had at least some stock investments. But this economic success did not satisfy Brerewood. From what it is known about his activities in the years before the Pitkin Affair, he moved from scam to scam, perhaps because, as counsel for Pitkin’s creditors opined in testimony before the House of Lords, he “thought he was not rich enough.”, ...|$|R
50|$|After World War II, various {{styles of}} {{camouflage}} cover were used at different times. In the 1960s through 1970s, the type commonly {{seen in the}} United States Army and Marine Corps was a reversible fabric cover called the Mitchell Pattern, with a leafy green pattern {{on one side and}} orange cloud pattern on the other. This type was nearly omnipresent in Vietnam, and where, for the first time, the <b>army</b> wore the <b>cloth</b> camouflage as general issue; whereas in World War II and the Korean War, the army traditionally wore their helmets only with nets, plain without anything on it, or with field-made, non-issue covers without camouflage. By contrast, United States Marines have consistently worn a cloth camouflage cover over their M-1 helmets in all three major wars—World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The Korean War (1950-1953) was largely fought using World War II weapons and equipment, and the Marine Corps helmets and camouflage covers were basically the same as those used during World War II. In Vietnam, the green portion of the reversible fabric camouflage was normally worn outermost. Helmet covers in the (European) woodland camouflage, were designed for fighting in the European Theater of Operations (NATO), and became the post-Vietnam (jungle pattern) camouflage cover used by the U.S. military from the late 1970s onward. The (European) Woodland pattern was not reversible; they were only printed on one side, though some rare desert camouflage examples do exist. These covers were all constructed from two semi-circular pieces of cloth stitched together to form a dome-like shape conforming to the helmet's shape. They were secured to the helmet by folding their open ends into the steel pot, and then placing the liner inside, trapping the cloth between the pot and the liner. An olive green elastic band, intended to hold additional camouflage materials, was often worn around the helmet to further hold the cover in place.|$|R
