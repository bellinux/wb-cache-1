40|$|Every <b>expanding</b> map on <b>a</b> closed {{manifold}} is topologically conjugate to <b>an</b> <b>expanding</b> map on <b>an</b> infra-nilmanifold, but {{not every}} infra-nilmanifold admits <b>an</b> <b>expanding</b> map. In this article we give a complete algebraic characterization of the infra-nilmanifolds admitting <b>an</b> <b>expanding</b> map. We show that, {{just as in the}} case of Anosov diffeomorphisms, the existence of <b>an</b> <b>expanding</b> map depends only on the rational holonomy representation of the infra-nilmanifold. A similar characterization is also given for the infra-nilmanifolds with a non-trivial self-cover, which corresponds to determining which almost-Bieberbach groups are co-Hopfian. These results provide many new examples of infra-nilmanifolds without non-trivial self-covers or expanding maps. Comment: 16 page...|$|R
