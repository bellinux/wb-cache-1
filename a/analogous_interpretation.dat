40|$|Abstract Background When {{investigating}} covariate {{interactions and}} group associations with standard regression analyses, {{the relationship between}} the response variable and exposure may be difficult to characterize. When the relationship is nonlinear, linear modeling techniques do not capture the nonlinear information content. Statistical learning (SL) techniques with kernels are capable of addressing nonlinear problems without making parametric assumptions. However, these techniques do not produce findings relevant for epidemiologic interpretations. A simulated case-control study was used to contrast the information embedding characteristics and separation boundaries produced by a specific SL technique with logistic regression (LR) modeling representing a parametric approach. The SL technique was comprised of a kernel mapping in combination with a perceptron neural network. Because the LR model has an important epidemiologic interpretation, the SL method was modified to produce the <b>analogous</b> <b>interpretation</b> and generate odds ratios for comparison. Results The SL approach is capable of generating odds ratios for main effects and risk factor interactions that better capture nonlinear relationships between exposure variables and outcome in comparison with LR. Conclusions The integration of SL methods in epidemiology may improve both the understanding and interpretation of complex exposure/disease relationships. </p...|$|E

40|$|Alexander Scriabin’s piano sonatas {{are largely}} {{regarded}} as the most significant works in the genre since Beethoven. They outline the development of his compositional style from the youthful Chopinesque works, to his mature, idiosyncratic post-tonal offerings. According to his close friend, biographer, and critic Leonid Sabaneyev, despite Scriabin’s philosophy suffering “from too many manifest faults”, his late music is “incomprehensible and incomplete” when “severed from his philosophy”. Consequently, this treatise focuses on Scriabin’s unique compositional voice through an examination of his idiosyncratic musical gestures, and the points of their interaction/intersection with his eclectic philosophizing. Recognizing {{the absence of a}} substantial interpretive system that reconciles Scriabin’s music with his philosophical outlook in the available Scriabin-scholarship, this dissertation investigates the impact of his mystical beliefs upon his compositional style. This is largely achieved through the identification and scrutiny of symbolic gestures in his idiosyncratic pianistic style. Part 1 constitutes the examination of Scriabin’s symbolic gestures that routinely feature in his late works: unity, summons, light, flight, occult, resonance, sensuality, eroticism, ecstasy, and transformation/dissipation. Part 2 discusses Sonata no. 8, which stands to benefit the most from a gestural reading, due to the near absence of the composer’s customary vivid French annotations. A brief discussion regarding issues of interpretation and performance of that sonata and Scriabin’s late keyboard works completes this dissertation. The investigative method outlined above, in synergy with the composer's complex beliefsystem, develops a new gestural framework for perceiving and interpreting Scriabin's work; one that blurs the conventional distinctions between musicologist and performer, enabling informed conceptualizations and gestalt performances of these ‘symbolist’ works. Sonata No. 8 is used as a matrix upon which this theoretical approach is applied. Through relative comparisons and references to the other late sonatas, the Eighth is proffered as an interpretive model upon which <b>analogous</b> <b>interpretations</b> may be based...|$|R
40|$|Three polymorphs of {{tridymite}} (MC, PO- 10 and MX) {{have been}} examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in crystals which also contain lamellae of cristobalite. MX is the least common, and is highly unstable in the electron beam. It occurs as small regions (< 1 /~m 2) in PO- 10 tridymite and at MC/PO- 10 boundaries; these regions are interpreted as being strained. A consistent association between PO- 10 and the cristobalite lamellae is attributed {{to the fact that}} PO- 10 can more closely match the low-cristobalite structure than MC can, at boundaries parallel to the plane in which the crystal structures contain layers of SiO 4 tetrahedra. An <b>analogous</b> <b>interpretation</b> explains the observation that twin boundaries (associated with 60 ~ or 120 ~ rotation of the layer) are commonly parallel to the layer plane in PO- 10 but at high angles to it in MC.

40|$|Upon {{interaction}} of the three anthracycline antibiotics daunomycin, adriamycin, and aclacinomycin A with calf thymus DNA the relative changes of both DNA contour length, delta L/Lo, and persistence length, delta a/ao, have been determined {{as a function of}} r, the ratio of bound ligand molecules per DNA mononucleotide. From the r dependence of delta a/ao a measure for the stiffening effect and also the angle gamma of ligand-induced DNA bending could be derived. Experimental basis are titration viscometric measurements upon both low and high molecular weight DNA. It was found that the DNA contour length increases linearly with r by approximately 0. 34 nm per bound drug molecule. The comparatively very high DNA stiffening effect measured in solution is understandable as a result of helix clamping by at least two anthracycline groups of sufficient long distance. The variation of gamma on DNA interaction with different anthracycline derivatives find their explanation in terms of different values of the mismatch to in-register binding prior to complex formation. From an <b>analogous</b> <b>interpretation</b> of viscosity measurements by Arcamone and coworkers upon high molecular weight DNA with many anthracycline derivatives it can be concluded that DNA interaction by both amino sugar and 9 -acetyl group are responsible for the generation of strong anthracycline binding mediated DNA stiffening effects in solution.

40|$|The Maslov {{index of}} triples of Lagrangean subspaces of a {{symplectic}} space over a local field F is {{considered in the}} book of G. Lion and M. Vergne [4]. The authors use the Maslov index to construct a central extension of Sp(2 n, F) by the Witt group WF of the field F. The cocycle of this extension determines the cocycle of the Weil representation of Sp(2 n, F). In the present work we introduce a generalised Maslov index associated to triples of non-zero vectors in a plane. It takes values in a certain non-commutative group N ̃, which contains K 2 (F) as a subgroup. The generalised Maslov index can be reduced to this subgroup, giving rise to a central extension of SL(2, F) by K 2 (F) (the field F is arbitrary). The cocycle of this extension coincides with Matsumoto’s cocycle ([1], [6]). The Witt group (more precisely, its quotient) should be regarded as a “reduction of the group N ̃ (mod 2) ”.

Inspired by scholarship on allegorical and <b>analogous</b> <b>interpretations</b> of 1950 s- 60 s ancient world epics, I explore how the current cycle engages with the American socio-political landscape in the wake of 9 / 11, with particular emphasis on the War on Terror and ensuing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. I chart the genre’s evolution in relation to the combat film, and examine how the current cycle of ancient world epics integrates the tropes of other genres into its portrayal of warfare, invasion, occupation and imperialism. Within this context, I explore the recurrent motif of the father-son dynamic, and assess how its use in combat films corresponds to that in ancient world epics. I also discuss how this motif was employed in 1980 s Vietnam War films, and what its use in these modern epics suggests about the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Furthermore, I discuss the use of the unreliable narrator to engage with wider debates on the value of historical films compared to written history. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the ancient world epic is a malleable construct with which filmmakers can engage with the present while depicting the past. I build on existing studies of the ancient world in cinema, contributing new understanding of the current cycle’s relationship to its predecessors, to other genres, and to post- 9 / 11 American society. In so doing this thesis contributes to notions of film as art, as industry, and as history, and how they intersect in cinematic depictions of the ancient world...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the micromechanical properties of various structural components in asphalt using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The focus of the study was based on nano-indentation experiments performed within a micro-grid of asphalt phases in order to determine micromechanical properties such as stiffness, adhesion and elastic/plastic behavior. The change in microstructure and micromechanical behavior due to oxidative aging of the asphalt was also a primary focus of the study. The experiment was performed with careful consideration of AFM artifacts, which can occur due to factors such as geometry of the cantilever tip, hysteresis, filtering methods and acoustic vibrations. The materials used in this study included asphalts AAB, AAD and ABD from the Materials Reference Library (MRL) of the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP), chosen due to variations in crude source, chemical composition and elemental analysis for each asphalt type. The analysis of nano-indentation creep measurements corresponding to phase-separated regions ultimately revealed heterogeneous domains in asphalt with different mechanical properties, and oxidative aging was found to induce substantial microstructural change within these domains, including variations in phase structure, phase properties and phase distribution. The form and extent of these changes, however, were different for each asphalt studied. Data analysis and information collected during this study were used for comparisons to existing models and asphalt data, which validated results and established correlations to earlier, related studies. From these comparisons, it was found that data parallels followed expected trends; furthermore, <b>analogous</b> <b>interpretations</b> and distinctions were made between results from this study and the micellar and microstructural models of asphalt.

One is for restriction of a representation of U(n) to the rotation group SO(n) when the given representation τλ of U(n) has nonnegative highest weight λ of depth ⩽n/ 2. It says that the multiplicity in τλ|SO(n) of an irreducible representation of SO(n) of highest weight ν is the sum over μ of the multiplicities of τλ in the U(n) tensor product τμ⊗τν, the allowable μ's being all even nonnegative highest weights for U(n). Littlewood's proof is character-theoretic. The present paper gives a geometric interpretation of this theorem involving the tensor products τμ⊗τν explicitly.
