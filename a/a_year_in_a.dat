5|$|This tit-tyrant defends its {{territory}} only against other tit-tyrants and, {{except for the}} southernmost population, is non-migratory. The tufted tit-tyrant feeds mainly {{on a variety of}} insects that it hunts on or from small shrubs, typically by perch gleaning. It normally hunts in pairs. The breeding season varies for this bird depending on its geographical location. Two to three eggs are normally laid twice <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cup-shaped nest made of root fibers, grasses, and lichens and lined with small feathers. The tufted tit-tyrant is listed as a species of least concern due to its large range and population.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{influence}} of a rise in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few ovarian follicles are stimulated. These follicles, which were present at birth and have been developing {{for the better part of}} <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> process known as folliculogenesis, compete with each other for dominance. Under {{the influence}} of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary, or Graafian, follicle, and it contains the ovum.|$|E

25|$|As {{reported}} in David Kushner's Masters of Doom, when Carmack was 14, {{he broke into}} a school to help {{a group of children}} steal Apple II computers.

However, an overweight accomplice struggled to get through the hole, and opened the window, setting off a silent alarm and alerting police. Carmack was arrested, and sent for psychiatric evaluation (the report mentions 'no empathy for other human beings' and describes Carmack as 'a brain on legs'). Carmack was then sentenced to <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> juvenile home.|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of détente, on March 11, 1974, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar arrived in Moscow for three days of sales presentations and demonstrations. The TriStar matched the Il-86 in size and {{performance}} and had development potential. Negotiations to buy 30 TriStars of the L-1011-385-250 version and licence-produce up to 100 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new factory employing 80,000 people continued until mid-1976. Any residual will to export TriStars was scotched when US President Jimmy Carter made human rights a US foreign policy factor. TriStar exports would have needed Coordinating Committee clearance: the type embodied advanced technology banned from potential enemies. In 1978, the US Department of Commerce vetoed export of 12 General Electric CF6-50 engines ordered by the USSR for planned long-range Il-86s.|$|E
25|$|In United's next match, {{home cooking}} {{seemed to make}} all the difference, as the team won 3–2 on their return to RFK for United's first home match in 5 weeks. Playing at home in front of over 19,000 fans was {{probably}} a boost to the team, but an even bigger boost might have been the sight of the team's new striker tandem of Espindola and Saborio. The game started horribly for the home side as the Philadelphia Union scored in the first and fourth minute to take what might have seemed a commanding 2–0 lead. United began to claw their way back into the game as Saborio scored on his United debut, with a 37th minute volley of a Korb cross. The game was tied midway through the second half when Nick DeLeon finished a rebound of an Espindola shot. D.C. United finally went ahead on an Espindola header, with Chris Korb getting his second assist of the match. DeLeon's goal was his first in over <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> regular season match.|$|E

25|$|La Guardia's sister, Gemma La Guardia Gluck (1881–1962), and brother-in-law, Herman Gluck (a Hungarian Jew {{whom she}} met while {{teaching}} English in Europe), {{were living in}} Hungary and were arrested by the Gestapo on June 7, 1944, when the Nazis took control of Budapest. Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler knew that Gemma was La Guardia's sister and ordered her to be held as a political prisoner. She and Herman Gluck were deported to Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, where he died, as Gemma learned from reading a newspaper account a year after her own release. She was transferred from Mauthausen to the notorious women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück, located some fifty miles from Berlin, where unbeknownst to Gemma at the time, her daughter Yolanda (whose husband also died in the camps) and baby grandson were also held for <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate barracks.

25|$|Schooling came to her, {{as it was}} apt {{to come to a}} girl of her period, {{intermittently}} and in variety.

C. A.” It was at Middlebury, in a one-story school house on Pleasant Street ,that she began the study of Latin, the subject of all others most useful in her adult life, as she declared. There, too, under Father Merrill, she wrote on the blackboard the list of English kings from Julius Caesar to William the Fourth, without a blunder. The feat was recalled by President John M. Thomas when in 1910 he conferred on her the degree of Doctor of Letters from Middlebury College, an honor which with characteristic modesty she accepted as a tribute to the women of her generation.|$|E
