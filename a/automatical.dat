50|$|The {{history of}} the Belgium {{national}} football team officially dates back to their first international in 1904. The Royal Belgian Football Association, which governs the team, co-founded the international governing bodies FIFA (in 1910) and UEFA (in 1954). As of October 2015, Belgium qualified for 12 FIFA World Cups and 5 UEFA European Championships (including an <b>automatical</b> qualification as co-hosts in 2000). In the periods 1920-1938 and 1970-2002 Belgium participated in many international tournaments, including three Olympic football tournaments in the 1920s. So far, the national side is considered to have had two golden generations: one in the 1980s and early 1990s, and one since the early 2010s.|$|E
5000|$|MS-DOS 7 is a {{computer}} Operative system which never has been separately released by its inventors Microsoft, but which is the basic (real mode) of Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows 98SE (as version 7.1, but the difference between version 7 and 7.1 are tiny). A major difference towards earlier versions of MS-DOS however, is the usage of the MSDOS.SYS file. In version 7 isn't this file a binary one, but a pure setting file. Anyone who wants the older boot style (where the booting process ends with a DOS-prompt, and which requires [...] "WIN" [...] to be typed at the prompt in order for Windows to start) could keep on using that same style, by just setting BootGUI=0 in the MSDOS.SYS-file. Otherwise does Windows naturally start up [...] "by it self", which {{was a very important}} issue at the time when Microsoft released Windows 95. But this was in reality only an <b>automatical</b> call for the file WIN.COM, the Windows starting file. So, also Windows 95 and 98 are both highly depending of a Real mode system, although MS-DOS 7 possibly is more [...] "hidden" [...] than earlier versions of MS-DOS. This is also true for Windows Millenium Edition, but [...] "ME" [...] refuses users to use Real mode. [...] Also the paths for (a plausible but actually not necessary) Windows directory and Boot directory is to be set in this new version of the MSDOS.SYS-file. Whilst IO.SYS (although binary different) remained as the initial executive startup file which BIOS booting routines fires up, if located correctly. Also the COMMAND.COM file keeps handle the command prompt. The typical DOS setting files CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT essentially retained its functions from earlier versions of MS-DOS (although memory allocation was no longer needed).|$|E
40|$|Introduction We {{describe}} {{a method for}} the <b>automatical</b> registration of transversal MRI-head-volumes.

This research was part of the Cyclops-Project 1 at the Artificial Intelligence Institute of the University of Kaiserslautern. The aim of the Cyclops-System [VW 96] is to provide a software workbench for the development of knowledgebased image understanding applications, particularly in the field of analysis of MRI-images.
