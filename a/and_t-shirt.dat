25|$|Within a few years, the {{campaign}} had gotten all five remaining Catskill fire towers {{listed on the}} Forest Fire Lookout Association's Historic Lookout Register and later the NRHP. State grants matched by money raised through local efforts such as bake sales, dances, fundraising drives, raffling of a quilt <b>and</b> <b>T-shirt</b> sales raised enough money to begin restoring the tower and cabin in 1998. Volunteers from the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference extended the path from the tower to the spring into a trail that would remain within state land down the mountain's never-logged northwestern slope to a new trailhead, avoiding the closed road. When all these efforts were complete, in 2000, the Red Hill tower became {{the first of the}} restored Catskill fire towers to be reopened to the public.|$|E

Saying that [...] "just as Madonna made bras a public garment in the 1980s, Ms. Lewinsky, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears transformed women's panties into a provocative garment intended for public display", the New York Times claimed that the thong, with straps worn high over the hips and exposed by fashionable low-rise jeans and [...] "Juicy Couture" [...] sweat pants, had become a public icon.|$|E

He found a traditional kampung house on stilts in Kampung Tawakal, a tiny village {{with a population of}} less than 100. Located about 10km away from the North-South Expressway near the Kempas exit, {{it is almost impossible to}} locate for those not familiar with the area. The Singaporean terrorist, who captured world attention when he escaped from the republic's maximum security Whitley Detention Centre in February last year, could barely put up a fight in his shorts <b>and</b> <b>T-shirt</b> when caught during a dawn raid in April. At 6am, about 30 armed policemen surrounded the kampung house and ordered Mas Selamat to come out. Police broke through two doors and rushed in when he refused to surrender. He was arrested together with two others, Abdul Matin and Johar Hassan, by a PGK and police Special Branch officers following intelligence sharing with the police forces of Indonesia and Singapore.

2500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Good for You" [...] {{was directed by}} Sophie Muller. In the video, Gomez wanted to represent her journey to womanhood and to promote female empowerment — which she felt strongly about and wanted to depict in a raw and vulnerable way. With the clip, she wanted to prove that young women should not be self-conscious of their sex appeal or be obliged to wear lingerie to feel attractive. [...] "I feel like people here, especially guys are like, 'Ah, lingerie and sexy.' I think being sexy {{as a young woman}} or girl, is not caring what other people think, wearing like casual things, feeling sexy". The singer felt it was important to collaborate with a female director as a means of female empowerment and wanted the visual to be raw and vulnerable. She was also drawn to jeans <b>and</b> <b>T-shirt</b> attire and believed it would prove to women that they need not dress in lingerie to feel attractive. She chose the video to be specifically about her, absent of a love interest or men, to reflect the song's meaning of female self-empowerment. She later said Muller [...] "created a beautiful and intimate visual representation" [...] of [...] "Good for You". Speaking of the music video's theme, Gomez stated, [...] "It's very jeans and a T-shirt, moments where a woman is deep in thought, or in a moment where she's in this crazy little rage. It just captures real things that women do. There {{are a lot of things}} that women do that are sexy that aren't just the typical, cheap way of being sexy." ...|$|E
