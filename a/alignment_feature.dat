40|$|Abstract—Face {{recognition}} {{systems for}} uncontrolled environ-ments often work through an <b>alignment,</b> <b>feature</b> extraction, and recognition pipeline. Effective alignment of faces is thus crucial {{as can be}} an entry point {{in the process and}} poor alignments can greatly affect recognition performance. The task of alignment is particularly difficult when a face comes from highly uncon-strained environments or so called faces in the wild. A lot of recent research activity has focused on faces in the wild and even simple similarity or affine transformations have proven both effective and essential to achieving state of the art performance. In this paper we explore a straightforward, fast and effective approach to aligning faces based on detecting facial landmarks using Haar-like image features and a cascade of boosted classifiers. Our approach is reminiscent of widely used face detection approaches, but focused on much more detailed features of a face such eye centres, the nose tip and corners of the mouth. This process generates multiple candidates for each landmark and we present a fast and effective filtering strategy allowing us to find sets of landmarks that are consistent. Our experiments show that this approach can outperform contemporary methods and easily fits into popular processing pipelines for faces in the wild. I...|$|E
40|$|Face {{recognition}} is a rapidly advancing research topic {{due to the}} large number of applications that can benefit from it. Face recognition consists of determining whether a known face is present in an image and is typically composed of four distinct steps. These steps are face detection, face <b>alignment,</b> <b>feature</b> extraction, and face classification [1]. The leading application for face {{recognition is}} video surveillance. The majority of current research in face recognition has focused on determining if a face is present in an image, and if so, which subject in a known database is the closest match. This Thesis deals with face matching, which is a subset of face recognition, focusing on face identification, yet it is an area where little research has been done. The objective of face matching is to determine, in real-time, the degree of confidence to which a live subject matches a facial image. Applications for face matching include video surveillance, determination of identification credentials, computer-human interfaces, and communications security. The method proposed here employs principal component analysis [16] to create a method of face matching which is both computationally efficient and accurate. This method is integrated into a real time system that is based upon a two camera setup. It is able to scan the room, detect faces, and zoom in for a high quality capture of the facial features. The image capture is used in a face matching process to determine if the person found is the desired target. The performance of the system is analyzed based upon the matching accuracy for 10 unique subjects...|$|E

30|$|Face {{recognition}} {{became the}} most sought-after research area due to its applications in surveillance systems, law enforcement applications, and access control and extensive work {{has been reported in}} the literature in the last decade [1]. The process of face recognition refers to identifying the person by comparing some features of a new person (input sample) with the known persons in the database. Face recognition pipeline consists of four main phases: face region detection, <b>alignment,</b> <b>feature</b> extraction, and classification [2] where the most crucial phase is feature extraction. Hand-crafted features have achieved reasonable results for constrained environments [3 – 5]. However, the recognition of unconstrained face images is an evolving and challenging field {{in the context of the}} real-world issues such as varying poses, expressions, illumination, and quality of images [6]. Many researchers tried different approaches for improving the recognition accuracy of unconstrained facial images [7] using different classification techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) [8], stochastic modeling [9], neural networks [10] and ensemble classifiers [11]. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown excellent results in face recognition by discovering intricate features in large datasets using the backpropagation algorithm [2, 12 – 15]. The DCNN-based models use softmax for quantifying model confidence of a class for an input face image in order to make a decision. However, the softmax probabilities are not a true representation of model confidence and often misleading in feature space that cannot be represented with available training examples [16]. In this research, we observe (an example is shown in Fig.  5) that such a scenario happens in borderline cases (i.e., faces with smaller intra-class variations). The primary goal of this paper is to improve the efficacy of face recognition systems by dealing with false positives through employing model uncertainty. The proposed study highlights the advantage of Bayesian deep convolutional neural networks (B-DCNN) over DCNN for robust recognition of facial images particularly in cases where intra-class variations are low.|$|E
40|$|The dengue virus (DENV) genome encodes 10 {{different}} genes {{including the}} NS 3 gene, {{which has a}} protease and helicase domain used in virus replication. This domain is a potential target for antiviral agents against dengue. Due to a high mutation rate, DENV is classified into four major serotypes (DENV 1 –DENV 4). This {{study was designed to}} perform conservancy analysis of all four serotypes by drawing a consensus sequence for each sero-type and then drawing a global consensus sequence to study conserved residues in all four serotypes. A total of 127 NS 3 sequences belonging to all four serotypes were retrieved and aligned using multiple <b>alignment</b> <b>feature</b> of CLC Workbench and were subjected to phylogenetic tree construction. Conservancy analysis of NS 3 revealed conserved peptides with active site residues that can be important in developing antiviral agents against dengue virus. Among conserved residues, residues G 142, Ser 144, and G 145 (catalytic pocket residues), A 219, D 220, and D 221 (divalent cations binding residues), and His 56, Asp 79, Ser 144, 146 were highly conserved among all the se-rotypes. Residues from L 138 to L 149 and from L 226 to L 245 were also considerably conserved in all serotypes, while lysine 141 mutated to serine in serotype 3. A total of 14 peptides from the conserved regions of DENV NS 3 protein were identified, which may be helpful to develop peptide inhibitors. The DENV NS 3 phylogenetic tree showed the evolutionary relationship among all four serotypes, and all serotypes of dengue were found to have evolved from the dengue 4 serotype. Because of its high variability, DENV has become a global health con-cern. It is important to study residues that are present in protease, helicase, the catalytic pocket Mg 2 + binding site, and the AAA domain.

40|$|Alignment {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} issues in optoelectronics packaging. A slight offset in any direction will affect the performance of the photonic devices. Nowadays passive alignment of optical fibers is attracting more attention due to its low manufacturing cost and short processing time when compared with active alignment. The position of the optical fiber in passive alignment is defined by the geometry of a V-groove. The epoxy is usually dispensed in a glob-top manner. However, the optical fiber may be lifted up due to the buoyancy effect. An additional cover plate is usually required to press the fiber against the wall of the V-groove. Although the fibers can be well aligned by the aforementioned method, the applied stress may deform the fibers or damage the cover plate, leading to subsequent reliability issues. In this study, a new method of dispensing epoxy with self-alignment capability is introduced. An innovative design of V-grooves on a silicon optical bench (SiOB) is developed. A "reservoir" is placed right next to the V-groove. The purpose of this reservoir is to let the epoxy flow into the gap between the optical fiber and the bottom of the V-groove. The excess epoxy may be drained away via the "canal". The reservoir/canal feature is patterned and etched together with the V-grooves so that there is no additional cost and time for fabricating the SiOB. It is observed that, if an appropriate amount of epoxy is flowing in the gap between the optical fiber and the V-groove, the optical fiber will not be lifted up by the buoyancy of the epoxy. On the contrary, the surface tension of running epoxy can pull down the fiber for passive alignment. With this new method, the optical fiber with greater than 60 μm of initial misalignment can be aligned with the centre of the V-groove within 0. 5 μm of accuracy. During the course of the present research, the wet etching techniques on silicon are also studied. The effects of various etching parameters are investigated and some critical issues are identified. Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSEL) are wildly used as light sources in various optoelectronic applications. As VCSELs are surface emitting devices, they are relatively difficult to be packaged with a silicon optical bench (SiOB). In this study, a new package structure with a chip-on-chip 3 D optical interconnect feature is developed. The package consists of a SiOB and a flip chip mirror carrier. The light beam is deflected by two pairs of mirrors on both the SiOB and the flip chip mirror carrier. The optical path is coupled from one optical fiber to another through an "overpass" type of 3 D interconnect. The flip chip mirror carrier is self-aligned during the reflow of flip chip solder joints. Furthermore, the newly developed V-groove passive <b>alignment</b> <b>feature</b> is also integrated with the SiOB. A prototype with the aforementioned configuration is fabricated in this study for illustration purpose. In practice, the flip chip mirror carrier may be replaced by other devices such as VCSELs and photo detectors...|$|E
