500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically. When speaking about Lennon, Turner said; [...] "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I {{really wanted to be}} able to write an [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] type song, and I found it very difficult. You listen to that <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely had a knack for that".|$|E
500|$|A {{critic of}} the Beatles' output {{immediately}} post-Sgt. Pepper, Ian MacDonald found [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] "as unfocused and monotonous {{as most of the}} group's output of this period", adding that the song [...] "numbingly fails to transcend the weary boredom that inspired it". Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot considered it to be [...] "one of [...] least-memorable Beatles tracks … a song essentially about boredom – <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> it". Similarly unimpressed with Magical Mystery Tour, Tim Riley describes [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] as a song that [...] "goes nowhere tiresomely", with a vocal that [...] "sounds as tired and droning" [...] as the musical accompaniment.|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when I was growing up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. And the same thing is happening now, where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E

6000|$|Then {{the door}} of Farmer Brown's house opened, and out stepped Farmer Brown's boy {{and looked up at}} Tommy Tit, and the look in his eyes was gentle and good to see.

500|$|Based on 146 {{individual}} year-end top ten lists {{compiled by}} Metacritic, Yeezus {{was the most}} critically acclaimed album of 2013, appearing on 61 lists and being named first on 18 of them. In October 2013, Complex named Yeezus the sixth best hip hop album {{of the last five}} years. Yeezus was rated as album of the year by nine publications. Spin named it the best album of 2013, writing, [...] "Yeezus was a thorny tangram puzzle of boxy headbanger blats that exemplified a year of equally stripped-down, basal pleasures." [...] The A.V. Club named it the best album of 2013 saying [...] "It’s magnificent, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> absolutely nothing else." [...] Rolling Stone named it the second best album of 2013, comparing it in concept to Reed's polarizing 1975 album Metal Machine Music: [...] "No wonder the late, great Lou Reed embraced Yeezus, since it's basically the Metal Machine Music concept translated into futuristic hip-hop, all industrial overload and hypertense egomania and hostile vibes." [...] Exclaim! also named it the hip hop album of the year. NME named it the second best album of the year calling it [...] "his most sonically challenging album to date." [...] Stereogum, TIME and Complex also named Yeezus the best album of 2013. It was also nominated in two categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards including for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for [...] "New Slaves". West responded unfavorably to this due to not receiving more nominations. He then addressed the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at one of his concerts and referred to it as patronizing.|$|E
2500|$|In a five-star review, Rolling Stone critic David Fricke {{wrote that}} Sea Change was [...] "the best album Beck has ever made, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> he's paid dearly for the achievement." [...] Rolling Stone {{went on to}} name it the best album of 2002; the next year, the album was ranked number 436 on the magazine's list of the 500 {{greatest}} albums of all time. It was ranked number 17 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 best albums of the 2000s.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, Kevin P. Sullivan of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} episode a C rating, stating [...] "there was the unshakable sense that {{something}} was off — like we’re in an invasion movie and are starting to suspect that our friend has been body-snatched. It looks like Fargo, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Fargo. But is that really Fargo in there? [...] All of the pieces are here for a season of Fargo, but there’s no heart. The show still looks like our friend, but there’s no life in its eyes." ...|$|E

5000|$|Dave Grohl {{commented on}} the song, saying [...] "For this song, it was a working title that stuck, because that was a song that we had demoed <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> this really bright, poppy, late '80s R.E.M. song {{that would have been}} off their 'Green' or {{something}} like that." [...] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine says the song has a riff as nimble as those on Foo Fighters' debut album.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} that I cannot tell?" [...] she continued. [...] "Didn't I see you turn the corner there, didn't I hear your step three flights down? Sometimes I have heard it come, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> {{something}} leaden beating time {{to the music of}} despair. And to-night you tripped up like a boy home for the holidays. You are going out to-night, Arnold." ...|$|E

Cavallooro (I stick at his very name to start with, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> the chorus to a comic song) is so {{necessary}} to you, that I don't like {{the thought of}} taking him away. More than that, there's no saying when we may come home again; and it would never do to take him away for an indefinite time. The cottage {{is not what it}} was. It only holds two little people less than it ever did, Pet, and her poor unfortunate maid Tattycoram; but it seems empty now. Once out of it, there's no knowing when we may come back to it. No, Arthur, I'll be pulled through by Mother.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Wired {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{when it was}} released. In Rolling Stone, the reviewer cited it {{as being}} full of [...] "fire and imagination". However, Robert Christgau faulted it as technically proficient but soulless, calling it [...] "mindless trickery". Engineer Peter Henderson later said of the album, [...] "I listened to that {{a few years later}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> had been recorded direct to cassette. I don't think it was one of my finer moments." ...|$|R

500|$|While {{recording}} her demo album, Swift {{worked with}} demo producer Nathan Chapman, whom she {{met in a}} little shed behind a publishing company she was at. Swift said, [...] "I'd always {{go in there and}} play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a record. We did this for a period of a year to two years before I got my record deal." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following his {{previous}} release, Afraid of Ghosts, an emotional album recorded {{after the loss}} of his father, Stay Gold presents a much more upbeat and optimistic outlook, with Walker saying [...] "I spilled it all out on Afraid of Ghosts <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was a heavy subject.

So I started writing about all that, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the template should be more of a celebration, as far as the music goes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Entertainment Weekly {{states that}} the band's sound hasn't changed much [...] "with the times" [...] with [...] "Five of Everything", <b>and</b> that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> could have been on their self-titled album.|$|R

5000|$|Baseball outfielder Torii Hunter {{brought up}} another obstacle: [...] "Once {{you get into}} the {{financial}} stuff, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Japanese, guys are just like, 'I ain't going back.'

5000|$|Vern {{had called}} over to Hank Cochran's house one day during a Nashville Tennessee {{thunderstorm}} and asked [...] "Is it raining {{at your house}} like it is raining at mine".

5000|$|Although Jorge Garcia {{had been}} tapped {{to play the}} Giant for only one episode, the {{producers}} decided to bring Garcia back in a recurring status after he wrapped up production on this episode: [...] "Yeah, we’ve talked {{about it for a}} while, whenever I’d run into them.

5000|$|Another {{frequent}} accompanist was {{the tenor}} saxophonist Lester Young, {{who had been}} a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom Holiday had a special rapport.

Some time I'd sit down and listen to 'em myself, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> two of the same voices, if you don't be careful, you know, or the same mind, or something like that."

The hunter comes to the moose, and the moose knocks out the hunter with the caller, and does the Tarzan call.|$|E
5000|$|Britt Julious of Pitchfork {{gave the}} album a 7.4 out of 10, {{describing}} it as [...] "a {{testament to the}} strength of traditional music composition: simple guitars, slinky bass lines, and sophisticated songwriting." [...] Lanre Bakare of The Guardian gave the album 4 stars out of 5, writing, [...] "Woon might have been expected to return with a dancefloor-focused second album, but instead he's taken the soul road, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a brilliant statement of intent." ...|$|E
5000|$|On June 22, 1998, Staley made a {{phone call}} to radio program Rockline and gave a rare {{interview}} while Jerry Cantrell was promoting his first solo album, Boggy Depot.

6000|$|... 'Now, I {{should be}} loth,' said Mr Wegg, {{with an air}} of patient injury, 'to think so ill of him as to suppose him capable of coming at this time of night. <b>And</b> yet <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> him.' ...|$|R

The best example was when we wrote [...] "Cuts Like A Knife," [...] which was just literally a mumble.
