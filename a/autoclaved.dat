5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and <b>autoclaved.</b> In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then <b>autoclaved</b> to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
2500|$|The endospores {{of certain}} types of (typically non-pathogenic) {{bacteria}} are used as probes to verify that an <b>autoclaved</b> item has been rendered truly sterile: a small capsule containing the spores is put into the autoclave with the items; after the cycle {{the content of the}} capsule is cultured to check if anything will grow from it. [...] If nothing will grow, then the spores were destroyed and the sterilization was successful.|$|E

[...] Many adjuncts are single use, though if they are multi use, after use of the adjunct, the mask must be cleaned and <b>autoclaved</b> and the filter replaced.

2500|$|The Mk VII was {{different}} from earlier [...]303 bullet designs or spitzer projectiles in general. Although {{it appears to be}} a conventional spitzer-shape full metal jacket bullet, this appearance is deceptive: its designers made the front third of the interior of the Mk 7 bullets out of aluminium (from Canada) or tenite (cellulosic plastic), wood pulp or compressed paper, instead of lead and they were <b>autoclaved</b> to prevent wound infection. This lighter nose shifted the centre of gravity of the bullet towards the rear, making it tail heavy. Although the bullet was stable in flight due to the gyroscopic forces imposed on it by the rifling of the barrel, it behaved very differently upon hitting the target. As soon as the bullet hit the target and decelerated, its heavier lead base caused it to pitch violently and deform, thereby inflicting more severe gunshot wounds than a standard single-core spitzer design. In spite of this, the Mk VII bullet was legal due to the full metal jacket used according to the terms of the Hague Convention.|$|E

50|$|In the {{production}} of composite aerospace and aircraft components, <b>autoclave</b> curing has traditionally been used to achieve the desired fiber content (resin-to-fiber ratio) {{and the absence of}} resin voids to produce light weight and strong components. <b>Autoclave</b> curing achieves this by placing the part under vacuum in an <b>autoclave</b> and then pressurizing the <b>autoclave</b> during the heated cure cycle. The high pressure on the part (within the pressurized <b>autoclave)</b> helps to minimize resin voids and to achieve the desired resin/fiber ratio.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} design {{optimization}} of brick-lined <b>autoclaves</b> to reduce wall thickness without compromising <b>autoclave</b> integrity. The use of acid resistant, brick lined, horizontal, <b>autoclaves</b> {{is common for}} hydrometallurgical processing within the mining industry. To prevent corrosion of the carbon steel pressure boundary, <b>autoclaves</b> are often lined with an acid proof flexible membrane and high nickel alloy overlay localized at nozzle areas. A brick lining protects the membrane against high temperature and abrasive damage {{that would result in}} corrosion of the carbon steel pressure boundary. Because of stringent out-of-roundness and deflection requirements, <b>autoclave</b> designers are faced with the challenge of choosing the proper thickness and layout of the <b>autoclaves.</b> Common practice for satisfying stringent requirements is to design much thicker <b>autoclave</b> than what is required to satisfy pressure and temperature conditions. This paper provides a methodology for the design that utilizes stiffening rings for controlling out-of-roundness that results in thinner and lighter <b>autoclaves...</b>|$|R

40|$|Summary: Steam {{sterilization}} (<b>autoclaving)</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective methods for decontaminating biohazardous material. <b>Autoclaves</b> use saturated steam under high pressure to decontaminate infectious materials (i. e., cultures, cells, contaminated glassware, pipettes, etc.) and to sterilize media, lab ware and other items. Biohazardous material and full sharps containers generated within research laboratories are placed in Contaminated Materials Containers (CMCs) and treated at the hospital <b>autoclave.</b> However, some laboratories that generate biohazardous material may use local laboratory (or departmental) <b>autoclaves.</b> When using laboratory or departmental <b>autoclaves</b> to decontaminate biohazardous materials, the Principal Investigator (or Department Head) is responsible for meeting the following mandatory requirements: 1. Maintaining a log book in accordance with Section 4 a below. 2. <b>Autoclaving</b> for a minimum of 30 minutes (see Section 4 b) unless validation data demonstrates that less time is sufficient for decontamination. 3. Documenting proper validation techniques when decontaminating materials (see Section 8). The recommendations below serve as guidelines to help <b>autoclave</b> operators ensure a safe and effective process.

50|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>autoclaves</b> {{was a big}} step {{in the direction of}} widespread treatment of refuse, and so many functional forms of <b>autoclaves</b> are currently in operation at landfills and treatment centers around the world. Some common features of <b>autoclaves</b> that differentiate them from competing technologies are as follows. <b>Autoclaves</b> employ the moist-heat method to sterilize and deactivate refuse in a large pressure vessel where saturated steam is injected. The end product is completely sanitized and even previously bio-hazardous waste can be discarded in a normal municipal landfill. <b>Autoclaves</b> employ the same method of sterilization as converters, but do so using larger and more complex equipment that also has higher safety and energy consumption requirements. In a majority of cases, <b>autoclaves</b> are hub-and-spoke operations requiring regional treatment centers and a supply chain.|$|R

50|$|An often {{overlooked}} aspect of <b>autoclave</b> access is the rear end. In many instances, the best <b>autoclave</b> {{is that which}} has two doors. In the typical industrial <b>autoclave,</b> there is mechanical hardware in the rear, including the circulation fan drive. An <b>autoclave</b> with a rear door will cost more initially. Over its service life, however, it will cost less to maintain, largely because the easy accessibility of components inside will encourage their more frequent inspection. In any <b>autoclave,</b> as in any machine, all major and minor components should be accessible for inspection, repair, and replacement. Overlook this, and the owner will eventually regret it.|$|R
