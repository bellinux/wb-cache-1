5|$|In 1971 Matlock became Director of Soviet Affairs in the State Department. During Richard Nixon's presidency, {{a period}} known as détente, {{there was a}} {{reduction}} of Cold War tension. Matlock participated in the negotiation of arms control treaties and other bilateral <b>agreements.</b> <b>In</b> fact, he attended {{every one of the}} U.S.-Soviet summits for the 20-year period 1972–1991, {{with the exception of the}} 1979 Carter - Brezhnev summit.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> Spanish Sign Language (lengua de signos española - LSE) {{and provides}} a comprehensive description of the agreement mechanisms available to the language based on data collected from LSE signers from the Basque Country. This description {{makes it possible to}} compare <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> LSE with what has been described for other sign languages, and also to offer a cross-modal comparison of the phenomenon, that is, to compare <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> a signed language to <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> spoken languages. Underlying this comparison is the issue of whether what we call <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> sign languages is the same thing as what is called <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> spoken languages. The study provides a strong case that this spatial mechanism in LSE (i) is a type of agreement that is similar to what has been described for other sign languages, (ii) is comparable to <b>agreement</b> processes <b>in</b> spoken languages, and (iii) can be accounted for in syntactic terms. The thesis includes discussion of what the findings tell us about LSE, sign languages, and natural languages in general...|$|R
50|$|The King's idea of hosting all-party {{talks on}} Ireland had echoes in later {{negotiations}} {{that produced the}} power-sharing executive <b>in</b> the Sunningdale <b>Agreement</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s, and in the negotiations that produced the Belfast <b>Agreement</b> <b>in</b> the late 1990s.|$|R

5|$|Following the Qatari–Bahraini War in 1868, British representatives signed another {{agreement}} with the Al Khalifas. It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territory except to the United Kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without British consent. In return the British promised to protect Bahrain from all aggression by sea and to lend support in case of land attack. More importantly the British promised to support {{the rule of the}} Al Khalifa in Bahrain, securing its unstable position as rulers of the country. Other <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> 1880 and 1892 sealed the protectorate status of Bahrain to the British.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{characteristics}} of subject-verb <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> number in spoken and written French, two morphological systems that are very different. In particular, we investigate the impact of frequency of forms and morphological patterns in the input on the acquisition of number <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> monolingual and bilingual French-speaking children (n= 32). Our results demonstrate an almost perfect fit between the partial and heterogeneous nature of number <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> the spoken input and the errors found in the children’s spoken narratives. However, the influence of a highly systematic written number-agreement on the children’s written narratives is weak, mainly {{due to the lack of}} phonological cues of number <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> written French...|$|R

5|$|Hungary {{recognised}} Croatian independence on 15 January 1992 (with {{the rest}} of the European Economic Community member states), and established diplomatic relations with Croatia three days later. During the Croatian War of Independence, Croatia obtained arms from several countries (including Hungary), despite a United Nations-imposed arms embargo. As of December 2011, Hungary and Croatia have 96 treaties and <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> force regulating a wide range of activities and relations (including diplomatic, cultural, economic, energy, transport, education, minority and other issues). Furthermore, Hungary supported the Croatian NATO membership request and Croatian accession to the European Union.|$|E
5|$|In May 1996, about 200 {{soldiers}} of the Central African Republic mutinied in Bangui, demanding salary increases and the abdication of Ange-Félix Patassé. In the aftermath, the renegades plundered and killed more than 50 people. Following this, the French troops stationed in the country suppressed the rebellion and restored the dictatorial power. After being elected, President Patassé announced a national unity government in early 1997. The Patassé government, the opposition parties, and religious groups signed the Bangui <b>Agreements</b> <b>in</b> January 1997 which were a series of measures designed to reconcile competing political factions, reform and strengthen the economy. The same year, the rebel troops refused a military base in Bangui and in June a new revolt broke out.|$|E
5|$|That the negotiations, {{acceptance}} of the assignment and agreements and understandings in respect thereof were within the competence of the President may not be doubted. Governmental power over external affairs is not distributed, but is vested exclusively in the national government. And in respect of what was done here, the Executive had authority to speak as the sole organ of that government. The assignment and the <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> connection therewith did not, {{as in the case}} of treaties, as that term is used in the treaty making clause of the Constitution (article 2, 2), require the advice and consent of the Senate.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> law, an <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> {{principle}} is {{a stepping stone}} to a contract. Such agreements {{with regard to the}} principle are usually considered fair and equitable.

40|$|The legal {{provision}} of credit <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> syariah bank is Law No. 21 / 2008 on Syariah Banking, Law No. 72 / 1992 on Profit-Sharing Bank, the Indonesian Civil Codes, Law No. 10 / 1998 on the Amendment of Law No. 7 / 1992 on Banking, the Regulation of Bank Indonesia, and the Fatwa of National Syariah Council related to syariah banking, while the {{legal provision}} of credit <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> conventional bank {{is referred to}} Law No. 10 / 1998 on the Amendment of Law No. 7 / 1992 on Banking, and the Indonesian Civil Codes. The form of the clause of financing <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> syariah bank and credit <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> conventional bank is substantially similar because {{both of them are}} standard written agreement and both agreements contain the amount of money, the amount of interest (conventional bank) or share of revenue (syariah bank), method of payment, repayment period and collateral in the form of land documents dan the evidence of vehicle ownership. The financing agreement is not different from the credit <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> conventional bank because it refers to the Indonesian Civil Codes found in Book III on General Bonding. Therefore, the relationship between the <b>agreement</b> <b>in</b> syariah and conventional banks is close enough and subject to the same regulation of legislation...|$|R

5|$|The 2011 {{purchase}} of the company by 3G Capital led {{to a change in}} how the company interacts with its franchises. The new owners moved to settle any disagreements with its franchises while initiating a sale of the majority of corporate locations with the goal of becoming an exclusive franchisor. The company also entered into several new franchise agreements that will allow it to dramatically expand its presence in several new markets including the BRIC nations. Additionally the company moved to establish new master franchise <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> several regions while realigning its operations in several markets.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik ("Eastern Policy") {{at the end}} of the 1960s reduced tensions between the two German states. It led to a series of treaties and <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> the early 1970s, most significantly a treaty in which East and West Germany recognised each other's sovereignty and supported each other's applications for UN membership, although East Germans leaving for the West retained the right to claim a West German passport. Reunification remained a theoretical objective for West Germany, but in practice that objective was put aside by the West and abandoned entirely by the East. New crossing points were established and East German crossing regulations were slightly relaxed, although the fortifications were as rigorously maintained as ever.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Denmark was {{a member}} of the European Union (EU), while Sweden and Norway had applied and were {{awaiting}} referenda to determine membership. EU was working to deregulate the airline market from 1995, which could cause problems for the Scandinavian <b>agreements.</b> <b>In</b> preparation for this, Braathens SAFE started negotiations with Linjeflyg of Sweden and Maersk Air of Denmark to crate an alliance to compete with SAS. In particular, the three airlines wanted to capture the two million passengers that travelled between the three Scandinavian capitals: Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. Instead, SAS was given permission to purchase Linjeflyg in exchange for the Swedish airline market being deregulated from 1 July 1992. From 23 October 1992, the Norwegian Armed Forces stopped chartering aircraft and started using scheduled flights to fly 240,000 personnel annually. Since most of the transport was between Northern and Southern Norway, this gave reduced revenue for Braathens SAFE.|$|E

5|$|By 1994, {{the tram}} {{route to the}} new {{hospital}} appeared to have political support, but by 1996 local politicians instead wanted to use Gaustad Station and buses to serve the hospital. There also arose a disagreement between {{the city and the}} state as to who should be paying for the light rail line, should it should be built. Not until 1998 were the necessary political <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, line 4 was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsarken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built. On 20 August 2003, the Ring Line of the metro opened, and line 4 started to also serve Nydalen and Storo.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN Radio {{expanded}} its coverage by signing programming <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> 1998 with two subscription-only satellite radio systems: CD Radio (later renamed Sirius Satellite Radio) and General Motors' XM Satellite Radio, bringing {{the station to}} a nationwide audience in 2001. Temporarily for a year during the XM and Sirius merger in 2007 and 2008, it was not heard on Sirius, {{and it is not}} currently available on radios only compatible with the older Sirius system. The station was added to XM Radio Canada on April 1, 2007. The FM range of the radio station extends as far north as Hanover, Pennsylvania, south around 15 miles beyond Fredericksburg, Virginia, west to 5 miles east of Front Royal, Virginia and east to Cambridge, Maryland. C-SPAN offers three channels of programming for listeners within the FM signal radius with HD radios, using digital technology to multicast all three channels at 90.1 FM. The three channels offer different programming: WCSP-FM's usual programming is broadcast on 90.1 HD-1; 90.1 HD-2 simulcasts C-SPAN, broadcasting coverage of the House of Representatives plus other C-SPAN programming; 90.1 HD-3 simulcasts C-SPAN2, broadcasting coverage of the Senate and audio of Book TV.|$|E
5|$|Due to the FCC's {{limits on}} station {{ownership}} {{at the time}} (which prevented the common ownership of multiple radio stations), local marketing <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> radio, in which a smaller station would sell its entire airtime to a third-party in time-buy, were widespread between the 1970s and early 1990s. These alliances gave larger broadcasters a way to expand their reach, and smaller broadcasters a means of obtaining a stable stream of revenue. In 1992, the FCC began allowing broadcasting companies to own multiple radio stations in a single market. Following these changes, local marketing agreements largely fell out of favor for radio, as it was now possible for broadcasters to simply buy another station outright rather than lease it – consequentially triggering a wave of mass consolidation in the radio industry. However, broadcasters still used local marketing agreements to help transition acquired stations to their new owners.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1991 {{decision}} {{to build a}} new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered too far away to be a suitable transfer point. Forskningsparken would also serve {{the northern part of the}} Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, Line 4 of the metro was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsparken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny {{regarding the use of}} such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in the market, and then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|E
5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales <b>agreements</b> <b>in</b> violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E
