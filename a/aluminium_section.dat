30|$|In fact, such dynamic {{behaviours}} of extruded <b>aluminium</b> <b>section</b> {{is typical}} for stiffened panel structures, {{for which the}} dynamic response from a point load is global and uniform at low frequencies and tends to localize at higher frequencies where the point mobility increases substantially. Because {{of the differences in}} dominant vibro-acoustic characteristics at different frequency ranges for stiffened panel structures, different vibration and acoustic modelling approaches should be applied accordingly. In principle, the choice for appropriate techniques should follow the two criteria below: (1) the adopted technique should be able to effectively reflect the critical design changes for the vibro-acoustic performance of the product, and (2) the predicting procedure should be computationally robust and efficient.|$|E

Then in Sect.  3, the main principle and theoretical predicting procedures for a few of major hybrid techniques are recapitulated and compared, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Two recently developed hybrid models are particularly introduced in Sect.  4 for their great potentials on predicting the mid-frequency issues of stiffened panel structures.

The equipment installed in 2014 (TIDVG# 3) featured an absorbing core composed of different materials surrounded by a water-cooled copper jacket, which hold the UHV of the machine. An inspection of a previous equipment (TIDVG# 2) in 2013 revealed significant beam induced damage to the <b>aluminium</b> <b>section</b> of the dump, which required imposing operational limitations to minimise the risk of reproducing this phenomenon.

40|$|Aluminium tubular {{structural}} members may experience web crippling failure due to localize concentrated loads or reactions. This paper reports an experimental program on strengthening of high strength aluminium tubular {{structural members}} using externally bonded carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP). A {{series of tests}} on CFRP strengthened aluminium square and rectangular hollow sections subjected to web crippling are presented. The web crippling tests were conducted under two loading conditions of End-Two-Flange (ETF) and End-One-Flange (EOF). A total of 27 web crippling tests were conducted in this study. The investigation was mainly focused {{on the effects of}} web slenderness of aluminium tubular sections on CFRP strengthening against web crippling. The tests were performed on eight different sizes of square and rectangular hollow sections which covered a wide range of slenderness (flat portion of web depth-to-thickness) ratio from 6. 2 to 61. 8. Material properties of each <b>aluminium</b> <b>section</b> were obtained from tensile coupon tests. Most of the strengthened specimens were failed by debonding of CFRP plate from the aluminium tubes. Three main failure modes were observed in the tests, namely the adhesion, combination of adhesion and cohesion, and interlaminar failure of CFRP plate. The failure modes and the load-web deformation behaviour of the aluminium sections are also presented. It was found that the web crippling capacity of aluminium sections are significantly increased due to CFRP strengthening, especially for those sections with higher web slenderness ratio. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 7 th International Conference on Steel and Aluminium Structures (ICSAS 2011), Sarawak, Malaysia, 13 - 15 July 2011.

40|$|A new {{extraction}} {{channel is}} being built in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) Long Straight Section 4 (LSS 4) to transfer proton beams to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and also to the CERN Neutrino to Gran Sasso (CNGS) target. The beam is extracted in a fast mode during a single turn. For this purpose a protection of the MSE copper septum coil, {{in the form of}} a beam diluting element placed upstream, will be required to cope with the new failure modes associated with the fast extraction operation. The present analysis focuses on the thermo-mechanical behavior of the proposed TPSG 4 diluter element irradiated by a fast extracted beam (up to 4. 9 x 10 ^ 13 protons per 7. 2 mus pulse) from the SPS. The deposited energy densities, estimated from primary and secondary particle simulations using the high-energy particle transport code FLUKA, were converted to internal heat generation rates taken as a thermal load input for the finite-element engineering analyses code ANSYS. According to the time dependence of the extracted beam, the transient solutions were obtained for coupled heat transfer, structural deformation, and shock wave problems. The results are given for the space distribution and the time evolution of temperatures and stresses in the most critical parts of the TPSG 4 beam diluting element followed by the MSE copper septum coil. In the worst case of impact of the full LHC ultimate beam, the maximum temperatures remain safely below the melting point. However, the maximum equivalent stresses may slightly exceed the elastic limit in the <b>aluminium</b> <b>section</b> of the diluter. Also, the predicted maximum temperature rise in the MSE septum coil exceeds the design value...|$|E

A {{series of tests}} was performed on fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthening of aluminium tubular structural members subjected to End-Two-Flange and Interior-Two-Flange loading conditions. A total of 58 web crippling tests was conducted. The investigation was mainly focused {{on the effects of}} different adhesive and FRP for strengthening of <b>aluminium</b> tubular <b>sections</b> against web crippling. The influence of different widths of FRP plate strengthening against web crippling has been also investigated in this study.

The properties of adhesive and FRP have significant influence on the effectiveness of the strengthening. Most of the strengthened specimens were failed by debonding of FRP plates from the aluminium tubes. There are mainly four different failure modes observed in the tests, namely the adhesion, cohesion, combination of adhesion and cohesion, and interlaminar failure of FRP plate.

40|$|Aluminium {{members are}} used in {{structural}} applications due to their high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, attractive appearance, recyclability, ease of production and availability. Thin <b>aluminium</b> <b>sections</b> are susceptible to buckling at a relatively low stress and welding makes it even worse; the design stress i. e. 0. 2 % proof stress is almost halved {{in the vicinity of}} the heat affected zones (HAZs). Currently available design codes have their guidelines both for welded and non-welded aluminium columns, but the predictions for welded aluminium columns are often quite inconsistent. The current research exploits a newly developed strain based design approach the ‘Continuous Strength Method’ (CSM) to predict the behaviour of aluminium members with SHS and RHS cross-sections subjected to compression. A new design curve is proposed herein to predict the cross-sectional resistance in compression; this concept is further extended to propose a new Perry type buckling curve to predict the flexural buckling resistance of aluminium columns. A simplified technique is proposed to include the effect of heat affected zone (HAZ) in CSM formulations. The CSM predictions for aluminium columns are compared against those obtained using available guidelines proposed by the European, American and Australian/ New Zealand standards of aluminium structures.

40|$|The {{shielding}} gas {{is used to}} protect the finished weld {{from the effects of}} oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Although the weld metal properties are primarily controlled by the composition of the consumable,the {{shielding gas}} can influence the weld‘s strength, ductility, toughness and corrosion resistance. In general, for a given welding wire,the higher the oxidation potential of a shielding gas, the lower the strength and toughness of the weld. This occurs because the oxygen and carbon dioxide in the shielding gas increase the number of oxide inclusions and reduce the level of materials such as manganese and silicon in the weld metal. When welding thick <b>aluminium</b> <b>sections</b> with pure argon as the shielding gas, porosity, lack of penetration and fusion defects can occur. The addition of helium to the argon shielding gas can significantly reduce these defects. This is because the high thermal conductivity of helium results in more energy being transferred into the weld. This in turn produces a hotter weld pool, resulting in improved fusion and slower freezing times, allowing any trapped gas more time to escape. This paper deals with the detailed study of shielding gas used for aluminium welding. Key Words: Aluminium alloy, MIG/TIG welding,Shielding gas Aluminium may be welded by either gas or arc processes, but arc welding is more satisfactory as the area over which the heat is generated is smaller and the speed of welding can thus be increased.
