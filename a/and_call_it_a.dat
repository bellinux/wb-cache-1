500|$|Robert California (James Spader) confronts Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{about the}} number of mishaps and blunders made in the office, and gives him a firm {{directive}} to bring them to a stop. With no ideas on how to make this come about, Andy puts it in the hands of Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who devises a system to find mistakes made by employees in the office. He programs an [...] "efficiency motivator" [...] that will forward incriminating emails to California if they make five mistakes in one day, effectively causing them to lose their jobs. The rest of the office are unhappy with Dwight's system, <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> doomsday device. Despite their best efforts, the group manages to make five mistakes barely halfway through the first day with the system, and Dwight reveals that the emails will be automatically sent to California at 5:00 pm. Andy pleads with Dwight to deactivate the system, but Dwight refuses, belittles the rest of the office staff for being so careless, and retreats to Schrute Farms.|$|E

Turns out that wasn't the brightest idea she'd ever had - her jealous girlfriend Lydia finally polished her off good and proper." [...] Olly Riachards men's lifestyle magazine FHM commented on Sarah stating: [...] "the one who fell out of a plane and splatted all across the ground, leading to a really drawn out and really boring plotline" [...] Holy Soap opined that Batley [...] "livened up screens as lesbian temptress Sarah Barnes." [...] {{and that she had}} many [...] "major storylines". Digital Spy brand Sarah as, just a [...] "wannabe model". The Daily Mail have favoured Sarah's storyline with Zoe. They opined that Sarah has had a [...] "string of bad relationships with men", that Zoe and Sarah's kiss was an [...] "interesting turn" [...] <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> scandal, that [...] "heats and spices up" [...] Hollyoaks.

500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed." ...|$|E

500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray gave Justice League Dark #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray stated: [...] "While many {{events that}} run across {{multiple}} titles often slap a logo on an existing series <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> tie-in...Lemire ensures {{that his team}} are an integral part, [...] the team finally {{feel as though they}} are part of a wider DC universe. Indeed, in many ways, this appears to be the primary goal of “Trinity War”, in that it unites the often disparate strands of the New 52." [...] Joshua Yehl of IGN gave the issue a 7.0 out of 10, saying [...] "While the art and characters are done well, the overall plot of Trinity War leaves much to be desired." [...] However, he praised Jeff Lemire's character work, and felt that Mikel Janin's art was the [...] "cleanest and most consistent looking chapter of [...] "Trinity War" [...] thus far." [...] Comic Book Resources' Kelly Thompson gave the issue 2.5 stars out of 5, saying the issue [...] "gets devoured by the massive [...] "Trinity War" [...] and buckles under the weight" [...] adding that the debate seems more plot driven than character driven. Despite the criticism of the story, Thompson praised Janin's art saying, [...] "he does nearly the impossible and draws just about every single major character in the DCU perfectly." ...|$|E

2500|$|First, {{the oldest}} {{hypothesis}} suggests that baka originated as a Chinese literary [...] "allusion to a historical fool", the Qin Dynasty traitor Zhao Gao (d. 207 BCE). This etymology first {{appears in the}} (c.1548) Unbo irohashu 運歩色葉集 dictionary, which glosses baka 馬鹿 as meaning [...] "指鹿曰馬" [...] "point at a deer and say horse". Namely, the Chinese idiom zhi lu wei ma 指鹿為馬 (lit. [...] "point at a deer <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> horse", Japanese shika o sashite uma to nasu) meaning [...] "call a deer a horse; deliberate misrepresentation for ulterior purposes"; which refers to the (c. 109-91 BCE) Shiji Chinese historical account of Zhao Gao. Zhao was an infamous eunuch who served the first emperor Qin Shi Huang (r.246-221 BCE) and forced the second Qin Er Shi (r.210-207 BCE) to commit suicide. Zhao Gao was contemplating treason but was afraid the other officials would not heed his commands, {{so he decided to}} test them first. He brought a deer and presented it to the Second Emperor but called it a horse. The Second Emperor laughed and said, [...] "Is the chancellor perhaps mistaken, calling a deer a horse?" [...] Then the emperor questioned those around him. Some remained silent, while some, hoping to ingratiate themselves with Zhao Gao, said it was a horse, and others said it was a deer. Zhao Gao secretly arranged for all those who said it was a deer to be brought before the law. Thereafter the officials were all terrified of Zhao Gao.|$|E
