5|$|To derive a URI from a URI reference, {{software}} converts the URI {{reference to}} absolute form by merging {{it with a}} base URI according to a fixed algorithm. The system treats the URI reference as relative to the base URI, although {{in the case of}} an absolute reference, the base has no relevance. If the base URI includes <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> identifier, it is ignored during the merging process. If <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> identifier is present in the URI reference, it is preserved during the merging process.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary.

5|$|Further south, near Mount St. Helens, is {{a similar}} situation, where the St. Helens Fault Zone (SHZ) is {{believed}} to be the eastern edge of the Crescent Formation, but the pre-Cenozoic continental basement is near Mount Rainier.

5|$|Heinrich Kreutz {{studied the}} orbits of the three great comets, and {{developed}} {{the idea that the}} three comets were fragments of a much larger progenitor comet which had broken up at an earlier perihelion passage. The fragmentation of the Great Comet of 1882 itself demonstrated that this was plausible. It is now thought that the Great Comet of 1882 is <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> of X/1106 C1, and that Comet du Toit (C/1945 X1) and Comet Ikeya–Seki (C/1965 S1) are two of its sister fragments.|$|E

5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link is based on the interpretation of <b>a</b> <b>fragment</b> by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E
