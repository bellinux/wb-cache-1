40|$|The in situ recover {{method is}} {{becoming}} more and more attractive for oil companies. One of the technologies that are currently experiencing the most growth is Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD). An emerging technology In Situ Combustion has a strong potential to improve oil sands operation, since it requires less water and it is based on air injection into the reservoir. In order to quantify environmental consequences associated with switching from one of the technology to another, several simplified LCA studies with &# 147;cradle-to-industrial gate&# 148; basis were conducted. Based on the daily production of 40 000 barrels of bitumen, the total impact generated by the SAGD technology is 4800 tonnes of CO 2 equivalents, where the steam generation and other facility units contribute 65 % of the total impact. Diluent production and natural gas contribute respectively 15 % and 11 %. The import of electricity generates 8 % of the total impact to climate change. The total impact generated by the ISC technology at the production rate of 40 000 barrels per day is 4298 tonnes of CO 2, where the direct emissions (connected to the processes on-site) contribute 72 % of the total impact to climate change. Diluent&# 146;s production contributes 15 % of the total impact and production of compressed air by <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> <b>unit</b> is responsible for 10 % of the total impact to the climate change impact categories. Also at the comparison stage, the findings showed that though the oil recovery for ISC is 70 % and higher than for SAGD 53 %, there are some environmental impacts potentials associated with the production of <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> <b>unit,</b> for example, the impacts per daily production to human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity for SAGD are 370 tonnes of 1. 4 -DB eq., and 9. 8 tonnes of 1. 4 -DB eq. respectively; while for ISC the impacts associated with daily production to the same categories are 2280 tonnes of 1. 4 - DB eq. and 31. 5 tonnes of 1. 4 -DB eq. The improvement in the electricity production for SAGD processes by on-site generation resulted in emission reduction, but the total contribution to climate change was still higher, than for ISC. Though, the discrepancy narrowed by 3 %. </p...|$|E

40|$|About 95 % of the {{electricity}} consumed by <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> stations around the world, is transformed into thermal energy, which is making its considerable contribution to global warming. The present article dwells on the re-use (recovery) of energy expended for air compression. The article presents the energy analysis {{of the process of}} compressing air {{from the point of view}} of compressor drive energy conversion into heat energy. The temperature level of excess heat energy has been estimated in terms of a potential to find the ways of recovery of generated heat. It is shown that the temperature level formed by thermal energy depends on the degree of air compression and the number of stages of the compressor. Analysis of technical characteristics of modern equipment from leading manufacturers, as well as projects of the latest <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> stations have shown that there are two directions for the recovery of heat energy arising from the air compression:  Resolving technological problems of <b>compressor</b> <b>units.</b>  The use of the excess heat generation to meet the technology objectives of the enterprise. This article examines the schematic diagrams of <b>compressor</b> <b>units</b> to implement the idea of heat recovery compression to solve technological problems:  Heating of the air in the suction line during operation of the compressor station in winter conditions.  Using compression heat to regenerate the adsorbent in the dryer of compressed air. The article gives an equity assessment of considered solutions in the total amount of heat energy of compressor station. Presented in the present work, the analysis aims to outline the main vectors of technological solutions that reduce negative impacts of heat generation of compressor stations on the environment and creating the potential for reuse of energy, i. e. its recovery. </p...|$|R

In tropical countries which have 70 – 80 % RH year round, the quantity of defrost formation is significant while refrigeration systems are on. This defrost water is dripped on the compressor's shell, which in turn cools the compressor oil and hence reduces the friction losses and winding temperature of the motor. Once winding temperature is reduced the compressor's ampere rating is reduced which ultimately reduces the energy consumption of the compressor. For given conditions of refrigerator function, the compressor shell temperature and ampere rating of compressor are tabulated and investigated before and after compressor shell cooling.
