Data gained from behavioural research are the right tools to cure such a market failure in EU internal market law.

The main results indicate that gender does matter for the leaders in their work and in their leadership. The geriatric care is seen as a work for women which the men notice in their work as leaders. Men experienced that they more than woman were expected to make decisions and to do reprimands. Women's experiences were that {{it was hard to get}} acceptance in decision making.

Previously, I'd been put off the idea of jazz and singing together because there was certain style of doing that — very over the top, lots of vibrato —while I prefer something quite different, more natural. Then a few years later, when I did the Jazzpar, and they asked me to put together a contrasting project, the first thing I saw when I went to gigs in Copenhagen was a student jam session. There was this girl who just sang a standard beautifully and then sat down—and all these males improvised for about an hour, all taking turns to solo kind of competitively, while she sat there quietly, like in a trance. Then when they finished she just got up and sang the song again. Something about that amused me and I was impressed by it.
