5|$|After {{the storm}} was named, {{officials}} in Texas began making preparations for Don. The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston issued a level one alert for Don, <b>and</b> <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> began preparing for a possible evacuation. On July 27, oil companies throughout the western Gulf of Mexico began removing non-essential personnel from their rigs and platforms in preparation for Don. The next day, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko and Apache announced the evacuations {{of some of the}} oil facilities in the area, while Exxon-Mobil began preparing the Baytown Refinery for a possible storm strike. Several oil companies stopped oil production as a result of Don; by midday on July 28, 6.8% of oil production and 2.8% of natural gas production in the Gulf had been shut in ahead of the storm.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, it was the largest mall complex {{developed}} by CBL. In the first year, it was projected that the mall would employee 2,500 employees—instantly making it the largest employer in the city; this was expected to expand to 3,500 with the completion of the second phase. It was hoped it would generate $80 million in sales. In addition to helping to retain local shoppers who might otherwise travel the 2½ hours southeast to Houston for mall shopping, CBL <b>and</b> <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> expected the mall would draw shoppers from around the Brazos Valley. Before its opening, the city did not have a highly developed retail community. With the planned additions, then College Station city manager North Bardell said it was expected to generate $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, nearly equal to what the city collected in the previous fiscal year from all other sales. It would bring in another $120,000 in property taxes, a half-million in taxes for College Station Independent School District, and $1 million in electric bills. The increase in jobs was seen as good for the community, and the city hoped it would attract new civic groups to the area. Taking a year longer than originally planned, the expansion was completed in 1985.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, one of Independence Hall's {{exterior}} doors {{was replaced by}} glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed. When Congress enacted the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. In {{the early days of}} World War II, it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, <b>and</b> <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> considered moving the bell to Fort Knox, to be stored with the nation's gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when studies found that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. The bell was again tapped on D-Day, as well as in victory on V-E Day and V-J Day.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} quarter of 2006, Shelbourne Development issued two {{separate}} press releases regarding the construction and design of the spire. A November 2006 press release stated that construction of the Chicago Spire would begin in June 2007. In early December 2006, Shelbourne Development issued another press release stating that {{the design of the}} building had been revised. This included the removal of the hotel and the antenna mast, making the building consist solely of condominium units. The design change altered the twist to be consolidated towards the base of the building, which was also wider than the original plan. Additionally, the spire no longer tapered at the top, resulting in an increase in floor space and overall floor count. The revision also removed the separate parking structure from the original plan, instead incorporating underground parking into the spire itself. This first major redesign of the Chicago Spire was criticized by architectural critics <b>and</b> <b>city</b> <b>officials.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many honors were heaped {{upon him}} by {{citizens}} <b>and</b> <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> of the Empire, including Colonia Obsequens Iulia Pisana (Pisa), {{where it was}} decreed that proper rites must be observed by matrons to lament his passing. Temples, public baths, and shops shut their doors as women wept inconsolably. To commemorate his brief life, a cenotaph was erected on the Limyrus River in Lycia. Posthumously, the Senate voted honors for the young Caesars, and arranged for the golden spears and shields the boys had received on achieving the age of military service, to be hung in the Senate House. The caskets containing their ashes were stored in the Mausoleum of Augustus alongside those of their father Agrippa {{and other members of}} the imperial family.|$|E
25|$|The 1920s saw {{the opening}} of the Compton Airport. Compton Junior College was founded <b>and</b> <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> moved to a new City Hall on Alameda Street. On March 10, 1933, a {{destructive}} earthquake caused many casualties: schools were destroyed and there was major damage to the central business district. While it would eventually be home to a large black population, in 1930 there was only one black resident. In the late 1940s, middle class blacks began moving into the area, mostly on the west side. Compton grew quickly in the 1950s. One reason for this was Compton was close to Watts, where there was an established black community. The eastern side of the city was predominately white until the 1970s. Despite being located {{in the middle of a}} major metropolitan area, thanks to the legacy of Griffith D. Compton, there still remains one small pocket of agriculture from its earliest years.|$|E

25|$|Safety {{conditions}} at the airport were so poor due to these and other obstructions that local businesses <b>and</b> <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> again called {{for the construction of}} a city-owned airport in a safer location just three months after Hoover Field was rededicated. In late 1926, the National Aeronautic Association sought to lease Hoover Field from Mitten in order to upgrade it and turn it into Washington's municipal airport. Their goal was to use Hoover Field temporarily while soil was dredged from the Potomac to create new land near Gravelly Point for a much-expanded new municipal airport. But these talks failed. In February 1927, a group of aviators and aviation companies, led by aviation pioneer Henry Berliner, called for the establishment of a new, larger airport on the site of just across Military Road (the southern boundary of Hoover Field). Although no field was built there at this time, an airport (Washington Airport) was built there in 1928.|$|E
25|$|Professional {{baseball}} grew {{throughout the}} United States {{at the beginning}} of the twentieth century, and clubs sought additional facilities to accommodate their spring training. Al Lang, a businessman in St. Petersburg, Florida, saw a huge potential to attract northeastern teams to his city to take advantage of the warm weather during the early months of the year. Lang <b>and</b> <b>city</b> <b>officials</b> created an incentives package that covered teams' travel expenses and other amenities, which drew in the city's first spring training tenant, the St. Louis Browns, in 1914. The club trained at Coffee Pot Park, a small ballpark located beside Coffee Pot bayou about a mile north of the current site of Al Lang Stadium. Subsequently, other Major League Baseball clubs such as the Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Yankees came to St. Petersburg for spring training, and Lang continued promoting the city when he was elected Mayor of St. Petersburg in 1916. After his term, Lang devoted his life to building a successful connection between Florida and baseball, and was instrumental in marketing St. Petersburg as a desirable sports site.|$|E
25|$|The first train, an {{official}} train consisting of four cars with the Mayor <b>and</b> <b>City</b> <b>officials,</b> departed from East 180th Street at 11:21 AM on May 15, 1941. Trains {{on the line}} were shuttles, with a paper transfer to the IRT White Plains Road Line at East 180th Street. When the city began operating the line it was considered {{as part of the}} IND Division internally, with IND crews operating the line because the city takeover of the IRT and BMT required that new lines be part of the IND. The line was known as the IND Dyre Avenue–East 174th Street Line. However, to the riding public the line was advertised as an IRT line. Shuttle trains consisting of two cars operated on the line and there was no late night service when the line opened in 1941. The fares were collected in the stations during rush hours, and by conductors on the trains when ridership was light. The signs for stations on the Dyre Avenue Line used IND signs, with white letters on a green background. During its first year of being part of the subway system, 637,148 riders used the line.|$|E
