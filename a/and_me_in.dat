2500|$|Thiers {{proposed}} a new cabinet, but de Broglie {{and the right}} wing objected that the new government was not conservative enough. A debate and vote of confidence in his government was scheduled for 23 May. The diplomatic corps was in the audience, along with the Thiers family, and Marshal MacMahon, in civilian clothes. De Broglie began the debate, warning that the country needed a firm government of the right because without it the radical party, which had never repudiated the Commune, would win. [...] "Posterity is merciless", he said, [...] "to governments and ministers who by weakness surrender to the enemy the laws and societies they are charged to defend." [...] Under the new rules of the Assembly, Thiers, as President, {{was not allowed to}} respond directly {{on the floor of the}} Assembly. However, he demanded and received the right to reply. He spoke emotionally at length, explaining that he, a longtime supporter of the monarchy, had decided that, [...] "considering the way of things today in the civilized world, for you <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> practice a monarchy is absolutely impossible." [...] He described accomplishments and policies, and concluded, [...] "What I am describing is a policy of conservatism; the path of our policy is the policy between two extremes." [...] The Assembly then voted, resulting in a declaration of no confidence in the Thiers government by a vote of 362 to 348. The next day, on 24 May, Thiers submitted his resignation as President. The same day, the Assembly voted to replace Thiers with Marshal MacMahon. De Broglie became the head of the new President's council of ministers. De Broglie proclaimed that the new government's priorities would be [...] "to prevent the he invasion of the radical element", and [...] "to strengthen the base of the social order." ...|$|E
