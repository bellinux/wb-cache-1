40|$|AbstractBACKGROUND:Arformoterol {{tartrate}} (<b>arformoterol,</b> 15 μg bid) is a nebulized long-acting β 2 -agonist {{approved for}} maintenance treatment of COPD. METHODS:This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients (aged ≥ 40 years with baseline FEV 1 ≤ 65 % predicted, FEV 1 > 0. 50 L, FEV 1 /FVC ≤ 70 %, and ≥ 15 pack-year smoking history) received <b>arformoterol</b> (n = 420) or placebo (n = 421) for 1 year. The primary assessment was time from randomization to respiratory death or first COPD exacerbation-related hospitalization. RESULTS:Among 841 patients randomized, 103 had ≥ 1 primary event (9. 5 % vs 15. 0 %, for <b>arformoterol</b> vs placebo, respectively). Patients who discontinued treatment {{for any reason}} (39. 3 % vs 49. 9 %, for <b>arformoterol</b> vs placebo, respectively) were followed for up to 1 year postrandomization to assess for primary events. Fewer patients receiving <b>arformoterol</b> than placebo experienced COPD exacerbation-related hospitalizations (9. 0 % vs 14. 3 %, respectively). Twelve patients (2. 9 %) receiving <b>arformoterol</b> and 10 patients (2. 4 %) receiving placebo died during the study. Risk for first respiratory serious adverse event was 50 % lower with <b>arformoterol</b> than placebo (P=. 003). Numerically more patients on <b>arformoterol</b> (13; 3. 1 %) than placebo (10; 2. 4 %) experienced cardiac serious adverse events; however, time-to-first cardiac serious adverse event was not significantly different. Improvements in trough FEV 1 and FVC were greater with <b>arformoterol</b> (least-squares mean change from baseline vs placebo: 0. 051 L,P=. 030 and 0. 075 L,P=. 018, respectively). Significant improvements in quality of life (overall St. George's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire and Clinical COPD Questionnaire) were observed with <b>arformoterol</b> vs placebo (P<. 05). CONCLUSIONS:Arformoterol demonstrated an approximately 40 % lower risk of respiratory death or COPD exacerbation-related hospitalization over 1 year vs placebo. <b>Arformoterol</b> was well-tolerated and improved lung function vs placebo.

40|$|Paul KingMonash University Department of Medicine and Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Monash Medical Centre, AustraliaAbstract: Formoterol is a beta 2 -agonist {{that has}} both {{short and long}} acting {{bronchodilator}} effects. &Beta;eta 2 -agonists used as bronchodilators have been synthesized as racemates that comprise (R,R) and (S,S) -enantiomers. Compounds that are beta 2 -selective derive their bronchodilator effect from an interaction between the (R,R) -enantiomer and the beta 2 -adrenoceptor. <b>Arformoterol</b> is the (R,R) -enantiomer and is distinguished from the more commonly used racemic (RR/S,S) -diasteriomer of formoterol. Overall literature {{on the use of}} <b>arformoterol</b> in COPD is very preliminary. There is some in vitro data that demonstrate significant bronchodilation and inhibition of inflammation with <b>arformoterol,</b> and these effects may be more pronounced than those caused by racemic formoterol. There are limited clinical trial data that demonstrate that <b>arformoterol</b> produces significant improvement in lung function in COPD; however, many of the subjects involved had marked baseline airway reversibility. <b>Arformoterol</b> has been very well tolerated in clinical trials and could potentially be used only once every 24 hours (due to its prolonged effect).

40|$|SummaryPurposeCurrent {{guidelines}} support {{using in}} combination {{more than one}} class of long-acting bronchodilator for COPD patients whose symptoms are not controlled by mono-therapy. This 2 -week, multi-center (34 sites), randomized, modified-blind, parallel group study evaluated the efficacy and safety of concomitant treatment with nebulized <b>arformoterol</b> (the formoterol(R,R) -isomer) BID and tiotropium DPI QD. MethodsCOPD patients (mean FEV 1 1. 37 L, 45. 4 % predicted) were randomized to receive mono-therapy (either <b>arformoterol</b> 15 μg BID [n= 76] or tiotropium 18 μg QD [n= 80]), or combined therapy (sequential dosing of <b>arformoterol</b> 15 μg BID and tiotropium 18 μg QD [n= 78]). Changes in pulmonary function, dyspnea, and rescue levalbuterol use were evaluated, as were safety outcomes. ResultsMean FEV 1 AUC 0 – 24 (the primary endpoint) improved similarly from baseline for <b>arformoterol</b> (0. 10 L) and tiotropium (0. 08 L) treatment groups and greater for the combined therapy group (0. 22 L; all p-values < 0. 005). Peak FEV 1, peak FVC, 24 -h trough FEV 1, and inspiratory capacity also improved similarly for the mono-therapies and greatest for the combined therapy. Dyspnea (mean transition dyspnea index) improved similarly for <b>arformoterol</b> (+ 2. 3) and tiotropium (+ 1. 8) and greatest with combined therapy (+ 3. 1; p-values < 0. 05). Levalbuterol use decreased for all treatment groups (range − 1. 8 to − 2. 5 actuations/day). All treatments had similar frequency of adverse events. ConclusionIn this study, the combination of nebulized <b>arformoterol</b> 15 μg BID plus tiotropium 18 μg DPI QD was the most effective in improving pulmonary function and disease symptoms. Mono-therapy improvement with <b>arformoterol</b> or tiotropium was similar. All three treatments were well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|<b>Arformoterol,</b> a long-acting beta- 2 agonist, has a rapid onset {{and long}} {{duration}} of action. Its role as rescue medication in acute asthma attack is undetermined. To compare the efficacy and tolerability of <b>arformoterol</b> with salbutamol nebulization, a {{study was conducted}} among 50 patients with acute non-severe asthma. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} group 1 (n = 25) and group 2 (n = 25) who received three doses of salbutamol and <b>arformoterol</b> nebulization, respectively, at 20 -min intervals. The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured at the baseline and 5 min after each dose. The demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The mean PEFR significantly increased in both these groups when compared with the baseline. The increases in the PEFR in two groups were similar after the third dose. The adverse effects in both these groups were minor. <b>Arformoterol</b> was as effective and safe as salbutamol in acute non-severe asthma...|$|E
40|$|Some basic {{scientific}} {{data suggest that}} (S) -enantiomers of beta(2) -agonists have different and sometimes opposing effects to (R) -enantiomers. These data may explain the paradoxical response of the airways to the repeated, chronic administration of racemic beta(2) -agonists. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} the use of (R) -enantiomers of beta(2) -agonists may be an alternative option to reduce the risks of long-term administration of inhaled long-acting agents. <b>Arformoterol</b> is the (R,R) -enantiomer of formoterol. It is currently available for use as a nebulized solution of <b>arformoterol</b> tartrate and is approved in the USA for twice-daily administration in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical trials in COPD patients have demonstrated that <b>arformoterol</b> is as effective in improving lung function and symptoms as other available long-acting inhaled beta(2) -agonists. Moreover, its safety for long-term administration has been documented in this population. These findings indicate that <b>arformoterol</b> is an effective option for patients with COPD who could benefit from sustained bronchodilation delivered through nebulization, and can be an alternative for patients who cannot use conventional inhaler devices, including metered-dose inhalers or dry-powder devices...|$|E

Preclinical {{studies suggest}} that it is a {{stronger}} bronchodilator than the racemic (R,R/S,S) -formoterol; however, its potential clinical advantages have not been demonstrated. This study compared the length of stay (LOS), 30 -day readmission rates, and doses of rescue medication administered in hospitalized patients with COPD who were treated with nebulized <b>arformoterol</b> or nebulized formoterol. Methods: This retrospective analysis utilized data from Premier, Inc. (Charlotte, NC, USA), the largest nationwide hospital-based administrative database. COPD patients ≥ 40 years of age were included if they were hospitalized between January 2011 and July 2014, had no asthma diagnoses, and were treated with nebulized <b>arformoterol</b> or nebulized formoterol. LOS was measured from the day the patients initiated the study medication (index day). Rescue medications were defined as short-acting bronchodilators used from the index day onward. Multivariate statistical models included a random effect for hospital and controlled for patient demographics, hospital characteristics, admission characteristics, prior hospitalizations, comorbidities, pre-index service use, and pre-index medication use. Results: A total of 7, 876 patients received <b>arformoterol,</b> and 3, 612 patients received nebulized formoterol. There {{was no significant difference in}} 30 -day all-cause (arformoterol = 11. 9 %, formoterol = 12. 1 %, odds ratio [OR] = 0. 981, P= 0. 82) or COPD-related hospital readmission rates (<b>arformoterol</b> = 8. 0 %, formoterol = 8. 0 %, OR = 1. 002, P= 0. 98) after adjusting for covariates. The adjusted mean LOS was significantly shorter for arformoterol-treated vs formoterol-treated patients (4. 6 vs 4. 9 days, P= 0. 039), and arformoterol-treated patients used significantly fewer doses of rescue medications vs formoterol-treated patients (5. 9 vs 6. 6 doses, P= 0. 006). Conclusion: During inpatient stays, treating with <b>arformoterol</b> instead of nebulized formoterol may lead to shorter LOS and lower rescue medication use.

Reducing 30 -day readmissions could save health care resources while improving patient care. Recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act authorized reduced Medicare payments to hospitals with excess readmissions for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. Starting in October 2014, hospitals will also be penalized for excess COPD readmissions. This retrospective database study investigated whether use of <b>arformoterol,</b> a nebulized long-acting beta agonist, during an inpatient admission, had different 30 -day all-cause readmission rates compared with treatment using nebulized short-acting beta agonists (SABAs, albuterol, or levalbuterol). Methods: A US nationally representative hospital database was used to study adults aged ≥ 40 years, discharged between January, 2006 and March, 2010, and with a diagnosis of COPD. Patients receiving <b>arformoterol</b> on ≥ 80 % of days following treatment initiation were compared with patients receiving a nebulized SABA during hospitalization. <b>Arformoterol</b> and nebulized SABA patients were matched (1 : 2) for age, sex, severity of inpatient admission, and primary/secondary COPD diagnosis. Logistic regression compared the odds of readmission while adjusting for age, sex, race, admission type, severity, primary/secondary diagnosis, other respiratory medication use, respiratory therapy use, oxygen use, hospital size, and teaching status. Results: This retrospective study compared 812 <b>arformoterol</b> patients and 1, 651 nebulized SABA patients who were discharged from their initial COPD hospital admission. An intensive care unit stay was more common among <b>arformoterol</b> patients (32. 1 % versus 18. 4 %, P< 0. 001), suggesting more severe symptoms during the initial admission. The observed readmission rate was significantly lower for <b>arformoterol</b> patients than for nebulized SABA patients (8. 7 % versus 11. 9 %, P= 0. 017), as were the adjusted odds of readmission (odds ratio 0. 69, 95 % confidence interval 0. 51 – 0. 92). Conclusion: All-cause 30 -day readmission rates were significantly lower for <b>arformoterol</b> patients than nebulized SABA patients, both before and after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics.

40|$|Exposure to {{chlorine}} (Cl 2) damages airway and alveolar epithelia, {{resulting in}} acute lung injury and reactive airway dysfunction syndrome. We evaluated the efficacy and {{mechanisms by which}} <b>arformoterol,</b> a long-term β 2 -agonist, administered after exposure, mitigated the extent of this injury. Exposure of C 57 BL/ 6 mice to 400 ppm Cl 2 for 30 minutes increased respiratory system resistance and airway responsiveness to aerosolized methacholine (assessed by FlexiVent) up to 6 days after exposure, and decreased Na+-dependent alveolar fluid clearance (AFC). Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) knockout mice developed similar degrees of airway hyperreactivity as wild-type controls after Cl 2 exposure, indicating that reactive intermediates from iNOS do not contribute to Cl 2 -induced airway dysfunction in our model. Intranasal administration of <b>arformoterol</b> mitigated the Cl 2 effects on airway reactivity and AFC, presumably by increasing lung cyclic AMP level. <b>Arformoterol</b> did not modify the inflammatory responses, {{as evidenced by the}} number of inflammatory cells and concentrations of IL- 6 and TNF-α in the bronchoalveolar lavage. NF-κB activity (assessed by p 65 Western blots and electrophoretic mobility shift assay) remained at control levels up to 24 hours after Cl 2 exposure.
