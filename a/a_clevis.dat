He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling his words and was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the back of his pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and ran toward a nearby farm to get help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if the women got away.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>clevis</b> hook is a hook, with {{or without}} a snap lock, with <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> and bolt or pin at the base. The clevis is used to fasten the hook to a bracket or chain.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>clevis</b> rod end is {{a folded}} or {{machined}} piece formed into <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> and {{fitted with a}} hole at its base to which a rod is attached. In machined pieces, the hole is most often threaded.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> twin <b>clevis</b> is <b>a</b> solid {{piece with}} two {{clevises}} directly opposite one another, each {{fitted with a}} pin. Twin clevises are commonly used to join two lengths of chain.|$|R
50|$|More {{sophisticated}} cylinders have a {{body with}} end cover, a piston rod, and a cylinder head. At one side the bottom is, for instance, connected to <b>a</b> single <b>clevis,</b> whereas at the other side, the piston rod is also foreseen with <b>a</b> single <b>clevis.</b> The cylinder shell normally has hydraulic connections at both sides; that is, a connection at the bottom side and a connection at the cylinder head side. If oil is pushed under the piston, the piston rod is pushed out and oil that was between the piston and the cylinder head is pushed back to the oil tank.|$|R
5000|$|A bolt can {{function}} as <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> pin, but a bolt {{is not intended}} to take the lateral stress that <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> pin must handle. Normal bolts are manufactured to handle tension loads, whereas clevis pins and bolts are designed to withstand shearing forces.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>clevis</b> bracket {{generally}} {{takes the}} form of a solid metal piece with a flat rectangular base, fitted with holes for bolts or machine screws, and two rounded wings in parallel forming <b>a</b> <b>clevis.</b> Commonly used in aircraft and cars, clevis brackets allow mounting of rods to flat surfaces.|$|E

Design and operating features for <b>an</b> automatic coupler <b>clevis</b> joint, <b>a</b> side latching detent joint, and a module-to-module auto lock coupler are given. An analysis of the packaging characteristics of stacked subassembly, single fold, hybrid, and double fold concepts is given for various platform structure configurations. Payload carrier systems and assembly techniques are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Mousing (pronounced mouzing) is the {{application}} of a molly or safety wire, called mousing wire in this use, to secure <b>a</b> threaded <b>clevis</b> pin to <b>a</b> shackle. This is done by passing a couple of turns of mousing wire through the reach-hole provided for this purpose in the unthreaded end of the clevis pin and around the body of the shackle's hoop. Alternatively, some threaded shackles are provided with a hole through the threaded end of the pin beyond where it emerges from the threaded hole. A cotter pin or a couple of loops of mousing wire through this hole serves the same purpose and secures the shackle in a closed position. Nylon zip ties are also commonly used in applications where the shackle must be secured, but easy removal is required.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1940s, plows {{and other}} tillage {{equipment}} usually {{were connected to}} the tractor via a drawbar. The classic drawbar is simply a steel bar attached to the tractor (or in some cases, as in the early Fordsons, cast {{as part of the}} rear transmission housing) to which the hitch of the implement was attached with a pin or by <b>a</b> loop and <b>clevis.</b> The implement could be readily attached and removed, allowing the tractor to be used for other purposes on a daily basis. If the tractor was equipped with a swinging drawbar, then it could be set at the center or offset from center to allow the tractor to run outside the path of the implement.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>clevis</b> {{fastener}} is a three-piece fastener system {{consisting of}} <b>a</b> <b>clevis,</b> clevis pin, and tang. The clevis is a U-shaped piece that has holes {{at the end}} of the prongs to accept the clevis pin. The clevis pin is similar to a bolt, but is only partially threaded or unthreaded with a cross-hole for a split pin. The tang is a piece that fits in the space within the clevis and is held in place by the clevis pin. [...] The combination of a simple clevis fitted with a pin is commonly called a shackle, although <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> and pin is only one of the many forms a shackle may take.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>clevis</b> hanger {{consists}} of one U-shaped clevis {{and a second}} V-shaped clevis {{with a hole in}} a flattened section {{at the base of the}} V, joined together with a bolt or pin. Clevis hangers are used as a pipe attachment providing vertical adjustment for pipes.|$|E
50|$|Clevises {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{fasteners}} used in farming equipment and sailboat rigging, as well as the automotive, aircraft and construction industries. They are also widely used to attach control surfaces and other accessories to servo controls in airworthy model aircraft. As a part of a fastener, <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> provides a method of allowing rotation in some axes while restricting rotation in others.|$|E
5000|$|In sailing, pintles insert into {{gudgeons}} {{that are}} normally {{affixed to the}} transom of a boat. Normally, the corresponding pintle fitting on the rudder slides, lowers or clips into the gudgeon. There are variations where gudgeons are mounted to the rudder and boat, and <b>a</b> pivot <b>clevis</b> pin is inserted into these gudgeons, or the pintles are fastened to the boat, and gudgeons {{are attached to the}} rudder. In any case, the fitting with the hole is referred to as a gudgeon. They are used to attach the rudder to the boat so that it can swing freely. The rudder can then be turned with the tiller. There must be at least two gudgeon/pintle sets for stability in the rudder's attachment to the transom. The pintles must face the same direction for insertion into the gudgeons and usually one is a bit longer so it can be the first into its gudgeon, giving some stability for the insertion of the other pintle. To prevent the rudder from rising out of the gudgeons there is often some preventer such as rudder weight or a locking device slid across the path of the pintle's removal from the upper gudgeon (also referred to as a Rudder Stop).Really good installations (gudgeons) have bushings, (plain bearing) either a solid sleeve, flanged or clenched. This will allow for smoother operation of the helm and preserve the pintles and gudgeons. A bushing can be seen as [...] "consumable".|$|R
2500|$|Multitool knives {{often have}} more than one blade, {{including}} an assortment of knife blade edges (serrated, plain, saws) as well as a myriad of other tools such as bottle openers, corkscrews, and scissors. A large tool selection is the signature of the Swiss Army Knife. These knives are produced by Victorinox and Wenger and issued to military services and sold to the public. [...] Similar to the Swiss Army knife is the German Army knife, with two blades opening from each side and featuring hard plastic grips and aluminum liners. [...] The U.S. Military utility knife (MIL-K-818), issued by the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, was made for many years by the Camillus Cutlery Company and Imperial Schrade as well as many other companies. [...] It was originally produced with carbon steel blades and brass liners (both vulnerable to corrosion), but with the onset of the Vietnam War was modified to incorporate all-stainless steel construction. [...] The current-issue U.S. military utility knife has textured stainless grips and four stainless blades/tools opening on both sides in the camper or scout pattern and has <b>an</b> extremely large <b>clevis</b> or bail.|$|R
40|$|Part of the {{redesign}} of the SRMs for the Space Shuttle involved {{the substitution of}} three new capture cylinders for three of the previously used cylinders. These new cylinders mate with the old standard case segments {{in each of the}} three field joints. The new capture cylinders contain an integral capture latch on the tang end which mates with <b>a</b> case <b>clevis</b> during stackup at KSC. The capture cylinders also contain a groove in the capture latch to provide for a third 0 -ring in the joint and are designed to achieve a metal-to- metal interference fit between the capture latch and the mating clevis. An unexpected fretting problem has occurred on the tang capture feature and the inner clevis leg interference fit surfaces on flight hardware since STS- 26. Varying degrees of fretting damage have been found on the case segments from different flight motors. Fretting is a wear phenomena that occurs when two tightly fitting metal surfaces are subject to cyclic relative motion of extremely small amplitudes (generally less than 0. 010 -inch) in the absence of adequate lubrication. It is adhesive ("cold" - welding) in nature and vibration is its essential causative factor. This problem has manifested itself on the flight motors as a series of pits and axial gouges on the inside diameter (ID) surfaces of the inner clevis legs and the outside diameter (OD) surfaces of the tang capture features. The problem occurs in varying degrees of severity in all of the field joints. It is not believed that fretting is a flight safety issue. However, it could become a reusability issue if left unattended. Fretting has been encountered in other industries for many years and measures that will prevent or reduce it have been devised. These include: elimination or reduction of vibration (amplitudes and/or frequencies), elimination of slip, improved lubrication between parts, increased surface separation, increased interference, inducing residual compressive stresses in the surfaces of the mating parts, and employing non-fretting interference shims. Looking at each of these separately; vibration and slip occur in varying degrees and magnitudes in the field joints (as part of the roll-out, launch, flight, splashdown, flotation, and/or tow back) and are difficult to define or eliminate. Improved lubrication is something that was evaluated since it would be the simplest change to incorporate, but little or no improvement was found. Increasing surface separation would defeat the purpose of the interference fit. The effect of increasing the interference fit is unknown. Additional shot peening and/or surface rolling to impart residual compressive stresses in the joints undoubtedly would alter the characteristics and finish of the sealing surfaces of the motor cases. Also, experimental data' indicate that the tangs and clevises already have residual compressive stress fields on their surfaces yet fretting occurs. These stresses probably result from the case machining and the glass beading used to clean these surfaces...|$|R

50|$|The in-line spinner {{is named}} {{for the fact that}} a metal blade {{revolves}} around a central axis (a wire), which may be attached by <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> (a c-shaped metal piece with holes that accommodates the wire) or by itself. Most in-line spinners have metal weights rigged behind the spinning blade and beads or brass hardware that separates the two for frictionless spinning. Due {{to the fact that the}} spinning blade cause the whole bait to rotate, line twist builds that creates line problems and tangles. Swivels are used to solve the problem of twist.|$|E
50|$|A {{safety wire}} {{is used to}} ensure proper {{security}} for a fastener. The wire needed is long enough to reach from a fixed location to {{a hole in the}} removable fastener, such as a pin — <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> fastener, sometimes a linchpin or hitch-pin through <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> yoke for instance — and the wire pulled back upon itself, parallel to its other end, then twisted, a single end inserted through a fastener, and twisted again, possibly then anchored to a second fastener or other part, then twisted once again, having excess slack pulled relatively taut to be secure. The two ends of the wire-loop thus formed are joined by twisting them together with a tool, using enough twists to be secure, then released from the twisting tool. The removable fastener — possibly a nut, wing nut, turnbuckle, a bolt or a pin similar to a bolt — having a hole through a part of it that will remain accessible when it is fastened in place will be secured with the wire passing through it. When finished, any excess length of wire would be cut off with a pair of wire cutters, such as pliers that may, also, be the twisting tool. If the fastener part to be secured does not come with a hole for the safety wire, one may need to be drilled.|$|E
60|$|MY FRIEND: By the way, a {{fine example}} was {{presented}} on board the boat for contemplating the effect of condition upon human happiness. A gentleman had purchased twelve negroes {{in different parts of}} Kentucky, and was taking them to a farm in the South. They were chained six and six together. <b>A</b> small iron <b>clevis</b> was around the left wrist of each, and this fastened to the main chain by a shorter one, at a convenient distance from the others, so that the negroes were strung together precisely like so many fish upon a trotline. In this condition they were being separated forever from the scenes of their childhood, their friends, their fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters, and many of them from their wives and children, and going into perpetual slavery where the lash of the master is proverbially more ruthless and unrelenting than any other; and yet amid all these distressing circumstances, as we would think them, they were the most cheerful and apparently happy creatures on board. One, whose offence for which he had been sold was an overfondness for his wife, played the fiddle almost continually, and the others danced, sang, cracked jokes, and played various games with cards from day to day. How true it is that 'God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,' or in other words, that he renders the worst of human conditions tolerable, while he permits the best to be nothing better than tolerable. To return to the narrative: When we reached Springfield I stayed but one day, when I started on this tedious circuit where I now am. Do you remember my going to the city, while I was in Kentucky, to have a tooth extracted, and making a failure of it? Well, that same old tooth got to paining me so much that about a week since I had it torn out, bringing with it a bit of the jawbone, the consequence of which is that my mouth is now so sore that I can neither talk nor eat.|$|R
50|$|A shackle, {{also known}} as a gyve, is a U-shaped piece of metal secured with <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> pin or bolt across the opening, or a hinged metal loop secured with a {{quick-release}} locking pin mechanism. The term also applies to handcuffs and other similarly conceived restraint devices that function in a similar manner. Shackles are the primary connecting link in all manner of rigging systems, from boats and ships to industrial crane rigging, as they allow different rigging subsets to be connected or disconnected quickly. A shackle is also the similarly shaped piece of metal used with a locking mechanism in padlocks.|$|E
50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to <b>a</b> <b>clevis.</b> It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a split pin or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the tip of}} {{the wire}} frame's {{overhead}} arm, a spinner blade is attached by a swivel or other means to an enclosed wire loop. Another blade may be attached [...] "in-line" [...] on the overhead arm by means of <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> to create a [...] "tandem" [...] blade spinnerbait. The characteristics of blades that are stated above for in-line spinners also apply to safety-pin style spinnerbaits. There are no hard-and-fast rules for when to use a particular design, color or size blade or blade combination. Generally, the rounder Colorado blade is used for slow, steady, colder-water retrieves, dropping the bait in a free fall during retrieve pauses, or slow rolling the bait along the bottom. Narrow willowleaf blades are used for fast retrieves and through vegetation. For more on blade hydrodynamics, see below.|$|E
5000|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck {{up to the front}} of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25 a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess.

After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the back of his pickup.

5000|$|Pipes {{are usually}} either {{supported}} from below or hung from above (but {{may also be}} supported from the side), using devices called pipe supports. Supports may {{be as simple as}} a pipe [...] "shoe" [...] which is akin to a half of an I-beam welded {{to the bottom of the}} pipe; they may be [...] "hung" [...] using <b>a</b> <b>clevis,</b> or with trapeze type of devices called pipe hangers. Pipe supports of any kind may incorporate springs, snubbers, dampers, or combinations of these devices to compensate for thermal expansion, or to provide vibration isolation, shock control, or reduced vibration excitation of the pipe due to earthquake motion. Some dampers are simply fluid dashpots, but other dampers may be active hydraulic devices that have sophisticated systems that act to dampen peak displacements due to externally imposed vibrations or mechanical shocks. The undesired motions may be process derived (such as in a fluidized bed reactor) or from a natural phenomenon such as an earthquake (design basis event or DBE).|$|E
50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|E
5000|$|When finally completed, the [...] chain {{contained}} huge iron links, each {{two feet}} in length and weighing 114 lb. The links were carted to New Windsor, where they were put together, and floated down the river to West Point on logs late in April. Including swivels, clevises, and anchors, the chain weighed 65 tons. For buoyancy, 40 ft logs were cut into 16 ft sections, waterproofed, and joined by fours into rafts fastened with 12 ft timbers. Short sections of chain (10 links, a swivel, and <b>a</b> <b>clevis)</b> were stapled across each raft and later, in the river, the chain sections were united. Peter Townsend, owner of Sterling Iron Works, was paid by the Continental Congress to manufacture the chain.Captain Thomas Machin, the Artillery Officer and engineer who had installed the chain at Fort Montgomery, {{was assigned to the}} same task at West Point. On 30 April 1778, he directed the installation of the chain across the river. Its southern end was secured to a small cove on the West Bank of the river and its northern end was anchored to Constitution Island. The West Point side was protected by Chain Battery and the Constitution Island side by Marine Battery. Both ends were anchored to log cribs filled with rocks.|$|E
50|$|The Type 99 is {{a smooth}} bore, muzzle-loading weapon of the Stokes-Brandt type. The Type 99 81 mm mortar {{differs from the}} Type 97 81 mm {{infantry}} mortar in the shortness of its tube, which is only 21.75 inches as compared with 45.34 inches of the Type 97. The mortar can be disassembled into three units: the tube, the bipod, and the base plate. The legs of the bipod, made of tubular steel, are mounted on the elevating screw housing by <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> joint. They terminate in thin steel plates which have single-pointed spikes on the underside. The spread of the legs is limited by a chain which has a spring attached to one end to relieve the shock of firing. A buffer system incorporated in the bipod gives a recuperation of 2 inches. The recoil cylinders are filled with light grease or heavy oil. The base plate, made of pressed steel, has a series of ribs and braces welded on the underside {{to allow it to}} dig into the ground when the piece is fired. On the top side of the plate, in the center, is a circular depression into which the base-cap knob fits when the mortar is mounted in firing position. A carrying handle is attached to the rear edge of the plate. Also, two small hooks are welded to the rear edge to permit the attachment of a carrying strap. Around {{the outer edge of the}} plate is a one-inch ridge, and on the lower front edge a hook is attached through which a small rod can be thrust and used for slight changes in base plate alignment. A stability test of the Type 99 mortar, in which a total of 14 rounds were fired, produced no visible evidence of cracking or deformation of either base plate or bipod. The plate sank about 2 inches into the ground with the firing of seven rounds at alternate elevations of 45 to 75 degrees. Stability was very satisfactory when firing zone charges I to IV, but zones V to VI produced noticeable hop of the mortar and a sinking of the base plate. The reported range of the weapon of about 2,200 yards has not been conclusively confirmed.|$|E

This platform {{is attached to the}} shuttle storage area through several supports, each consisting of an attachment fitting, a monoball bearing, <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> pin and a support strut. The experiments must be temperature controlled during and after launch. Consequently, heat loss through the plate, attachment fitting, monoball bearing, and strut are important. The overall conductance of the monoball bearing was determined by an experimental method of heating the outer ring with a nichrome resistance wire and cooling the inner ball with propylene glycol. Temperature differences across the bearing were measured for various heat fluxes. The overall conductance is 0. 42 Watts/C (0. 80 BTU/hr F), This yields a 16 watt loss for a 38 C temperature difference across the bearing...|$|E
40|$|A load {{regulating}} mechanical latch {{is described}} {{that has a}} pivotally mounted latch element having a hook-shaped end with a strike roller-engaging laterally open hook for engaging a stationary strike roller. The latch element or hook is pivotally mounted in <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> end of an elongated latch stem that is adapted for axial movement through an opening in a support plate or bracket mounted to a structural member. A coil spring is disposed over and around the extending latch stem and {{the lower end of}} the coil spring engages the support bracket. A thrust washer is removably attached to the other end of the latch stem and engages the other end of the coil spring and compresses the coil spring thereby preloading the spring and the latch element carried by the latch stem. The hook-shaped latch element has a limited degree of axial travel for loading caused by structural distortion which may change the relative positions of the latch element hook and the strike roller. Means are also provided to permit limited tilt of the latch element due to loading of the hook...|$|E
40|$|Fabric-reinforced {{cementitious}} matrix (FRCM) composites made of dry-fiber fabric {{embedded in}} an inorganic matrix are advanced cement-based materials designed for retrofitting masonry or concrete structures. Characterization of the tensile behavior of FRCM composites provides the parameters {{needed for the}} design of the structural reinforcement and has given rise to numerous research studies on the aspects that influence its mechanical properties. To obtain the tensile behavior characteristics of this composite under different boundary conditions, two test setups were investigated. <b>A</b> <b>clevis</b> grip (pin action) was used to reproduce field boundary conditions from typical installation and to obtain design parameters. A clamping grip was used to obtain a complete characterization of the composite by inducing a tensile failure of each constituent material. Several FRCM systems made with different fabrics were used for the investigation: polyparaphenylene benzobisoxazole (PBO), carbon (C), and glass (G), plus carbon and glass with a special protective coating.

40|$|The {{response}} of truss-type structures for future space applications, such as Large Deployable Reflector (LDR), will be {{directly affected by}} joint performance. Some of the objectives of research at BAC were to characterize structural joints, establish analytical approaches that incorporate joint characteristics, and experimentally establish {{the validity of the}} analytical approaches. The test approach to characterize joints for both erectable and deployable-type structures was based upon a Force State Mapping Technique. The approach pictorially shows how the nonlinear joint results can be used for equivalent linear analysis. Testing of the Space Station joints developed at LaRC (a hinged joint at 2 Hz and <b>a</b> <b>clevis</b> joint at 2 Hz) successfully revealed the nonlinear characteristics of the joints. The Space Station joints were effectively linear when loaded to plus or minus 500 pounds with a corresponding displacement of about plus or minus 0. 0015 inch. It was indicated that good linear joints exist which are compatible with errected structures, but that difficulty may be encountered if nonlinear-type joints are incorporated in the structure...|$|E
