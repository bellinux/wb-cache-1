5|$|Binary and multi-star systems {{consist of}} two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and {{generally}} move <b>around</b> <b>each</b> other in stable orbits. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can {{have a significant impact on}} their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.|$|E

5|$|The {{white-eyes}} {{are small}} birds of rather drab appearance, the plumage above being typically greenish-olive, but some species have a white or bright yellow throat, breast or lower parts, and several have buff flanks.

5|$|This tiling has four-way {{rotational}} symmetry <b>around</b> <b>each</b> of its squares. When {{the ratio of}} the side lengths of the two squares is an irrational number such as the golden ratio, its cross-sections form aperiodic sequences with a similar recursive structure to the Fibonacci word. Generalizations of this tiling to three dimensions have also been studied.|$|E

5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the {{dichotomy}} between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates {{more than a third}} of the painting. The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously <b>around</b> <b>each</b> celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E
5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in {{forward speed}} northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, in which two tropical cyclone appear to rotate <b>around</b> <b>each</b> other. The cold front that absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms <b>around</b> <b>each</b> other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of algebraic topology, the homotopy groups of spheres describe how spheres of various dimensions can wrap <b>around</b> <b>each</b> other. They {{are examples of}} topological invariants, which reflect, in algebraic terms, the structure of spheres viewed as topological spaces, forgetting about their precise geometry. Unlike homology groups, which are also topological invariants, the homotopy groups are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil <b>around</b> <b>each</b> other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E
