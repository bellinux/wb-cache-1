25|$|A {{localized}} but damaging tornado outbreak produced 11 tornadoes {{in eastern}} North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota {{on the evening}} of August 26, 2007. A large EF3 tornado passed near Rugh Lake, North Dakota, destroying garages and outbuildings on three farms, tossing grain bins, and snapping numerous trees. Gravel roads were deeply scarred by flying debris, five bison were killed, and two heavy combines were thrown and smashed to pieces by the tornado. The strongest tornado of the outbreak was a large, rain-wrapped EF4 wedge that devastated the town of Northwood, North Dakota. This multiple-vortex tornado began to the southwest of town, snapping numerous trees and striking the Northwood Muni-Vince Airport at EF1 strength, where several planes were damaged. A metal storage building and a small <b>airplane</b> <b>hangar</b> were reduced to bare slabs at that location. The tornado grew to nearly a mile wide and reached EF3 strength as it struck Northwood directly. Of the roughly 460 homes in Northwood, 90% of them sustained some type of damage. The local health center, bank, fire station, school, supermarket, and grain elevator were all damaged. Near the grain elevator, several rail cars were knocked off the tracks. Hundreds of trees were snapped, uprooted, or damaged throughout town, and one person was killed in a mobile home park that was destroyed at the north edge of town. A small area of EF4 damage was noted as the tornado exited at the northeast corner of town. An agricultural company, a construction company, and a car dealership were completely destroyed in this area. The construction company was entirely flattened, with steel beams twisted and thrown into nearby fields. A large metal storage tank that originated in this area was found 1.5 miles away in a corn field. Numerous vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from the car dealership, many of which were mangled beyond recognition. Farm fields in this area were heavily scoured, and mature corn stalks in one field were snapped at the base and flattened to the ground, with husked ears of corn found scattered about. EF1 damage was observed further to the northeast before the tornado dissipated. In addition to the fatality, 18 other people were injured in Northwood. Later that evening, an EF2 tornado touched down near Reynolds, North Dakota, snapping numerous trees near the Red River, and flattening a flag pole and an antique windmill to the ground. The tornado crossed into Minnesota, where a quonset hut and a pole shed were destroyed before the tornado dissipated near Eldred. Eight other weak tornadoes occurred that evening as well.|$|E

In an interview with MTV, Wade talked about the idea behind the music video and said, [...] "This is the closest we'll probably ever come to being in a Tim Burton fantasy world. It was done in a real 'Jack and the Beanstalk' style. And Marcos used some camera tricks that make it look amazing. From far away, the stage set looked normal, {{but when you get}} closer you get smaller and it gets huge. We were being filmed in front of this bookcase that was like 150 feet high. It's a real visual trip." [...] It premiered on VH1.com on June 27, 2001.|$|E

500|$|After {{departing from}} the station, which resembles an <b>airplane</b> <b>hangar,</b> the train {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} steep [...] chain lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift hill, the train enters the first element of the roller coaster, a Dive Drop. This element is similar to the Dive Drop's found on The Swarm at Thorpe Park and GateKeeper at Cedar Point and consists of the train rotating 180 degrees into an upside down position before descending back to the ground. During this drop, the train reaches its top speed of [...] At the bottom of the first drop, riders get their picture taken. After the train exits the first drop, the train then enters a zero-g-roll before going through a cloud of fog. The train then makes a slight left turn before entering an Immelmann loop followed by a right turn over a pond. The train then leads into the second zero-g-roll over the main entrance of the ride. Following the roll, the train makes a left turn before going through an Inline twist. During this element, which is known as a keyhole, riders go through an actual airplane control tower (which was retrieved from O'Hare International Airport), giving the illusion the train will hit the tower. After going through the tower, the train goes through another near miss keyhole surrounded by a cloud of fog, before exiting the twist and making a tight right turn, passing by Demon's corkscrews and last turn, before making a slight left upward turn leading into the brake run. The train then makes a 180-degree left turn into another set of brakes before entering the station. One cycle lasts about 1 minute and 15 seconds.|$|E
