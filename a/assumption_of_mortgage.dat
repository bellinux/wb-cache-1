This paper presents a model of residential mobility decisions and an empirical analysis that evaluates {{the importance of the}} ownership <b>of</b> these <b>mortgages</b> upon the mobility of homeowners.

40|$|Executive Summary •	The usual advice {{given to}} the public by {{financial}} planners and the popular press is that less debt is better and in particular owning your own house outright is a desirable goal. •	We show that this advice is often wrong because mortgage debt acts as an inflation hedge. Mortgage debt also has a valuable refinancing option in case interest rates fall and an abandonment option if {{the value of the}} property declines. •	Mortgage debt is often seen simply as necessary because of people’s limited financial assets. Specifically, people can purchase a home only if they resort to borrowing. Employing a numerical model, we demonstrate that some level <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> debt is valuable to many individuals who do not face such a constraint. •	The model is able to simulate over a wide range <b>of</b> plausible <b>assumptions</b> the impact <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> debt on a household’s wealth. Home ownership provides households a hedge against rental increases, but exposes them to the vagaries of the local real estate market. Our model shows that mortgage debt allows individuals to hedge against inflation and local market risk. •	The model allows an analyst to vary assumptions to examine the impact <b>of</b> the <b>mortgage</b> decision on a particular household...|$|R

40|$|Governments {{across the}} world have faced a {{difficult}} balancing act in reacting to the GFC: housing markets and in particular new construction have slumped and mortgage lending is down, calling for measures to stimulate output. But the crisis was brought about {{in part by the}} proliferation <b>of</b> new <b>mortgage</b> products and lax lending standards from the 1990 s onwards-calling for tighter regulation. This paper examines the cases of the UK and the Netherlands. Both countries have high levels <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> debt to GDP and well-developed mortgage markets, but the important institutional differences between them, and the fact that their housing-policy developments often serve as models for other countries, make a comparison worthwhile. The paper takes a system-embedded approach to describing the housing and mortgage markets, and the governments' post-GFC responses. The countries enacted similar short-term stimulus measures for the housing market but have adopted stricter long-term regulations for the mortgage market, which replace the <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> rational consumer behaviour with the principles of behavioural economics. The institutional frameworks condition the effects of such measures, so outcomes will differ, but tighter regulation <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> markets can be expected to reduce demand for owner-occupied housing...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the effect of}} the share <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending by individual banks (together with some control variables) on two measures of financial stability - the bank Z-score and the nonperforming loan ratio - for a sample of 212 banks in 19 emerging Asian economies for 2007 - 2013 from the Bankscope database. We find some evidence that an increased share <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending is positive for financial stability, specifically by lowering the probability of default by financial institutions and reducing the nonperforming loan ratio, at least in noncrisis periods, for levels <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> shares up to 30 %- 40 %. For higher levels <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending shares, the impact on financial stability turns negative. We also find that the share <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending can be a useful measure of both financial development and financial inclusion. This finding most likely reflects the effect of a higher share <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending in diversifying the mix of banks' assets and, thereby, reducing overall risk. However, if the share <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending is too high, then the diversification effect diminishes. Therefore, the challenge is to balance the expected improvement in financial stability due to asset diversification against negative impacts that might result from easier lending standards or overly rapid increases in mortgage lending that could trigger a bubble in the housing market. This highlights the need for prudent monetary policy and macroprudential policy measures to forestall the development of such bubbles...|$|R

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s {{the volume}} of secured lending to {{households}} has expanded rapidly, both in absolute terms and in relation to household incomes. This paper examines the determinants of households' ability to service this stock of secured debt. It estimates a random effects probit model for the probability <b>of</b> households having <b>mortgage</b> payment problems. It is found that past experience of payment problems increases {{the probability that the}} household has difficulties servicing its secured debt today. At the household level, becoming unemployed, interest income gearing of 20 % and above, high loan to value ratios and having a heavy burden of unsecured debt are all associated with a significantly higher probability <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> payment problems. Saving regularly and having unsecured debt which is not a problem are both associated with a significantly lower probability <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> payment problems. The only non-household-specific variable to have a significant effect is mortgage interest rates - the probability of payment problems increases with the level <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> interest rates. An aggregate measure of debt at risk is calculated. This has decreased between 1994 and 2002, as falls in the probability <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> payment problems have more than offset increases in the stock <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> debt outstanding.
