They {{commissioned}} the architect N. P. Grebenka to do it. Simultaneously a new part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house symmetrically replicating its structure was attached to <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>annex.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> <b>annex</b> was completely included in the new house, only having the window decoration style changed from Baroque to Neo Renaissance. Two storeys were added to <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>annex</b> which faced <b>the</b> yard. But that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>annex</b> didn’t lose its connection with the old wooden house on the stone basement. The Baroque window decoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>annex</b> wasn’t changed and has survived till the present day. A two-storeyed stone laundry built in the 18th century joins the old house with one side and <b>the</b> front <b>annex</b> with <b>the</b> other (the laundry building also has survived).|$|R

25|$|As {{noted in}} the {{preceding}} section, between 1990–1999, {{there was a large}} reduction in <b>the</b> emissions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EITs.

Emissions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Annex</b> II countries (<b>Annex</b> I minus <b>the</b> EIT countries) have experienced a limited increase in emissions from 1990–2006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards.
