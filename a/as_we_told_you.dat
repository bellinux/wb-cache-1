5000|$|Ananus, who, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> already, {{took the}} high priesthood, was a bold {{man in his}} temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, who are very rigid in judging offenders, above {{all the rest of}} the Jews, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper {{opportunity}} exercise his authority. Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the Sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, some of his companions; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king Agrippa, desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a Sanhedrin without his consent. Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, McCain {{continued}} {{questioning the}} progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: [...] "Things have not gone <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had planned or expected, nor <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were <b>told</b> by <b>you,</b> General Myers." [...] In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: [...] "We [...] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be." [...] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007. The strategy's opponents labeled it [...] "McCain's plan" [...] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, [...] "McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now." [...] The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, [...] "I would much rather lose a campaign than a war." [...] In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{simple one}} enough," [...] he answered. [...] "We got here all right, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> over the wire. Then Maqueda {{talked to you}} for a long while until you rang off, saying you wanted to speak to Japhet. After that, at ten o'clock precisely, we heard the thud of the explosion. Next, as we were {{preparing}} to go out to see what had happened, Joshua arrived alone, announced that the idol Harmac had been destroyed, and demanded that the Child of Kings, 'for State reasons,' should accompany him to his own castle. She declined and, as he insisted, I took it upon myself to kick him out of the place. He retired, and we saw no more of him, but a few minutes later there came a shower of arrows down the passage, and after them a rush of men, who called, 'Death to the Gentiles. Rescue the Rose.' ...|$|E
6000|$|So He {{spoke to}} Jeremiah {{in the time}} of Jehoiakim: [...] "It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil that I purpose to do to them; that I may forgive them their iniquity and their sin." [...] The Lord, you see, wishes to forgive--longs to forgive. His heart yearns over sinful men as a father's over his rebellious child. But if they will still rebel, if they will still turn their wicked wills away from Him, He must punish. Why we know not; but He knows. Punish He must, unless we repent--unless we turn our wills toward His will. And woe to the stiff-necked and stout-hearted man who, like the wicked king Jehoiakim, sets his face like a flint against God's warnings. How many, how many behave for years, Sunday after Sunday, just as king Jehoiakim did! When he heard that God had {{threatened}} him with ruin for his sins, he heard also that God offered him free pardon if he would repent. Jeremiah gave him free choice to be saved or to be ruined; but his heart and will were hardened. Hearing that he was wrong only made him angry. His pride and self-will were hurt by being told that he must change and alter his ways. He had chosen his way, and he would keep to it; and he cared nothing for God's offers of forgiveness, because he could not be forgiven unless he did what he was too proud to do, confess himself to be in the wrong, and openly alter his conduct. And how many, as I first said, are like him! They come to church; they hear God's warnings and threats against their evil ways; they hear God's offers of free pardon and forgiveness; but being told that they are in the wrong makes them too angry to care for God's offers of pardon. Pride stops their cars. They have chosen their own way, and they will keep it. They would not object to be forgiven, if they might be forgiven without repenting. But they do not like to confess themselves in the wrong. They do not like to face their foolish companions' remarks and sneers about their changed ways. They do not like even good people to say of them: [...] "You see now that you were in the wrong after all; for you have altered your mind and your doings yourself, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> you would have to do." [...] No; anything sooner than confess themselves in the wrong; and so they turn their backs on God's mercy, for the sake of their own carnal pride and self-will.|$|E
