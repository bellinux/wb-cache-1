25|$|There {{are only}} two {{chemical}} bird repellents registered {{for use in the}} United States. They are methyl <b>anthranilate</b> and anthraquinone. Methyl <b>anthranilate</b> is a primary repellent that produces an immediate unpleasant sensation that is reflexive and {{does not have to be}} learned. As such it is most effective for transient populations of birds (DeVault et al. 2013). Methyl <b>anthranilate</b> has been used with great success at rapidly dispersing birds from flightlines at Homestead Air Reserve Station (Engeman et al. 2002). Anthraquinone is a secondary repellent that has a laxative effect that is not instantaneous. Because of this it is most effective on resident populations of wildlife that will have time to learn an aversive response (Izhaki 2002, DeVault et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} 117 carbocyclic compounds {{for their}} bird repellent effects in no-choice (one-bottle) drinking tests and summarized {{the results in}} this paper. Compounds derivative of aromatic heterocycles, acetophenones and carbocyclic compounds containing sulfur are often strong repellents. <b>Anthranilates,</b> aromatic alcohols, aromatic aldehydes, and carbocyclic compounds containing nitrogen are moderately strong repellents. However, the potency of <b>anthranilates</b> is highly variable, depending upon {{the nature of the}} substitutions. Acetates and benzoates are weak repellents. Benzoic acids and amino acids are not repellent to starlings. In addition, discussions of the type of behavioral assay, units of measure, and dose-response characterizations include recommendations for future studies of repellents. Convergence on the types of information reported and the details of experiments will enhance our ability to compare the efficacy of repellents across studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{cultures}} of mouse or chick embryo ceils several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylates, Ibufenac, phenylbutazone, Indomethacin, flufenamic and mefenamic acids, CI- 583, and chloroquine) inhibit the multi-plication of various viruses (encephalomyocarditis, S ndbis, influenza A 2, Newcastle disease, herpes implex and vaccinia). Two factors were {{critical for the}} virus inhibitory action of these drugs: the concentration of serum and the pH of the medium. The antiviral effect of these drugs seems to be due mainly to limitation of intraceUular synthesis. However, salicylates and <b>anthranilates</b> also inhibit the adsorption and/or penetration of encephalo-myocarditis virus into mouse cells. The antiviral potency shows some correlation with other biochemical, cellular and clinical activities of these drugs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine {{potential}} protective effects of methyl N-methylanthranilate (M) and isopropyl N-methylanthranilate (I) in a rat model of acute intoxication with carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) by tracking the changes in liver morphology and function. Serum transaminase and bilirubin were significantly elevated in animals treated with CCl 4 alone. A pretreatment with M and I prior to the administration of CCl 4 significantly prevented the increase of serum levels of liver damage markers. Histopathological evaluation of the livers of the test animals also revealed that M and I reduced the incidence of liver lesions. Our experiments showed that both M and I possess protective effect in CCl 4 -induced liver damage in rats. The results are of interest due to the presence of natural or synthetic M in the human diet.

50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is anthranilate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating, deaminating). Other names in common use include <b>anthranilate</b> hydroxylase, <b>anthranilate</b> 2,3-dioxygenase (deaminating), <b>anthranilate</b> hydroxylase (deaminating), anthranilic hydroxylase, and <b>anthranilate</b> 2,3-hydroxylase (deaminating). This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: benzoate degradation via hydroxylation, carbazole degradation, and nitrogen metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Anthranilate-based insect repellents include methyl <b>anthranilate,</b> N,N-dimethylanthranilic acid (DMA), ethyl <b>anthranilate</b> (EA), and butyl <b>anthranilate</b> (BA). Chemically, {{they are}} esters of anthranilic acid. These {{compounds}} are {{approved by the}} US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as food additives. The compounds repel both fruit flies and mosquitos. The compounds target the same neurons that respond to DEET. The receptors are located on part of the antennae known as the sacculus.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of sunscreens is often {{influenced by the}} solvents inwhich they are dissolved. In this regard, the ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra of 13 UVA and UVB sunscreen chemicals were determined in 12 solvents ofvarying polarity and cosmetic interest. Changes inboth the wavelength of maximum absorbance (K max) and molar absorptivity () were observed {{for many of the}} sunscreen-solvent sys ems studied. Observed hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts in K max for a number of sunscreen chemicals were related to their structure and polarity. Polar solvents shifted the K max of polar sunscreens to shorter wavelengths (hypsochromic) andshifted less polar sunscreens to longer wavelengths (bathochromic). Ortho-substituted sunscreen chemicals, uch as salicylates and <b>anthranilates</b> xperienced a minimum or no UV absorbance shift. With the exception of PABA, most sunscreens showed increased absorbance in both polar and non-polar solvents and decreased absorbance in semi-polar solvents, such as hexylene glycol and C• 2 -C• 5 alcohols benzoate. The results of this study should aid the cosmetic chemist in selecting appropriate solvents and vehicles for sunscreen chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{work which}} has {{resulted}} in the synthesis of cinnolines is reviewed. The strictly historical approach has been modified to accommodate a classification based upon the type of cinnoline involved. Preparative routes to 4 -chloro- 2 -amlnoacetophenone are described. Reaction between the acid chloride of 4 -chloro- 2 - phthallmldobenzoic acid and diethyl sodiomalonate followed by hydrolysis gives the pure amine via the acetamido-compound. A second route which utilises 4 -chloro- 2 -nitrobenzovl chloride and ethyl sodioacetoacetate leads to 4 -chloro- 2 -nitroaceto-phenone and thence to the amine, Diazotisation of 4 rohloro- 2 -aminoacetophenone and subsequent ring closure produces 7 -chloro-U-hydroxycinnoline. Nitration of 4 -Ghloro- 2 -acetamidoacetophenone has given the 5 -nitro-derivatlve with some of the 3 -nitro-isomer. Hydrolysis to the corresponding nitro-amines and diazotisation of these in sulphuric acid yields 6 -nitro- 7 -chloro- and 8 -nitro- 7 -chloro-U-hydroxycinnoline. In hydrochloric acid, however, the corresponding dichloro- 4 -hydroxycinnolines are formed, the replacement (nitro →chloro) taking place before cyclisation to the cinnoline. Attempts to prepare 4 -chloro- 2 -aminopropiophenone are described, and work on the projected synthesis of 7 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyclnnoline is reported. Widman's synthesis of 7 -methylcinnoline- 7 -carboxylic acid has been repeated; in general, the original results are confirmed but the acid is best purified via the ethyl ester. 4 -Methylcinnoline and the 6 - and 7 -chloro-compounds have been prepared by ring closure of the diazotised o-isopropenylanilines; these are formed by dehydration of the corresponding carbinols which arise from the o-amino-acetophenones or methyl <b>anthranilates</b> by a Grignard reaction. The 4 -methylcinnolines are characterised by their green picrates and red ethiodldes. The application {{of a wide variety of}} reactions to estimate the reactivity of the methyl group in 4 -methyl-cinnoline has had little success. Confirmation of enhanced reactivity and hence of the postulate that is N(_ 1) the basic centre of the molecule is provided by the formation of 4 -p-dimethylaminostyryl-l-ethylcinnollnlum iodides. Reduction of a number of cinnolines with sodium and alcohol has been carried out. Qualitative examination has shown partial conversion to the corresponding indoles of 4 -(4 '-hydroxyphenyl) oinnoline, the 3 -methyl compound and of 3 -methyl- 4 -P-anisylclnnollne; 3 -phenyl- 4 -p-anisylcinnoline and the deraethylated compound are virtually unchanged. 4 -Methylclnnoline and its 6 - and 7 -chloro-derivatives all give 3 -niethylindole as the final-product but data on the intermediate stages is incomplete. Estimation of the ammonia liberated in each case confirms the above findings. Attempts to repeat Stolle and Becker's synthesis of 3 -phenylcinnoline- 4 -carboxylio acid are reported...|$|R
