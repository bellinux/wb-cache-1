500|$|Following the cancellation, the Defence Secretary Liam Fox {{used the}} Nimrod MRA4 {{procurement}} {{as an example}} of the worst of MOD procurement performance: [...] "The idea that we ever allow ourselves into a position where something that was originally Nimrod 2000 – where we ordered [...] was reduced to nine, spent £3.8bn <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> weren't close to getting the capability – is not to happen again." [...] Nevertheless, six ex-defence chiefs publicly criticised the decision to scrap the Nimrods in January 2011 and the Public Accounts Committee concluded in February 2012 [...] that the decision had been made without a proper understanding of the cost implications and had wasted £3.4bn.|$|E

After supposedly hearing that Johnny had returned to New York, Dee Dee wrote that he and Marky Ramone booked a flight and returned home as well. [...] "To this day, I still have no idea how they made the album End of the Century, or who actually played bass on it." [...] Dee Dee's account contradicts much of the band's collective account from the 1982 Trouser Press interview, where the band stated that the only track that Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky did not play on was the cover of [...] "Baby, I Love You"; as the band, save for Joey, had gone home after cutting basic tracks {{for the rest of the}} album.|$|E

500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I say just leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess we told you how to [...] We were really happy <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E

500|$|February was a busy {{month for}} the club. Benfica trailed Porto by 11 points in the Primeira Liga, with crucial European and {{domestic}} cup matches between league matches. The first was on 2 February against Nacional. Like past home performances, Benfica failed to score and lost points in another scoreless draw. Camacho tried to explain his team's performance: [...] "We did not lack attitude, but at home, we sometimes feel disturbed, pressured. We played two forwards <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> did not score." [...] He saw his first white handkerchiefs, an action commonly seen as a request for resignation. Benfica regained their feet with a home win against Paços de Ferreira in the Portuguese Cup. An opening goal by Pedrinha in the second minute was answered with an equaliser by Cardozo before half-time. In the second half, Cardozo, Rui Costa and Nuno Assis scored to send Benfica to the quarter-finals. On 14 February, Benfica hosted 1. FC Nürnberg {{in the first of}} two games against the German team. Recent acquisition Ariza Makukula scored the only goal in the 43rd minute, a 20-meter strike which fooled goalkeeper Jaromír Blažek. Camacho called the narrow victory important. Three days later, Benfica played Naval at the Municipal José Bento Pessoa. Cristian Rodríguez scored the club's opening goal in the 18th minute, with László Sepsi assisting Nuno Assis on a second goal in the final minute. On 21 February, Benfica played the second leg of their European double-header with Nürnberg. The Bundesliga side scored twice in seven minutes during the second half before Cardozo scored in the 89th minute and Di María tied the game in the 92nd, sending Benfica to the round of 16 with Spanish side Getafe. Camacho said, [...] "Benfica made some defensive errors in the second half that put them in a though spot. They managed to react and continued their search for goals until they arrived." [...] In domestic-league play, Benfica hosted Braga on 24 January. Braga scored first with a fifth-minute goal by Zé Manel, with Luisão tying the game in the 21sth minute. The draw complicated the league race, with Porto increasing their lead. Camacho said, [...] "Benfica did everything they could win. They tried to score from every way possible, but could not". The club ended the month with a 2–0 victory over Moreirense in the Portuguese Cup, sending them to the semi-finals.|$|E

2500|$|UCSD Economics {{professor}} Julian Betts states: “What {{all this}} means for spending is that starting around 1978-1979 {{we saw a}} sharp reduction in spending on schools. We fell compared to other states dramatically, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> haven’t really caught up to other states.” [...] From 1977, in California {{there has been a}} steady growth of class sizes compared to the national average, “which have been decreasing since 1970.” [...] The shortage in funds translated to decreased spending per student in the years following passage of Proposition 13. During the 1970s, school spending per student was almost equal to the national average. Using discount rate, “measured in 1997-1998 dollars, California spent about $100 more per capita on its public schools in 1969-1970 than did the rest of the country." [...] Since 1981-1982, California consistently has spent less per student {{than the rest of the}} U.S. as demonstrated by data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and by the Public Policy Institute of California [...] This has resulted in increased pupil-to-teacher ratios in K-12 public schools in California. Professor Betts observes that “pupil-teacher ratios start to skyrocket in the years immediately after 1978, and a huge gap opens up between pupil-teacher ratios here and in the rest of the country, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> haven’t recovered from that." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001, {{performances}} by the Boston Symphony Orchestra of excerpts from Klinghoffer were canceled. BSO Managing Director Mark Volpe remarked of the decision: [...] "We originally programmed the choruses from John Adams’ The Death of Klinghoffer {{because we believe}} in it {{as a work of}} art, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> hold that conviction. ... explained that it was a purely human reason, and that it wasn’t in the least bit a criticism of the work." [...] Adams and Klinghoffer librettist Alice Goodman criticized the decision, and Adams rejected a request to substitute a performance of Harmonium, saying: [...] "The reason that I asked them not to do 'Harmonium' was that I felt that 'Klinghoffer' is a serious and humane work, and it's also a work about which many people have made prejudicial judgments without even hearing it. I felt that if I said, 'OK, [...] "Klinghoffer" [...] is too hot to handle, do [...] "Harmonium,"' that in a sense I would be agreeing with the judgment about 'Klinghoffer.'"

This aspect is like something out of Lovecraft, although it is not exploited as well as it could have been." [...] Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: [...] "The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they're naïve and go to get scared, or they're sophisticated and enjoy scoffing at the pictures. There isn't much a teenager can scoff at these days, you know." [...] Lead actor Peter Graves also felt the film worked on a certain level. [...] "I think they played OK. ...

2500|$|The final was {{a rematch}} with Yugoslavia. The tense finale, where Lithuania {{had the support}} of the home crowd as the Serbs had {{eliminated}} Greece, had Lithuania winning the close first half, 49–48. With five minutes remaining, Arvydas Sabonis fouled out, as the Lithuanians were behind 76–83, later closing to 83–84. With Yugoslavia leading 87–83, Saulius Štombergas made a shot that was ruled out as the referee George Toliver called an offensive foul. Lithuanians protested the decision and received three technical fouls (first Sabonis, then Marčiulionis and then the whole team), leading them to leave the court in protest, only returning when persuaded by the Serbs. Aleksandar Đorđević, the game's overall top scorer with 42 points, scored all three free-throws. Lithuania eventually lost the game 90–96.
