40|$|Abstract. Every {{compressor}} has a stall line. In {{the vicinity}} of the stall line, the flow field is inherently unsteady due to the interactions between adjacent rows of blades, formation of small stall cells, flow separation and the viscous effects including shock-boundary layer interactions. These factors may aggravate to a state of local breakdown of flow or a total breakdown of flow or with a disastrous flow reversal. This paper starts with an overview on the previous researches about compressor stall and surge. Subsequently, it describes the effects of these instabilities in overall engine performance and design with / without any control. The main objectives of this paper are to review the phenomenon of instability and methodology to suppress the rotating stall and surge by enlarging the stable operating range of compressor with the application of various control systems. This paper surveys research developments in this field and also tries to find an improved solution to increase the engine performance by applying various surge control strategies. Finally, the paper focuses on some recommendations towards a better design of compressor especially for <b>aircraft</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant...</b>|$|E

A mathe- matical model of a wind propeller in discontinuous wind stream is developed. Software package to comprehensively assess wind-powered drive conditions and performance indicators is generated and tested taking into account experimental data, as well as airplane performance and flight modes. The typical data on the wind propeller and the wind-powered drive in the spraying process are received; specific features of the dynamics at the wind-powered drive turning-on and the wind propel- ler rotation at zero load are determined and the data on the wind-propeller blades load imbalance at spraying and transient processes are defined.

Aerospace propulsion is defined to cover the full spectrum from conventional <b>aircraft</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> through the Aerospace Plane to space propulsion. The conventional subsonic/supersonic aircraft arena, whether commercial or military, relies on the turbine engine. A key characteristic of turbine engines is that they involve fundamentally unsteady flows which must be properly treated.

The hypersonic flight propulsion systems are subject to severe heat loads and the engine and airframe are truly one entity.

40|$|Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) {{technologies}} aim {{at improving}} the availability, reliability, maintainability, {{and safety of}} systems {{through the development of}} fault diagnostic and failure prognostic algorithms. In complex engineering systems, such as <b>aircraft,</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> etc., the prognostic activities have been limited to the component-level, primarily due to the complexity of large-scale engineering systems. However, the output of these prognostic algorithms can be practically useful for the system managers, operators, or maintenance personnel, only if it helps them in making decisions, which are based on system-level parameters. Therefore, there is an emerging need to build health assessment methodologies at the system-level.
