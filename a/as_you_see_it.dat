2500|$|During the pastorate of Rev. Gilbert Horn, {{the first}} three rows of pews were removed and stored in the {{basement}} below the chapel. [...] This was done to accommodate the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra that held concerts and rehearsals there on occasion. [...] Unfortunately, those pews were stored in less than favorable condition and because of poor humidity they have been rendered useless due to dry rot. [...] Other than some minor restorations and repainting performed by church member Timothy Hess, the sanctuary remains <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> today.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 July 1974 the Government of Canada {{released}} a {{commemorative postage stamp}} honouring the centenary of {{the invention of the}} telephone stating [...] "At Brantford... Alexander Graham Bell, a young teacher of the deaf, spent a few weeks of leisurely contemplation and invented the telephone." [...] The stamp depicts three telephones of various time periods, including his famous Gallows model, considered the world's first telephone. In 1915 Alexander Graham referred to it saying [...] "The instrument, just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> here, was invented in the summer of 1874, during a visit I paid to my father and mother in Brantford..." [...] As well, one of the first successful voice transmission of any notable distance (6km) was made on 4 August 1876, between the telegraph office in Brantford, Ontario and Melville House over makeshift wires.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes, my Lord,' says Charles; {{and brings}} {{me out the}} haunch in a newspaper, and on the chany dish <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> and the two baskets of fruit besides.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Forms!' she said. 'Forms! Is {{the spirit}} there? By their fruits ye shall know them. I ask you {{yourself}} whether his life <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> is such as I should think conformable with the Word of God?' ...|$|R
50|$|Villa Spoiano is {{a renaissance}} villa {{located on a}} hillock between Tavarnelle Val di Pesa and Barberino Val d'Elsa. It has been cited {{for the first time}} in 1689 but the villa, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now, is from the 18th century.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he'll live, {{but he has}} had {{a narrow}} escape," [...] was the reply of the medical man in charge of the case. [...] "The bit of shell scraped his left temple, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see.</b> Had <b>it</b> come a little closer, it would have gone through his brain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about it," [...] replied Upton curtly. [...] "Everything was {{practically}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now when I reached here. Pat, did any of your party see the thing happen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, nonsense!' {{replied the}} boy angrily, 'do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> is your skin, and not mine; I don't care what becomes of it!' And he walked quickly {{on with his}} head in the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Storm! What storm? The {{weather has}} been splendid. We cannot wish for {{anything}} better. It {{has been just}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now--a bright sun, and just enough wind for her to carry whole sail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bien! Frank!" [...] Lady Kew smiled (in her supernatural way) {{almost as}} much as her portrait, by Harlowe, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>see</b> <b>it</b> at Kewbury to this very day. She is {{represented}} seated before an easel, painting a miniature of her son, Lord Walham.|$|R
60|$|This. Underneath London--as, I dare say, {{many of you}} know--there lies four or {{five hundred}} feet of clay. But not ice-clay. Anything but that, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> belongs to a {{formation}} late (geologically speaking), but somewhat older than those Disco Island beds.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm mighty {{glad you}} are going to give this, Tom, on Songbird's account," [...] {{announced}} Sam, when he and his brother were left to themselves. [...] "Songbird is about as blue <b>as</b> indigo. <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> isn't only the money--it's Minnie. Her father won't let him call on her any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the truth}} {{is so hard to}} be certain of, and you know {{goodness}} as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Mrs. Halleck, I'll tell you what I want: I want Flavia should be baptized into your church. Will you let her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never. We {{know nothing}} of {{the passage of time}} or of day or night. The light always shines just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now, and we sleep {{whenever}} we are tired and rise again as soon as we are rested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We thank you," [...] it ran, [...] "for your {{excellent}} contribution. All {{of us in}} {{the office}} enjoyed it immensely, and, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> was given the place of honor and immediate publication. We earnestly hope that you liked the illustrations.|$|E
2500|$|... : Humpty Dumpty says: [...] " [...] 'Slithy' means 'lithe and slimy'. [...] 'Lithe' is {{the same}} <b>as</b> 'active'. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>it's</b> like a portmanteau, there are two {{meanings}} packed up into one word." [...] The original in Mischmasch notes that 'slithy' means [...] "smooth and active" [...] The i is long, as in writhe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> {{somebody}} thought <b>it</b> worth {{while to}} steal the top sheet of your blotter," [...] Jake replied. [...] "Now perhaps I'd better tell you something I've just learned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} been unfaithful to you, Horace, even in thought. If I had not been true to you, should I feel my {{position}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> I feel <b>it</b> now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Captain Dan {{pointed to}} {{a place in the}} side of the rocky wall which was grooved and cut as if with a huge gouge or chisel, and highly polished. [...] "It was never cut by man in that fashion; we found it <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> and there's many of 'em in the mine. We call 'em slinking slides." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very abominable on {{the part}} of these Jacksons," [...] Mr. Renfrew said, [...] "but your {{interference}} was most imprudent, my young friend; and <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> has done harm rather than good. If you are so quixotic as to become the champion of every ill-treated slave in the State, your work is pretty well cut out for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{not quite}} in {{possession}} of the facts yet," [...] said Holmes. [...] "This splinter of wood, which I {{have every reason to}} believe to be poisoned, was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this card, inscribed <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> was on the table; and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into your theory?" ...|$|E
60|$|Thirdly: It {{is plain}} from what I have said, that {{you of the}} lower rank have no just reason to {{complain}} of your condition: Because, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> plainly <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> affordeth <b>you</b> so many advantages, and freeth you from so many vexations, so many distempers both of body and mind, which pursue and torment the rich and powerful.|$|R
5000|$|The first Twitches was {{released}} on October 14, 2005 a year after 2004's Halloweentown High, {{in the same year}} <b>as</b> Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It...,</b> and started a new format for Disney television in October that was named [...] "Hauntober Fest". The television premiere received 5.0 million viewers on its premiere night. Its theme song is [...] "Rush" [...] by Alyson Michalka with her sister Amanda.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{wonder you}} are puzzled," [...] he continued, [...] "so was {{everybody}} in the court that day, every one save myself. I alone could see in my mind's eye that gruesome murder such {{as it had been}} committed, with all its details, and, above all, its motive, and such <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>see</b> <b>it</b> presently, when I place it all clearly before you.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he explained, [...] "I know {{beforehand}} {{that you}} are speaking the truth <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> I know beforehand that any scheme in which you are engaged is {{for the benefit of}} our fellow creatures and not for their harm. But alas! you make yourself the judge of these things, and there are times when individual effort is the most dangerous thing in life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{you shall}} have," [...] said the red one. Then he thrust {{his hand into}} his {{breeches}} pocket, and drew forth the prettiest little plough that you ever saw. He stood {{it on the ground}} before Jacob, and it grew large <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in the picture. [...] "Plough away," [...] said he, and then he went back again whither he had come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you'd better {{understand}} that thing before we start," [...] said Van der Kemp, observing that Nigel was examining the contrivance with some curiosity. [...] "It's an apron to tie round you {{in bad weather}} to keep the water out. In fine weather it is rolled <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now round the ledge. Undo the buckle before and behind {{and you will see}} how it is to be used." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the Head Chief {{cried and}} said and sang, 'Taffy dear, {{the next time}} you write a picture-letter, you'd better send a man who can talk our {{language}} with it, to explain what it means. I don't mind it myself, because I am a Head Chief, but it's very bad {{for the rest of the}} Tribe of Tegumai, and, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> surprises the stranger.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been {{figuring}} on that. He's {{learned something}} about the ground, and my {{idea is that the}} provisions are dumped in a hollow that looks like a good road up to the gap; that is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would <b>see</b> <b>it</b> from the creek. What we don't know is where his boys would strike the ice. It might be anywhere within three or four miles." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{generally}} positive review of Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> {{in the journal}} portal: Libraries and the Academy, Andrew Battista wrote [...] "As inspiring <b>as</b> Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> can be, I would say that Davidson uncritically seeks to apply the doctrines of capitalist efficiency into contemporary learning. In fact, at times her vision of education seems to verge {{on a kind of}} fluency that will prepare people to compete in a new globalized economy rather than an altruistic experience that sees learning as the preparation of any fit participant in a democracy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The weak side of {{the place}} is along this sea face. On the other side, the Rock rises {{right out of the}} water; but on this side, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> slopes {{gradually}} down. There are batteries, all along by the water's edge; but if the place were attacked by a fleet strong enough to knock those batteries to pieces, and silence their guns, a landing could be effected.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will take}} that for granted," [...] Arranmore interrupted. [...] "You know {{the spirit in}} which I gave it. It is not, I fear, one of sympathy, but it may at any rate save me from having my {{carriage}} windows broken one dark night. By the bye, I have ordered a brougham for you in half-an-hour. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> is raining. Your bicycle shall be sent in to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{not likely}} to be of much use, sir," [...] Francis said modestly. [...] "I was very much more likely to get a stab in the back than to be carried off. Still, it was just {{possible}} that Mocenigo might himself like to see his vengeance carried out, and it was therefore worth my while guarding against it. But, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> will be necessary for me to be back sometime before morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{the hour}} and minute," [...] said Herbert, nodding, [...] "at which she {{afterwards}} stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I don't know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she laid the whole place waste, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>it,</b> and she has never since looked upon the light of day." ...|$|R
60|$|So it is. All {{that water}} {{was inside the}} chalk last night, till it froze. And then it came {{squeezing}} out of {{the holes in the}} chalk in strings, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>see</b> <b>it</b> if <b>you</b> break the ice across. Now you may judge for yourself how much water a load of chalk will hold, even on a dry summer's day. And now, if you'll excuse me, sir, I must be off to market.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hush, hush! [...] . But I feel it, too, <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>you.</b> I have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> more {{forcibly}} lately. You {{would have}} obtained your degree long before this time--possibly fellowship--and I {{should have been}} {{on my way to}} mine.' ...|$|R
