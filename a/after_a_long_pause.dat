5|$|In spring 333 BC, Alexander {{crossed the}} Taurus into Cilicia. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> due to illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' {{significantly}} larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. He offered {{a peace treaty}} that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.|$|E

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> in open hostilities—at {{least in}} the chronicles—a Novgorodian called Vyshata Vasilyevich led his troops against Yem in 1186, {{returning}} unharmed with prisoners. It {{is not clear whether}} he took his forces to fight in the land of Yem or to defend his country against an intrusion. Reasons for the renewed fighting have not been identified.|$|E
6000|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{ruminant}} <b>pause,</b> {{the priest}} said: [...] "You miss a logical step. Three persons are needed as ideas. Only two are needed as agents." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>After</b> rather <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> {{for both}} of them, Clementina asked, [...] "Do {{you think it would}} be nice for me to ask Mr. Gregory about things, when I wasn't suttain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At that I {{made sure}} the man started, for I heard the blunderbuss rattle on the window-sill; and it was <b>after</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> and with <b>a</b> curious change of voice, that the next {{question}} followed: ...|$|R
25|$|After the Khmer advance was checked, Anawrahta {{turned his}} {{attention}} toward Nanzhao. Anawrahta led a campaign against the kingdom in the northeast. (According to a mid-17th century source, he began the march on 16 December 1757.) He advanced to Dali, the capital of Nanzhao Kingdom, ostensibly to seek a Buddha's tooth relic. As {{in the case of}} the request for the scriptures from Thaton, it was really a demand for tribute. The ruler of Nanzhao shut the gates, and would not give up the relic. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> two kings exchanged presents and conversed amicably. The Nanzhao ruler gave Anawrahta a jade image which had come into contact with the tooth.|$|E
500|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> of eruptions at the vent, the eruptions {{abruptly}} {{stopped there}} {{and returned to}} the Showa crater, on April 4, 2016, some 8–9 days preceding major 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes on the Median Tectonic Line near Kumamoto, Japan. Then, three months later, on July 26, it spewed volcanic ash [...] into the air.|$|E
500|$|Blender asked Bowie in 2002 {{whether he}} still {{believed}} his public declaration was his biggest mistake. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> he said, [...] "I don't {{think it was}} a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people." [...] Bowie said {{he wanted to be a}} songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in [...] "puritanical" [...] America, [...] "I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do".|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hynes {{hesitated a}} little longer. Then amid the silence {{he took off}} his hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his mind. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> rather <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> he announced: ...|$|R
60|$|Cuffe {{explained}} what had happened, {{and put into}} the admiral's hand an official letter, explaining his recent success. With the last Nelson was pleased--at the first surprised. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> thoughtful <b>pause,</b> {{he went into the}} after-cabin, and returned, throwing a small, jack-like flag on the floor.|$|R
6000|$|Erasmus Walker closed one eye, and rewarded his visitor fixedly out of {{the other}} {{for a minute or}} two in silence, as if taking his bearings. It was a trick he had {{acquired}} from frequent use of a theodolite. Then he answered at last, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> deep <b>pause,</b> [...] "It's YOUR deal, Mr. Tyrrel. Make me an offer, won't you?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Colored {{people lived}} in three neighborhoods that were clearly demarcated, as if by ropes or turnstiles," [...] wrote Harvard {{professor}} Henry Louis Gates, Jr. {{about growing up in}} segregated West Virginia in the 1960s. [...] "Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said.... Of course, the colored world was not so much a neighborhood as a condition of existence." [...] "For most of my childhood, we couldn't eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores," [...] recalls Gates. His mother retaliated by not buying clothes that she was not allowed to try on. He remembered hearing a white man deliberately calling his father by the wrong name: [...] "'He knows my name, boy,' my father said <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> 'He calls all colored people George.'" [...] When Gates's cousin became the first black cheerleader at the local high school, she was not allowed to sit with the team and drink Coke from a glass but had to stand at the counter drinking from a paper cup. Professor Gates also wrote about his experiences in his 1995 book, Colored People: A Memoir.|$|E
2500|$|Sometime {{in the mid}} 200s, Gongsun Du {{gathered}} all {{his subordinates}} and asked them, [...] "I heard that Lord Cao is away on a campaign. Ye (around present-day Handan, Hebei) is unguarded. If I lead 30,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry to attack Ye, can anyone stop me?" [...] All of them agreed that Gongsun Du would succeed if he did so. After Gongsun Du sought his opinion, Liang Mao replied, [...] "The Han Empire {{is in a state}} of chaos and on the brink of collapse. General, you command thousands of troops, yet you sit here and watch others attack and destroy each other. As a subject of the Han Empire, is this what you should be doing? Lord Cao is concerned about the Han Empire's future and the people's welfare, which is why he leads an army of righteousness to eliminate tyrants and villains. He has made immense contributions and his virtues are well-known. There is none other like him in the Han Empire. As peace and stability has just recently been restored, it is only a matter of time before everyone starts pointing fingers at you, General, for not doing anything to save the Han Empire. Now, General, you want to lead your forces west to attack Ye? All it takes is one morning to find out the result of this test of survival and destruction. General, I hope you know what is good for you." [...] Gongsun Du's subordinates were shocked when they heard what Liang Mao said. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> Gongsun Du said, [...] "What Administrator Liang said is correct." ...|$|E
60|$|The other {{voice came}} <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> {{and as it}} were hoarsely.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis {{a village}} of the Yengeese!" [...] she said, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and {{expressive}} <b>pause.</b> [...] "A Narragansett woman does not love {{to look at the}} lodges of the hated race." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and solemn <b>pause,</b> at a {{sign from}} the Shadid, he {{who had been}} the husband of the dead Baaltis, the veil was removed from Elissa. At once she turned, looked at Aziel, and smiled sadly.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Gildersleeve {{sat down}} by the bedside {{wringing}} her hands in silence. [...] "It's too late to-night," [...] she said at last, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> deep <b>pause,</b> and in a voice like a woman condemned to death, [...] "too late to do anything; but to-morrow your father must go up to town and try to see him. At all costs we must buy him off. He knows everything--that's clear. He'll ruin us. He'll ruin us!" ...|$|R
60|$|BLAYNE. (<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> to {{the room}} generally.) It's my notion {{that we are a}} set of fools.|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> Pigling went on tip-toe and peeped {{round the}} door into the front kitchen. There was nobody there.|$|E
60|$|I was thunder-struck! Here {{were all}} my hopes blown {{again to the}} winds. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> I resumed the discourse.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{ship has}} truly tacked!" [...] Earing exclaimed, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> meditative <b>pause,</b> {{and with a}} voice in which distrust, or rather awe, was {{beginning}} to get the ascendancy. [...] "Long as I have followed the sea, have I never before seen a vessel tack against such a head-beating sea. He must have been all shaking in the wind, when we gave him the last look, or we should not have lost sight of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is there aught {{in which}} we can {{contribute}} to your comfort, or to your wishes?" [...] asked Captain de Lacey, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and solemn <b>pause,</b> during which all around the litter had mournfully contemplated the sad spectacle of sinking mortality.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Walk him up {{and down}} further off then, sir,' cried old John, 'and when you see me and a noble gentleman {{entertaining}} ourselves with talk, keep your distance. If you don't know your distance, sir,' added Mr Willet, <b>after</b> <b>an</b> enormously <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> during which he fixed his great dull eyes on Hugh, and waited with exemplary patience for any little property in the way of ideas that might come to him, 'we'll find a way to teach you, pretty soon.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Was it you {{who first}} {{proposed}} coming here?' Mrs. Lodge suddenly inquired, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> 'How very odd, if you did!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gentlemen,' said Mr Willet <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> 'you needn't ask. The {{likeness}} of a murdered man. This is the nineteenth of March.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, my {{eyes and}} limbs!' he then cried, peeping hideously out of the shop, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> 'will you go for twopence more?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, mother," [...] Elma answered, {{turning her}} face to the wall, but a {{thousand}} times less ashamed than she had been the day before when her mother spoke to her. [...] "I couldn't help it, dearest." [...] She took that soft white hand in hers and pressed it hard in silence. [...] "It's no wonder, you know," [...] she said at last, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> deep <b>pause.</b> [...] "He's going away from Chetwood to-day--and it was so very, very hard to say good-bye to him for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|If {{there was}} a shade of displeasure blended with the {{surprise}} that crossed {{the features of the}} divine at this extraordinary limitation of his duties, it entirely disappeared when he considered more closely the perfect expression of simplicity with which the dying master uttered his wishes. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and melancholy <b>pause,</b> which neither Griffith or his friend felt any inclination to interrupt, the chaplain replied: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miles," [...] Lucy said, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and {{thoughtful}} <b>pause,</b> [...] "it {{is not good}} for you to remain at Clawbonny, just at this time. Your kinsman, John Wallingford, has been here, and I think you like him. Why not pay him a visit? He resides near Niagara, 'West of the Bridge,'[3] as he calls it, and you might take the opportunity of seeing the 'Falls.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|A scarlet blush {{manifested}} itself on Freddie's young face. His eyes wandered sidewise. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> {{a single word}} escaped him, almost inaudible: ...|$|E
60|$|Bessie {{looked through}} the keyhole <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> and saw the two {{walking up and down}} as usual, Torpenhow's hand on Dick"s shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "This surpasseth belief!" [...] Don Camillo exclaimed <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> {{which had}} only been {{disturbed}} by the rush and retreat of the waters.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 Sir Iwain and Lucreza {{created the}} first two songs, “Leif Eriksson” and “Sound of Norns”, of the not yet formed band. They decided {{that they wanted to}} play these songs live as a band. So in spring 2006 Tajy and Moni joined them. Obsidia was born. In 2007 they finally found a drummer, Simon, and Imorh on the bass. Being complete, they had their first gig at May 16, 2007 in Breitenbach. Shortly after that Moni and Simon left the band for {{personal}} reasons. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> creative <b>pause,</b> Drake joined them in spring 2008 and they started working on their first album. They also started to have regular concerts, national and international.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not so {{sure that}} you are right, Marika," [...] he said, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> sad <b>pause.</b> [...] "That our darling boy is now in heaven I doubt not, for you saw him killed. But you did not see Ivanka killed, and what you call her death-shriek may not have been her last. We must not be too ready to believe the worst. If I had not {{believed}} you and them to have been all murdered together, I would not have sought death so recklessly. I will not give up hope in that God who has brought you back, and saved me from death. I think that darling Ivanka is still alive." ...|$|R
5000|$|Corin {{helped his}} father {{in the writing of}} his last autobiography. During one of Corin's visits to his father, the latter said, [...] "There is {{something}} I ought to tell you". Then, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> very <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> [...] "I am, to say the least of it, bisexual". Corin encouraged him to acknowledge his bisexuality in the book. Michael agreed to do so, but in the end he chose to remain silent about it. Alan Strachan's 2004 biography of Redgrave discusses his affairs with both men and women. Although Redgrave had some long-term relationships with men, he also was prone to cruising Victoria or Knightsbridge for what he called [...] "a necessary degradation", a habit of quick pick-ups that left him with a lasting sense of self-disgust.|$|R
