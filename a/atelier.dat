This heavy manufacturing factory was built during World War I to produce artillery shells, although by 1952 the factory had begun producing armoured fighting vehicles. Before producing the AMX-30, for example, it had made 1,900 AMX-13s and variants. The Roanne factory was responsible for final assembly, most components were made elsewhere: the powerplant by the <b>Atelier</b> de Construction de Limoges, the full armour set by the Ateliers et Forges de la Loire, the turret by the <b>Atelier</b> de Construction de Tarbes, the cannon by the <b>Atelier</b> de Construction de Bourges, the cupola and machine-gun by the Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne and the optics by the <b>Atelier</b> de Construction de Puteaux; all these again used many subcontractors. In a series of corporate mergers under state guidance, most of these firms would eventually be concentrated into GIAT.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{arts and}} crafts are practiced {{throughout}} the country for commercial, decorative, and religious purposes. Woodcarvings and sculptures are especially common. The high-quality clay of the western highlands is suitable for pottery and ceramics. Other crafts include basket weaving, beadworking, brass and bronze working, calabash carving and painting, embroidery, and leather working. Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials and vary from temporary wood-and-leaf shelters of nomadic Mbororo to the rectangular mud-and-thatch homes of southern peoples. Dwellings made from materials such as cement and tin are increasingly common. Contemporary art is mainly promoted by independent cultural organizations (Doual'art, Africréa) and artist-run initiatives (Art Wash, <b>Atelier</b> Viking, ArtBakery).|$|E

By 1907, Pflueger {{was working as a}} draftsman and soon joined the architectural firm Miller and Colmesnil, under the guidance of James Rupert Miller, senior partner. Young Pflueger sketched ornamental details based on ideas from his bosses, and attended Mission High Evening School to further his education. In 1911, Pflueger joined the San Francisco Architectural Club (SFAC), an organization that helped budding architects receive training in the informal <b>Atelier</b> Method where older experts taught the practical side of architecture including waterproofing, lighting and structural concerns to students who had no hope or wish to study Beaux-Arts in an established school abroad. Pflueger became thoroughly involved with SFAC's collegial activities and was chosen director in 1914.|$|E

5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived <b>Atelier</b> de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{the company}} ordered seven new trams from Skabo, with {{electric}} equipment from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). These {{were the first}} in the country to have Norwegian-built electrical equipment, and also allowed for multiple-unit train control. They were delivered in 1920 and 1921. In addition, six trailers were built from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik (HaWA) The delivery of new rolling stock required a new depot building at Holtet, two new electric arc transformers and a ticket price increase. The HaWa trailers were delivered in 1925. However, the two-axled trailers did not give as smooth a ride, and in 1927 the company ordered bogie trailers from <b>Atelier</b> Métallurgique de Nivelles, which were put into service in 1928 and 1929.|$|E
5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm <b>Atelier</b> One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because {{of their ability to}} produce nearly invisible welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made to}} transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E

40|$|Candida albicans is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} human fungal pathogen. Here, we take advantage of haploinsufficiency and transposon mutagenesis to perform large-scale loss-of-function genetic screen in this organism. We identified mutations in 146 genes that affect the switch between its single-cell (yeast) form and filamentous forms of growth; this switch appears central to the virulence of C. albicans. The encoded proteins include those involved in nutrient sensing, signal transduction, transcriptional control, cytoskeletal organization and cell wall construction. Approxim <b>ately</b> one-third of the genes identified in the screen lack homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other model organisms and thus constitute candidate antifungal drug targets.

5|$|New York faced similar {{architectural}} challenges, but {{in comparison}} to Chicago, skyscraper architects worked less closely with engineers and other specialists, and instead held strong backgrounds in the Beaux Arts movement and perceived their role to be primarily artistic rather than {{a partnership with the}} mechanical arts. Their practices tended to be smaller, resembling <b>atelier</b> style workshops. Structural engineers in New York took longer to build up a strong professional role there, a trend reflected in the lower engineering quality of many early skyscrapers in the city. The New York style emphasized stunning height and a somewhat eclectic use of architectural features from other periods, creating an energetic, flamboyant appearance. Towers were common, making best use of the relatively small plots of land in New York. Some New York skyscrapers emulated the tripartite style of Chicago, but others broke their exterior down into many different layers, each with its own style. Proponents argued that this reintroduced a sense of human proportion to these tall buildings; critics felt that the results were confusing and ungainly.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study explores {{feasibility}} of tissue-engineered osteogenesis using sterile coral implants loaded with homologous osteoblasts to repair bone defects. Study Design: A unilateral 4 mm transverse dis- continuity defect was produced approximately mid-way along left radius of young female rabbits using ro- tary diamond disc under continuous saline irrigation and stabilised with autoclaved steel miniplate and screws. The defect was then fitted with sterile bioresorbable coral implant loaded with homologous neonatal calvarial osteoblasts or control implants without osteoblasts. All animals underwent radiography immedi- <b>ately</b> post-operative, at weekly intervals {{for four weeks}} and at fortnightly intervals thereafter.

Different initial conditions were prepared by solution treating above β-transus immedi- <b>ately</b> followed by heat treatment in α/β temperature regime. These resulted in different grain boundary α thicknesses and contiguities at a fixed α vol- ume fraction. The subsequent ageing response of this material was studied by low temperature ageing at 400 ◦ C, 450 ◦ C and 500 ◦ C. Phase transformations were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and resistivity measurements. Mechan- ical properties were investigated using microhardness measurements and tensile tests. It has been proved that metastable ω phase is formed during annealing at 400 ◦ C and 450 ◦ C. ω particles further transform to very fine precipitates of α phase when exposed to annealing for longer time periods.
