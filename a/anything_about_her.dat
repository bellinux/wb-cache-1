5|$|On 13 December 1562, Mary {{sent for}} Knox again after {{he gave a}} sermon denouncing certain {{celebrations}} which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing {{at the expense of}} the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> that he disliked. Despite her friendly gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man {{contacts}} Mulder, arranging {{a meeting}} at a nearby diner. There Mulder meets his sister Samantha, who calls The Smoking Man her father. Samantha claims to not remember <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> abduction and is reluctant to stay or tell Mulder where he can find her. The next day, The Smoking Man offers Mulder the truth if he quits the FBI and comes work for him; Mulder refuses. Mulder later meets with Blevins, who now has evidence Skinner was withholding information concerning Ostelhoff's death.

Despite Scully's pleas, he refuses to name Skinner as the traitor in the FBI.|$|E
25|$|The English Trader was {{stranded}} on the knoll with her crew powerless to do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> As {{the first signs}} of daylight approached, the weather began to rapidly deteriorate, with the wind reaching gale force. Ever increasing waves crashed around her decks, smashing the starboard lifeboat and its derrick. The ship's back had broken as it settled on the knoll and the sea started it relentless destruction of the English Trader. The port lifeboat, though in the lee of the storm, could not be launched because of the turbulent waves crashing around the sandbank. The crew would rely on others for their rescue.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's very nice, {{and very}} good, and very pretty, and very clever,' Arthur answered, a little constrainedly. 'I don't know that I {{can tell you}} <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>her</b> than that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} {{is safe and}} well," [...] I said, [...] "or {{you would not be}} here, and before you say <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> please tell me what you meant by that terrible word 'but.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, father," [...] he protested, [...] "she is {{a leader}} of Society, she goes to Court and you see her name at the very best places. If there was <b>anything</b> wrong <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> she wouldn't be {{received}} like that." ...|$|R
25|$|Detective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature. Like Christie, she is {{not overly}} fond of the detective whom she is most famous for creatingâ€“in Ariadne's case, Finnish sleuth Sven Hjerson. We never learn <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> husband, {{but we do know}} that she hates alcohol and public {{appearances}} and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them by the events of Hallowe'en Party. She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats. Her maid Maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer, but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others.|$|E

500|$|Meeting with Mulder and Scully, Shannon tearfully {{tells them}} that Ausbury {{and the other}} Satanists {{repeatedly}} raped and impregnated her {{as part of their}} rituals, sacrificing her babies. When the agents confront Ausbury with the accusations, he is shocked, and denies them. Shannon stays after school to make up her assignment of dissecting the pig. Mrs. Paddock takes her bracelet and uses it as part of a spell that causes Shannon to slit her wrists. When Ausbury learns that the other faculty members plan to use Shannon as a scapegoat, he admits the sect's existence to Mulder. He confirms that rituals did happen while Shannon was present, but said that exposure to sensational media coverage led her to [...] "remember" [...] the sexual abuse. Meanwhile, Scully researches Mrs. Paddock and finds that no one knows <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> or her background. During a sudden power outage, Mrs. Paddock steals Scully's pen and uses it to impersonate her in a call to Mulder, pretending to be in trouble. Mulder handcuffs Ausbury in the basement to prevent his possible escape, then leaves to help Scully. Soon after, a giant snake appears, controlled by Mrs. Paddock, and devours Ausbury.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look at this woman," [...] {{she went}} on, aside, {{in a low}} voice--"no, NOT the first bed; the one beyond it; Number 60. I don't want the patient to know you are {{watching}} her. Do you observe <b>anything</b> odd <b>about</b> <b>her</b> appearance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I like Tennyson better. Do {{you know}} him?" [...] asked Emily, with a {{superior}} air, {{for the idea}} of this farmer's daughter knowing <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> poetry amused <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ventidius, a Roman general, {{comes to}} aide Antony in Alexandria. Ventidius disagrees with Antony's {{relationship}} with Cleopatra and offers to give Antony troops if he leaves her. Although Antony is insulted by Ventidius's opinions regarding Cleopatra (and refuses to hear <b>anything</b> negative <b>about</b> <b>her),</b> Antony agrees.|$|R
500|$|A mind-controlled Terra Branford {{participates in}} an Imperial raid on Narshe {{in search of}} a {{recently}} unearthed frozen esper (later identified as Tritoch; Valigarmanda in the GBA retranslation) found in the city's mines. The esper then kills Terra's controllers and breaks the Imperial control over her, but she is unable to remember <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> past. Locke Cole, a treasure hunter, promises to protect her until she can regain her memories and helps her escape to the hideout of the Returners, a group of militants opposing the Empire. Along the way, they pass through the Kingdom of Figaro and meet Edgar Roni Figaro, the king, and his estranged brother, Sabin Rene Figaro, who join them. Banon, the leader of the Returners, asks for Terra's help in their struggle against the Empire, and she agrees. Just as the resistance is preparing to return to Narshe to investigate the frozen esper, the Empire attacks South Figaro. Locke heads to the besieged town to slow the Empire's advance, {{while the rest of the}} group makes their way via rafting down the nearby Lethe River. However, Sabin is separated from the group after a battle with Ultros, self-proclaimed [...] "octopus royalty" [...] and a recurring antagonist, forcing the various members of the Returners to find their own ways to Narshe in three different scenarios controlled by the player. In Locke's scenario, he must escape the imperial occupied town of South Figaro without detection. Sabin has been swept to a distant continent and must find a way back while Terra, Edgar, and Banon will continue to float down the Lethe River back to Narshe.|$|E
2500|$|Austen's {{surviving}} correspondence {{contains only}} one other mention of Tom Lefroy, in a November 1798 letter that Austen biographer Claire Tomalin believes demonstrates the author's [...] "bleak remembrance, and persistent interest" [...] in Lefroy. In the letter to her sister, Austen writes that Tom's aunt Mrs. Lefroy had been to visit, but had not said <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> nephew...|$|E
60|$|MRS. PEARCE. Why not! But {{you don't}} know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> What about her parents? She may be married.|$|E
6000|$|Morton laughed, rather sadly. [...] "That's a fine, womanly reason, {{and may be}} {{sufficient}} for you; but, if you go, understand, Kate, it is against my wish. I do not care to know <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>her</b> and her problems; she has interfered too much with my work already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm sorry--" [...] she said, {{and closed}} the door. From the walk she saw him puzzled and anxious at the window. His face was {{becoming}} so ruddy and fatuous and babyish. She was sorry for him--but she was not big enough to do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>Her</b> sorrow was like sympathy for a mangy alley cat which she could not take home.|$|R
60|$|The little princess, whose nicety as to {{her dress}} and {{sensitiveness}} as to <b>anything</b> unpleasant <b>about</b> <b>her</b> pretty person we have seen, was lifted up streaming with tears and broken eggs, but otherwise not seriously injured, having fallen on the very substantial substratum of hay which Dame Poulet had selected {{as the foundation of}} her domestic hopes.|$|R
60|$|Ethel started. Mrs. Olcott {{was young}} and pretty; nobody knew <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> husband; Andrew's visits had already excited comment.|$|E
6000|$|He asked, with {{a certain}} slyness, [...] "Have you heard <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> already? At the club? From that fool woman in the kitchen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{there any}} harm in her! Have you any {{objection}} to her? Is there <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> {{that makes her}} unfit to be my wife?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Patient, indeed! Little {{did that}} poor painted slave think what demands would yet be made upon her patience. Full two months elapsed before she again saw Peter, or heard <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> Ben-Ahmed and <b>her</b> former friends at Mustapha! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{would read}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> India;' and <b>her</b> tone, though low and subdued, betrayed such enthusiasm as could find nothing dry, and {{this in a}} girl who had read aloud the reign of Edward III. with stolid indifference! ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{tried to}} force herself to say, [...] "Has to be {{proposed}} to you?" [...] but the question was too tremendous, and in another moment Evelyn was saying that the finest men were like women, and women were nobler than men--for example, one couldn't imagine a woman like Lillah Harrison thinking a mean thing or having <b>anything</b> base <b>about</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{made her}} way into the palace once, before I knew <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> and I cannot tell you how dreadfully indecent her conduct was." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{many nights}} the Queen {{came in the}} same way, but she never spoke a word, and the nurse was too frightened to say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> visits.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not saying}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> being a good woman now," [...] said Priscilla, {{interrupting}} the other with some vehemence, [...] "but only that she is my friend." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course, if Prissy {{had had a}} {{spark of}} spirit she wouldn't have given in. But she hadn't a mite; I believe she would have cut off her nose if Emmeline had ordered her to do it. She was just her mother over again. If ever a girl belied her name, Prissy Strong did. There wasn't <b>anything</b> strong <b>about</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{were sure}} o't I'd lay information," [...] said Longways emphatically. [...] "'Tis too rough a joke, and apt to wake riots in towns. We {{know that the}} Scotchman is a right enough man, and that his lady has been a right enough 'oman since she came here, {{and if there was}} <b>anything</b> wrong <b>about</b> <b>her</b> afore, that's their business, not ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She may be," [...] Mr. Gray {{admitted}} drily. [...] "The other half's Austrian all right, though. I can't {{tell you}} <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> my dear fellow. All I {{can say is}} that she is in my book, and so long as she is there, you know it's better for you youngsters to keep away. Be off now. I am decoding a dispatch." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. H. Don't tell me <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her!</b> She won't {{care for}} you, {{and when you}} come back, after having made an {{exhibition}} of yourself, you'll find me occupied with-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Took on! You don't {{think he}} grieves for his Mama, sure?' argued Berry, sitting {{down on the}} side of the bed. 'He can't {{remember}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her,</b> you know, Mrs Wickam. It's not possible.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, mamma. He said Mr. Armadale {{began by}} {{mentioning}} {{that he was}} very much interested in Miss Gwilt, and he then went on to ask whether papa could tell him <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> family misfortunes--" ...|$|E
50|$|In September 1991, the Christian Science Board of Directors {{decided to}} publish The Destiny of The Mother Church, despite charges of blasphemy and protests that doing so {{violated}} the Manual of The Mother Church, which governs the church, including its publishing arm. It created a 15-book series of biographies of Eddy, {{the first time}} the church had published <b>anything</b> new <b>about</b> <b>her</b> in years.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{would find}} excuses to come without being brought, if {{he wished to}} come," [...] said the mother. [...] "But she isn't in his mind enough to make him. He goes away and doesn't think <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> She's a child. She's a good child, and I shall always say it; but she's nothing but a child. No, she's got to forget him." ...|$|R
60|$|Although I did {{not decide}} {{at that moment}} {{to go in and}} win, I was profoundly {{affected}} by his words. Without knowing <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>her</b> than these two meetings gave me, I took it for granted--quite without warrant, that Fuller had learned from Lorado that she was not committed to any one. It was fatuous in me but on this assumption I acted.|$|R
