25|$|Unofficial {{designation}} for 1121 aircraft modified under a Supplemental Type Certificate with {{an increased}} <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> available from 1971.|$|E
25|$|The two {{machines}} went to RAF Martlesham Heath in January 1933 for comparative trials. Despite the hopes, {{the trials}} were not conclusive. At the same <b>all-up</b> <b>weight,</b> the monoplane was faster {{and had a}} better rate of climb, but having an empty weight about 10% greater, it could not carry so great a payload.|$|E
25|$|Early {{press reports}} showed a large triplane, 68ft (17.9metres) and with equal-span six-bay wings of 133foot (40.5metre) span. The aircraft, {{to be capable}} of {{carrying}} heavy armament, was estimated to have an <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> of 21,450pounds (9,750kilogrammes) and was to be powered by six 140hp 104kW) engines driving three propellers, two of which were to be of tractor configuration and the third a pusher.|$|E
50|$|In early {{testing on}} the Avro Canada CF-100, the Maxaret allowed {{landings}} to be safely made on runways covered in ice. Since the operational requirements of most aircraft {{are defined by}} the best take-off or landing distances under all weather conditions, Maxaret allowed aircraft to operate at 15% higher <b>all-up</b> <b>weights.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of having been built over {{such a long time}} span by so many {{different}} manufacturers, the six main groups of the Class 19D all had different <b>all-up</b> <b>weights</b> and axle loadings, as shown in the table and the specifications in the infobox. Over the eleven years during which the Class 19D was being produced for the SAR, some alterations occurred.|$|R
2500|$|Taihōs {{upper and}} lower hangars were {{approximately}} [...] long and [...] high. The upper hangar was [...] wider than the lower. Fighters were normally stowed {{in the middle and}} forward sections of the upper hangar and were raised to flight deck level using the bow elevator to facilitate more rapid handling. Dive bombers occupied the remaining upper hangar spaces with torpedo bombers stowed in the lower hangar. With greater <b>all-up</b> <b>weights</b> and longer take-off runs than the fighters, these planes were brought up to the flight deck using the aft elevator where they could then be spotted as far astern as possible.|$|R
25|$|Heavy {{losses to}} enemy fighters forced the {{reintroduction}} of a rear gunner; early Il-2s were field modified by cutting {{a hole in}} the fuselage behind the cockpit for a gunner sitting on a canvas sling armed with a 12.7mm UBT machine gun in an improvised mounting. The semi-turret gun mount allowed the machine gun to be fired at angles of up to 35° upwards, 35° to starboard and 15° to port. Tests showed that maximum speed decreased by between 10 and 20km/h (6.2–12.4mph) and that the two-seater was more difficult to handle because the center of gravity was shifted backwards. At the beginning of March 1942, a production two-seat Il-2 with the new gunner's cockpit began manufacturer tests. The second cockpit and armament increased <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> by 170kg (374lb) so the flaps were allowed to be deployed at an angle of 17° to avoid an over-long takeoff run. The new variant had a lengthened fuselage compartment with an extended canopy offering some protection from the elements. Unlike the well-armoured cockpit of the pilot compartment with steel plating up to 12mm (0.47in) thick behind, beneath and on both sides as well as up to 65mm thick glass sections, the rear gunner was provided with 6mm (.23 in) thick armour, effective only against rifle-calibre rounds.|$|E
500|$|Rheinmetall {{introduced}} a larger 130mm tank gun at Eurosatory 2016 in June 2016. [...] Development commenced in 2015, financed entirely using internal funding, {{as a response}} to the Russian introduction of new generation armored vehicles like the T-14 Armata tank, and the first technical demonstrator (TD) was completed in May 2016. [...] The new 130mm gun has an L/51 chrome-lined smoothbore barrel with a vertical sliding breech mechanism, increased chamber volume, no muzzle brake, a thermal sleeve, and a muzzle reference system (MRS) enabling it to be bore sighted on a more regular basis without the crew needing to leave the platform. [...] Compared to the 2700kg 120mm gun, the 130mm has a [...] barrel and an <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> of 3000kg including the recoil system.|$|E
500|$|Roberto Bartini had {{designed}} and built the Stal-7 airliner whilst he was the chief designer at the ZOK NII GVF (— [...] "Factory for Special Construction at the Scientific Test Institute for the Civil Air Fleet"). The performance of the Stal-7 was exceptional, particularly in respect to its payload; at gross overload weight over 56% of the total weight was payload. During flight trials with maximum <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> the prototype crashed on takeoff in early 1938, resulting in the arrest of Bartini and his imprisonment in a Siberian Gulag in February 1938. The Stal-7 lay unrepaired until Vladimir Yermolaev was appointed as chief designer at OKB-240 after Bartini's arrest, {{with the task of}} transforming the Stal-7 design into a long-range bomber, a task made easier since Bartini had reserved space for a bomb bay in the fuselage. After repair the Stal-7 carried on with the flight-test programme, including a record-breaking nonstop flight on 28 August 1939 when it flew Moscow—Sverdlovsk—Sevastopol—Moscow; a distance of [...] at an average speed of [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{stability}} of the 4-8-4 wheel arrangement enabled it to be provided with driving wheels of up to 80 in diameter for high speed passenger and fast freight operation and, with the latest lateral control devices, the type was flexible on curves {{in spite of its}} eight-coupled drivers. The increased boiler size that became possible with this type, together with the high axle loads permitted on mainlines in North America, resulted in the design of some massive locomotives with <b>all-up</b> <b>weights</b> exceeding 350 tons with tender included. The 4-8-4 proved itself suitable for both express passenger and fast freight service. While it was not suited to heavy drag freight trains, faster and lighter trains were well suited to the type.|$|R
50|$|Early on in development, Fairey {{found that}} {{securing}} access to engines to power their design {{proved to be}} difficult. In November 1950, Ernest Hives, 1st Baron Hives protested that the design resources of Rolls-Royce were being stretched too thinly across multiple projects; accordingly, the initially-selected Dart engine was switched to the Mamba engine of rival firm Armstrong Siddeley. By July 1951, Fairey had re-submitted proposals using the Mamba engine in two and three-engine layouts, supporting <b>all-up</b> <b>weights</b> of 20,000 lb and 30,000 lb respectively; the adopted configuration of pairing the Mamba engine to auxiliary compressors {{was known as the}} Cobra. Due to complaints by Armstrong Siddeley that it too was lacking resources, Fairey also proposed the alternative use of engines such as the de Havilland Goblin and the Rolls-Royce Derwent turbojet powerplants to drive the forward propellers.|$|R
5000|$|Only {{one example}} of the Short-Mayo {{composite}} was built, the S.21 Maia with the registration G-ADHK and the S.20 Mercury G-ADHJ. The development of a more powerful and longer-range Empire boat (the Short S.26), the increase in allowable <b>all-up</b> <b>weights</b> with the standard [...] "C-Class", the further development of in-flight refuelling and the outbreak of the Second World War combined to render the approach obsolete. Maia was destroyed in Poole Harbour by German bombers on 11 May 1941. Mercury was flown to Felixstowe for use by 320 (Netherlands) Squadron RAF a Dutch seaplane reconnaissance unit serving with the Royal Air Force at RAF Pembroke Dock. When this squadron was re-equipped with Lockheed Hudsons, Mercury was returned to Shorts at Rochester on 9 August 1941 and broken up so that its aluminium could be recycled for use in the war effort.|$|R
500|$|In October 1947, {{with work}} already underway, Bristol had {{settled on a}} Centaurus-powered design, with an <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> of [...] and a payload of [...] The {{anticipated}} Karachi-Cairo run necessitated a 48-seat limit with a requirement for sufficient fuel for the lengthy stage. On 5 July 1949, the Ministry of Supply ordered five prototypes to this specification {{with the understanding that}} BOAC would contract for an additional 25 production examples. [...] BOAC purchased options for 25 aircraft on 28 July, to be powered initially with the Bristol Centaurus engine but to be re-fitted with the Bristol Proteus when available. In November 1948, the Type 175 design was revised again to accommodate 74 passengers and a longer span wing in a contemplated long-range version aimed at long-haul Empire and transatlantic routes rather than the medium-haul Empire routes originally planned. On reflection, BOAC decided that only a Proteus-engined aircraft was worth working on, necessitating a further redesign with Bristol eliminating the Centaurus option. Senior figures within BOAC such as the Deputy Chairman Whitney Straight, however, considered the Proteus engine to be [...] "an obsolete contraption". Despite BOAC's desire to have a turboprop engine, the Type 175 project was contingent on the Proteus passing a 150-hour Type Test.|$|E
2500|$|Stalling speeds {{were quite}} low. The typical Typhoon trait, {{as with most}} {{aircraft}} at the time, was to drop a wing sharply with flaps either up or down. The stalling speeds varied. The various loads depended on external fittings. <b>All-up</b> <b>weight</b> plus two [...] bombs (12,155lb in total) with flaps up could induce a stall at 90–100mph. With flaps down, stall was initiated at 70–75mph. Normal <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> (11,120lb) would see stall at 80–90 and 65–70mph respectively. With all ammunition and nearly all fuel expended (9,600lb) stall occurred at 75–80 and 65–70mph.|$|E
2500|$|The Eon 460 first flew on 26 April 1960 {{then went}} to RAE Bedford for testing and, whilst there, {{took part in the}} RAF and Interforces Competition held at RAF Odiham in July that year. [...] This machine, {{registered}} as G-APWL and designated 460 Type A had a wing with aspect ratio 20 and an <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> of 600lb (272kg). It was followed by the Type B with aspect ratio of 18 and an <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> of [...] 630lb (286kg), the values adopted for production machines. Both these aircraft had performances limited by turbulence generated behind the canopy so were followed by the Type C which was like the Type A but had a longer, lower hood and upper decking. [...] The final prototype variant was the Type D, like the Type C but with modified outer wing sections. [...] Production machines, produced from April 1963 were as the Type D but with wings of aspect ratio 18.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary Henschel {{publicity}} appropriately {{referred to}} them as the [...] "Henschel Giants". They were larger in most respects than Deutsche Reichsbahn's new Standard gauge Class 44 three-cylinder 2-10-0 locomotives. Although their <b>all-up</b> locomotive <b>weight</b> was almost the same, when {{considering the fact that}} the SAR's Cape gauge Class 18 had shorter axles and frame stretchers, saving weight that could then be built into other items such as the firebox, the Class 18 was the larger locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 August 1939, {{the first}} {{prototype}} (serial K8178), {{powered by the}} Vulture engines, made its maiden flight from Brooklands. This initial flight, flown by test pilot Joseph Summers, only lasted {{for a few minutes}} due to a defect in the carburettor linkage. By this point, the smaller Wellington bomber had made its maiden flight three years earlier and quantity production of the type had started 18 months prior. When fully equipped, the calculated <b>all-up</b> service <b>weight</b> of the first prototype was 42,182lb, almost double that of the weight originally given by Vickers in its initial tender for the design. Initial flight tests with the prototype revealed the type to possess unfavourable characteristics, being slow, underpowered, and unable to maintain altitude when flown on a single engine.|$|R
2500|$|Sources differ {{regarding}} {{the speed and}} endurance of the LCA. By 1945 the <b>all-up</b> loaded <b>weight</b> of an LCA had risen to 13½ tons, due to the addition of further armour {{and the weight of}} weaponry an infantry platoon expected to carry into battle. As with all wooden vessels after prolonged immersion, weight increased in the LCA and performance consequently fell. The equipment had evolved and so had the personnel. The time of needing a few craft for raiding was past and the time for invasion, for scores of flotillas dawned. Another obstacle to getting the best performance out of the LCA was the early war tendency to return ratings to their various barracks who had landing craft and small marine engine training. Unfortunately, the Navy appointed these ratings to duties without regard to the importance of their amphibious skills. In June 1941 this pattern was changed with the establishment of the Combined Operations naval base [...] at Inveraray. Combined Operations was then able to keep trained landing craft crew until boats became available.|$|R
2500|$|The DH.54 Highclere was {{designed}} to Air Ministry specification 40/22 for a larger version of the very successful DH.34 and the two aircraft had much in common, both in construction and general layout. Compared with the DH.34, the Highclere's passenger complement increased from nine to twelve, its <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> by 56% and its wing area by 70%. [...] They were both single-engined two-bay biplanes with fabric-covered wooden wings and with wooden-framed fuselages covered with thin plywood.|$|E
2500|$|Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the SAR from 1922 to 1929, {{prepared}} the specifications and the {{contract for the}} design and construction of these locomotives, the Class GL, was awarded to Beyer, Peacock and Company (BP). The locomotive was to be approximately equal to two Class 14 locomotives in power output with a maximum permitted axle loading of [...] owing {{to the use of}} [...] rail on both sections of the mainline, and a maximum <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> of [...]|$|E
2500|$|Both the Ba.32 and Ba.46 {{were three}} engine, {{cantilever}} low wing monoplanes with fixed, [...] conventional undercarriages. Since the Ba.46's military equipment, chiefly bombs and defensive armament, raised the <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> by some 45%, it was re-engined with 650hp (485kW) Alfa Romeo-built Bristol Pegasus radials which provided {{more than twice}} the power of the Ba.32's Pratt and Whitney Wasp Juniors. [...] Wing span and area were also increased, by 12% and 22% respectively. Other dimensions remained the same. [...] As a result, the Ba.46 was quicker both in level flight and particularly in the climb, reaching 5,000m in 18 minutes rather than the B.32's 52 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The initial 695 gliders were {{manufactured}} at Airspeed's {{factory in}} Christchurch, Hampshire; {{production of the}} remainder was performed by an assortment of subcontractors. These included Austin Motors, and a production group coordinated by the furniture manufacturers Harris Lebus. These same contractors would produce an improved model of the glider, designated as the AS.53 Horsa Mk II, while none would be manufactured by Airspeed themselves. The Horsa Mk II had been specifically designed for the carriage of vehicles, featuring a reinforced floor and a hinged nose section {{in order to accommodate}} such use. Other changes included the adoption of a twin nosewheel arrangement, a modified tow attachment and an increased <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Class GL {{embodied}} comparatively few {{features of}} any particular novelty. Instead, {{they were designed to}} make the best possible use of existing technologies to produce a locomotive of great power, efficiency and reliability. Their <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> of [...] coupled with their [...] axle loading closely matched the limits laid down by the SAR and was considered by Lionel Wiener, author of Articulated Locomotives, to show [...] "such mastery in general and detail design that we have pleasure on congratulating Messrs. Beyer, Peacock & Co. on this achievement." [...] Their tractive effort of [...] at 75% of boiler pressure remained the highest of any locomotive on the SAR {{for the duration of the}} steam era.|$|E
2500|$|Recommendations {{included}} an urgent call for cockpit voice recorders and for closer co-operation between the Civil Aviation Authority and British airlines. Though the report covered {{the state of}} industrial relations at BEA, no mention was made of it in its conclusions, despite the feelings of observers that it intruded directly and comprehensively onto the aircraft's flight deck. BEA ceased to exist as a separate entity in 1974, when it and the British Overseas Airways Corporation merged to form British Airways. A recommendation of the report that all British-registered civil passenger-carrying aircraft of more than [...] <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> should be equipped with cockpit voice recorders resulted in their fitting becoming mandatory on larger British-registered airliners from 1973.|$|E
2500|$|According to Folland, the Fo. 147 was to {{have been}} capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2, being limited by the buildup of heat {{generated}} by flying at such high speeds. It had a maximum <b>all-up</b> <b>weight</b> of 18,500lb, comparing well with the Gnat 5's more restrictive 11,100lb maximum. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the Fo. 147: [...] "would have provided a first-class flying test-bed for variable geometry theories...even a VG conversion of the standard Gnat Mk 2 fighter would have been an invaluable research tool". However, neither the Fo 147 or its successor, the Fo 148, would be developed to the prototype stage; the RAF showed little interest in possessing a variable geometry trainer, even when it intended to procure the General Dynamics F-111K strike aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, for a [...] "military load" [...] of , the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) {{had advised}} that {{work on an}} {{aircraft}} of [...] <b>all-up</b> <b>weight,</b> with a total static thrust of 3,200lb (14.2kN) should be started, with an 11,000lb (4,990kg) design for the expected, more powerful, W.2 and axial engine designs. George Carter's calculations based on the RAE work and his own investigations was that a [...] aircraft with two or four 20mm cannons and six 0.303 machine guns would have {{a top speed of}} 400–431mph at sea level and 450–470mph at 30,000ft. In January 1941 Gloster were told by Lord Beaverbrook that the twin jet fighter was of [...] "unique importance", and that the company was to stop work on a night-fighter being developed to Specification F.18/40.|$|E
