25|$|It sort of is {{a little}} puzzle <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> goes by - but they're all great things. 'I won't stop doing {{beautiful}} things and I won't do bad things.' It's very noble. I'm {{very proud of that}} song because it's very much like out of the world of Excalibur. To me, it's like Sir Lancelot or something - very noble and chivalrous. That's my favorite song on the record - it's very ambitious.|$|E
2500|$|President Abraham Lincoln asked Barnum and Nutt {{to come to}} the White House in November 1862. When the two arrived, Lincoln left {{a cabinet}} meeting to welcome them. Nutt asked Salmon P. Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, if he was the man who was {{spending}} so much of Uncle Sam's money. [...] Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, interrupted {{to say that he was}} the man. [...] "Well," [...] said Nutt, [...] "It is in a good cause, anyhow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> will come out all right." [...] As Barnum and Nutt were on their way out, President Lincoln shook Nutt's hand. He told the Commodore that he should [...] "wade ashore" [...] if his [...] "fleet" [...] was ever in danger. Nutt looked up and down Lincoln's long legs. [...] "I guess, Mr. President", he said, [...] "You could do that better than I could." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1994 Steć, Pazik, Major Donny MacNeil of Canada and Colonel Clayton Yaache of Ghana {{along with}} four Tunisian UNAMIR peacekeepers {{attempted}} unsuccessfully an evacuation {{of some of}} those trapped in the Hotel des Mille Collines with MacNeil and Steć reading the names of those to be evacuated in the crowded hotel lobby. [...] "I had a 'Schindler's List' of the people we were allowed to save. The conditions were: they did need a visa guarantee and a financial guarantee that they would be received outside Rwanda (...). Although approved by the Rwandan Chief of Staff, the convoy was halted by military and militia and following a very dangerous stand off they managed to return the refuges safely to the Hotel des Milles Collines. A few blocks away from the Mille Collines, there was a church, l' Eglise St. Famille, with more than 5000 refugees. Every night militia were killing people there. We did nothing to evacuate them <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> was because they didn't have visas".|$|E
6000|$|... "There's some grit in {{that young}} man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> just as well," [...] he observed. [...] "He's up against quite a big proposition." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{sat down}} in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold, {{whatever}} her secret might be, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it,</b> of course; so she commenced-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And here's a {{book for}} you," [...] said Frank. [...] "It's a real pretty book, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> pretty {{interesting}} reading too. It's all about the Turks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he had, it's {{got to be}} registered. You {{can find}} out at the record office, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> would pay you to go and see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope Unc' Billy {{is enjoying}} a good nap," [...] he chuckled. [...] "Drummer {{certainly}} {{has turned the}} joke back on Unc' Billy this time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> serves him right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} will do," [...] said Dick. [...] "We won't be able to couple it on quite so tightly as the other was but we can pack it well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> will last till we reach some port." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] she replied, {{with a faint}} note of truculence in her tone. [...] "You know I'm not {{short of}} money, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> was where <b>I</b> should find you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A living, I suppose. Some of the high-class weeklies {{feel the}} {{competition}} of the ten-cent monthlies. But 'Every Other Week' {{is about the}} best thing we've got in the literary way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> holding its own." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I think {{everyone}} {{on both sides}} of the political aisle just wants to see some sort of resolution to their status <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> just going to take longer now to figure out how that process is going to work." ...|$|R
60|$|DEAR POLLY, Opydilldock is first-rate for sprains. You {{put a lot}} on the flannel and do up your wrist, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> will be {{all right}} in the morning. Will you come a sleigh-ride tomorrow? I 'm awful sorry I hurt you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've heard {{say that}} he could," [...] replied Jimmy Skunk, [...] "but I don't know. One thing is sure, {{and that is that}} he is just as smart and sly as his great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather was, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> is just as well that his tongue is just as it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{shortly after}} this {{that he got}} the agency for a new cash-delivery system, and went {{on the road with}} it, {{traveling}} in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota. He came back after a three weeks' trip, quite jubilant. [...] "I've made a hundred dollars, Nell. I'm all right if this holds out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubt it," [...] said Hicks. [...] "I'm {{going to}} be seasick to-morrow. The captain's been shaking his head over the {{barometer}} and powwowing with the first officer. Something's up, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> a gale. Good-by; I shan't see you again {{for a week or}} so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't {{surprise}} me," [...] Euphrasia continued. [...] "He {{fell down}} the stairs here not long ago, and went right on about his business. He's never {{paid any attention to}} anybody, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> a mite late to expect him to begin now. Won't you set down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't {{unhealthy}} where I've bought," [...] said Lapham, rather enjoying her insinuation. [...] "I {{looked after}} that when <b>I</b> was trading; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> about as healthy on the Back Bay {{as it is}} here, anyway. I got that lot for you, Pert; I thought you'd want {{to build on the}} Back Bay some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was, {{but that}} was twenty-four years ago and before you were born. Got my first lift with the ten {{thousand}} dollars I made in the next state down this coast, besides the ague and shivers that have never quite left me. However, it's pretty healthy up here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> ought to suit Jake all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Slocum, grimly, [...] "I'll {{be quite}} {{glad to get}} out with a whole hide, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> couldn't be done if we started with a {{packhorse}} train or a wagon. I hadn't quite fixed to light out until I got the message that Devine, who didn't seem quite pleased with the last accounts, was coming in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "S'pose I'll have to," [...] grunted Mrs. Conover. She {{put away}} her pipe and took an unblushing swig {{from a black}} bottle she {{produced}} from a shelf near her. [...] "It's my opinion the kid won't live long. It's sickly. Min never had no gimp <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> hain't either. Likely it won't trouble any one long and good riddance, sez I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{means that}} Brother Gerrish thought Mr. Peck was hitting {{at him in}} that talk about the large commerce, and it means business," [...] said Putney. [...] "Brother Gerrish has made a {{beginning}}, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> {{the beginning of the}} end, unless we're all ready to take hold against him. What are you going to do?" ...|$|R
5000|$|O'Regan is {{frequently}} questioned about his flamboyant persona {{and subjected to}} numerous insinuations about his personal life: [...] "As my profile grows and as more people hear my music and see my videos, it’s something that I realize: {{people want to know}} more. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it’s</b> up to me to really decide how much more I want to give.” ...|$|R
6000|$|The grizzled axeman nodded. [...] "Well," [...] he volunteered, [...] "I'll stand watch. I was in {{the last}} two nights, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> up to me to see you through. We're going to have trouble, if one of those big logs fetches up across the sluiceway. The river's full of them, and she's risen 'most a foot since sun-up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I got. Now I'm {{coming to}} what I didn't get. It won't sound much of {{anything}} to you, but I don't wish you to be as old as I am before you find out. I can handle men, of course, and I'm no fool along my own lines, but--but I can't compete {{with the man who}} has been taught! I've picked up as I went along, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> sticks out all over me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, I just {{warmed up}} all over when I see you, Austen. I'm so glad to run across an honest man. We ain't forgot in Mercer what you did for Zeb Meader, and how you went against your interests. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> ain't done you any harm in the State. As many as thirty or forty members have spoke to me about it. And down here I've got so I just can't hold in any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{worrying}} about the boat we left {{on the edge of}} the ice," [...] he said. [...] "I've had a notion all along it was going to make trouble. Dampier would see the wreckage when he ran in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> would only mean one thing to him. He'd make quite certain he was right when he didn't find us at the inlet." [...] He paused and pointed towards the distant sea. [...] "You have got to push right on with Lewson as fast as you can while I try to bring the Siwash along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he replied, [...] "I guess not. We'll {{feel the}} wind fresher when she draws {{out from the}} land, and there's a streak of dry rot in her {{mainmast}} round the partners. That stick was sound right through when we put it into her, but it has stood the wind and weather quite a while, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> getting shaky, like its owner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Gordon, [...] "it's quite a nice clean slice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> {{not going}} to trouble you much, though you won't walk very far {{for a week or}} two. As soon as we can get you to the dam, I'll put a proper {{dressing}} on." [...] Then he looked up sharply. [...] "In the meanwhile, I don't quite see how you cut yourself like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{always been}} my luck," [...] she went on reflectingly, [...] "that when what I wanted to happen did happen, I never could take {{advantage}} of it. It was just like that to-night, when you handed me out the bill of fare, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ordered beefsteak. <b>And</b> it was like that when--when he came along--I didn't do what I thought I was going to do. It's terrible to fall in love, isn't it? I mean the real thing. I've read in books that it only comes once, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's this; and I {{wanted to}} ask you, anyway. You think there'd be any chance of my gettin' summer folks {{to come here and}} board if I was to put an {{advertisement}} in a Boston paper? I know it's a lonesome place, and there ain't what you may call attractions. But the folks from the hotels, sometimes, when they ride over in a stage to see the view, praise up the scenery, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> is sightly. I know that well enough; and I ain't afraid but what I can do for boarders as well as some, if not better. What do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't! ever so {{many folks}} have taken roots away, {{but they never}} thrive in gardens as they do on the hills where they belong. So I tell 'em to leave the dear bushes alone, and {{come up here and}} enjoy 'em in their own place. You might keep a plant of it in your hot-house, and it would blow I dare say; but it would never be half so lovely as my acres of them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> would only make you sad, seeing it so far from home, and pale and pining," [...] {{answered}} Becky, with her eyes on the green slopes where the mountain-laurel braved the wintry snow, and came out fresh and early in the spring.|$|E
6000|$|Devine laughed. [...] "It's quite easy. You {{have just}} about sense enough to worry anybody, or you wouldn't have dumped that ore into the Dayspring, and worked {{off one of}} the richest mines in the {{province}} on to me. Well, when I saw you meant to strike me on the Canopus, I just let you get to work because it suited me. I figured it would keep you busy while I took out timber-rights and bought up land round the Dayspring. Nobody believed in Allonby, and I got what I wanted at quite a reasonable figure. I'm holding the mine and everything worth while now. There's nothing left for you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> would be wiser to get hold of a man of your own weight next time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the end of}} that {{precious}} pair, so far as we are concerned," [...] said he with a sigh of relief. [...] "Pierre is {{wise enough}} to know that this isn't a healthy country for them, and they won't bother us any more. He's got the Indian where the hair is short now, for the latter hasn't even a knife, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> just as well. Now we'll finish our job here and get back to camp. You fellows rustle up some birch bark and dry wood and heap it up inside the cabin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want your}} button," [...] {{answered}} the policeman. He hesitated a moment. [...] "I shall be round {{at the court}} in the morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> if <b>it</b> ain't right {{we can make it}} so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most of {{the boys}} think {{a good deal of}} Elcot, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> natural. He has given quite a few of them a lift now and then. There's Winthrop and Thorne, for instance--he {{guaranteed}} Maverick for a thousand dollars, somebody told me--and now he's putting a good deal more into this creamery scheme. From experience of their habits, I should say he must find that kind of thing expensive now and then. Perhaps, if one might suggest it, that is why he lives as plainly as he does. In a way, it's rather fine of him, though it wouldn't appeal to me." ...|$|R
