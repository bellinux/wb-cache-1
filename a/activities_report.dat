50|$|A {{study on}} Salinas Lake in Peru shows that mining {{companies}} have established themselves {{adjacent to the}} flamingos' nesting sites, and some mining is performed near flamingo breeding grounds and feeding sites. Flamingos abandoned their nesting sites if mining was initiated after the establishment of nesting colonies and in close proximity. Results from {{this study showed that}} an increase of hydrocarbon exploration resulted in a decreased success rate for breeding. Less than one percent of the flamingos observed were juveniles. The decreased reproductive success may be due to borax exposure or to an altered environment caused by bulldozers disturbing the lake bed. Mining creates a muddy environment, which entraps flamingos, thus increasing mortality. Surveys conducted on residents near the mining <b>activities</b> <b>report</b> sightings of dead flamingos exhumed by the bulldozers.|$|E
5000|$|Participants in the temple's <b>activities</b> <b>report</b> {{that the}} temple {{feels like a}} family. According to Taylor, the temple's success may be partly {{explained}} by the flexible social structure of the temple, allowing for openness to newcomers. The temple organizes its followers into groups with certain interests. The temple's lifestyle promotes good family values and emphasizes a network of like-minded friends to facilitate spiritual development. Wat Phra Dhammakaya encourages people to persuade others to make merit, because such persuasion is in itself considered a merit. In activities of the temple, even on retreats, ample opportunity is therefore given for socializing and spiritual friendship. In teachings of the temple, practitioners are encouraged to set up kalyanamitta homes ('homes of good spiritual friends') to meditate together with friends and family, and practitioners are trained to take on leading roles. Wat Phra Dhammakaya makes it a point that homes, temples and schools should unite in creating responsible members of society, and organizes programs to that effect. Communities of kalyanamittas also have an exemplary effect, according to the temple. One {{of the reasons why}} the temple emphasizes huge gatherings during ceremonies, as stated in the temple's literature, is that such gatherings will effect that [...] "people of the world will stop, think and ask themselves why so many people have gathered in one place to meditate.(...) and they will strive to find the answer for themselves.".|$|E
5000|$|Joe Verret (11 December 1945 - 30 March 2010) was an American Trotskyite {{who worked}} in civil rights in the South in the 1960s, and who {{was the target of}} state repression. Born in New Orleans, Verret was {{involved}} in founding the Spartacist League (US) in 1966, serving on the central committee. Prior to the formation of the Spartacist League, Verret was part of the American Socialist Organising Committee, which had split from the Socialist Party. Joe's Trotskyite work in the 1960s centred on New Orleans, involving the Southern Student Organizing Committee, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and civil rights protests. Verret's activities were an element of the Louisiana Joint Legislative Committee on Un-American <b>Activities</b> <b>Report</b> 9, on [...] "The Spartacist League and Certain Other Communist Activities in South Louisiana." [...] Verret achieved full membership of the Spartacist League Central Committee in 1969. Also in 1969, despite being an anti-war activist, Verret was drafted. Following the Spartacist line on war, Verret accepted the draft in order to serve alongside fellow workers. Verret was involved in the G.I. Voice newsletter supporting soldiers taking a class war position against the US state. The US Army reacted to Verret's politics by making him serve unusually long training, through individual intimidation, and through placing him in desk work in Vietnam. In 1976 Verret moved to London and {{played a role in the}} founding of the Spartacist League/Britain in 1978. In 1979 Verret was elected a member of the International Executive Committee of the now International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist). He also served as National Chairman of the Trotskyist League of Canada in the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1981 Verret returned to the US, where he led the Atlanta Local of the Spartacist League from 1983 until 1996. In 1996 he moved to Los Angeles.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of research is}} to find out the financial reporting effectiveness of Mandiri People Empowerment National Program (PNPM) in Paranggupito Subdistrict viewed from the form of <b>activity</b> <b>reporting,</b> reporting period/time, as well as the user of <b>activity</b> <b>report.</b> In line with this objective, the author employed a descriptive qualitative method. Viewed from the aspect studied, this research is a case study. In this study, the sampling technique employed was purposive sampling. The data sources employed were informant, document and archive. Techniques of collecting data used were interview, observation and document analysis. Technique of analyzing data used was an interactive model of analysis. Considering the result of data analysis and discussion, it can be concluded that: (1) financial reporting is done using standard financial form from the Regency government consisting of daily cash book, bank book, inventory book, cash flow <b>report,</b> balance, <b>activity</b> operational <b>report,</b> loan progress report, and collectibility <b>report.</b> (2) <b>Activity</b> <b>report</b> delivery period and level has been consistent with the regulation determined by the central government. Independent PNPM Reporting in Paranggupito Subdistrict is done periodically and gradually. PNPM fund reporting is carried out periodically monthly. Meanwhile, the gradual reporting is done through structural (government apparatus) and functional (consultant and facilitator) paths in the {{objective of}} ensuring the quick, proper and accurate information flow from the information maker to the user. (3) The <b>activity</b> <b>Report</b> of Paranggupito Subdistrict Activity Management Unit aims to meet the information requirement of the report user namely Subdistrict Activity Operational Guarantor, subdistrict head, subdistrict facilitator (F-Kec) and subdistrict technical facilitator, Supervising Agency of UPK (BP-UPK), Verification Team (TV), Local Assistant (PL), Controller Team, Interural Cooperation Board (BKAD), as well as Subdistrict Adhoc Board. (4) Financial Reporting organized by the administrator of Paranggupito Subdistrict’s UPK covering the <b>activity</b> <b>report</b> as well as activity plan for the next month is sufficiently effective because it has been consistent with the <b>activity</b> <b>report</b> user’s requirement as well as consistent with the standard defined by the central government included in the Operational Technical Manual (PTO) of PNPM. ...|$|R
