40|$|Aim To {{compare the}} {{dissolution}} profi les of various enteric-coated low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) tablets marketed in Indonesia. Methods The dissolution study {{was carried out}} according to US Pharmacocopoeiae (USP) /European Pharmacopoeiae, method A, using USP apparatus 1 (basket) 100 rpm, with 2 media: 0. 1 N HCl, 120 minutes for <b>acid</b> <b>stage,</b> and phosphate buffer pH 6. 8, 90 minutes for buffer stage. The sampling points were 120 minutes for the <b>acid</b> <b>stage,</b> and every 10 minutes until 90 minutes for the buffer stage. The acetylsalicylic acid was assayed using spectrophotometry at 280 nm for the acid stage, and at 265 nm for the buffer stage. The free salicylic acid was determined {{only at the end}} of the buffer stage with HPLC method. There were 6 test products (Cardio Aspirin® 100 mg, Aptor® 100 mg, Ascardia® 80 mg, Thrombo Aspilet® 80 mg, Astika® 100 mg and Farmasal® 100 mg), 3 batches for each product, and 6 units for each batch. Results The amount of ASA released from each ASA product tested at the end of <b>acid</b> <b>stage</b> (120 minutes) ranged from  1. 79 % for Cardio Aspirin® to 6. 92 % for Thrombo Aspilet®, all conformed to the compendial requirement for enteric-coated product (< 10 %). The amount of salicylic acid observed {{at the end of the}} dissolution test ranged from 3. 47 % for Cardio Aspirin® to 10. 90 % for Astika® and 11. 90 % for Thrombo Aspilet®. Thrombo Aspilet® showed sustained-release properties, causing high variability in ASA release, such that one of the 3 batches tested did not fulfill the compendial requirement of more than 75 % (the release was only 55. 11 %). High variability in ASA release between batches was also found with Farmasal® at 10, 20, and 30 minutes in buffer medium. The lowest effective dose of ASA as an antiplatelet drug for longterm use is 75 mg of plain ASA, and this is equivalent to 100 mg of enteric-coated ASA. Conclusions All of the low-dose ASA preparations marketed in Indonesia are enteric-coated products, while Thrombo Aspilet® is not only an enteric-coated but also a sustained-release product. Cardio Aspirin®, followed by Aptor®, has the right dose for low-dose enteric-coated preparation (100 mg), produces consistent ASA release between batches, and the most stable towards deacetylation (antiplatelet inactivation).

30|$|Moreover, it {{has been}} {{described}} by McCune et al. (1975) that “rock sample with permeability less than 100 mD could be acidized more successfully compare to the sands having more permeability. Study on porosity showed that sandstone formation with the porosity less than 20 % was treated much more adequately than those with porosity 25 % or more.” Other than acids, some additives are also added during sandstone acidizing procedure for different purposes. Frenier and Hill (2002) showed that these additives have a minimal effect on the performance of the acids. For example, stimulation process is not affected by the addition of certain additives such as surfactants and corrosion inhibitors. These additives are added to minimize other problems like corrosion and incompatibility (Rabie and Nasr-El-Din 2015). Incompatibility problems can be minimized using surfactant additives in the main <b>acid</b> and after-flush <b>stages.</b> Corrosion inhibitors are used at concentrations of 0.1 % uniformly throughout the <b>acid</b> <b>stages</b> to protect the metal integrity (McLeod et al. 1983). Iron sequestrants are added in the HCl stage to stabilize any dissolved iron and to minimize the precipitation of iron compounds. A mutual solvent ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGMBE) was included in the after-flush stage to restore the formation wettability and to reduce the surface tension of the returning spent acids Sutton and Lasater (1972).|$|R
30|$|Sandstone {{formations}} {{are challenging}} to acidize {{because of the}} presence of alumino-silicates such as clays, zeolites, and feldspars, which may lead to unwanted precipitates in contact with mud acids as a result of secondary and tertiary reaction products. For instance, smectite and mixed layer clays are unstable in HCl at temperatures of approximately 150  °F. Chlorite is unstable in presence of HCl at temperatures above 125  °F. When contacted with HCl, the clay structure may disintegrate, releasing iron which may precipitate in presence of HCl acid (Rae and Di Lullo 2003). Therefore, formations with high levels of chlorite respond best to acid formulations based on acetic acid rather than hydrochloric acid, since the former limits iron liberation and thereby reduces the risk of precipitates from iron reaction products (Nasr-El-Din and Al-Humaidan 2001; Hashem et al. 1999). In formations with high levels of feldspar (> 20  %), a common practice is to limit the strength of HF <b>acid</b> <b>stages</b> to reduce the formation of complex fluorosilicate precipitates and other species that would result from excessive dissolution of the mineral by stronger acid (Coulter and Jennings 1997).|$|R
30|$|Experiments were {{performed}} by Shafiq et al. (2013 a) {{to analyze the}} combination of acetic acid and hydrochloric acid in pre-flush stage. The authors then compare the result with the conventional use of only hydrochloric acid in that stage.

This proved that the usability of this acid combination is much better {{to be used as}} a pre-flush acid than the conventional 10 % HCl, which resulted in only 10.9 % porosity change. At the same time, this research also highlighted the importance of pre-flush stage in matrix acidizing to dissolve the carbonates to prevent precipitation during the main <b>acid</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E

40|$|Odor is an {{unwanted}} consequence of municipal waste processing {{and disposal of}} sludge. Anaerobic digestion of sludge generates {{a broad range of}} odorants during the treatment process. In the first <b>stage</b> (<b>acid</b> fermentation), sugars, lipids, colloidal solids, and dissolved carbonaceous matter are converted to organic acids with the evolution of H 2 S and CO 2; pH drops during this stage. In the next <b>stage</b> (<b>acid</b> regression), the organic <b>acids</b> (formed in <b>stage</b> 1) along with some proteins are digested to acetate and ammonia compounds; pH rises slowly during this stage.

The resultant humic mass has more odor if thermophilic digestion rather than mesophilic digestion is used. The sludge is then stabilized by chlorine or lime to render the material less suitable for microbial growth. It is also heated to reduce the quantity of moisture.

This study was carried out to investigate the cause of quality failure of omeprazole in Cambodia in 2010 and Myanmar in 2014. Methods: We conducted pharmacopoeial quantity, content uniformity and dissolution tests of 156 samples of omeprazole capsules collected in Cambodia in 2010 and Myanmar in 2014. High failure rates were found, especially in dissolution testing, and detailed investigation of several unacceptable samples was carried out by means of in-vitro dissolution profiling, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) to identify the cause of failure. Results: Dissolution profiling with and without the <b>acid</b> <b>stage</b> showed that acid caused premature omeprazole release, indicating that the enteric coating of the omeprazole granules was ineffective. SEM examination of two failed samples revealed cracked and broken granules mixed with apparently intact omeprazole granules in the capsule. X-ray CT examination indicated that some granules of failed samples completely lacked enteric coating, and others had incomplete and non-uniform enteric coating or malformation. Conclusions: Omeprazole capsules collected in Myanmar and Cambodia showed high failure rates in pharmacopoeial tests, especially dissolution tests. Some samples were found to have ineffective or absent enteric coating of the granules, resulting in premature dissolution and degradation in acidic conditions.

The deposition of potential acid varied from 490 to 810 mol ha(- 1) yr(- 1). On Terschelling, the amount of potential acid was highest and around 800 mol ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for both sites. On Schiermonnikoog, the amount of potential acid was lowest for the dune slacks in the north-western part of the island and it showed an increase for slacks towards {{the eastern part of the}} island. Calcium is the main cation leached from the topsoil followed by sodium, magnesium and potassium. Nitrogen or ammonium hardly leached from the topsoil layer. The shift from basiphilous pioneer communities toward older and more <b>acid</b> <b>stages</b> of dune slack succession appears to be caused primarily by leaching of base cations rather than eutrophication...|$|R
