40|$|The {{practice}} of slash-and-burn agriculture in poor tropical countries is often {{one of the}} main causes for deforestation, leading to biodiversity loss and to potential externality effects on lowland agricultural productivity. Under innovative environmental policies, direct conservation payments to farmers have started being implemented to induce them to give up slash-and-burn agriculture as well as the use of forest resources altogether. However, appropriate compensation levels are often difficult to get to. Using a stochastic payment card format in a case study in Madagascar, it is estimated that farmers would give up slash-andburn agriculture for median <b>annual</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> at a lower bound of around 85 $ per household. The econometric analysis shows that there is a systematic relationship between poverty and the required compensation for forgoing land use. Better educated and older households demand higher payments. deforestation, conservation payments, payment card, biodiversity...|$|E

As expected, the econometric analysis shows that there exists a systematic relation between poverty and the required compensation for forgone land use.

Better educated and older households require higher payments...|$|E
50|$|The Hunnic {{problem had}} not gone away. In 449, Chrysaphius, with the {{approval}} of Theodosius, suborned Edecon, the chief of Attila's guards, to assassinate him. But he later betrayed the plot to Attila, who demanded the head of Chrysaphius. Chrysaphius sent an envoy with money, and Attila consented in contemptuous language to forgive him and the emperor provided that he received an <b>annual</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>payment</b> of 700 pounds of gold a year. This burden of taxes on an empire already devastated by the ravages of the Huns made the already unpopular favourite deeply hated. Gibbon remarks that the money involved would have more than financed any war against Attila.|$|R

40|$|In Australia, {{states and}} territories are moving ahead with {{resolution}} of Native Title claims to {{national parks and}} other protected areas. Under the Traditional Owner Settlement Bill 2010 (Victoria), Aboriginal groups that can prove a traditional rather than continuous connection to land are able to forge agreements with the government to jointly manage national parks. The terms of ILUAS for parks, and other lease-back agreements, include <b>annual</b> rental <b>payments,</b> <b>compensation</b> or economic development funds. Park ILUAS also include terms for Indigenous training and employment in parks, and preferential provision of Indigenous tours or park services. Joint management has stimulated Indigenous investment in park tourism facilities or enterprises. Future ILUAs for parks should include Indigenous contracts for provision of park services, and provision for <b>payment</b> or <b>compensation</b> for other Indigenous property rights (e,g. carbon credits). Indigenous carbon rights and sequestration is an emerging issue (Barnsley, 2009, Sheehan, 2010). In Victoria, traditional owner groups will be compensated for carbon sequestration activities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> for farmers affected by an animal disease outbreak. Recent literature has questioned the scope for the widely used “single mechanism” of <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> to incentivise farmers both to undertake costly on-farm biosecurity and to comply with disease reporting requirements. This paper develops a simple theoretical model of the farmer’s decision environment in this situation and uses a numerical analysis to illustrate both {{the potential for a}} range of levels of <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> to achieve this dual incentivising, and how this range is affected by changes in the parameter values of the farmer’s decision environment. The findings of the paper are used to suggest a range of policy implications in relation to <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> in the UK...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantification}} of the <b>compensation</b> <b>payment</b> for expropriation, {{which is}} mainly an economic assessment issue, has been not sufficiently studied above all in {{relation with the}} complex relationships that it has with the judicial-normative aspects which regulates the expropriation for public purposes. The case of partial expropriation, the economic-estimative meaning of the expression “agricultural value” and the quantification criteria for the <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> {{in the case of}} building areas represent for sure some of the most relevant issues concerning the quantification of the <b>compensation</b> <b>payment.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} go in deeper detail on those issues which offer very interesting cues of thoughts.

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> for biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures has grown {{over the past}} decade, particularly in connection with agri-environmental policy. Given that both the costs {{and the benefits of}} biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures are subject to spatial variation, the criterion of cost-effectiveness calls for spatially heterogeneous <b>compensation</b> <b>payments.</b> However, when deciding whether to implement uniform or heterogeneous <b>compensation</b> <b>payments,</b> the regulator has to compare the disadvantage of uniform payments in terms of cost-effectiveness with the disadvantages of spatially heterogeneous payments. To help resolve this issue, this paper provides a simple ecological-economic model that allows the reduced cost-effectiveness associated with uniform payments for biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures to be assessed for different types of benefit and cost functions.

For each group of measures, the logarithmic transformations of cumulative payments received (comp, org, int, for) were used to estimate the policy impacts on HNV.|$|R
30|$|The {{individual}} rationality constraints (IR TB) are met {{because of}} the limited liability constraints (LL TB) and the incentive compatibility constraints (IC TB).

Thus, the <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> w_i^L,TB for i= 1, 2 are optimally set equal to zero.|$|R

25|$|Charges and countercharges {{of border}} incursions and {{protection}} of fugitives led to an unsuccessful Bhutanese mission to Calcutta in 1852. Among other demands, the mission sought increased compensation for its former Duars territories; instead the British deducted nearly 3,000 rupees from the <b>annual</b> <b>compensation</b> and demanded an apology for alleged plundering of British-protected lands {{by members of the}} mission. Following more incidents and the prospect of an anti-Bhutan rebellion in the Bengal Duars, British troops deployed to the frontier in the mid-1850s. The Sepoy Rebellion in India in 1857-58 and the demise of the British East India Company's rule prevented immediate British action. Bhutanese armed forces raided Sikkim and Cooch Behar in 1862, seizing people, property, and money. The British responded by withholding all <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> and demanding release of all captives and return of stolen property. Demands to the Druk Desi went unheeded, as he was alleged to be unaware of his frontier officials' actions against Sikkim and Cooch Behar.|$|R
30|$|The agents’ reports {{affect the}} principal’s choice of {{coordinating}} adaptions. When the agents misreport, the principal conducts imperfect coordination. Thus, the probability to obtain high earnings is reduced compared to truthful reports. The agents’ <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> {{are linked to}} the observable realization of the earnings. A reduced probability to achieve high earnings hurts the agents’ probability to receive the <b>compensation</b> <b>payment</b> associated with high earnings. The principal sets the <b>compensation</b> <b>payments,</b> so that each agent finds it optimal to provide high effort and report truthfully. Compared to the top-down budgeting process, the additional truth-telling issue increases the principal’s incentive costs. The solution to the principal’s optimization program is summarized in Proposition 2.|$|R
