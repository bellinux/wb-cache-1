25|$|To a small extent, {{hemoglobin}} A slowly combines with glucose at {{the terminal}} valine (an alpha <b>aminoacid)</b> of each β chain. The resulting molecule {{is often referred}} to as Hb A1c. As the concentration of glucose in the blood increases, the percentage of Hb A that turns into Hb A1c increases. In diabetics whose glucose usually runs high, the percent Hb A1c also runs high. Because of the slow rate of Hb A combination with glucose, the Hb A1c percentage is representative of glucose level in the blood averaged over a longer time (the half-life of red blood cells, which is typically 50–55 days).|$|E
25|$|Gramicidin S {{differs from}} other {{gramicidin}} types {{in that it}} is a cationic cyclic decapeptide and has a structure of an anti-parallel beta-sheet. Gramicidin S molecule is amphiphilic, with hydrophobic amino acids (D-Phe, Val, Leu side chains) and charged <b>aminoacid</b> (L-Orn). It exhibits strong antibiotic activity towards Gram-negative and Gram-positive and even several pathogenic fungi. The mode of action is not entirely agreed upon, but it is generally accepted that it is disruption of the lipid membrane and enhancement of the permeability of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Unfortunately, being hemolytic at even low concentrations, gramicidin S is only used as topical applications at present. Additionally, Gramicidin S has been employed as a spermicide and therapeutic for genital ulcers caused by sexually transmitted disease.|$|E

The increase of <b>aminoacids</b> leveland particularly the level of essential <b>aminoacids</b> in wheat grain under bacterization was demonstrated, this fact accounting {{for the quality of}} grain as an important protein source. Increase of <b>aminoacids</b> content with the use of biopreparations on low-fertile soil ensures acquisition of biologically valuable grain with the decrease of mineral fertilizers dosage and emphasizes the role of biopreparations in the production of ecologically pure high quality products.

30|$|At lower <b>aminoacids</b> concentrations, the {{sorption}} process {{does not}} seem to be influenced by temperature and the amounts of <b>aminoacids</b> removed are approximately the same for all conditions. The LDH reconstruction with both <b>aminoacids</b> seems to be very similar. The regeneration at low <b>aminoacids</b> concentrations occurs predominantly via intercalation of OH- anions from aqueous solution (pH 10). As the amino acid concentration increases, a competition between OH- and amino acid takes place with amino acid intercalation. At lower amino acid concentrations, approximately 99 % of Asp or Glu are removed; whereas, at higher amino acid concentration, near the limit of solubility, the extraction rate is approximately 20 %. The electrokinetical potential curves related to each isotherm are also very similar. Positives values at low equilibrium concentrations decrease, reaching values as negative as − 6 mV, while the <b>aminoacids</b> concentration increase. The profiles of electrokinetical potential curves are in agreement with the respective isotherm profile.|$|R

50|$|Tracy worked {{primarily}} with Gregory {{until his death}} in 1990. Their collaboration defined understanding of the acid-secretory hormone gastrin during the 1960s and 70s.

Between 1962 and 1968 their work isolated gastrin {{for the first time and}} sequenced it (in collaboration with George Kenner from the Department of Chemistry at University of Liverpool).

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{investigates the}} interaction between the polysaccharide sodium hyaluronate (HA) and some amphiphilic molecules. As amphiphilic molecules the <b>aminoacids</b> lysine and 6 – aminocaproic acids were chosen. The presence of the carboxylic group on HA and the aminogroup on the <b>aminoacids</b> suggests electrostatic interaction between these two compounds. This supposal offers the possibility to modificate HA and uses it as a new type of a carrier of bioactive compounds, for example medicals. The HA of two molecular weights (1. 75 MDa and 70 kDa) were chosen {{for the study of the}} interactions with the <b>aminoacids.</b> Solutions of HA and stock solutions of the <b>aminoacids</b> were prepared for their mutual mixing in the various volume ratios. The solutions and the mixtures were measured in three types of environment: pure water, 0. 15 M solution of NaCl and in phosphate buffer (PBS) of pH 6. The interactions were investigated by means of reometry. Our results show, the presence of interactions between HA and the <b>aminoacids</b> mainly in the system consisting the 1. 75 MDa HA and lysine in water.
