Two important Igbo traditional festivals {{take place in}} Enugu annually; the Mmanwu festival and the New yam festival. The Mmanwu festival takes place in November and features various types of masquerades that each have a name. This festival is held at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium as a parade of carnival-like masquerades that are accompanied by music and it {{is supported by the}} Enugu Council of <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Culture.</b> The second important Igbo festival, the New yam festival known as 'iwa ji', is held between August and October marking the harvesting and feasting of the new yam. The yam is a root vegetable that is the staple crop and a cultural symbol for the Igbo people. Recently created festivals include the Enugu Festival of Arts which is managed by the Enugu Council of <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Culture.</b> The festival highlights African culture and traditions and it is here that the Enugu Council of <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Culture</b> included the Mmanwu parade as part of the events.
