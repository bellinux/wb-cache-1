5|$|Due to the {{fragmentary nature}} of known Paraceratherium fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several {{different}} ways since its discovery. In 1923, W. D. Matthew supervised <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using the proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum skeleton from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life {{that could only be}} found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a {{comfortable}} place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E

5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in 1817, {{the son of a}} London musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E
5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in London in 1817, {{the son of a}} musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to both a deep knowledge of the Bible and a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and six years later was proficient enough as <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> earn a living as a portrait painter and cricket illustrator. Aged 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson family {{attends a}} prison rodeo where Marge meets Jack Crowley, a convict whom she {{believes}} to have great artistic potential after becoming {{impressed with his}} work. She later teaches a class on being <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> the prisoners and befriends Jack. With Marge's help, Jack is granted parole under her custody. Marge soon finds a mural-painting job at Springfield Elementary School for him. Jack paints a powerful mural symbolizing school spirit with a warrior woman riding a puma, which the whole school likes, but Principal Skinner demands he tone it down using his idea of a cartoonish puma walking with two children under a rainbow in a fantasy land. Jack reluctantly gives into his wishes; however, upon its unveiling, the new mural is panned by everyone in town. Skinner blames Jack and fires him.|$|E

25|$|Debate {{on keeping}} or {{changing}} the New Zealand Flag started before May 1973, when a remit {{to change the}} flag was voted down by the Labour Party at their national conference.

25|$|Noten {{started the}} project with interviews, asking the taxi drivers {{how they felt}} about art, what they knew about MIMA and what they would like him, as <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> <b>to</b> create for their cars.

25|$|The Pisani Dossi Ms. was {{published}} in facsimile by Francesco Novati in 1902, including the only reproductions of {{a copy of the}} Flower of Battle that are clearly in the public domain. However, it is unclear how accurate this facsimile is as evidence suggests that Novati may have hired <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> create a tracing of the original manuscript rather than reproducing it directly. This would have provided ample opportunity for errors to creep into the images, and might also account for the significant divergences from the artistic style of the Getty and the Morgan.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 20 {{years she}} joined a convent in Warsaw, Poland, was later {{transferred}} to Płock, and then to Vilnius where she met her confessor Father Michał Sopoćko, who supported her devotion to the Divine Mercy. Faustina and Sopoćko directed <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> paint the first Divine Mercy image, based on Faustina's vision of Jesus. Sopoćko used the image in celebrating the first Mass on the first Sunday after Easter. Subsequently, Pope John Paul II established the Feast of Divine Mercy on that Sunday of each liturgical year.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} truly Renaissance {{images in}} Florence {{date from the}} first year of the century known in Italian as Quattrocento, synonymous with the Early Renaissance. At that date a competition was held to find <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> create a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistry of St. John, the oldest remaining church in the city. The Baptistry is a large octagonal building in the Romanesque style, whose origins had been forgotten and which was popularly believed to date from Roman times. The interior of its dome is decorated with an enormous mosaic figure of Christ in Majesty thought to have been designed by Coppo di Marcovaldo. It has three large portals, the central one being filled at that time by a set of doors created by Andrea Pisano eighty years earlier.|$|E

It is not <b>an</b> <b>artist's</b> responsibility <b>to</b> capture what is there, it should be <b>an</b> <b>artist's</b> challenge <b>to</b> exaggerate or diminish what already exists." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{process for}} {{selecting}} <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> design the memorial was somewhat convoluted. Many artists made inquiries with the UDC about designing the memorial in 1909, and some submitted proposals, but the ACMA declined to consider any design {{because it was}} still raising funds. The design committee first met on May 16, 1910. Rev. McKim made the motion that the memorial should depict an event in which General Robert E. Lee attempted to ride into the Battle of the Wilderness to rally his troops. Lee was stopped by a private who seized the bridle of Lee's horse and prevented him from going, declaring that the troops would rally themselves. His motion was accepted. Herbert submitted the proposed design to an undisclosed artist to have a model developed and to get an aesthetic opinion about McKim's idea.|$|E

Shipley, along with the New Zealand Tourism Board, backed the quasi-national silver fern flag, using a white silver fern on a black background as a possible alternative flag, {{along the lines of the}} Canadian Maple Leaf flag. On 5 August 2010 Labour list MP Charles Chauvel introduced a member's bill for a consultative commission followed by a referendum on the New Zealand flag.|$|E

From the 1970s the Coast Guard started calling regularly at Ny-Ålesund {{to assist in}} the transport of scientific instruments. During the early 1980s a plan for cultural heritage management was developed, which included the renovation of several older houses. Members of the Norwegian Railway Club restored a train which was put on display. Ny-Ålesund Town and Mine Museum opened in 1988. Very little of the town was listed with the initial pre-1900 conservation rules from 1974, but from 1992 larger parts were listed following automatic listing of all pre-1945 human traces. There had also since the 1970s been irregular visits by artists. From 1986 a building was refurbished to allow for <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> stay there at any time. By 1985 there were sixteen universities with scientific activities. In 1987 the University of Tromsø built a scientific greenhouse next to the school and by 1987 Kings Bay had twenty people working in Ny-Ålesund during the summer.|$|E
