50|$|The Tell Brak Head is {{carved from}} {{alabaster}} {{and appears to}} wear a head-dress. The face is elongated with large almond shaped eyes, circular ears and <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> <b>smiling</b> mouth. It {{has been difficult to}} determine whether the figure represents a deity or worshipper. A thin vertical depression {{at the back of the}} head, with holes either side for nails, suggests that it was once fixed to a pole and used during religious ceremonies. No other similar sculptures were found at the site, and there are few other representations comparable to the head from this period in the region.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{fallen in love}} with you, Mr. Boldwood--certainly I must say that." [...] She allowed <b>a</b> very <b>small</b> <b>smile</b> to creep for the first time over her serious face in saying this, and the white row of upper teeth, and keenly-cut lips already noticed, {{suggested}} an idea of heartlessness, which was immediately contradicted by the pleasant eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile</b> {{of relief}} came on his face, {{and he put}} out his hand from the bed. He lay with the disorderly clothes pulled up to his chin. His face was {{discoloured}} and rather bloated, his nose swollen.|$|E

50|$|Pride, {{a feeling}} of {{satisfied}} accomplishment, and/or hubris and self-importance. Proud people tend to show <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile,</b> tilt their heads back, and even place their hands on their hips and improve posture. They also regularly choose to share their accomplishments with others.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to that of Activision's Kaboom!, in which the player must prevent objects dropping from the top of the screen from reaching the bottom by positioning their character directly under the falling objects. In Tooth Protectors, the objects are small [...] "snack" [...] squares dropped by the [...] "Snack Attacker", a menacing-looking face that moves horizontally along the top of the screen. The player's character is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smiling</b> face carrying <b>a</b> strand of dental floss above its head. The player must prevent the snack squares from reaching the row of white teeth along the bottom of the screen; repeated hits by the snacks cause the teeth to blink and disappear from tooth decay.|$|R

60|$|We {{had passed}} {{between the white}} posts of a gate and up a curving drive, lined with {{rhododendron}} bushes. Beyond stood a low brick house, picked out with white woodwork, very comfortable and pretty. Mrs. Challenger, <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> dainty, <b>smiling</b> figure, stood in the open doorway to welcome us.|$|R
50|$|The {{statue of}} Mary also {{features}} in the film's themes. The statue has <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile,</b> and resembles Karin's mother. Bergman had earlier expressed his psychological difficulty distinguishing between wife and mother, and writer Frank Gado argues Karin's mother dying removes the mother from Karin, and allows David to love her. The larvae eating the statue may represent David and Karin's fetus.|$|E
50|$|After {{reading his}} diary, Ianto becomes {{disturbed}} when he notices {{there is no}} mention of Adam. Adam confronts him and implants false memories into Ianto’s mind, leading Ianto to believe he is a serial killer. Jack returns to find Ianto deeply upset but refuses to believe that Ianto is a killer. The pair search Torchwood's files, discovering the truth after seeing footage of Adam implanting the memories into the team. Jack discovers that the team needs to take amnesia pills, to erase their memories of the past forty-eight hours. He gathers the team and asks each person to try to recall who they really are. Each member takes their pill, Owen looking at Tosh and giving <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
50|$|Afterward, Sue meets Will {{and claims}} that because Will {{was one of}} the few people to stand up for her during the recent {{television}} exposé of her by Geraldo Rivera, she planned her pranks to help New Directions perform better, and deliberately sabotaged Vocal Adrenaline by devising a performance that would alienate the judges. Rachel finds Jesse in the auditorium, and tells him that she has decided to return to NYADA, and has turned down the Broadway role. Jesse is disappointed but understanding, and they kiss. New Directions says goodbye to Rachel as they place the Sectionals trophy in their trophy case, and decide to also bring back the trophies from past years. Sue observes this from the hallway with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
60|$|But need we {{say that}} Mr. Aaron felt very much out of it. He sat and listened, with <b>a</b> sardonic <b>small</b> <b>smile</b> {{on his face and}} a sardonic gleam in his blue eyes, that looked so very blue on such an occasion. He made the two elderly people uncomfortable with his silence: his {{democratic}} silence, Miss Wade might have said.|$|R
60|$|Siegmund sat in {{his great}} horse-hair chair by the fire, while Helena {{attended}} to the lamp. Glancing at him over the glowing globe, she found him watching her with <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> peculiar <b>smile</b> of irony, and anger, and bewilderment. He was not quite himself. Her hand trembled so, she could scarcely adjust the wicks.|$|R

50|$|Lopburi images {{date back}} to the {{eleventh}} century. They are typically found in Northeast Thailand, and their style is essentially similar to Cambodian Buddha images. Such images typically have a cone-shaped cranial protuberance in the form of tiers of lotus petals. The hair depicted in the images is considerably more realistic than the hair of the Dvaravati images, and may be either straight or curly. The face of the Buddha typically has <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile,</b> while the earlobes are in unusually large proportion relative {{to the rest of the}} face, often hanging down nearly to the image's shoulders. A second Lopburi style is the Naga Protected Buddha with the heads of Naga forming a protective taper around the Buddha's head.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the fleet}}'s {{food-processing}} systems become contaminated the fleet prepares {{to make a}} hazardous journey through a highly radioactive stellar cluster in search of supplies, Tigh finally returns (a little self-consciously) to the Galactica CIC. Although Adama does not join the applause for the Colonel, he cannot hide <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile.</b> After the stellar cluster has been negotiated, he visits Captain Louanne [...] "Kat" [...] Katraine on her deathbed after she receives a fatal dose of radiation guiding civilian ships through the cluster. He comforts her, telling her that her shady past life is irrelevant to him: he is interested only in her bravery and outstanding qualities as a leader, for which he (posthumously) returns her {{to the position of}} CAG.|$|E
50|$|Bardock now realizes Frieza {{intends to}} destroy the entire Saiyan race by annihilating their homeworld. Unfortunately, {{he is unable to}} {{convince}} the others of the approaching peril and, with no other choice, decides to confront Frieza himself. After penetrating Frieza's armed guard, Bardock sends a large energy blast at the tyrant himself, expecting a sure victory. However, Frieza counters this with his Supernova technique, which destroys Bardock, many of his own guards, and the Planet Vegeta itself. As he is dying, Bardock sees one more vision of the future: his son Kakarot facing Frieza. Being assured that Kakarot will be the one to defeat Frieza, Bardock gives <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile</b> as he disintegrates along with the planet. Bardock, after his death, telepathically asks his son Kakarot in the space pod to avenge the Saiyans, to which Kakarot wakes up.|$|E
5000|$|After Channel 4 Action News WTAE-TV began <b>an</b> {{investigation}} on <b>Small</b> <b>Smiles,</b> the U.S. Senate filed a report saying that taxpayer dollars were wasted in <b>Small</b> <b>Smiles</b> and recommended that its Medicaid access be terminated. The report accused <b>Small</b> <b>Smiles</b> clinics of performed unnecessary dental work and performing procedures too quickly. The 1,500-page report was prepared by Grassley and Max Baucus. This bipartisan {{report of the}} US Senate further advised <b>Small</b> <b>Smiles</b> Dental be excluded as a Medicaid provider. CSHM LLC stated that [...] "We {{do not believe that}} this report adequately reflects the current operations of CSHM LLC (CSHM or the Company)." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{brought me}} a great quantity, so, whilst the girl was serving coffee-with-rum to {{the men at the}} bar, I took another spoon and knife and fork and plates for Emil, and we had two dinners from my one. When the girl--she was a woman of thirty-five--came back, she looked at us sharply. I smiled at her coaxingly; so she gave <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> kindly <b>smile</b> in reply.|$|R
5000|$|The bear image was, however, {{on various}} {{occasions}} (especially in the 20th century) also {{taken up by}} Russians themselves. Having the bear cub [...] "Misha" [...] as the mascot of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games was evidently intended to counter the [...] "big and brutal Russian Bear" [...] image with <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> cuddly and <b>smiling</b> bear cub.|$|R
5000|$|When Tohru (who {{recovered}} at the hospital) {{was finally}} allowed visitors beyond her immediate family, Akito was surprisingly {{one of the}} first to visit (and even more surprisingly, according to Hatori and Shigure, she went alone and entirely on her own accord). Fearful that she would be rejected by Tohru and Kureno (both of whom she'd hurt, emotionally and physically), Akito was told a comforting story by Momiji, who also offered advice that made it possible for Akito to see Tohru and Kureno for who they really are: People whose kindness for others overrides their ability to be concerned about themselves. With that in mind, she finally went to see Tohru, who offered her hand (despite the fact her arm is injured) to Akito in friendship again, which she accepted with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile.</b> Akito also visited Kureno in the hospital, whom she had stabbed in the back (chapter 118); Kureno, however, didn't blame Akito for her actions, and forgave her when Akito cried and apologized to him repeatedly for smothering him all of the years she'd kept him close. From there on out, Akito decided to try to change rather than cling to being [...] "God," [...] and to the memory of her father and what he had wanted her to be (chapter 132).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the hall}} closet, Rosemary discovers a secret door {{leading into the}} Castevets' {{apartment}} and hears a baby's cries, revealing that her child is alive. She then finds a congregation {{made up of the}} building's tenants, as well as Dr. Sapirstein, gathered around her newborn son. When Rosemary pulls back the curtains of the crib, she is horrified and asks what they've done to its eyes. It is remarked upon that the baby, a boy, has [...] "his father's eyes," [...] to which Rosemary protests that the baby's eyes are nothing like those of Guy. It is then explained to Rosemary that Guy is actually not the child's real father; her newborn child, named Adrian, is actually the son of the Devil himself. Guy attempts to calm a horrified Rosemary by explaining to her that they will be generously rewarded with possible wealth and fame in exchange for having produced Satan's offspring, and that they can conceive a second child that will truly be theirs. Rosemary takes no solace in Guy's words, instead spitting in his face. Minnie tells Rosemary that she should be honored to be the [...] "lucky" [...] woman chosen to bear a child for Satan. Roman urges her to become a mother to her son, and assures her that she does not have to join the coven if she does not want to. Initially reluctant, Rosemary ultimately goes to the cradle and gently rocks it, with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile</b> on her face.|$|E
5000|$|That {{campaign}} {{focused on}} gay marriage, {{and later on}} whether employees of Catholic hospitals and universities should have insurance coverage for contraception. In a February 2012 interview on C-SPAN, Catholic Democrats Board member Kathleen Kennedy Townsend strongly supported the administration’s efforts to provide wider access to contraceptives, with their potential for decreasing the number of abortions. But in an opinion piece the same week in the Philadelphia Inquirer, Archbishop Chaput said that the administration was motivated by “a seemingly deep distrust of the formative role religious faith has on personal and social conduct, and a deep distaste for religion's moral influence on public affairs.” The Inquirer subsequently interviewed Catholic Democrats’ president Steve Krueger, and reported this exchange of views with Archbishop Chaput:“While there's nothing wrong with a Catholic bishop being a Republican or a Democrat,” Krueger said, “there's something eerily unsettling when the archbishop's political affiliation and the teaching authority he rightfully claims conflate, so that he becomes more of a partisan political figure than a shepherd." [...] Told of Krueger's criticism, Chaput became visibly annoyed and leaned forward in his chair. [...] "Can a group that calls itself 'Catholic Democrats' talk about politicizing things? That's absolutely ridiculous." [...] Asked {{if he had a}} preferred candidate in the presidential elections, Chaput allowed <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>smile</b> and shook his head. [...] "I don't talk about candidates," [...] he said. [...] "I just talk about the issues.” ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{external}} cavity in a quasi-Littrow configuration for a diode laser bar with 19 single emitters {{and the individual}} spectral stabilization, ranging from wavelengths between 970 and 980 nm corresponding to each emitter. The imaging of the vertical waveguide mode onto a blazed grating acting as a diffractive optical element is realized with a beam transformation system that swaps the vertical and lateral axes. Along with a feedback intensity of < 10 %, {{the reduction of the}} divergence due to a beam expander results in high losses for cross coupling modes. We demonstrate the possibility to suppress cross coupling and that even <b>a</b> process-related <b>small</b> <b>smile</b> error has <b>a</b> positive effect {{on the quality of the}} spectral stabilization in a quasi-Littrow configuration...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Now," [...] said Witta, {{when the}} ship was loaded, [...] "I counsel you strangers to pray to your Gods, for from here on, our road is No Man's road." [...] He and his men killed a black goat for {{sacrifice}} on the bows; and the Yellow Man brought out <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> <b>smiling</b> image of dull-green stone and burned incense before it. Hugh and I commended ourselves to God, and Saint Barnabas, and Our Lady of the Assumption, who was specially dear to my Lady. We were not young, but I think no shame to say whenas we drove out of that secret harbour at sunrise over a still sea, we two rejoiced and sang as did the knights of old when they followed our great Duke to England. Yet was our leader an heathen pirate; all our proud fleet but one galley perilously overloaded; for guidance we leaned on a pagan sorcerer; and our port was beyond the world's end. Witta told us that his father Guthrum had once in his life rowed along the shores of Africa to a land where naked men sold gold for iron and beads. There had he bought much gold, and no few elephants' teeth, and thither by help of the Wise Iron would Witta go. Witta feared nothing--except to be poor.|$|R

Her crew filmed video of screaming children, bound with papoose boards, as technicians performed dental work. She filmed the lead dentist discussing production goals and stating that his clinics dentists perform many baby root canals per day. Interviews with several former employees who either resigned or were fired after speaking out against the companys practices revealed other abuses, including dental staff conducting X-rays on children {{even though they were}} not certified to do so. The film and the investigative report aired on television led to legal action unfolding. [...] This sparked other stations across the United States to investigate area <b>Small</b> <b>Smiles</b> locations.|$|R
