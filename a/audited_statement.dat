40|$|There are {{significant}} {{differences of opinion}} about the merits of additional aid in meeting the MDGs, including whether and how aid should be given in ‘fragile states’, whether additional aid on the scale envisioned can be effectively used even in well-managed economies, and whether the aid system, particularly in highly aid-dependent countries, undermines instead of strengthens local institutions. We discuss an approach to scaling up foreign aid that would explicitly be aimed at strengthening local capacity and institutions, including in fragile states. “Payments for progress ” would link additional aid to clear evidence of progress already achieved on the ground. This approach would give flexibility and autonomy to local institutions, providing an opening for local institutional experimentation, {{while at the same}} time ensuring that aid pays only for real, measurable achievements. Donors would bind themselves as a group to pay a specific amount for clear evidence of progress against one or more agreed goals in low-income developing countries. Developing country governments would present an independently <b>audited</b> <b>statement</b> reporting their progress on the measures, and donors would pay the agreed amount. Payments would be determined as a function of the outcomes, and not linked to the implementation of any particular policies, any othe...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{study examines}} a material but less understood {{component of the}} public audit marketplace, namely the provision of “audit-related” services to financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit</b> clients. I use the benefit plan audit service setting to examine the company and benefit plan characteristics associated with auditor selection {{and the impact of}} audit-related services on financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit</b> quality. I provide market evidence of distinct shifts {{in the use of the}} same audit firm for the financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit</b> and other audit-related services over time as well as characteristics of the choice of auditors. I then test whether having the same audit firm for both types of audit services is associated with financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit</b> quality as measured by missed misstatements (revealed through future restatements). I find that companies that engage the same audit firm for their financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit</b> and benefit plan audit are less likely to have subsequent restatements. I also test whether having the same audit firm for both types of audit services is associated with switching the financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit</b> firm. I find that companies that engage the same audit firm for their financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit</b> and benefit plan audit are associated with a lower likelihood of switching their financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit</b> firm. Overall, my results suggest that choosing the same auditor for both the financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit</b> and audit-related services is associated with a higher level of financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit</b> quality consistent with knowledge spillover between the financial statement and benefit plan audits. My findings also suggests that who provides audit-related services, and whether or not that provider has changed, affects the perception of switching costs for the financial <b>statement</b> <b>audit...</b>|$|R

40|$|This current GAAP {{determination}} of a going concern is shortsighted for two important reasons. The most important deals with creditors and other stakeholders {{involved with the}} business. Do they enter into contracts with the business or with the individual owner/manager? Currently, they contract with both since, in reality, they make no determination whether a separate firm (entity) exists. The second deals with valuing a business. If the business {{is not really a}} separate going concern, it would typically be valued as the sum of its individual assets instead of the present value of its future cash flows. Many times when buying a business, the acquirer is really just buying the assets to start his own business. This is particularly true in most service businesses. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to advocate reintroducing a qualification to the going concern audit opinion when an entity separate from its owner/manager does not exist. Criteria for determination are also proposed. Arguably, this will make <b>audited</b> accounting <b>statements</b> more meaningful for closely-held firms. More important, this should produce information useful for potential creditors and outside owners. Traditionally, banks have extended loans to small, closely-held firms with only compiled statements; there was no need to provide <b>audited</b> <b>statements.</b> However, the process of lending is changing from a direct, face-to-face process between borrower and lender to an indirect one where credit scoring systems are used. <b>Audited</b> <b>statements</b> can provide better, higher quality information to lenders extending credit...|$|R
