25|$|The {{competition}} from road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced the revenue {{available to the}} railways, even though the needs for maintenance on the network had never been higher, as investment had been deferred over the past decade. Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage {{through the construction of}} roads subsidised by the taxpayer, while restricting the rail industry's ability to use flexible pricing because it was held to nationally <b>agreed</b> <b>rate</b> cards. The government response was to commission several inconclusive reports; the Salter Report of 1933 finally recommended that road transport should be taxed directly to fund the roads and increased Vehicle Excise Duty and fuel duties were introduced. It also noted that many small lines would never be likely to compete with road haulage. Although these road pricing changes helped their survival, the railways entered a period of slow decline, owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles.|$|E

50|$|The rate of {{demurrage}} (if any) {{is generally}} accepted as {{the measure of the}} damages for detention, but is not necessarily the true measure. When the claim is for detention and not demurrage the actual loss is recoverable, which may be more or may be less than the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate</b> of demurrage. The contract usually doesn't count Sundays and holidays as lay days—but unless expressly stipulated, this exception does not apply after the lay days have expired.|$|E
50|$|An {{overdraft}} {{occurs when}} withdrawals {{from a bank}} account exceed the available balance. This gives the account a negative balance and in effect means the account provider is providing credit. If there is a prior agreement with the account provider for an overdraft facility, and the amount overdrawn is within this authorised overdraft, then interest is normally charged at the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate.</b> If the balance exceeds the agreed facility then fees may be charged and a higher interest rate might apply.|$|E

5000|$|An {{overdraft}} {{occurs when}} money is withdrawn {{from a bank}} account and the available balance goes below zero. In this situation the account {{is said to be}} [...] "overdrawn". If there is a prior agreement with the account provider for an overdraft, and the amount overdrawn is within the authorized overdraft limit, then interest is normally charged at the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate.</b> If the negative balance exceeds the agreed terms, then additional fees may be charged and higher interest rates may apply.|$|E
50|$|After {{purchasing}} an asset, {{the owner}} enters a long-term agreement {{by which the}} property is leased back to the seller at an <b>agreed</b> <b>rate.</b> One reason for a leaseback is to transfer ownership to a holding company while keeping proper track of the ongoing worth and profitability of the asset. Another reason is for the seller to raise money by offloading a valuable asset to a buyer who is presumably interested in making a long-term secured investment. Leaseback arrangements are common in the REIT industry.|$|E

50|$|India has {{comprehensive}} Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with 88 countries. This {{means that}} there are <b>agreed</b> <b>rates</b> of tax and jurisdiction on specified types of income arising in a country to a tax resident of another country. Under the Income Tax Act 1961 of India, there are two provisions, Section 90 and Section 91, which provide specific relief to taxpayers to save them from double taxation. Section 90 is for taxpayers who have paid the tax to a country with which India has signed DTAA, while Section 91 provides relief to tax payers who have paid tax to a country with which India has not signed a DTAA. Thus, India gives relief to both kind of taxpayers.|$|R

The reported results for Sweden do no support the suggestion that adverse employment effects are modest in systems with collectively <b>agreed</b> <b>rates.</b> This runs counter to the hypothesis that unions and employers have a good sense of what constitutes a relevant market wage for unskilled workers and use this information to set minimum wages at appropriate levels.

50|$|The {{price of}} gold was fixed for years, twice daily at 10:30 am and 3:00 pm, {{in a small room}} at N M Rothschild's London {{headquarters}} on St Swithin's Lane. The world's main bullion houses: Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Scotia-Mocatta and Société Générale used the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate</b> as a price benchmark for gold products and derivatives in the world's markets. The chairperson, traditionally appointed by the Rothschild bank, sat in the center, although the bank itself has largely withdrawn from trading. The five members of the London Bullion Association: Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank, Scotiabank, HSBC and Société Générale, now conduct their twice-daily meetings over the telephone. But until 2004, the meetings were a century-old tradition as great as the ringing of the bell at the New York Stock Exchange. That ritual is now a thing of the past.|$|E
5000|$|When {{presented}} {{with the problem of}} speculators shifting operations to offshore tax havens, a representative of a [...] "pro-Tobin tax" [...] NGO argued as follows: Agreement between nations could help avoid the relocation threat, particularly if the tax were charged at the site where dealers or banks are physically located or at the sites where payments are settled or 'netted'. The relocation of Chase Manhattan Bank to an offshore site would be expensive, risky and highly unlikely - particularly to avoid a small tax. Globally, the move towards a centralized trading system means transactions are being tracked by fewer and fewer institutions. Hiding trades is becoming increasingly difficult. Transfers to tax havens like the Cayman Islands could be penalized at double the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate</b> or more. Citizens of participating countries would also be taxed regardless of where the transaction was carried out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In earlier work, {{we found}} {{important}} selection biases {{when we tried}} to obtain consent for participation in a national stroke registry. Recognizing that not all registries will be exempt from requiring consent for participation, we examine here in greater depth the reasons for the poor accrual of patients from a systems perspective with a view to obtaining as representative sample as possible. Methods We determined the percent of eligible patients who were approached to participate and, among those approached, the percent who actually consented to participate. In addition we examined the reasons why people were not approached or did not consent and the variation across sites in the percent of patients approached and consented. We also considered site variation in restrictions on the accrual and data collection process imposed by either the local research ethics board or the hospital. Results Seventy percent of stroke patients were approached, with wide variations in approach rates across sites (from: 41 % to 86 %), and considerable inter-site variation in hospital policies governing patient accrual. Chief reasons for not approaching were discharge or death before being approached for consent. Seventeen percent of those approached refused to participate (range: 5 % to 75 %). Finally, 11 % of those approached did not participate due to language or communication difficulties. Conclusion We found wide variation in approach and <b>agree</b> <b>rates</b> across sites that were accounted for, in part, by different approaches to accrual and idiosyncratic policies of the hospitals. This wide variation in approach and <b>agree</b> <b>rates</b> raises important challenges for research ethics boards and data protection authorities in determining when to waive consent requirements, when to press for increased quality control, when to permit local adaptation of the consent process, and when to permit alternatives to individual express consent. We offer several suggestions for those registries that require consent for participation. </p...|$|R

50|$|There is {{a public}} figure named Rodrigue Lemoyne from Sorel, Quebec (now a part of Sorel-Tracy), which {{is located in the}} Richelieu division. This figure, a lawyer, {{is best known for his}} {{colourful}} tenure as general manager of the Sorel Éperviers ice hockey team in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. During the league finals in 1974, he dismissed the team's head coach to take over the position himself. He moved the team to Verdun in 1977, but shifted it back to Sorel in the middle of the 1979-80 season. Lemoyne also represented star player Raymond Bourque in 1979 and, when Bourque was about to be drafted into the National Hockey League, tried to negotiate a financial settlement worth ten times the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate</b> for underage players. He lost this bid following pressure from Harry Sinden, president of the Boston Bruins. In 1988, he was reprimanded by a disciplinary committee of the Quebec Bar for insulting and threatening another lawyer. This may be the same figure at the 1989 candidate.|$|E
5000|$|Sir,I {{have long}} since {{believed}} {{that in spite of}} all the vigilance that can be infused into Post Commanders, that the Specie regulations of the Treasury Dept. have been violated, and that mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders. So well satisfied of this have I been at this that I instructed the Commdg Officer at Columbus Kentucky to refuse all permits to Jews to come south, and frequently have had them expelled from the Dept. the Tennessee. But they come in with their Carpet sacks in spite of all that can be done to prevent it. The Jews seem to be a privileged class that can travel any where. They will land at any wood yard or landing on the river and make their way through the country. If not permitted to buy Cotton themselves they will act as agents for someone else who will be at a Military post, with a Treasury permit to receive Cotton and pay for it in Treasury notes which the Jew will buy up at an <b>agreed</b> <b>rate,</b> paying gold.There is but one way that I know of to reach this case. That is for Government to buy all the Cotton at a fixed rate and send it to Cairo, St Louis, or some other point to be sold. Then all traders, they are a curse to the Army, might be expelled.|$|E

Also high penetration of distributed generation (DG) resource is increasingly observed worldwide. Considering the viewpoint of a retailer, this paper analyzes the problem of setting up contracts on both the supplier and end-user sides to maximize profits while maintaining a minimum operational cost of distribution system. The proposed two-level optimization models can minimize the cost of distribution system with Distributed Generation and maximize the profits of retailers. The numerical simulations are carried out based on an IEEE 33 -bus test distribution network. Test results are included to show the performance of the proposed method...|$|R
