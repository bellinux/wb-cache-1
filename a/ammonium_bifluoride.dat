40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of pre-luting surface treatments by 3 different etchant used at 3 different etching periods and their effect on shear bond strength of IPS Empress 2 luted to tooth by dual cure resin cement. Fifty samples of ceramic were divided into four groups as group I control group: No surface treatment, group II: Etched with Hydrofluoric (HF) acid (4. 9 %), group III: Etched with <b>Ammonium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> acid (9. 4 %) and group IV: Etched with Phosphoric acid (37 %). Group II, III and IV were further divided into 3 Subgroups; namely A, B and C according to the etching periods (20, 60 and 120 s) respectively. The shear bond strength was determined by using a Universal testing Machine. The morphological changes of the surface treated ceramic samples prior to luting to tooth and mode of the fracture failure after shear bond test were observed by using a Scanning Electron Microscope.

The objective was to prepare ammonium uranium fluoride double salts from uranium dioxide and <b>ammonium</b> <b>bifluoride,</b> then decompose these salts to uranium tetrafluoride through heating to temperatures near 425 'C in either a fluidized bed or a stirred bed. Fluorination in the stirred bed was attempted without pretreatment of the reagents. For the fluidized bed experiments, reagents were ball-milled prior to being heated in the bed.

40|$|Two {{methods were}} {{examined}} for the fabrication of dielectric mirror masks. In the first method, a commercial laser mirror was patterned with photoresist and the dielectric film etched with <b>ammonium</b> <b>bifluoride.</b> The <b>ammonium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> etch showed strong kinetic anisotropy with the fastest etch {{rate in the}} vertical direction. However, horizontal etching still resulted in significant undercutting of the photomask. In the second method, a photoresist coated laser mirror was etched with an argon plasma. The argon plasma caused significant damage to the photoresist and underlying dielectric layer without adequate removal of the dielectric film in the open areas of the mask. Neither of the two methods examined were able to produce usable dielectric masks. During {{the course of this}} project, it was discovered that a foreign company, Balzers AG of Liechtenstein, had recently developed successful fabrication procedures for dielectric mirror masks. A mask purchased from Balzers for testing showed distinguishable pattern features down to 2 {mu}m in size. This mask was used in ablative projection etching experiments to form microstructures in Mylar polymer films. A thin film resistor pattern with 7. 0 {mu}m wide lines was etched 5. 4 {mu}m deep into a Mylar substrate.

40|$|The {{anisotropic}} etching behavior of quartz crystal in concentrated <b>ammonium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> solution is studied and analyzed {{in the framework}} of a tensorial model. This model allows to simulate bi- or three-dimensional etching shapes from the equation for the representative surface of the dissolution slowness. In this paper, we present experimental results such as surface profile and initially circular cross-sectional profiles of differently singly- or doubly-rotated cuts. The polar diagrams of the dissolution slowness vector in several planes are deduced from experimental data. The comparison between predicted surface and cross-sectional profiles and experimental results is detailed and shows a good agreement. In particular, several examples give evidence that the final etched shapes are correlated to the extrema of the dissolution slowness. However, in several cases, experimental shapes cannot be simply correlated to the presence of extrema. Simulation gives effectively evidence for an important role played by more progressive changes in the curvature of the slowness surface. Consequently, analysis of data merits to be treated carefully...|$|E
