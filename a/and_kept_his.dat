5|$|After {{attending}} the Far Eastern People's Conference in the Soviet Union, Nosaka returned to Japan in 1922, and {{helped found the}} Japanese Communist Party (JCP) that same year. Nosaka was more secretive {{about his relationship with}} the Communist Party than he had been in Britain, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> membership a secret from Bunji Suzuki and other moderate labour leaders. After his return, Nosaka worked as a trade unionist and editor of the JCP's official newspaper, Musansha Shimbun.|$|E

Harley made his finals debut in the First Elimination Final against Hawthorn, where he gathered 7 disposals and took 2 marks in the clubs' nine-point loss.|$|E
5|$|Sharaf {{writes that}} Reich's {{personality}} changed after {{his experience in}} Oslo. He became socially isolated <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> distance even from old friends and his ex-wife. His students in the United States came to know {{him as a man}} that no colleague, no matter how close, called by his first name. In January 1940 he wrote to Lindenberg to end their relationship once and for all, telling her that he was in despair and that he believed he would end up dying like a dog.|$|E

5|$|Gascoigne {{was first}} {{called up to}} the full England squad by Bobby Robson for a {{friendly}} against Denmark on 14 September 1988, and came on as a late substitute for Peter Beardsley in a 1–0 win. He scored his first goal for England in a 5–0 victory over Albania at Wembley on 26 April 1989. He made his first start in the following game against Chile, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> first team place for most matches in the run in to the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He also played four games for the England B team. He secured {{his place in the}} World Cup squad in a 4–2 win against Czechoslovakia when he scored one goal and was a key component in the other three.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Dhoni scored 148 in an ODI against Pakistan <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> {{position}} as the ODI gloveman safe. Despite Dhoni’s heavy run-scoring in the ODIs, the selectors continued to persist with Karthik for the Tests {{in the face of}} his low scoring at both domestic and international level in the preceding 12 months. Karthik started the tour of Zimbabwe with 40 in a warm-up match against the Zimbabwe Board XI. The hosts, depleted due to political purges conducted by their government, were no match for India and lost by an innings and ten wickets respectively. India scored heavily against their weakened opponents, amassing 554 and 366 in their completed innings, but Karthik failed on both occasions, twice making a single.|$|E

He was signed as emergency cover while Keiren Westwood was away on international duty, coming in for the League Cup match against Morecambe, but was recalled only a day later because of an injury to Foster. In January 2011, Doyle played his first match for Birmingham {{for nearly two years}} in a 3–2 defeat of Coventry in the FA Cup fourth round, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> place for the fifth-round tie against Sheffield Wednesday, keeping a clean sheet as the home team won 3–0. He made his first Premier League appearance since August 2007, as a first-half substitute for the injured Foster, in a 5–0 defeat at Liverpool in April in which he conceded three goals.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} clergyman who {{was also}} a politician, Horne had a burgeoning {{business}} career with Triplex Safety Glass, which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. While serving in a barrage balloon unit, he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer Richard Murdoch, and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished, and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley.|$|E
5|$|With {{the peace}} of 1783, Harvey again took leave from the navy, seeing out his {{parliamentary}} term and continuing his notorious lifestyle of gambling and debauchery. The young death of Harvey's elder brother William Harvey, MP in April 1779 had provided Harvey with a substantial fortune, which he immediately began squandering in epic nights at London's fashionable drinking and gambling establishments. Harvey gained a reputation among this crowd for playing exceptionally high stakes; one often repeated story concerns his loss, on his 21st birthday in 1779, of over £100,000 in a single game of hazard to a Mr O'Byrne. O'Byrne, recognising that such a sum would bankrupt his opponent, refused to take more than £10,000, insisting that they roll the dice again to determine {{the fate of the}} remaining £90,000. Harvey won <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> fortune, but reportedly still failed to pay the £10,000.|$|E

5|$|At the World Cup {{he played}} all three group games against Uruguay, Mexico and France, however in the win against France midfielder Joseph Bonnel racked his studs down Greaves' shin, causing a wound that {{required}} 14 stitches {{and left a}} permanent scar. His replacement, Geoff Hurst, scored the winner in the quarter-final against Argentina <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> place {{all the way to}} the final, where Hurst scored a hat-trick as England won the tournament. Greaves was fit to play in the final, but manager Alf Ramsey opted against changing a winning team. Only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the 4–2 win over West Germany received medals. Following a Football Association-led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to all the winners' squad members, Greaves was presented with his medal by Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009. In November 2014, Greaves' medal was sold at auction for £44,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Chapman entered Pembroke College, Cambridge. He {{failed in}} two trial games, {{organised}} {{prior to the}} 1920 cricket season to inform {{the selection of the}} Cambridge team, and despite his reputation, was omitted from the University's opening first-class match against Essex. But {{on the day of the}} match, a player withdrew from the Cambridge team and Chapman replaced him. Making his first-class debut on 15 May 1920, he scored 118 in a rapid innings <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> place in the team for the remainder of the season. After a century and two fifties, he was selected for the University Match against Oxford. Chapman scored 27 in this final game of the university season to aggregate 613 runs at an average of 40.86, second in the Cambridge batting averages. Unusually for someone in their first year of University cricket, he was subsequently selected for the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. Although not particularly successful with the bat, critics singled him out for his effective fielding. During August, he played second-class Minor Counties cricket for Berkshire as an amateur and headed the team's batting averages; he later appeared in three end-of-season first-class games at the Scarborough Festival where he scored 101 in a Gentlemen and Players game against a bowling attack containing three internationals. In all first-class matches in 1920, Chapman scored 873 runs at 39.68.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Feller {{left for}} combat, {{his father died}} of brain cancer in early January 1943. Five days later he married Virginia Winther whom he met while in Florida for spring training; she {{was a student at}} Rollins College. After the marriage, Feller {{returned}} to service as Gun Captain aboard the Alabama <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> pitching arm in shape by throwing near a gun turret. Feller and the Alabama crew spent most of 1943 in the British Isles along with , but in August were reassigned to the Pacific Theater of Operations. Feller's first taste of direct combat was at Operation Galvanic in November 1943. The Alabama also served during Operation Flintlock while primarily being used as an escort battleship in 1944. Feller participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea before his combat duty ended in January 1945; he {{spent the rest of the}} war at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station as an instructor.|$|E

5|$|Metallica {{released}} {{their debut}} album Kill 'Em All on the independent label Megaforce Records in July 1983. The album helped to establish thrash metal, a heavy metal subgenre defined by its brisk riffs and intense percussion. After finishing its promotional tour, Metallica began composing new material and from September began performing {{the songs that}} were to make up Ride the Lightning at concerts. Because the band had little money, its members often ate one meal a day and stayed at fans' homes while playing clubs across the US. An incident occurred when part of Metallica's gear was stolen in Boston, and Anthrax lent Metallica its equipment to complete the remaining dates. When not gigging, the band stayed in a rented house in El Cerrito, California, called the Metallica Mansion. Frontman James Hetfield felt uneasy about performing double duty on vocals and rhythm guitar so the band offered the job to Armored Saint singer John Bush, who turned down the offer because Armored Saint was doing well at the time. Hetfield gradually built confidence as lead vocalist <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> original role. Metallica started recording on February 20, 1984 at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The album was produced by Flemming Rasmussen, founder of Sweet Silence, {{who went on to}} produce the band's next two albums. Drummer Lars Ulrich chose Rasmussen because he liked his work on Rainbow's Difficult to Cure (1981) and was keen to record in Europe. Rasmussen, who had not heard of Metallica, agreed to work on the album, even though his studio employees questioned the band's talent. Rasmussen listened to Metallica's tapes before the members arrived and thought the band had great potential. Metallica rehearsed the album's material at Mercyful Fate's practice room in Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel slowly {{moved up}} the field, running {{eleventh}} on lap 18, only to spin a lap later at turn seven, falling back to 16th. He subsequently complained about a flat spot on his tyre, but continued without pitting. On lap 20, Sergio Pérez made a pit stop for new tyres and a front wing adjustment. Since the stop took longer than expected, he rejoined just before Sainz, Jr., who used the momentum to pass Pérez into turn one. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Bottas were racing for sixth place. On lap 24, Bottas attacked around the outside into turn two, sticking to the inside line at the following corner, where Räikkönen did not back away {{and ran into the}} front-left of the Williams, breaking his own rear-right suspension and forcing him to retire on the spot, while Bottas was able to carry on. Rosberg came in for his scheduled pit stop on lap 27, while Hamilton waited two laps to follow suit, trying to get ahead. This proved unsuccessful, as he rejoined behind Rosberg after his stop on lap 29. On lap 35, Sergio Pérez attempted to overtake Carlos Sainz Jr. for ninth, who ran wide <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> position. After his team radio informed him that he had done so by going off track, he handed the position to Pérez. Sebastian Vettel made a pit stop for a second time on lap 37 and rejoined in between the two Mercedes of Rosberg and Hamilton, albeit a lap down. He was told to let Hamilton go by as well some laps later.|$|E
