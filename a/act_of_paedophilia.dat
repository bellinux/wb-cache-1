40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore how sexual child abusers who meet the DSM-IV criteria for paedophilia differ from those who do not. We studied DSM-IV disorders and paedophilic interests in all cases of sexual child abuse referred to forensic psychiatric investigation in Sweden between 1993 and 1997 (n = 185). Frequency and severity of other mental disorders did not differ between subjects with and without DSM-IV paedophilia. However, men with paedophilia had more previous paedophilia convictions, same-sex and younger victims and less often intoxicated status when committing the <b>act.</b> The concept <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> as a mental disorder is not supported by the DSM-IV diagnosis, which primarily describes the acting out of attraction...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigates student/trainee-professional implicit theories <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> {{and their}} {{explanations for the}} current crisis <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia.</b> The research methodology {{is based on a}} previous research design (Sternberg, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 49, 607 - 627, 1985), and consists of two interrelated studies. Study 1 (n- 60) develops scales for student/trainee-professional implicit theories <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> and Study 2 (n- 188) uses these scales in conjunction with other scales to define the student/trainee-professional implicit theories <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> and to measure the potential explanations for the current crisis <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia.</b> The findings indicate that student/trainee-professional implicit theories of paedophilic personalities (pathology, abusive and mentally disordered old offender) and behaviours (devious, child focused, cognitive distortions, secretive, child lovers, sexual abusers, socially inept and grooming) seem to reflect both previous research and expert opinion. These tentative findings suggest that student/trainee-professionals’ implicit theories of paedophilia,and as such the current crisis <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> in modern society, seem to have developed in part from the transfer of expert knowledge (explicit theories), the impact of the media, and social constructionalism; and not from the student/trainee-professionals’ individual personality and coping traits...|$|R

40|$|Paedophilia {{has become}} a major social issue; although, there remains {{considerable}} ambiguity in how society understands and perceives this phenomenon. This thesis will investigate professionals' as well as trainee/non-professionals' implicit theories <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> and their explanations for the current social outcry. This is an inter-disciplinary, mixed-design piece of research, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, with professionals' (n= 28) and trainee/non-professionals' (study 1, n= 601 study 2, n= 188) respectively. Professional implicit theories <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> were found to be fragmented with no unified definitions or understandings. Professionals' believe paedophilia to be a moral panic, caused by a number of factors (the media and changing perceptions of risk). Although, the professionals' {{do not believe that the}} general public have a good understanding <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia,</b> research with trainee/non-professionals' reveal that their implicit theories <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> tend to be mixed, reflecting both, popular sensationalistic stereotypes and current professional understandings from this research as well previous research. Professionals' and trainee/non-professionals' implicit theories <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> seem derived from socially constructed beliefs, not from psychological traits and/or individual differences...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss professionals' {{contemporary}} definitions and understandings <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia,</b> based upon empirical qualitative research {{with a range}} of professionals working within paedophilia, or in related fields (practitioners, academics and members of the media) (N = 28). The research used semi-structured interviews, interpreted through qualitative (thematic) content analysis. The findings reveal that in general the professionals seem to have similar, but differently nuanced understandings <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia.</b> The professionals believe that the current definition <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia,</b> {{as a result of a}} number of factors including disparate professional discourses, has become problematic as it does not reflect the complexity of the issue or the population in question. This disharmony in professional discourse and public discussion has led to the broader societal discourse surrounding paedophilia to become maladaptive and not fit for purpose. Therefore the professionals believe that the current discourse surrounding paedophilia, and its resulting definition, needs to be readdressed...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the current}} {{high-profile}} concern over paedophiles and paedophilic activity, {{there is no}} easily accessible or widely accepted multi-disciplinary definition <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia.</b> Commentators have pointed to a general contemporary misunderstanding surrounding the subject <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia,</b> and to the tensions between strong beliefs and facts in both societal and correctional contexts. We suggest that the current situation – societal, clinical and legal – can be problematic for both offenders and practitioners who are currently charged with, and involved in the risk treatment and/or management of paedophiles. This article attempts to begin {{to address these issues}} by looking at conceptions <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> from a multi-disciplinary viewpoint. We examine understandings from clinical and legal sources, and present this analysis in a historical and cultural context. In drawing these divergent conceptions together, we highlight various contradictions and discrepancies. We suggest that these inconsistencies present significant problems in terms of professional engagement with paedophilia and paedophiles, and as a result illustrate the need to engage in more detailed debate regarding what constitutes ‘the problem’...|$|R
40|$|Various {{indices of}} use of Internet {{pornography}} have drawn attention {{to the extent of}} adult sexual interest in children; clinical experience and now research evidence are accumulating to suggest that the Internet is not simply drawing attention to those with existing paedophilic interests, but is contributing to the crystallisation of those interests in people with no explicit prior sexual interest in children. Drawing on clinical experience in a specialist NHS outpatient psychotherapy service, the author argues that a dichotomous notion <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> is no longer tenable, and any model <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> needs to take account of eruptions of a sexual interest in children in those who appear not to be consistently paedophilic and who have had adult-to-adult sexual relationships. This phenomenon is analysed in two ways: first, by considering how it is that the adult sexual adaptation might ‘unravel’ under the influence of Internet sex to reveal underlying paedophilic currents and second, by revisiting general and psychoanalytic theories <b>of</b> <b>paedophilia</b> and by considering how predisposing factors to paedophilia might be amplified through access to Internet pornography. ...|$|R
