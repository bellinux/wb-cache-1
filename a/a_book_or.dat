5|$|Scientology is {{represented}} by {{a large number of}} independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred.|$|E
25|$|The name al-Fātiḥah ("the Opener") {{is due to}} the {{subject-matter}} of the surah. Fātiḥah is {{that which}} opens a subject or <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> any other thing. In other words, a sort of preface.|$|E

25|$|The Catcher in the Rye is narrated in a {{subjective}} style {{from the point}} of view of Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought processes.

25|$|A second {{journey in}} October-December {{of the same}} year was also successful, again trading chemicals, {{medicines}} and gems for rubber, nickel, alloys and tin. However, Deutschland was lightly damaged during a collision with a tug in New London. Following his return, captain Paul König wrote <b>a</b> <b>book</b> (<b>or</b> possibly had it ghostwritten) about the journeys of Deutschland. The book was heavily publicized, as it was intended to sway public opinion in both Germany and the US.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} diaries from {{survivors}} {{and hundreds of}} written correspondences made to relations {{from those in the}} ghetto at the time. Photos of many of the ghetto's deportees to Auschwitz were preserved. A collection of over 2,000 photographs was discovered in October, 1986, including many images of life in Będzin and the ghetto. Some of them have been published in <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> in a video. The Eyes from the Ashes Foundation administers the collection.|$|E
25|$|Another {{option is}} {{self-help}} based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Using <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> a website, {{a person does}} the kinds of exercises {{that would be used}} in therapy, but they do it on their own, perhaps with some email or phone support from a therapist. A systematic analysis of trials testing this kind of self-help found that websites, books, and other materials based on cognitive-behavioral therapy could help some people. The best-studied conditions are panic disorder and social phobia.|$|E
25|$|Cockburn's {{declaration}} {{remained in}} force for several decades, {{and most of}} the high profile seizures under the Act relied on this interpretation. Known as the Hicklin test no cognisance was taken of the literary merit of <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> on the extent of the offending text within the book in question. The widened scope of the original legislation led to the subsequent notorious targeting of now acknowledged classics of world literature by such authors as Zola, James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence plus medical textbooks by such as Havelock Ellis rather than the blatant erotica which was the original target of this law.|$|E

25|$|After a {{collectable}} {{has been}} purchased, its retail price no longer applies and its value {{is linked to}} {{what is called the}} secondary market. There is no secondary market for an item unless someone is willing to buy it, and an object's value is whatever the buyer is willing to pay. Depending on age, condition, supply, demand, and other factors, individuals, auctioneers, and secondary retailers may sell a collectable for either more or less than what they originally paid for it. A price guide is a resource such as <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> website that lists typical selling prices.|$|E
25|$|The final Masorah {{is located}} at the end of biblical books or after certain {{sections}} of the text, such as {{at the end of the}} Torah. It contains information and statistics regarding the number of words in <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> section, etc. Thus, Book of Leviticus 8:23 is the middle verse in the Pentateuch. The collation of manuscripts and the noting of their differences furnished material for the Text-Critical Masorah. The close relation which existed in earlier times (from the Soferim to the Amoraim inclusive) between the teacher of tradition and the Masorete, both frequently being united in one person, accounts for the Exegetical Masorah. Finally, the invention and introduction of a graphic system of vocalization and accentuation gave rise to the Grammatical Masorah.|$|E
25|$|A {{book can}} be {{prohibited}} by the Censorship of Publications Board if they consider {{it to be}} indecent or obscene. A periodical can be prohibited if it {{is considered to be}} frequently or usually indecent or obscene, or if the Board is of the opinion that an unduly large proportion of space in the periodical is given to matters related to crime. <b>A</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> periodical may also be prohibited if the Board considers that they advocate abortion or ways of carrying out abortions. Most of the publications considered by the Board have been reported because of obscenity. When considering a book, the Board measures its literary, scientific and historical merit and takes note of its general tenor, the language in which it is written and its likely circulation and audience.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by Hitchcock's Psycho, Morris visited Plainfield, Wisconsin in 1975. While in Wisconsin, he {{conducted}} multiple interviews with Ed Gein, the infamous serial killer who resided at Mendota State Hospital in Madison. He later made plans with German film director Werner Herzog, whom Tom Luddy had introduced to Morris, {{to return in}} the summer of 1975 to secretly open the grave of Gein's mother to test their theory that Gein himself had already dug her up. Herzog arrived on schedule, but Morris had second thoughts and was not there. Herzog did not open the grave. Morris later returned to Plainfield, this time staying for almost a year, conducting hundreds of hours of interviews. Although he had plans to either write <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> make a film (which he would call Digging up the Past), Morris never completed his Ed Gein project.|$|E
25|$|Focus on the Family {{supports}} {{private school}} vouchers and {{tax credits for}} religious schools. According to Focus on the Family website, Dobson believes that parents are ultimately responsible for their children's education, and encourages parents to visit their children's schools {{to ask questions and}} to join the PTA so that they may voice their opinions. Dobson opposes sex education curricula that are not abstinence-only. According to People for the American Way, Focus on the Family material has been used to challenge <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> curriculum taught in public schools. Critics, such as People for the American Way, allege that Focus on the Family encourages Christian teachers to establish prayer groups in public schools. Dobson supports student-led prayer in public schools, and believes that allowing student-led Christian prayer in schools does not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E
25|$|The work of {{translating}} {{was typically}} undertaken in this fashion: A member, or members, {{of one of}} the committees would produce a draft of <b>a</b> <b>book,</b> <b>or</b> books, of the Bible (typically from the section in which they were assigned) and submit the draft to the section committee. Occasionally a scholar outside the committee would be invited to participate in this phase of the translation process and was asked to submit a draft of the book or books with which he or she had renowned experience. This draft was then distributed among the members of the appropriate committee. Members of the committee would then meet and discuss the translation choices made in the draft. The draft that resulted from this meeting of the concerned committee was then sent to the committee of literary advisers, who would revise the draft in co-operation with the translators. When a consensus on the draft was reached, the final draft would be sent on to the Joint Committee, which was head over the four sub-committees.|$|E

Thus they encourage Esperanto organizations that hold gatherings on that day to add <b>a</b> <b>book</b> review <b>or</b> poetry reading to the program or to announce the publication of <b>a</b> new <b>book.</b> On <b>an</b> individual level, one can buy or start reading <b>a</b> new <b>book</b> <b>or</b> {{in some other way}} celebrate Esperanto literature.|$|R
25|$|The Basilica {{is noted}} {{especially}} for the numerous mosaics that adorn its interior. There is twenty six mosaic depiction of the Christological cycle that, while other iconographical depictions were known to exist at the time, there is not known of any that were as extensive {{as the one that}} was present in Theodoric’s Sant' Apollinaire Nuovo. Also present in the church are 32 statues meant to represent, in a nonspecific manner, the biblical authors. Each one of the statues in their hands has either <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> a scroll, nine with the former and twenty-one with the latter. Each has different appearance characteristics different from their counterparts and none are named or labeled, meaning that they are not saints. There is also a depiction of Christ and in imperial regalia: He sits upon a gem studded throne draped in the imperial purple and gold. The halo above him and the cross are also covered in gems. Upon a throne beside him, the Virgin Mary who, though also on a similar jewel encrusted throne, is not adorned in the regalia of an empress.|$|E
25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E
