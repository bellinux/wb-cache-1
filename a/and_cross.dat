Quantitative analysis in terms of 15 th, 50 th and 85 th percentile and speed ratio for different locations and conditions are found and compared.

Zook, Patrick Kelly (the Irish Brigade), and Edward E. Cross moved forward; the fourth brigade, under Col. John R. Brooke, was in reserve. Zook and Kelly drove the Confederates from Stony Hill, <b>and</b> <b>Cross</b> cleared the Wheatfield, pushing Kershaw's men back {{to the edge of}} Rose Woods. Both Zook <b>and</b> <b>Cross</b> were mortally wounded in leading their brigades through these assaults, as was Confederate Semmes. When Cross's men had exhausted their ammunition, Caldwell ordered Brooke to relieve them.

Brooke's brigade in Rose Woods had to retreat in some disorder. Sweitzer's brigade was sent in to delay the Confederate assault, and they did this effectively in vicious hand-to-hand combat.
