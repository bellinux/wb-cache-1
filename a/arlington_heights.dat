5|$|The American Derby {{was also}} reborn {{at the new}} track, and was run at Washington through 1957, when it was moved to Arlington Park, in {{northwest}} suburban <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights.</b> However, racing venues had previously shifted between Chicago-area tracks. For example, in 1943, Arlington Park shifted its major races to Washington Park {{as a result of}} curtailed racing due to World War II.|$|E

5|$|When the Commonwealth of Virginia seceded {{from the}} Union on May 23, the {{regiment}} {{was ordered to}} assist in the occupation of <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights</b> and Alexandria, Virginia, directly across the Potomac River from Washington. On May 24, the regiment boarded the steamers Baltimore and Mount Vernon and was transported across the Potomac, landing at the Alexandria wharves under the guard of the gunboat Pawnee. The 11th New York was one of eight to enter Virginia, and Ellsworth's men met no resistance as they moved through the streets.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the {{beginning}} of construction, however, severe deficiencies were beginning to be revealed in the fort's location. Due to its site close to the Long Bridge, Runyon was overlooked by the ridge of the <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights,</b> and an enemy force could shield itself with the heights and sneak up on the fort unopposed. To prevent this from happening, Barnard was forced to issue orders calling {{for the construction of a}} fort called Fort Albany atop the ridge. Nevertheless, work on Fort Runyon continued despite its less-than-optimal location.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{construction}} {{began on}} a 60-home upscale development called <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights,</b> and {{a grant from}} the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors is planning a $250 million New Urbanist revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic neighborhood that borders the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a central park. Construction for the project began in 2006.|$|E

5000|$|Marble Cliff {{was one of}} {{the first}} suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, settled as a {{community}} in 1890 and incorporated as the [...] "Hamlet of Marble Cliff" [...] in 1901. It took its name from the Marble Cliff Quarry Co. (still in use today), and at this time stretched all the way from the Scioto River to the Olentangy River. In 1902, it detached all land but its present area, and the area that separated became Grandview Heights in 1906. The village was named [...] "Arlington" [...] for a short time, which led its new neighbor to the north, incorporated in 1918, to name itself Upper Arlington. Marble Cliff is bordered by the cities of Upper <b>Arlington,</b> Grandview <b>Heights,</b> and Columbus.|$|R

25|$|The {{result in}} <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights</b> {{was similar to}} that in Washington v. Davis (1976), and has been defended on the basis that the Equal Protection Clause was not {{designed}} to guarantee equal outcomes, but rather equal opportunities; if a legislature wants to correct unintentional but racially disparate effects, it may {{be able to do so}} through further legislation. It is possible for a discriminating state to hide its true intention, and one possible solution is for disparate impact to be considered as stronger evidence of discriminatory intent. This debate, though, is currently academic, since the Supreme Court has not changed its basic approach as outlined in <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights.</b>|$|E

25|$|Initially, Myer {{used his}} office {{downtown}} in Washington, D.C. {{to house the}} Signal Corps School. When it was found to need additional space, he sought out other locations. First came Fort Greble, one of the Defenses of Washington during the Civil War, and when that proved inadequate, Myer chose Fort Whipple, on <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights</b> overlooking the national capital. The size and location were outstanding. The school remained there for over 20 years and ultimately was renamed Fort Myer.|$|E

He then brought his regiment to Washington on September 11, and by November they were posted to <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights</b> in Virginia as part of the defenses of Washington.

500|$|Canterbury Castle was {{a private}} , three-story house located in <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights</b> near Washington Park, {{offering}} views of downtown Portland. Constructed from basalt stone quarried from Rocky Butte, the house featured characteristics of a castle such as a moat, a drawbridge and a copper-topped turret. The wooden drawbridge covered a moat seven feet wide by more than three feet deep. A single-car garage, built into the hillside, was constructed {{during the same time}} as the house. The concrete foundation supported a rectangular ground plan. Canterbury featured [...] "buttressing wing walls, cylindrical corner bays and a crenellated parapet of uncut stone". Round, arched and straight-topped frameless windows were often fitted with steel sashes. Doorways were also frameless, narrow and round or parabolic in shape. Doors had wrought iron hinges, handles and lock plates. The leaded glass slit window at the stair tower's top level featured a spiderweb pattern, a signature element of castle designer Jeter O. Frye's work. Windmill palms surrounding the property added to its exotic appearance.|$|E
500|$|The {{defenses}} {{south of}} the Potomac were combined into the Arlington Line, an interlocking system of forts, blockhouses, rifle pits and trenches that would defend Washington throughout the entire course of the war. Their intimidating nature was designed to dissuade an attack as much as repel one, and over the four years that would pass before the final armistice, no Confederate force would ever seriously attempt to penetrate the Arlington Line. A side effect of the new building campaign inaugurated by General McClellan was the obsolescence of Fort Runyon, which soon was overshadowed by forts built atop the <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights</b> and adjacent to Fort Albany. Due to the distance between Fort Runyon and the new line of defenses, direct fire support was not an option, and thus Runyon could only offer indirect support to the forts that now served on the front lines. Fort Runyon's cannon were removed and emplaced further forward, and the fort was designated an [...] "interior" [...] fortification. The soldiers who had served the guns were also removed to other positions that needed trained artillerymen.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in April 1996 to positive reviews. Mark Deming of Allmusic called it a [...] "superb debut" [...] and wrote, [...] "Welch's debts to artists of the past are obvious and clearly acknowledged, but there's a maturity, intelligence, and keen eye for detail in her songs you wouldn't expect from someone simply trying to ape the Carter Family." [...] Bill Friskics-Warren of No Depression praised the album as [...] "breathtakingly austere evocations of rural culture". The <b>Arlington</b> <b>Heights,</b> Illinois Daily Heralds Mark Guarino observed that Revival was [...] "cheered and scrutinized as a staunch revivalist of Depression-era music only because her originals sounded so much like that era." [...] He attributed this to the biblical imagery of the lyrics, Burnett's threadbare production, and the plainly-sung bleakness in Welch's vocals. Ann Powers of Rolling Stone gave Revival a lukewarm review and criticized Welch for not singing of her own experiences, and [...] "manufacturing emotion." [...] Robert Christgau echoed Powers: Welch [...] "just doesn't have the voice, eye, or way with words to bring her simulation off." [...] Revival was nominated for the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, but lost to Bruce Springsteen's The Ghost of Tom Joad.|$|E
