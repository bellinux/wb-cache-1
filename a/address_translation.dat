Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line, {{as well as}} remote desktop access software. The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition and its first wireless product. The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004. An open interface {{for the development of}} third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Microsoft {{released}} Windows 98Second Edition, {{an interim}} release. One {{of the more}} notable new features was the addition of Internet Connection Sharing, a form of network <b>address</b> <b>translation,</b> allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single Internet connection.

50|$|There {{are several}} savings {{inherent}} in this approach. For one, only two <b>address</b> <b>translations</b> are needed. Depending on the architecture, this can represent a significant savings by itself. Another saving is fetching and decoding the instruction itself, {{which has to}} be done only one time instead of ten. The code itself is also smaller, which can lead to more efficient memory use.|$|R
500|$|Though {{interesting}} {{on their}} own, the design concepts of Plan 9 {{were supposed to}} be most useful when combined together. For example, to implement a network <b>address</b> <b>translation</b> (NAT) server, a union directory can be created, overlaying the router's [...] directory tree with its own [...] Similarly, a virtual private network (VPN) can be implemented by overlaying in a union directory a [...] hierarchy from a remote gateway, using secured 9P over the public Internet. A union directory with the [...] hierarchy and filters can be used to sandbox an untrusted application or to implement a firewall. In the same manner, a distributed computing network can be composed with a union directory of [...] hierarchies from remote hosts, which allows interacting with them as if they are local.|$|E

[...] The BAT registers can map linear chunks of memory as large as [...] and are normally used by an OS to map large portions of the address space for the OS kernel's own use. [...] If the BAT lookup succeeds, the other lookup is halted and ignored.|$|E
2500|$|A child {{partition}} {{does not}} have access to the physical processor, nor does it handle its real interrupts. Instead, it has a virtual view of the processor and runs in Guest Virtual Address, which, depending on the configuration of the hypervisor, might not necessarily be the entire virtual address space. Depending on VM configuration, Hyper-V may expose only a subset of the processors to each partition. The hypervisor handles the interrupts to the processor, and redirects them to the respective partition using a logical Synthetic Interrupt Controller (SynIC). [...] Hyper-V can hardware accelerate the <b>address</b> <b>translation</b> of Guest Virtual Address-spaces by using second level <b>address</b> <b>translation</b> provided by the CPU, referred to as EPT on Intel and RVI (formerly NPT) on AMD.|$|E
40|$|Students at the {{undergraduate}} level encounter {{a number of}} problems in translation due to inadequate language knowledge, lack of knowledge of the world, including the absence of required knowledge of the subject of the text.

40|$|Applications can {{map data}} on SSDs into virtual memory to transparently scale beyond DRAM capacity, {{permitting}} them to leverage high SSD capacities with few code changes. Ob-taining good performance for memory-mapped SSD content, however, is hard because the virtual memory layer, the file {{system and the}} flash translation layer (FTL) perform <b>address</b> <b>translations,</b> sanity and permission checks independently from each other. We introduce FlashMap, an SSD interface that is optimized for memory-mapped SSD-files. FlashMap combines all the <b>address</b> <b>translations</b> into page tables {{that are used to}} index files and also to store the FTL-level mappings without altering the guarantees of the file system or the FTL. It uses the state in the OS memory manager and the page tables to perform sanity and permission checks respectively. By com-bining these layers, FlashMap reduces critical-path latency and improves DRAM caching efficiency. We find that this in-creases performance for applications by up to 3. 32 x compared to state-of-the-art SSD file-mapping mechanisms. Additionally, latency of SSD accesses reduces by up to 53. 2 %. 1...|$|R
30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, the {{state-of-the-art}} traceback methods in the literature are able to detect only up to the autonomous system (AS) level or at best, the edge router of the attacker network, because proxies and network <b>address</b> <b>translations</b> (NATs) make it difficult to differentiate activities from distinct hosts.

2500|$|On CPUs without Second Level <b>Address</b> <b>Translation,</b> {{installation}} of most WDDM accelerated graphics drivers on the primary OS {{will cause a}} dramatic drop in graphic performance.

The terms are explained bottom up, for disk addressing the sector is the smallest unit.

2500|$|The IBM System/360 Model 67, {{which was}} {{introduced}} Aug. 1965, included an MMU that {{was called a}} dynamic <b>address</b> <b>translation</b> (DAT) box.

[...] They refer to physical memory rather than virtual memory, and are accessed by special-purpose instructions. [...] This reduces overhead for the OS, which would otherwise need to propagate accessed and dirty bits from the page tables to a more physically oriented data structure.
