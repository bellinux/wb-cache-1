5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomena</b> such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E
25|$|The Thermal wind is {{wind that}} varies with height {{due to a}} balance between the Coriolis and pressure-gradient forces in the atmosphere. It is the primary {{physical}} mechanism for the jet stream and {{plays an important role in}} other large-scale <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomena.</b> The thermal wind ensures the jet stream is typically strongest in the upper half of the troposphere, which is the atmospheric layer extending from the surface of the planet up to a height of 12 km to 15 km.|$|E

25|$|Mesoscale {{meteorology}} is {{the study}} of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomena</b> that has horizontal scales ranging from 1km to 1000km and a vertical scale that starts at the Earth's surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer, troposphere, tropopause, and the lower section of the stratosphere. Mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to weeks. The events typically of interest are thunderstorms, squall lines, fronts, precipitation bands in tropical and extratropical cyclones, and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and sea and land breezes.|$|E
25|$|The Greek {{scientist}} Theophrastus {{compiled a}} book on weather forecasting, called the Book of Signs. The work of Theophrastus remained a dominant influence {{in the study of}} weather and in weather forecasting for nearly 2,000 years. In 25 AD, Pomponius Mela, a geographer for the Roman Empire, formalized the climatic zone system. According to Toufic Fahd, around the 9th century, Al-Dinawari wrote the Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants), in which he deals with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the Muslim Agricultural Revolution. He describes the meteorological character of the sky, the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, the anwa (heavenly bodies of rain), and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomena</b> such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes.|$|E
25|$|A few later {{classical}} philosophers did dispute {{this view}} of comets. Seneca the Younger, in his Natural Questions, observed that comets moved regularly through the sky and were undisturbed by the wind, behavior more typical of celestial than <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomena.</b> While he conceded that the other planets do not appear outside the Zodiac, he saw no reason that a planet-like object could not move through {{any part of the}} sky. However, the Aristotelian viewpoint proved more influential, and {{it was not until the}} 16th century that Tycho Brahe demonstrated that comets must exist outside the Earth's atmosphere by measuring the parallax of the Great Comet of 1577 from observations collected by geographically separated observers. Within the precision of the measurements, this implied the comet must be at least four times more distant than from the Earth to the Moon.|$|E

50|$|The Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone (DCVZ) is an orographically-induced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{characterized}} by convergent winds {{east of the}} Denver metropolitan area, typically 50 to 100 km in length and oriented in a north-south direction. This meteorological feature was subject to academic scrutiny following a large outbreak of Denver-area tornadoes in 1981 and {{has been used to}} explain the propensity of the area to spawn landspout (misocyclone) and supercell (mesocyclone) tornadoes. The DCVZ is often associated with the Denver Cyclone effect, although the Denver Cyclone is considered a distinct <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomenon</b> by some scientists.|$|R
500|$|Microscale {{meteorology}} is {{the study}} of short-lived <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomena</b> smaller than mesoscale, about 1km or less. These two branches of meteorology are sometimes grouped together as [...] "mesoscale and microscale meteorology" [...] (MMM) and together study all phenomena smaller than synoptic scale; that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a weather map. These include small and generally fleeting cloud [...] "puffs" [...] and other small cloud features.|$|E

2500|$|Storm {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} mutants on Earth and has demonstrated a plethora of abilities, most of which are facets of her power to manipulate the weather. Storm possesses the psionic ability to control all forms of weather over vast areas. [...] She has been able to control both Earthly and extraterrestrial ecosystems. She can modify the temperature of the environment, control all forms of precipitation, humidity and moisture (at a molecular level), generate lightning and other electromagnetic <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomena,</b> and has demonstrated excellent control over atmospheric pressure. She can incite all forms of meteorological tempests, such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, blizzards, and hurricanes, as well as mist. She can dissipate such weather to form clear skies as well.|$|E
2500|$|Gunn {{left the}} NRL for the United States Weather Bureau in February 1947.

40|$|In 1937, the {{meteorologist}} Joachim Kuettner used several gliders {{to study}} and map a large-scale, yet hitherto unknown, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomenon</b> called mountain waves. He also examined an accompanying occurence that stood in contrast to these calm, gigantic waves: relatively small air pockets of extreme turbulence, so-called “rotors”. The present paper puts Kuettner’s investigations into {{the larger context of}} meteorological instrumentation, glider mania in Germany between the two world wars, and the buildup of Nazi air power. It also traces the connections to such wildly diverse topics as the analog computer or the transcendent dizziness of the pilot, and follows mythological references. In doing so, the paper seeks to contrast the history of meteorology with a broader epistemological approach, and to juxtapose the discovery of a somewhat schizophrenic and diabolic <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomenon</b> with an escalating political situation...|$|R

60|$|Now, {{as regards}} his {{attitude}} towards the supernatural he is at one with modern science. We too know that, just as the primeval coal- beds reveal to us the traces of rain-drops and other <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomena</b> {{similar to those of}} our own day, so, in estimating the history of the past, the introduction of no force must be allowed whose workings we cannot observe among the phenomena around us. To lay down canons of ultra-historical credibility for the explanation of events which happen to have preceded us by a few thousand years, is as thoroughly unscientific as it is to intermingle preternatural in geological theories.|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} make the above remarks more clear as regards <b>atmospheric</b> <b>phenomena,</b> let us suppose the case of a sailor who makes the same voyage every year, but not {{precisely}} at the same time each year (and it must be remembered that the rigid punctuality at starting which now holds good did not exist in former times). In his first voyage he had to cross, say, four of the wind-belts. While crossing belt number one, he experiences south-west winds chiefly, and, being an observant man, notes the fact. In belt number two he encounters westerly winds. In number three he is in a region of variable winds and calms. In this region the winds blow all round the compass, averaging about three months from each quarter. But our sailor does not know that; he does not stay there all the year to make notes; he passes on, having recorded his experience. In crossing belt number four, he finds the prevailing winds to be easterly.|$|E
