The comparison between genotypes in two directions - by the selection methods by which they were established and according to the time of their creation.

40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years, {{a team led by}} Dr Rickard Brånemark {{attempted}} to alleviate concerns related to the socket of transfemoral amputees by developing a new method of attachment of their prosthetic leg based on a direct skeletal anchorage (Brånemark et al. 2001). In this case, the socket is replaced by an implant inserted into the shaft of the femur. The design of the specific prosthetic components for these amputees might be refined with {{a better understanding of the}} actual load regime experienced by the implant. The purpose of this study was to provide the load applied on this implant during walking. METHODS The forces and moments were directly measured with a 3 -axis transducer mounted between the knee and the implant (Nietert et al. 1998, Frossard et al. 2002). A total of 16 transfemoral amputees, representing 30 % of the existing population, located around the Melbourne, London and Gothenborg areas participated to this study.

30|$|Samiee et al. [49] Proposed a {{new method}} of feature {{extraction}} in time–frequency domain called MT rational DSTFT which relies on rational function, {{and it is}} adaptive in nature. Their method proposed a sparse representation of the signal while the components remain orthogonal. They investigated that the best window and coefficients size are 256 samples (1.5  s) and first 32 coefficients of the proposed transform. Authors applied stochastic hyperbolic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to find the optimal position of the pole of each EEG epoch which gives the compact t–f representation of the proposed system. For seizure detection, features used are absolute mean value, absolute median value, absolute standard deviation, <b>absolute</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>value,</b> absolute minimum value of the coefficients. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on Bonn database and showed that the algorithm has more accuracy (in terms of sensitivity keeping specificity fixed) than other t–f transforms like DSTFT and 13 Cohen’s transforms with {{the same number of}} nonzero coefficients and achieved an accuracy of 99.8 and 99.3 for the combination of E–A and E–B datasets, respectively. They also showed that the inverse rational DSTFT has smaller MSEs as compared to classical inverse DSTFT. But reliability of the algorithm needs to be checked for long EEG data. They investigated various algorithms and found feed-forward MLP as optimal classifier. Their proposed future work is to improve this proposed algorithm by using multidimensional (MD) PSO to determine the optimal number of unique poles so that rational DSTFT can be used in multichannel long-term epileptic seizure detection algorithm.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A small Box type {{solar dryer}} with {{controllable}} air inlet {{was designed and}} tested. The dryer had a mild steel absorber plate and a polyvinyl chloride (pvc) transparent cover and could be adjusted to allow variation in airflow rate through the drying chamber. A convectional green house covered with transparent pvc and into which a drying tray stand at a height of 90 cm above the ground was placed made up the second drying method. The rate of air flow through the green house could be controlled by adjusting the opening {{at either end of}} the tunnel. The third method of drying which also served as the control is sun drying in which case the drying trays was placed 90 cm above the ground but left unenclosed to allow free flow of ambient air. The air temperature at points just above the drying rack was monitored for all three drying systems under no load conditions from morning to late afternoon. The temperature was also monitored during drying when the trays were loaded with fish of different fillet thicknesses. The rate of loss of moisture was also monitored by weighing the fillets at regular interval until the moisture dropped to 20 %, dry basis or lower. The average temperature inside the plenum chamber of the box type solar dryer was found to have a high daily value of 71. 1 OC although an <b>absolute</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>value</b> of 74. 4 OC was recorded.

Usually the operative interest of such a model is to determine an its solution when is subject to additional conditions like those boundary or initial. This work exposes the mathematical basis of a program (freeware in [URL]) to numerically solve every differential analytical model with every set of additional conditions. In particular is exposed what follows. Are described the analytical properties of two well known models to approximate a function: the interpolating polynomial and the cubic spline. The values of a natural cubic spline and of its derivatives, in the interpolation nodes, are expressed as linear combinations of the known values of the function to be interpolated and whose coefficients depend only on the nodes. Are obtained new bounds for the errors of a cubic spline.

Therefore, understanding their behavior under earthquake is an important subject for structural engineers. In this paper, a comprehensive study is presented on dynamic response of tanks. A parametric study has been completed on the rectangular storage tanks with aid of finite element method (FEM). Various parameters are investigated, such as; liquid height, density and earthquake with different peak ground acceleration (PGA). When investigating these parameters, modal and time history method is used. Six different earthquake records are used for time history analysis.
