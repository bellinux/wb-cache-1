STAT1 and STAT2 are activated by these tyrosine kinases, and STAT1 and STAT2 mediate the antiviral and inflammatory effects of IFN-α/IFN-β.

The pressor sensitivity of subjects with MSA to norepinephrine infusion was increased 10 - to 20 -fold, demonstrating denervation supersensitivity to adrenergic agonists. Analysis of <b>alpha</b> <b>receptors</b> was by binding of [3 H]dihydroergocryptine to platelets. Results are shown as mean +/- standard error of the mean.

Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that helps lower blood pressure. Its effects are modest, but they are not well understood. Baclofen is a GABA agonist that helps control muscle spasms, proving to be helpful in treating dystonia. Benzodiazepines bind to GABA receptors and work as muscle relaxants. Benzodiazepines also combat high blood pressure and respiratory rates; however, they are associated with glaucoma, which is a rather serious side effect. Gabapentin inhibits neurotransmitter release in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and various areas of the central nervous system.

5000|$|The {{endogenous}} cannabinoids, or endocannabinoids, are endogenous lipids that activate cannabinoid receptors. The {{first such}} lipid {{to be isolated}} was anandamide which is the arachidonoyl amide of ethanolamine. Anandamide is formed via enzymatic release from N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine by the N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). [...] Anandamide activates both the CB1 receptor, found primarily in the central nervous system, and the CB2 receptor which is found primarily in lymphocytes and the periphery. It is found at very low levels (nM) in most tissues and is inactivated by the fatty acid amide hydrolase. Subsequently, another endocannabinoid was isolated, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which is produced when phospholipase C releases diacylglycerol which is then converted to 2-AG by diacylglycerol lipase. 2-AG can also activate both cannabinoid receptors and is inactivated by monoacylglycerol lipase. It is present at approximately 100-times the concentration of anandamide in most tissues. Elevations in either of these lipids causes analgesia and anti-inflammation and tissue protection during states of ischemia, but the precise roles played by these various endocannabinoids are still not totally known and intensive research into their function, metabolism, and regulation is ongoing.One saturated lipid from this class, often called an endocannabinoid, but with no relevant affinity for the CB1 and CB 2 receptor is palmitoylethanolamide. This signaling lipid has great affinity for the GRP55 receptor and the PPAR <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor.</b> It {{has been identified as}} an anti-inflammatory compound already in 1957, and as an analgesic compound in 1975.

TGF-beta effects on PDGF <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> expression were studied in vitro using ligand binding techniques in three human dermal fibroblast strains: newborn foreskin, adult skin, and scleroderma (systemic sclerosis, SSc). Each cell strain responded differently to TGF-beta. In newborn foreskin fibroblasts, PDGF <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> number decreased in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to low concentrations of TGF-beta (0. 1 - 1 ng/ml). Responses of normal skin fibroblasts were varied, and mean net receptor number was unchanged. Increases in PDGF <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> number by TGF-beta occurred consistently with SSc fibroblasts and low concentrations of TGF-beta (0. 1 - 1 ng/ml) were particularly stimulatory. Increased surface expression of <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> subunit by TGF-beta in SSc fibroblasts correlated with increased new PDGF <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> synthesis {{as demonstrated by}} radioimmunoprecipitation analysis of metabolically labeled cells and with increased steady-state levels of corresponding mRNAs. In normal adult skin fibroblasts, TGF-beta {{had no effect on}} either synthesis or mRNA expression of <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> subunits.

Decreased mitogenic responses to PDGF-AA were observed in foreskin fibroblasts, small changes in responses in adult fibroblasts, and significant increases in SSc fibroblasts. Thus, costimulation with PDGF-AA and TGF-beta selectively enhanced proliferation of fibroblasts with the SSc phenotype. Immunohistochemical examination of SSc and control skin biopsies revealed the presence of PDGF-AA in SSc skin. Data obtained by ligand binding, immunoprecipitation, mRNA, and mitogenic techniques are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of the PDGF-AA ligand/alpha receptor pathway is a characteristic of the SSc fibroblast and may contribute to the expansion of fibroblasts in SSc...|$|E

Rat aortic VSMCs were incubated with insulin or IGF-I for various times and expression of <b>alpha</b> 1 <b>receptors</b> was detected using [3 H]prazosin binding. Both insulin and IGF-I increased <b>alpha</b> 1 <b>receptor</b> number; also, these peptides increased expression of the <b>alpha</b> 1 D <b>receptor</b> gene with no change in expression of the <b>alpha</b> 1 B <b>receptor</b> gene as detected by RNase protection assays.

40|$|The platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) alpha and beta receptors undergo dimerization as a {{consequence}} of ligand binding. Depending on the PDGF isoform (PDGF-AA, -AB or -BB), homodimers or heterodimers of receptors are formed. In this study, we have used transfected porcine aortic endothelial cells, coexpressing cDNAs for the <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> and the beta receptor at comparable levels, to investigate the properties of the alpha beta-heterodimeric receptor complex. PDGF-AB, which mainly induced alpha beta-heterodimeric complexes, was the most efficient isoform for stimulating mitogenicity. Actin reorganization, in the form of circular membrane ruffling and chemotaxis, was induced by PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB, but not by PDGF-AA, thus indicating that the beta receptor in the homodimeric or heterodimeric configuration was required for induction of motility responses. The molecular basis for the apparent receptor dimer-specific properties was examined by analyzing receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of substrates. The <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> was found to be phosphorylated at an additional tyrosine residue, Tyr 754, in the heterodimeric complex as compared to the alpha <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> homodimer.

A candidate is a 134, 000 -M(r) protein, which was shown to associate preferentially with the <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> in the heterodimeric receptor complex. It is possible that phosphorylated Tyr 754 in the <b>alpha</b> <b>receptor</b> mediates activation of specific signal-tranducing molecules like the 134, 000 -M(r) substrate, and thereby initiates signal-tranduction pathways from the alpha beta receptor heterodimer, which are distinct from those initiated via homodimeric receptor complexes...|$|E

The overall result of these signals is often unpredictable, as these two signaling pathways can interact in many cellular systems, with either potentiation or inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 activity. In the present studies we investigated potential signaling interactions after stimulation of CRH-R 1 <b>alpha</b> <b>receptors</b> in human cultured pregnant myometrial cells or HEK 293 cells overexpressing recombinant CRH-R 1 <b>alpha</b> <b>receptors.</b> We found that the adenylyl cyclase/PKA pathway {{has the capacity to}} markedly decrease UCN-induced ERK 1 / 2 activation, and that these effects were {{due in part to the}} ability of PKA to phosphorylate the CRH-R 1 alpha at position Ser(301) in the third intracellular loop. Mutant CRH-R 1 <b>alpha</b> <b>receptors</b> with substitutions at position Ser 301, which is the only potential PKA phosphorylation site, were resistant to PKA-dependent phosphorylation and showed altered signaling characteristics, which were dependent upon the amino acid substitution at this position. We conclude that Ser 301, which is located in the third intracellular loop of CRH-R 1 alpha, is critical for efficient coupling of the receptor to G proteins and to second messenger generation.

One hybridoma, developed from a fusion between SP 2 /O myeloma cells and splenic lymphocytes from BALB/c mice immunized with human platelet <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenergic <b>receptors,</b> secreted a monoclonal antibody (alpha 2 - 116 p) against the ligand binding site of alpha 2 -adrenergic but not <b>alpha</b> 1 -adrenergic <b>receptors.</b> In contrast, three monoclonal antibodies raised against the alpha 1 -receptor polypeptide backbone but not the ligand binding site were found to specifically immunoprecipitate human platelet <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenergic <b>receptors.</b> These {{data suggest that the}} alpha 1 - and <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenergic <b>receptors</b> are "isoreceptors," sharing immunogenic and, by implication, structural determinants that most likely evolved as a result of gene duplication...|$|R
40|$|An <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenergic <b>receptor</b> subtype {{has been}} cloned {{from a human}} kidney cDNA library using the gene for the human {{platelet}} <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenergic <b>receptor</b> as a probe. The deduced amino acid sequence resembles the human platelet <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenergic <b>receptor</b> and {{is consistent with the}} structure of other members of the family of guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors. The cDNA was expressed in a mammalian cell line (COS- 7), and the alpha 2 -adrenergic ligand [3 H]rauwolscine was bound. Competition curve analysis with a variety of adrenergic ligands suggests that this cDNA clone represents the <b>alpha</b> 2 B-adrenergic <b>receptor.</b> The gene for this receptor is on human chromosome 4, whereas the gene for the human platelet <b>alpha</b> 2 -adrenergic <b>receptor</b> (<b>alpha</b> 2 A) lies on chromosome 10. This ability to express the receptor in mammalian cells, free of other adrenergic receptor subtypes, should help in developing more selective alpha-adrenergic ligands...|$|R
40|$|Maturation of {{the fetal}} {{pituitary}} and adrenal glands allows the secretion of cortisol, {{which in turn}} leads {{to an increase in}} prostaglandin and mesotocin production. The production of prostaglandin and mesotocin results in an increase in uterine contractions and initiates birth in marsupials. The major metabolite of PGF(2 alpha), 13, 14 -dihydro- 15 -keto-prostaglandin F- 2 alpha (PGFM), has been found in the plasma of the possum at the time of birth and administration of PGF(2 alpha) to female possums induced the adoption of the birth position. Evidence that mesotocin is an integral hormone of birth in the tammar wallaby indicates that both PGF(2 alpha) and mesotocin or oxytocin are required for marsupial birth. The presence of PGF(2 <b>alpha)</b> <b>receptors</b> in the uterus and corpus luteum of the possum, and the in vitro uterine responsiveness to PGF(2 alpha) or oxytocin, were examined. PGF(2 <b>alpha)</b> <b>receptors</b> were not observed in possum uteri and the inability of PGF(2 alpha) to cause contractions indicates that PGF(2 alpha) is not involved directly in contraction of the uterus at parturition. The presence of oxytocin and mesotocin receptors in the uterus of possoms and the ability of oxytocin to induce uterine contraction in vitro supports the view that mesotocin is required for expulsion of the young from the uterus. Low numbers of PGF(2 <b>alpha)</b> <b>receptors</b> were found in the possum corpus luteum at birth, indicating an involvement of PGF(2 alpha) in regression of the corpus luteum...|$|R
