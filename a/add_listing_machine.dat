50|$|The American Arithmometer Company was {{organized}} in St. Louis, Missouri in 1886 by William S. Burroughs. Born in Rochester, New York in 1855, {{after receiving a}} high school education in 1881 and working in a bank, for health reasons he moved south. Burroughs began working in the Boyer Machine Shop in St. Louis, Missouri, constructing models for castings and working on new inventions. At that time he decided to design a machine for solving arithmetical problems. After submitting a patent in 1885 for an <b>adding</b> and <b>listing</b> <b>machine</b> with a full keyboard, on January 20, 1886 Burroughs co-founded the American Arithmometer Company along with Thomas Metcalfe, Richard. M. Scruggs, and William R. Pye. The fledgling company continued to operate out of the Boyer Machine building in St. Louis. Burroughs received a patent for his invention in 1888. Early models were unreliable yet he persisted and after much trial and error he patented a practical model in 1892.|$|R

We construct the Decision <b>List</b> <b>Machine</b> which uses generalized balls as data-dependent features. We compare practical performance on some data sets {{with the performance of}} some other learning algorithms such as the Set Covering Machine and the Support Vector Machine. This performance is evaluated for both symmetric and asymmetric loss coefficients. We also provide a theoretical assessment of the performance of the DAM by computing upper bounds of the generalization error...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The primary {{objective}} of group technology (GT) is {{to enhance the}} productivity in the batch manufacturing environment. The GT cell formation problem is solved using modified binary adaptive resonance theory networks known as ART 1. The input to the modified ART 1 is a machine-part incidence matrix comprised of the binary digits “ 0 ” and “ 1 ”. And the outputs are the list of part families and the corresponding part <b>list,</b> <b>machine</b> cells and their corresponding <b>list</b> of <b>machines,</b> {{and the number of}} exceptional elements. This method is applied to the known benchmarked problems found in the literature and it is found to outperform other algorithms in terms of minimizing the number of the exceptional elements. The relative merits of using this method with respect to other known algorithms/heuristics in terms of computational speed and consistency are presented...|$|R

40|$|This is a 1985 {{note with}} modernized typography. ] STRIPS [FN 71] is a {{planning}} system that uses logical formulas to represent {{information about a}} state. Each action has a precondition, an <b>add</b> <b>list</b> and a delete list. When an action is considered, it is first determined whether its precondition is satisfied. This {{can be done by}} a theorem prover, but my understanding is that the preconditions actually used are simple enough that whether one is true doesn’t require substantial theorem proving. If the precondition isn’t met, then another action must be tried. If the precondition is met, then then sentences on the delete list are deleted from the database and sentences on the <b>add</b> <b>list</b> are <b>added</b> to it. STRIPS was considered to be an improvement on earlier systems [Gre 69] using the situation calculus, because these earlier systems ran too slowly. It was often said that STRIPS was just a specialization of the situation calculus that ran faster. However, it wasn’t easy to see how to model...|$|R
