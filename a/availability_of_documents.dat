Although he paid attention to Miyako and Yaeyama, his studies on these subfields remained in a preliminary stage, partly due to the limited <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>documented</b> sources.

However, most of the present research is dealing with access control and authentication-based trust. Especially with the popularity of WWW as one of the largest information sources, privacy of individuals is now as important as the security of information. In this chapter, our focus is text, which is probably the most frequently seen data type in the WWW. Our aim is to highlight the possible threats to privacy that exist due to the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> repositories and sophisticated tools to browseand analyze these documents.
