30|$|In {{accordance}} with this theory, practical intelligence is {{an ability to}} solve simple everyday problems, and this is achieved using readily available knowledge and heuristics. Abilities to open a door or to ride a bus are good examples of practical intelligence. <b>Analytical</b> <b>intelligence</b> is an ability to solve analytical problems, and that requires using deductive skills and utilising existing knowledge (for example, analysis of traffic flow, numerical optimization, or planning a typical construction process, etc.). <b>Analytical</b> <b>intelligence</b> is acquired through the combination of rote learning and learning deductive skills. <b>Analytical</b> <b>intelligence</b> alone is what traditional IQ tests measure.

40|$|The lack of {{satisfactory}} consensus for {{characterizing the}} system <b>intelligence</b> and structured <b>analytical</b> decision models has inhibited the developers and practitioners {{to understand and}} configure optimum intelligent building systems in a fully informed manner. So far, {{little research has been}} conducted in this aspect. This research is designed to identify the key intelligent indicators, and develop analytical models for computing the system intelligence score of smart building system in the intelligent building. The integrated building management system (IBMS) was used as an illustrative example to present a framework. The models presented in this study applied the system intelligence theory, and the conceptual analytical framework. A total of 16 key intelligent indicators were first identified from a general survey. Then, two multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and analytic network process (ANP), were employed to develop the system <b>intelligence</b> <b>analytical</b> models. Top <b>intelligence</b> indicators of IBMS include: self-diagnostic of operation deviations; adaptive limiting control algorithm; and, year-round time schedule performance. The developed conceptual framework was then transformed to the practical model. The effectiveness of the practical model was evaluated by means of expert validation. The main contribution of this research is to promote understanding of the intelligent indicators, and to set the foundation for a systemic framework that provide developers and building stakeholders a consolidated inclusive tool for the system intelligence evaluation of the proposed components design configurations. 1...|$|R

40|$|This article {{challenges}} {{the view that}} it is always better to hold decision makers accountable for their decision process rather than their decision outcomes. In three multiple-cue judgment studies, the authors show that process accountability, relative to outcome accountability, consistently improves judgment quality in relatively simple elemental tasks. However, this performance advantage of process accountability does not generalize to more complex configural tasks. This is because process accountability improves an analytical process based on cue abstraction, while it does not change a holistic process based on exemplar memory. Cue abstraction is only effective in elemental tasks (in which outcomes are a linear additive combination of cues) but not in configural tasks (in which outcomes depend on interactions between the cues). In addition, Studies 2 and 3 show that {{the extent to which}} process and outcome accountability affect judgment quality depends on individual differences in <b>analytical</b> <b>intelligence</b> and rational thinking style.

We {{discuss the}} novel problem of {{supporting}} <b>analytical</b> business <b>intelligence</b> queries over web-based textual content, e. g., BI-style reports based on 100. 000 ’s of documents from an ad-hoc web search result. Neither conventional search engines nor conventional Business Intelligence and ETL tools address this problem, which {{lies at the}} intersection of their capabilities. “Google Squared ” or our system GOOLAP. info, are examples of these kinds of systems. They execute information extraction methods over one or several document collections at query time and integrate extracted records into a common view or tabular structure. Frequent extraction and object resolution failures cause incomplete records which could not be joined into a record answering the query. Our focus is the identification of join-reordering heuristics maximizing the size of complete records answering a structured query. With respect to given costs for document extraction we propose two novel joinoperations: The multi-way CJ-operator joins records from multiple relationships extracted from a single document. The two-way join-operator DJ ensures data density by removing incomplete records from results. In a preliminary case study we observe that our join-reordering heuristics positively impact result size, record density and lower execution costs...|$|R
