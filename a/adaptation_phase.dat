50|$|Mammalian spermatozoa, like {{sea-urchin}} spermatozoa, {{appear to}} sense a temporal chemoattractant gradient. This {{is because the}} establishment of a temporal gradient in the absence of spatial gradient, achieved by mixing human spermatozoa with a chemoattractant, results in a delayed transient increase in swimming velocity and lateral head displacement, leading to a delayed transient decrease in the linearity of swimming (Gakamsky et al., 2009). When the chemoattractant concentration is high, the spermatozoa exhibit hyperactivated motility. Likewise, photorelease of cyclic nucleotides, considered as putative second messengers of the chemotactic pathway(s) (Kaupp et al., 2003; Spehr et al., 2004), from their caged compounds cause a delayed decrease in the linearity of swimming (Gakamsky et al., 2009), similar to that observed upon the photorelease of progesterone (Kilic et al., 2009). On the basis of these observations it was suggested that the response characteristics observed in temporal gradients also occur in spatial gradients: an excitation phase, composed of a delay (i.e., no change in the motility parameters) and a subsequent turn, and an <b>adaptation</b> <b>phase</b> during which the cell ceases to respond to the chemoattractant even though it is still present. When a spermatozoon swims up a spatial gradient, the turning step is repressed. When it swims down a gradient or in no gradient, the cell turns. In the latter case, if not re-stimulated, the cell eventually adapts and resumes its original swimming mode (Gakamsky et al., 2009).|$|E

Moreover, the survival after challenge of stationary phase cells at pH 4 ? 4 was three orders of magnitude higher than that of cells taken from the exponential phase, due to the production of lactic acid during growth and increasing acidification of the growth medium until stationary phase.

The method has two phases:. the first one completes a retrieved case as an easy-to-generate solution method. The second phase improves {{the quality of the}} solution by using a generic heuristic in a recursive algorithm to determine segments of the plan to be replanned. The CASER method does not use any additional knowledge, and it can find as good solutions as those found by the best generative planners. ...|$|E

Using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) {{this study showed}} that the primary motor cortex {{may play a role in}} motor adaptation of this sort. Subjects performed arm reaching movement trials in three phases: in a null force field (baseline), in a velocity-dependent force field (adaptation; 25 N s m− 1) and once again in a null force field (de-adaptation). Active or sham tDCS was directed to the motor cortex representation of biceps brachii muscle during the <b>adaptation</b> <b>phase</b> of the motor learning protocol. During the <b>adaptation</b> <b>phase,</b> the global error in arm reaching (summed error from an ideal trajectory) was similar in both tDCS conditions. However, active tDCS induced a significantly greater global reaching (overshoot) error during the early stage of de-adaptation compared to the sham tDCS condition. The overshoot error may be representative of the development of a greater predictive movement to overcome the expected imposed force. An estimate of the predictive, initial movement trajectory (signed error in the first 150 ms of movement) was significantly augmented during the <b>adaptation</b> <b>phase</b> with active tDCS compared to sham tDCS. Furthermore, this increase was linearly related to the change of the overshoot summed error in the de-adaptation process. Together the results suggest that anodal tDCS augments the development of an internal model of the novel adapted movement and suggests that the primary motor cortex is involved in adaptation of reaching movements of healthy human subjects...|$|E

While faces {{similar to those}} seen during <b>adaptation</b> <b>phases</b> are typically perceived as more 'normal' after adaptation, {{it is possible to}} induce aftereffects in one direction for one category (e. g. female) and simultaneously induce aftereffects in the opposite direction for another category (e. g. male). Such aftereffects could reflect 'category-contingent' adaptation of neurons selective for perceptual category (e. g. male or female) or 'structure-contingent' adaptation of lower-level neurons coding the physical characteristics of different face patterns. We compared these explanations by testing for simultaneous opposite after effects following adaptation to (a) two groups of faces from distinct sex categories (male and female) or (b) two groups of faces from the same sex category (female and hyper-female) where the structural differences between the female and hyper-female groups were mathematically identical to those between male and female groups. We were able to induce opposite aftereffects following adaptation between sex categories but not after adaptation within a sex category. These findings indicate the involvement of neurons coding perceptual category in sex-contingent face aftereffects and cannot be explained by neurons coding only the physical aspects of face patterns. © 2007 Elsevier B.

Here, we investigated reflex-like (obligatory) spatial updating (online updating of our egocentric spatial reference frame during self-motion, which is largely beyond conscious control). Our object was to adapt vestibularly induced reflex-like spatial updating {{with the use}} of a purely cognitive interpretation of the angle turned [...] that is, without any concurrent sensory conflict, just by presenting an image with a different orientation, after physical turns in complete darkness. The experiments consisted of an identical pre-test and post-test, and an <b>adaptation</b> <b>phase</b> in between. In all three phases, spatial updating was quantified by behavioural measurements of the new post-rotation orientations (rapid pointing to invisible landmarks in a previously learned scene). In the <b>adaptation</b> <b>phase,</b> visual feedback was additionally provided after the turn and pointing task (display of an orientation that differed from the actual turning angle by a factor of 2). The results show that the natural, unadapted gain of perceived versus real turn angle in the pre-test was increased by nearly a factor of 2 in the <b>adaptation</b> <b>phase</b> and remained at this level during the post-test. We emphasise that at no point was simultaneous visual and vestibular stimulation provided. We conclude that vestibularly driven reflex-like spatial updating can be adapted without any concurrent sensory conflict, just by a pure cognitive conflict. That is, the cognitive discrepancy between the vestibularly updated reference frame (which served for the pointing) and the subsequently received static visual feedback was able to recalibrate the interpretation of self-motion.
