Our empirical experiment is based on <b>annual</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> for two decades (1989 - 2008).

40|$|Introduction) The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain the {{preliminary}} version of the newly compiled Japan Industrial Productivity Database (JIP 2006) and report some results of our growth accounting analysis based on this database. The JIP 2006 contains information on 108 sectors from 1970 to 2002 that can be used for total factor productivity analyses. These sectors cover the whole Japanese economy. The JIP Database was compiled as part of the RIETI (Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry) research project "Study on Industry-Level and Firm-Level Productivity in Japan. " The original version of the JIP Database (ESRI/Hi-Stat JIP Database 2003) was compiled in a collaboration between ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute, Cabinet Office, Government of Japan) as part of its research project on "Japan's Potential Growth" and Hitotsubashi University as part of its Hi-Stat project (A 21 st-Century COE Program, Research Unit for Statistical Analysis in the Social Sciences). The authors are grateful to ESRI and members of the Hi-Stat team for the support and cooperation provided for our present RIETI project. At this moment, the major data available are sectoral capital service input indices and labor service input indices, including information on real capital stocks and the nominal cost of capital by type of capital and by industry, the nominal and real values of sectoral gross output and intermediate input, as well as some supplementary tables, such as statistics on trade, inward and outward FDI, and Japan's industrial structure. All real values are based on 1995 prices. For growth accounting, nominal labor costs and nominal capital services for 108 industries are also estimated. The sum of these two values for each industry is not adjusted to be equal to the value added of that industry at factor cost base. The final version of the JIP 2006 is scheduled to be released by November, 2006. The final version will include nominal and real <b>annual</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>tables,</b> detailed information on ICT capital services and some additional statistics, such as R&D stocks and capacity utilization rates at the detailed sectoral level. For scholars familiar with the JIP 2003, we here briefly summarize the main differences between and the main similarities of the 2006 and 2003 versions of the JIP. 1. The JIP 2003 is based on the 1968 SNA, while the JIP 2006 is based on the 1993 SNA. The capital stock of the JIP 2006 includes order-made software, plant engineering, and assets accumulated by the search for minerals. The JIP 2003 uses SNA statistics as control totals. Following Japan's present SNA statistics, capital stock in the preliminary version of the JIP 2006 does not include prepackaged and in-house software. However, the final version of the JIP 2006 will include two sets of statistics, one in which capital stock does not include prepackaged and in-house software and one in which it does. 2. In the case of the JIP 2006, labor input data include detailed information on labor input cross-classified by categories of labor. The paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we report the estimation procedures of our <b>annual</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>tables.</b> In Sections 2 and 3, we explain the capital service input data and the labor input data of the JIP 2006, respectively. Finally, in Section 4, we analyze Japan's sectoral and macro TFP growth. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the effects of R&D on the Dutch {{production}} structure. R&D efforts of a sector can result in a more efficient production process, and thus reduce the sector’s demand for intermediate inputs. Another effect of R&D may be an increase in the quality of the products, which will have consequences for other sectors that use the product as an intermediate input. When there are rent spillovers, other sectors might use more of the product even if the price of the product increases. The effects of R&D are analysed using a production function in which the productivity of the intermediate inputs is modelled as a simple function of the stock of R&D of the delivering sectors. The model is estimated in a panel data setup, using <b>annual</b> Dutch <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> fo...|$|R
40|$|The {{indicated}} {{importance of}} productivity increase {{may be taken}} {{to be some sort}} of measure of our ignorance. Moses Abramovitz (1956) This paper will describe some exciting new developments in the Inforum LIFT model of the U. S. The model is grounded in a new set of detailed <b>annual</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>tables,</b> derived by Inforum from U. S. data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This set of tables brings us closer to the goal of developing an integrated model of multifactor productivity, which is consistent at the industry and aggregate level. Since economists first started to develop economic statistics and national accounts, a motivating principal has been to measure the growth of the economy, and discover its sources. Classical economists such as Smith, Ricardo and Mill had observed that more output could be produced with a given quantity of labor by employing machinery and other capital. But it wasn’t until the 1920 s that comparable measures of labor and output became available, and the first estimates of labor productivity growth appeared 1. By the 1950 s, the concept of the production function became formalized, and the idea of segregating growth in output per head into technical change and the availability of capital per head caught on, especially after Solow’s (1957) introduction of the aggregate production function. Solow’s work stimulated numerous studies relating real value added growth to real capital and labor inputs, and deriving the residual as a measure of technical change and other factors. Dissatisfaction with the real value added concept stimulated the desire for a comprehensive measure of productivity that would relate real gross output to capital, labor and intermediate inputs. A convenient classification of intermediate inputs into the categories of energy, materials and services led to KLEMS (capital, labor, energy, materials and services) databases and productivity studies. In either case, KL or KLEMS, the resulting measure of productivity is called multifactor productivity (MFP) defined a...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the evolution of Italian aggregate structural change over the years 1965 - 85. We use <b>annual</b> <b>input-output</b> (IO) <b>tables</b> in current and constant prices to derive an aggregate index of structural change. We adopt several techniques for such an explorative analysis. First, we borrow from qualitative matrix analysis and graph theory some basic concepts to assess direct and indirect links among sectors, and interrelatedness measures are derived in a straightforward way. However, qualitative analysis of indirect links may be flawed, since it can establish a path that is quantitatively negligible. Then, we turn our attention to a non-standard quantitative index derived from structural path analysis, expressed by a simple function of the input matrix determinant. Since empirical findings indicate a structural break in 1975, we derive another measure of technical change: the dominant eigenvalue. Such an index has several interesting properties but no clear relationship to the circularity process implicit in the Leontief model. Results for constant- and actual-price IO tables are discussed and compared with main macro-economic variables over the sample. Empirical findings indicate a relationship between investment, variability in final demand and aggregate structural change.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to build the {{so-called}} RAWS/RAW method to estimate an <b>annual</b> series of <b>Input-Output</b> <b>Tables</b> (IOTs) in 2000 reference of Brazilian national accounts.

40|$|Conventional studies {{into the}} impacts of {{economic}} shocks using global <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> (sensitivity analyses) assume stable production structures and thus, only reveal the marginal impacts of changes in final demand. However, when economic shocks occur, whether at home or abroad, economic agents are expected to react to reduce the negative impact or amplify the positive effects. The ability of a country to contain economic losses {{can be defined as}} the resilience to economic shocks. Using the OECD's <b>annual</b> Inter-Country <b>Input-Output</b> (ICIO) <b>tables,</b> 1995 to 2011, this paper investigates the relationship between changes in final demand and production structures for 61 economies. Our findings are summarized as follows. Production and final demand structures tend to change to reduce the negative feedbacks from final demand shocks. During economic downturns, structures tend to change so that the dependency on domestic services increases, while the dependency on domestic demand for goods, and the dependency on foreign demand for domestic goods and services, both decrease. Therefore, the domestic service sector seems to {{play a key role in}} temporarily containing the negative feedback. Countries that are able to prop up their economy by domestic service sectors instead of domestic goods and foreign sectors are more resilient to negative economic shocks...|$|R
40|$|Do {{multinational}} corporations (MNCs) crowd out domestic firms in developing countries, or is {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) complementary to domestic firm profitability, productivity, and employment? Empirical literature has identified diverse channels through which FDI facilitates aggregate spillovers to the host economy-including total factor productivity (TFP) transfers, employment generation, as well as backward and forward linkages-however there is much less consensus regarding the structural preconditions that maximize the net gains from such spillovers. In this work, I quantify the trade-offs from FDI across ten expansive sectors of the Colombian economy, combining econometric and inter-industry linkage analyses to capture the impact of FDI on industry output, labor payments, firm productivity, and productive diversification. I first apply fixed effects multivariate regression models to a rich longitudinal panel of Colombian and foreign firm financial statements to capture the marginal effect of a 1 % increase in MNC sector output share on domestic industry output and labor payments (as a proxy for employment). Combining this dataset with information from the Colombian national accounts, I construct <b>annual</b> <b>input-output</b> <b>tables</b> distinguishing domestic from MNC intermediate purchases, improving on the proxy for backward linkages proposed by Javorcik (2004). I then test for total factor productivity (TFP) spillovers by sector controlling for factor inputs at the firm level, and instrument for FDI using average wage data on sending countries to improve causal inference. I find a negative and statistically significant correlation between foreign share of sector output and domestic sector revenue-a 1. 8 % average decrease in domestic revenue for a given 1 % increase in MNC sector output share. The impact on wages at the industry level yields a similar result-a 1 % increase in foreign share of output {{is associated with a}} 2. 3 % decrease in average domestic labor payments. The results also suggest countervailing positive and statistically significant (causal) TFP spillovers-a 1 % increase in MNC causes a 2. 2 % increase in average domestic firm revenue through horizontal TFP spillovers, and a 160 % increase in firm revenue through backward TFP spillovers to the manufacturing sector. Further decomposing these effects by industry reveals that specific sectors drive the overall results. We observe that the magnitude of FDI spilllover depends on sector-specific structural characteristics {{that may or may not}} be conducive to growth-perhaps warranting strategic industrial, competitiveness, and FDI targeting policies that are differentiated by the unique role FDI plays in each sector. by Benjamin G.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effect of foreign {{presence}} in the services sector on the productivity growth of downstream customers in the manufacturing sector in six EU new member countries {{in the course of their}} accession to the European Union. For this purpose, the analysis combines firm-level information, data on economic structures and <b>annual</b> national <b>input-output</b> <b>tables.</b> The findings suggest that services FDI may enhance productivity of manufacturing firms in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries through vertical forward spillovers, and thereby contribute to their competitiveness. The consideration of firm characteristics shows that the magnitude of spillover effects depends on size, ownership structure, and initial productivity level of downstream firms as well as on the diverging technological intensity across sector on the supply and demand side. The results suggest that services FDI foster productivity of domestic rather than foreign controlled firms in the host economy. For the period between 2003 and 2008, the findings suggest that the increasing share of services provided by foreign affiliates enhanced the productivity growth of domestic firms in manufacturing by 0. 16 %. Furthermore, the firms' absorptive capability and the size reduce the spillover effect of services FDI on the productivity of manufacturing firms. A sectoral distinction shows that firms at the end of the value chain experience a larger productivity growth through services FDI, whereas the aggregate positive effect seems to be driven by FDI in energy supply. This does not hold for science-based industries, which are spurred by foreign presence in knowledge-intensive business services...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three empirical studies {{on the effects of}} institutions, broadly conceived, on economic outcomes. The first study tests for evidence of causal relationships between provincial quality of governance and economic growth rates in reform-era China, 1985 – 2005. Improvements in governance are found to be significantly predicted by lagged economic growth rates, while economic growth is not found to be predicted by improvements in quality of governance. At the sectoral level, the effect of growth on governance is strongly driven by growth in the secondary sector, while governance is found to {{have a negative effect on}} growth in the primary sector, and a positive, but inconsistent, effect on growth in the tertiary sector. The second study tests the effect of historically-determined regional culture on regional variation in private entrepreneurship during China’s economic liberalization. Provincial success in imperial exams during the Ming dynasty (1368 – 1644) —which required many of the same personality traits as private entrepreneurship today—is used as a proxy for the historical distribution of these entrepreneurial traits, capturing regional variation in cultural values conducive to entrepreneurship. Controlling for a variety of geographic, economic, and policy factors, this historical cultural variation is shown to be significantly associated with entrepreneurial activity in modern times. The third study investigates the offshoring of pollution-intensive production as a response to increasingly stringent regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Using <b>annual</b> multi-regional <b>input-output</b> <b>tables,</b> and matched carbon dioxide emissions data, for 40 countries over the period 1995 – 2009, this study shows that observed increases in the greenhouse gas emissions embodied in imports in developed countries—previously linked to offshoring of pollution-intensive production by firms facing stricter domestic regulations—have instead been driven purely by overall growth in trade and increasing export production in relatively emissions-intensive developing countries.

However, as long as we know this is the first attempt to estimate a rural-urban inter-regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table.</b> Since many developing countries are characterized by dual economy, we need an analytical tool to investigate the differences in industrial structures and interdependency between rural and urban areas. Using the <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> we estimated, we conducted a LCA and a couple of scenario analysises to study the effects of energy transition in rural households...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{attempts}} to estimate a regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> for Selangor for 2000. Then, the regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> {{is used to}} analyse the production structures in Selangor. Design/Methodology/Approach – The regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> for Selangor is estimated by applying the RAS technique. Accordingly, under the homogeneity assumption of production structures and technologies between Selangor and Malaysia, the structure of Selangor’s inter-industry is estimated based {{on the structure of}} national inter-industry transactions. Findings – Results showed that Selangor has modest production structure and highly dependent on imports and exports. The inter-industry linkages analysis indicated that manufacturing, mining and quarrying, and government service sectors are the key sectors in Selangor, where these sectors have potential to stimulate growth in the economy. Originality/Value – This paper is a pioneer study {{for the construction of a}} regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> for Malaysia, especially for Selangor, by using a partial survey approach. For the purpose of planning, the regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> is an important economic tool because it compiles the whole demand and supply of production sectors in an economy.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} to develop a methodology of the compilation of symmetric Time <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables</b> under the conditions of the Czech Republic. The following aim is to create an input-output model which is based on the compiled symmetric Time <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables.</b> For the practical applications of this model it is crucial to link the created Input-Output model with the Semi-Dynamic Input-Output model. Semi-Dynamic Input-Output model in the conception of the submitted dissertation thesis takes into account several multiplier effects and presents more comprehensive tool {{for the use of the}} Input-Output analyses in this way. The first chapter focuses on the development of the issues linked to the <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables</b> and analyses on the territory of the Czech Republic and in the world as well. The second chapter which is also theoretical is focused on mapping of different kinds of Input-Output analyses which are done in the world using Physical, Time or Hybrid <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables.</b> The third chapter is a purely methodological because here it is described the methodology of the compilation of symmetric Time <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables</b> as well as methodological approach to the various sensitivity analyses. The fourth chapter focuses on the creation Semi-Dynamic Input-Output model and on the formal linking with the Input-Output model based on the Time <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables.</b> The last fifth chapter is focused analytically. Methods described in the third chapter are applied on the official published data on the Czech economy. The analytical chapter is perceived in the submitted dissertation thesis as a tool for the sensitivity analysis in the sense of validation of the quality of the compiled Time <b>Input-Output</b> <b>tables...</b>|$|R

In Myanmar, the last <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> {{was constructed in}} (1994 ? 95). The investigation of industrial structure of Myanmar economy by using input-output analysis is not fully documented yet. This study illustrates the full current picture of sectoral development of Myanmar economy by using input-output model {{with the help of}} newly estimated <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> of Myanmar. The results of this study have revealed that agricultural sector and processing & manufacturing sector are the two most important sectors for the extension of primary inputs market and enhancing GDP and export of Myanmar...|$|R
50|$|Leontief {{earned the}} Nobel Prize in {{economics}} {{for his work}} on <b>input-output</b> <b>tables.</b> <b>Input-output</b> <b>tables</b> analyze the process by which inputs from one industry produce outputs for consumption or for inputs for another industry. With the <b>input-output</b> <b>table,</b> one can estimate the change in demand for inputs resulting from a change in production of the final good. The analysis assumes that input proportions are fixed; thus the use of input-output analysis is limited to rough approximations rather than prediction. Input-output was novel and inspired large-scale empirical work; in 2010 its iterative method was recognized as an early intellectual precursor to Google's PageRank.|$|R

This is the first regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table,</b> which will reveal the economic structure {{of the region and}} subsequently to be employed for regional planning by Plan and Budget Organization, Yazd Division, in Iran. The table covers twenty two sectors with the separate export and import vectors which is the main advantage of the table as compared to the other tables constructed so far in Iran. Constructing a survey based regional <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> is a difficult task especially if the required data for certain region have not been already prepared. According to the literature, it is observed that there are variety of non-survey and semi survey techniques. In the case of Yazd, a semi survey based method has been used to construct a twenty two sector <b>input-output</b> <b>table</b> in which almost eighty percent of necessary data are survey- based {{and for the rest of}} data we employed the necessary data collected by survey, data recorded, research projects and finally from the experts.

30|$|The SAM is a data system, {{including}} both {{social and economic}} data for an economy. The data sources for a SAM come from <b>input–output</b> <b>table,</b> national income statistics, and household income and expenditure statistics. Therefore, a SAM is broader than an <b>input–output</b> <b>table</b> and typical national account, showing more detail about all kinds of transactions within an economy. However, an <b>input–output</b> <b>table</b> records economic transactions alone irrespective of the social background of the transactors. A SAM, on the contrary the national accounts, “… attempts to classify various institutions to their socio-economic backgrounds instead of their economic or functional activities” (Chowdhury and Kirkpatrick 1994 : 58).|$|R
