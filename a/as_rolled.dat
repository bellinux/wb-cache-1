25|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) use a solid material, most {{commonly}} a ceramic material called yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), as the electrolyte. Because SOFCs are made entirely of solid materials, {{they are not}} limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of fuel cells and are often designed <b>as</b> <b>rolled</b> tubes. They require high operating temperatures (800–1000°C) and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas.|$|E
25|$|This process uses {{two large}} smooth or {{corrugated}} rolls spinning {{at the same}} speed in opposite directions at a controlled distance. After rolling, the oats are then toasted to make rolled oats. Oat flakes, also known <b>as</b> <b>rolled</b> oats, have many different sizes, thicknesses and other characteristics {{depending on the size of}} oat groats passed between the rolls. Typically, the three sizes of steel cut oats are used to make instant, baby and quick rolled oats, whereas whole oat groats are used to make regular, medium and thick rolled oats. Oat flakes range in thickness from 0.36mm to 1.00mm.|$|E

25|$|The {{tea leaves}} are {{packaged}} loosely in a canister, paper bag, or other container {{such as a}} tea chest. Some whole teas, such <b>as</b> <b>rolled</b> gunpowder tea leaves, which resist crumbling, are sometimes vacuum packed for freshness in aluminised packaging for storage and retail. The loose tea must be individually measured for use, allowing for flexibility and flavor control {{at the expense of}} convenience. Strainers, tea balls, tea presses, filtered teapots, and infusion bags prevent loose leaves from floating in the tea and over-brewing. A traditional method uses a three-piece lidded teacup called a gaiwan, the lid of which is tilted to decant the tea into a different cup for consumption.|$|E
500|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{are unique}} [...] "one-dimensional systems" [...] {{which can be}} envisioned <b>as</b> <b>rolled</b> single sheets of graphite (or more precisely graphene). This rolling can be done at different angles and curvatures resulting in different nanotube properties. The diameter typically varies in the range 0.4–40nm (i.e. [...] "only" [...] ~100 times), but the length can vary ~10,000 times, reaching 55.5cm. The nanotube aspect ratio, or the length-to-diameter ratio, can {{be as high as}} 132,000,000:1, which is unequalled by any other material. Consequently, all the properties of the carbon nanotubes relative to those of typical semiconductors are extremely anisotropic (directionally dependent) and tunable.|$|E

60|$|For {{purposes}} of registration, {{the method of}} printing to be employed, must be one that gives little trouble on the one hand, and yields the maximum of efficiency for that amount of trouble on the other. Sir W. Herschel impressed simultaneously the fore and middle fingers of the right hand. To impress simultaneously the fore, middle, and ring-fingers of the right hand ought, however, to be better, the trouble being no greater, while three prints are obviously more effective than two, especially for an off-hand comparison. Moreover, the patterns on the ring-finger are much more variable than those on the middle finger. Much <b>as</b> <b>rolled</b> impressions are to be preferred for minute and exhaustive comparisons, they would probably be inconvenient for {{purposes of}} registration or attestation. Each finger has to be rolled separately, and each separate rolling takes more time than a dab of all the fingers of one hand simultaneously. Now a dabbed impression of even two fingers is more useful for registration purposes than the rolled impression of one; much more is a dabbed impression of three, especially when the third is the variable ring-finger. Again, in a simultaneous impression, {{there is no doubt}} as to the sequence of the finger prints being correct, but there may be some occasional bungling when the fingers are printed separately.|$|E
