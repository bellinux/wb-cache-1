5000|$|Side impact {{protection}} beams, also called <b>anti-intrusion</b> bars.|$|E
50|$|An <b>anti-intrusion</b> bar or beam is {{a passive}} safety device, {{installed}} in most {{cars and other}} ground vehicles, which must protect passengers from side impacts.Side impacts are particularly dangerous for two reasons: a) the location of impact {{is very close to}} the passenger, who can be immediately reached by the impacting vehicle; b) in many side-impact accidents, the impacting vehicle may be larger, taller, heavier, or structurally stiffer than the struck vehicle. The role of an <b>anti-intrusion</b> bar is to absorb the kinetic energy of the colliding vehicles that is partially converted into internal work of the members involved in the crash.|$|E
50|$|Several vehicle safety {{changes are}} {{mandatory}} on all races, including revised steering column mounting, and garage-only fuel couplers. <b>Anti-intrusion</b> plating, escape hatches and toeboard foam are also required on all restrictor plate races, but are optional on all other races.|$|E

50|$|The <b>anti-intrusion</b> {{bars are}} {{generally}} made of high strength steels. However, some {{studies indicate that}} stainless steel 304 {{might be a better}} choice, because of its larger plastic field and a larger amount of potentially absorbed energy before fracture. In the scientific and technical literature, some unconventional material combinations have been proposed, too, e.g. based on metal foam filled tubes or composite materials.|$|E

The brake line also has a load-sensing proportioning valve which prevents rear wheel lock-up on wet surfaces when the Juara is lightly loaded. However, there are no airbags or an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS).|$|E
50|$|Starting at {{the fall}} Talladega race, NASCAR allowed teams to run {{additional}} <b>anti-intrusion</b> panels at superspeedway races. The components are optional for 2016, required at superspeedway races in 2017, and required at all races in 2018.

As the figure shows, the typical profiles can be open or closed (tubular, usually with a round cross section). [...] They are conventionally made by stamping or hydroforming processes. When the cross section is closed, the tubes can be used as-received. In the scientific and technical literature, some unconventional designs have been proposed.|$|E

A closed-top design, it incorporates several new mechanical and safety features not used in the Oreca 03 car. Zylon <b>anti-intrusion</b> panels are built into the frame that prevent any mechanical components from coming into the chassis {{in the event of an}} accident. The car is smaller than the normal LMP2 class; the 05's frame is 1900mm wide while most other cars have a 2000mm frame. The 05 has an electrical power steering system and an improved gearbox.|$|E

In a 2010 interview with Il Giornale, he said he was providing consulting services to the wealthy, teaching them how to protect their properties, for a fee of up to €2000. He says all home security alarm systems have flaws, none will deter professional thieves, and that all passive infrared sensors and <b>anti-intrusion</b> devices can be circumvented.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{functions}} of metallic foams in vehicles are to increase sound damping, reduce weight, increase energy absorption {{in case of}} crashes, and (in military applications) to combat the concussive force of IEDs. As an example, foam filled tubes {{could be used as}} <b>anti-intrusion</b> bars. [...] Because of their low density (0.4-0.9 g/cm3), aluminium and aluminium alloy foams are under particular consideration. These foams are stiff, fire resistant, nontoxic, recyclable, energy absorbent, less thermally conductive, less magnetically permeable, and more efficiently sound dampening, especially when compared to hollow parts. Metallic foams in hollow car parts decrease weakness points usually associated with car crashes and vibration. These foams are inexpensive to cast with powder metallurgy, compared to casting other hollow parts.|$|E

Additional changes include loss of aerodynamic grip via smaller front splitter and rear diffuser, stiffer roll cages, an Earnhardt bar (<b>anti-intrusion</b> bars on the windscreen), and side window nets on both sides, {{both of which are}} required in the Rolex Series. As is the rule, a specification Continental tyre is used. Compared to the Audi R8 LMS ultra, the R8 Grand AM has lower down force.|$|E
50|$|The {{minimum weight}} of the cars at all times during an event was {{increased}} to 702 kg, a difference of 10 kg from 2014, addressing concerns raised the year before that the lighter weight limit forced taller drivers to become unhealthily slim. The ban on front-and-rear interconnected suspension systems (FRIC) that had been implemented {{in the middle of}} the 2014 season was formalised, with the regulations stating that the front and rear suspension had to be designed in such a way that any change in performance had to be a direct result of a change in load applied solely to them. The <b>anti-intrusion</b> panels on both sides of the survival cell were extended upwards to the rim of the cockpit and alongside the driver's head in order to improve the drivers' safety in event of a side impact. Titanium skid blocks on the underside of the car were made mandatory for the 2015 season, which led to a return of sparks being created by the cars as the underbody touched the track.|$|E

40|$|The {{role of an}} <b>anti-intrusion</b> bar for {{automotive}} use is {{to absorb}} the kinetic energy of the colliding bodies that is partially converted into internal work of the bodies involved in the crash. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the performances of a new kind of <b>anti-intrusion</b> bars for automotive use, filled with metallic foams. The reason for using a cellular material as a filler deals with its capacity to absorb energy during plastic deformation, while being lightweight. The study is the evolution of a previous paper presented by the authors at Esaform 2010 and will present new results and findings. It is conducted by evaluating some key technical issues of the manufacturing problem and by conducting experimental and numerical analyses. The evaluation of materials and shapes of the closed sections to be filled is made in the perspective of a car manufacturer (production costs, weight reduction, space availability in a car door, etc.). Experimentally, foams are produced starting from an industrial aluminium precursor with a TiH 2 blowing agent. Bars are tested in three point bending, in order to evaluate their performances in terms of force-displacement response and other specific performance parameters. In order to understand the role of interface between the inner surface of the tube and the external surface of the foam, different kinds of interface are tested...|$|E

Cold rolling was used to produce intensive nano-twins so that the microstructure was greatly refined. Recovery is employed to anneal dislocations for improving the ductility. A physical model is proposed to describe the relationship between the yield stress and the twin density. Furthermore, the present work also found that the activation energy for recovery is ~ 160  J/mol, which implies that the recovery mechanism is governed by dislocation core diffusion...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years radar sensor {{networks}} for localization and tracking in indoor environment have generated more and more interest, especially for <b>anti-intrusion</b> security systems.

The system has two different input signals: the magnetic background field (natural + artificial) and a signal composed by the magnetic background field and the signal due to the target magnetic field. The system uses the first signal as filter for the second one to detect the target magnetic signal. The effectiveness of the procedure is related to the position of the magnetic field observation points (reference devices and sentinel devices).

40|$|Engineering of Personnel Protection Systems (PPS) {{in large}} {{research}} facilities, such CERN, represents nowadays {{a major challenge}} in terms of requirements for safety and access control functionalities.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{civilian}} protection, and suggests solutions based on the peculiar characteristics of such scenarios, specifically the severe limitations in testing an underwater detection system {{in the field and}} the limited economic resources available. The first part of this work focuses directly on the main security problem, describing a new approach, based on simulating tools, to analyze and verify harbours protection levels. Traditionally based on trial-and-error methodologies, building an underwater <b>anti-intrusion</b> system is a complex operation, starting from choosing the right sensors to be placed in the specific scenario to configuration deployments into the water. Using a simulating tool can be an efficient way to get better information on the <b>anti-intrusion</b> behaviour before dipping any sensor into the water and then with a very limited influence on the normal port activities. More specifically this could even be the only solution for civilian ports protection. The simulator tool is based on a GIS architecture, acoustic and magnetic sensor models and an event driven simulator to simulate the sensors performance in their relation with the specific sea environment and intruder classes (diver, ships, etc), providing operational and ready-for-action data in order to build or modify an <b>anti-intrusion</b> system. The second part describes four low-cost monitoring systems for marine areas and the major problems connected with the underwater localization. All the systems, based on passive acoustic hydrophones, can be used to protect and monitor non-critical zones such as fishing farming installations, archaeological sites or protected marine areas, and in general in situation in which access may be always or temporary forbidden to unauthorized personnel. The first system shown is based on only one hydrophone, using a very simple acoustic propagation model, to track and localize the threat. Two and three hydrophones systems are then described making the installation more complex and expensive but effectively increasing the localization performance and reliability. Finally, the discussion goes further using an autonomous underwater vehicle with very limited computational and signal acquisition capabilities to localize a fixed underwater source of sound. In this part the problem is not in the localization itself, for the vehicle can carry up to four hydrophones, a number that is sufficient to localize exactly a sound source in a three dimensional scenario, while the challenge is in the very limited vehicle acquisition resources which make useless all the traditional localization algorithms based on reliable signal delays among the hydrophones. Besides, while the security problem has to be investigated directly, underlining systems performance with respect to specific threats, on the other side, it involves even several side tasks that have to be accomplished to make the general one completed. Protecting marine areas means having the best knowledge of the areas we are interested in, and then providing a large amount of data both from historical databases and from new experiments in order to get up-to-date geographic and environmental information. The third part of the thesis is in fact related to a very important but side field in the whole security aspect and it concerns with marine areas exploration through a platoon of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) performing point-wise measurements or observations. The proposed algorithms, based on a fuzzy like approach or on the use of radial basis functions (RBFs), allow to adapt vehicles exploration to the specific conditions the agents are into, without any need of an a-priori knowledge of the mission area, incrementally controlling the approximation error of the overall environmental quantity as the mission goes on and new scattered data are provided. The algorithms can be applied to more general cases in which point-wise measurements are required and mobile sensors networks are used, even though, in this thesis, they are especially aimed to environmental monitoring and exploration of oceanic regions...|$|E
40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are being increasingly incorporated into automotive body structure to reduce vehicular weight without adversely affecting crashworthiness. Ultra-{{high strength}} steel (UHSS), a sub-set of AHSS, possess excellent <b>anti-intrusion</b> properties which make them very suitable for fabricating crash relevant automotive structures. The steel is usually coated {{as a necessary}} preparation for further processing. During resistance spot welding, the principal joining method for body-in-white automotive structures, the contact resistance, which is principally determined by {{the properties of the}} coating, play key role in defining welding parameters, thermal profiles, microstructure and eventually, sometimes, mechanical properties of the joint. 	In this work, the contact resistance associated with AlSi and galvannealed coatings on Usibor 1500 hot stamping steel were determined using their dynamic resistance profiles. The results showed significant differences in the contact resistance values associated with the different coatings, and the trend in these values represented trends in current requirements for attaining acceptable nuggets sizes during resistance spot welding. Although peak load for tensile shear loading in static mode was similar for the AlSi and galvannealed coated sheets, there were significant differences in failure mode transition characteristics and energy absorption capabilities associated with the different coatings. Moreover, it was found that joints formed from dissimilar combinations of AlSi and galvannealed coated sheets exhibited poorer mechanical properties than either of AlSi or galvannealed coated sheets...|$|E
40|$|At Esaform 2013 a {{hierarchical}} metamodeling approach had been presented, able to com- bine {{the results of}} numerical simulations and physical experiments into a unique response surface, which is a "fusion'' of both data sets. The method had been presented {{with respect to the}} structural optimization of a steel tube, filled with an aluminium foam, intended as an <b>anti-intrusion</b> bar. The prediction yielded by a conventional way of metamodeling the results of FEM simulations can be considered trustworthy only if the accuracy of numerical models have been thoroughly tested and the simulation parameters have been sufficiently calibrated. On the contrary, the main advantage of {{a hierarchical}} metamodel is to yield a reliable prediction of a response variable to be optimized, even in the presence of non-completely calibrated or accurate FEM models. In order to demonstrate these statements, in this paper the authors wish to compare the prediction ability of a "fusion'' metamodel based on under-calibrated simulations, with a conventional approach based on calibratedFEMresults. Both metamodels will be cross validated with a "leave-one-out'' technique, i. e. by excluding one ex- perimental observation at a time and assessing the predictive ability of the model. Furthermore, the paper will demonstrate how the hierarchical metamodel is able to provide not only an average esti- mated value for each excluded experimental observation, but also an estimation of uncertainty of the prediction of the average value...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new simulative approach {{to assess the}} level of underwater security in civilian harbor installations, {{with the aim of}} bridging the gaps between system specifications and operative performance of <b>anti-intrusion</b> systems. The integration of a geographical information system (GIS), acoustic and magnetic sensor models, with a dynamic simulator makes it possible to simulate the impact of both new sensors and modification in the sensors placement in the overall harbor protection system. With the proposed approach it is possible to model the harbor environment including geographical and environmental information, to set up the surveillance system with underwater acoustic and magnetic sensors and reacquisition vehicles, and to add several types of intruders to estimate, through dynamic simulations, what security level is obtained by the sensors configuration chosen against the selected intruder. The intention is that of hiding the physical aspects of acoustic and magnetic propagation while providing high-level figures of merit (probability to stop the intruder, expected halt distance from the high value asset (HVA), and expect halt time to intercept) capable of a clear representation of the system capability to detect, classify, and stop a menace. For this purpose, a software simulator tool has been developed and its usage in several scenarios has been reported (e. g., sensors configuration and deployment, performance sensitivity to changing oceanic conditions) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a fusion metamodeling {{approach}} is suggested {{as a method}} for reducing the experimental and computational effort generally required for calibrating the parameters of FEM simulations models. The metamodel is used inside an optimization routine for linking data coming from two different sources: simulations and experiments. The method is applied to a real problem: the optimal design of a metal foam filled tube {{to be used as}} an <b>anti-intrusion</b> bar in vehicles. The model is hierarchical, in the sense that one set of data (the experiments) is considered to be more reliable and it is labeled as “high-fidelity” and the other set (the simulations) is labeled as “low-fidelity”. In the proposed approach, Gaussian models are used to describe results of computer experiments because they are flexible and they can easily interpolate data coming from deterministic simulations. Since the results of experiments are obviously fully accurate, but aleatory, a second stage (“linkage”) model is used, which adjusts the prediction provided by the first model to more accurately represent the real experimental data. In the paper, the modeling and prediction ability of the method is first demonstrated and explained by means of artificially generated data and then applied to the optimization of foam filled tubular structures. The fusion metamodel yields comparable predictions (and optimal solution) if built over calibrated simulations vs. non-calibrated FEM model...|$|E

It was sponsored by Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG) and Joint Program Manager – Guardian (JPM-G), and was managed by the Product Manager- Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS). The experiment was an effort to utilize existing technical solutions from all branches of the military in order to provide more efficient and effective force protection. The FPJE consisted of four separate Integration Assessments (IA), which were intended as opportunities to assess the status of integration, automation and fusion efforts, and the effectiveness of the current configuration and “system ” components. The underlying goal of the FPJE was to increase integration, automation, and fusion of the many different sensors and their data to provide enhanced situational awareness and a common operational picture.

These sensors were originally designed for employment by infantry soldiers at the platoon level to provide early warning of personnel and vehicle intrusion in austere environments.

40|$|Many of the {{existing}} Publish/Subscribe systems only provide communication functionalities without giving security guarantees to applications that use these features. The negative effects of this lack of security is exacerbated if the application {{context in which the}} system is working is a critical infrastructure such as production offshore (oil rigs or installations of kinetic energy recovery of the waves are only two examples) and if equally critical are the applications that use the communications services offered by the middleware (eg monitoring and control systems or <b>anti-intrusion</b> systems). It is therefore necessary that in such contexts, the communication infrastructure can provide strong guarantees of security and reliability to the applications. This thesis extends a particular Publish/Subscribe system, MOOS (Mission Oriented Operating Suite), adding security services that increase the level of reliability and robustness that the system can offer to applications in order to use the system in underwater acoustic networks. Adding to MOOS a component called Security Manager makes the system able to offer confidentiality at packet and message level, integrity check, anti-replay, intrusion detection and authentication of the client. What has been achieved is a suite of security features, called Secure-MOOS, completely modular, easily configurable through parameters entered in an appropriate configuration file and characterized by the fact that every function is activated regardless of the other so that the system can offer to each application, the configuration that will best meet its security requirements. Given the criticality of the applications and the context for which Secure-MOOS was designed, and given the limited bandwidth of submarine physical transmission channel, great attention has been paid in introducing delays in communications and in increasing the size of the packets...|$|E
40|$|The 2 D (range and azimuth) {{radar system}} here {{presented}} {{has been developed}} for civilian and industrial <b>anti-intrusion</b> applications and {{has been designed to}} provide an impassable protection barrier with controllable width (down to one meter). It is based on a CW double chirp technique: a linearly changing frequency signal is transmitted and the signals reflected by possible intruders (targets) are properly processed to determine, by analyzing their frequency content, the position in azimuth and range of the target itself. The system is mainly composed of a 24 GHz transceiver module for the transmission and reception of the signals, a real-time processing DSP-based board and an interface board for communication with the user and with external devices. The transceiver module includes one transmitting (TX) and two receiving (RX) antennas and an MMIC chip for the generation of the radar signals and the reception of echoes and their coherent pulse compression and filtering. The TX and RX antennas are patch 2 D arrays with a designed beam-width of approximately 6 ° and side-lobe suppression achieved through appropriate elements power tapering. The main element of the transceiver is an MMIC chip which converts the triangular continuous wave generated by the DSP board into a varying frequency (24 - 24. 250 GHz) wave for feeding the TX antenna. The high frequency received echo signals are then pulse compressed by the MMIC, filtered and sent back to the DSP board. The processing board is equipped with a DAC, four ADCs, a 300 MHz DSP and many peripherals. The received echo signals, converted into frequency domain through complex FFT, are processed with sophisticated algorithms for background removal (MTI filter), thresholding (CFAR algorithms, RCS analysis and more) and range determination. The determination of the azimuthal position of the target is based on a phase comparison mono-pulse technique. The analysis allows to determine both the range and the azimuth position and to accurately achieve the desired 2 D shape of the detection area (usually a very narrow BLADE shape). The sophisticated processing algorithm makes the system resilient to atmospheric events such as wind, snow and rain, and capable of discriminating between human targets and small animals. The interface board gives the user the possibility to properly configure the radar system by setting all the parameters through an appropriate GUI and regulate the radar sensitivity all over the protection area. Furthermore, it allows the system to be integrated in a network of sensors, video cameras and other device...|$|E
