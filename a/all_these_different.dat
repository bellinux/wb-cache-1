The only style that all 38 bore was the British Railways lined Brunswick Green and the entire class was turned out thus beween 1955 and 1958.|$|E
5|$|What <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> {{varieties}} of functionalism share {{in common is}} the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E
5|$|Catabolism is {{the set of}} {{metabolic}} {{processes that}} break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), {{as shown in the}} table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates, and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.|$|E

Later that month, Bell talked about some of the new character pairings in the season, saying [...] "Putting Mack and Daisy together; putting Hunter and May together; putting Bobbi and Fitz together—suddenly you have <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> dynamics, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> stories that you didn't have before." [...] Tancharoen later highlighted the number of characters in the season compared to previous, stating that [...] "There's more scale and scope, but at the same time, I think we're diving into each character's internal struggle a little bit more." ...|$|E

[...] We made grindcore a bit easier to listen to {{at the expense of}} the diehard grindcore fans who thought that we were, well, not sellouts, but not really true to the original essence of grindcore." [...] Other Swedish groups, such as General Surgery and Regurgitate, practiced goregrind. Inhume, from the Netherlands, Rotten Sound, from Finland, and Leng Tch'e, from Belgium, were subsequent European groups who practiced grindcore with death metal inflections. In 2000s, the Belgium-based Aborted [...] "had grown into the role of key contributors to the death-grind genres".|$|E
500|$|Referred to as a [...] "genre roulette" [...] by the San Francisco Chronicle, Post {{touches on}} various musical styles, {{including}} industrial music, big-band jazz, trip hop, chillout, and experimental music. Jim Farber, reviewing the album in 1995 for Entertainment Weekly, considered Post to be a [...] "connecting point between industrial-disco, ambient-trance, and catchy synth pop". When asked if this variety of genres was intentional, Björk replied: [...] "Yes, I'm {{very aware of}} that. I've got very many sides to me. To be honest, I think everyone has got a thousand sides to them. It's called being human. Nature gave us that kinda complexity. Most people pretend they're only one thinglike : [...] "cool" [...] or [...] "intelligent" [...] or [...] "stupid" [...] or [...] "caring". But I think everyone are all of these things, including me". She recognises Post as darker and more aggressive than Debut, and has identified independence, strength, and instinct as its lyrical themes. In a 1997 interview, the singer said: [...] "Post... {{a bit like the}} Tin Tin books. Sort of Tin Tin goes to Congo. Tin Tin goes to Tibet. So it's <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> flavors, me sort of trying <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> things on". The balance between synthetic and organic elements in the album—generated through the combination of electronic and [...] "real" [...] instruments—is a recurring characteristic of Björk's output. In 1999, Vibe stated: [...] "Fusing techno, industrial, ambient, punk, and the rarefied yet tuneful spheres of art rock, Björk explores a jungle of tones, supported by her eternally buoyant voice from Mars." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Back to the Shack" [...] {{was written}} by Rivers Cuomo and Jacob Kasher Hindlin. The song was {{produced}} by Ric Ocasek. Cuomo wrote {{a majority of the}} song, with Karl Koch describing Jacob Kasher Hindlin's contribution to the song as [...] "randomly singing out the title while hanging out on the couch listening to [...] strumming the song. It doesn't take much to get half a songwriting credit." [...] At one point, the song was performed with the bridge containing the lyric [...] "we belong in the rock zone", before Cuomo, based on fan suggestions changed it from [...] "rock zone" [...] to [...] "rock world". Regarding the composition of the song, Cuomo stated that he [...] "tried to find different melodies and different beats and <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> things." [...] Further, he stated that as he [...] "couldn't crack the code" [...] they had to go ahead and record it anyway. Ocasek introduced a synth melody line to the song during this period.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{included}} in Pitchforks list of their staff's favorite music books. Contributing writer Matthew Perpetua said the book's writers—either top critics at the time or those who have since become important figures in music journalism—outline the [...] "alternative sensibility" [...] by recognizing and connecting music from disparate genres in [...] "an inclusive, open-minded survey, but it's defined as much by what's left out—pretty much all Boomer-oriented rock—as what it includes." [...] According to Perpetua, the [...] "number of young readers [...] pursued music criticism" [...] because of the book was far greater than the copies it sold. Matthew Schnipper, editor of The Fader, bought the book after it was published and said he {{used it as a}} consumer guide for 10 years. Along with its influence on future critics, the book was cited by guitarist William Tyler as his only source of music education growing up, having found it in a bookstore around the time it was published: [...] "They had entries for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> people that I had never heard of: Can, John Zorn, [...] Fahey, whatever...

500|$|Like other ABC shows, Quantico has a racially-diverse cast (allowing {{viewers to}} relate {{to at least one}} character) as FBI {{recruits}} who deal with their individual problems. Safran had wanted the show to be diverse from the beginning, saying: [...] "You’re not just watching people who have struggled to achieve places of power and they’re there. This show is about the struggle to achieve that. Their politics and their racial makeup and their religious backgrounds are very important to their characterizations and who they are. I really am interested in looking at how every culture handles stress — and in particular, how people from <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> backgrounds find their place in the FBI, an agency that has historically fraught relationships with gay people and people of color." [...] The first actor cast in the series was Tate Ellington, as FBI trainee Simon Asher. Graham Rogers was then cast as another FBI trainee, Caleb Hass. It was announced that Aunjanue Ellis had signed to play Miranda Shaw, assistant director and training supervisor of the academy. Dougray Scott was then cast as Liam O'Connor, Miranda's former partner and current subordinate.|$|E
