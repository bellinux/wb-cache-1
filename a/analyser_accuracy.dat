40|$|Copper {{flotation}} profit can {{be estimated}} online utilising the assay of the on-stream analysers. High and low limits of the profit can be calculated, and the range between limits {{can be used for}} an evaluation of the return on investment, which has to be done during the implementation of a new control system or analyser. The range depends on the target values for concentrate and tailings, and on the accuracy of the controls and analyser. The separate pay-back values from any improvement in the controls or the <b>analyser</b> <b>accuracy</b> are estimated. The economic effect is analysed and demonstrated on data collected from two flotation plants. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} master thesis was to {{implement}} algorithm for bidirectional classifi cation of sequences described in article of Libin Shen and col. This work builds on implementation and experimental project Mor ce, morphological tagger based on hidden Markov model with averaged perceptron and on Jan Raab's master thesis, which goal was {{to implement}} Viterbi's algorithm and nd best possible set of features for it. This work o ers Shen's algorithm as alternative to Viterbi's algorithm. Limitation of Viterbi's algorithm is in its one-way direction, selection of tag on some position can depend on some already done decisions, but only on preceeding positions. This can cause selection of suboptimal candidate and regression of <b>analyser</b> <b>accuracy.</b> This work implements algorithm, that works bidirectionally and can use already done decisions {{from both sides of}} current position, keeping tolerable complexity...|$|E

40|$|Point-of-care testing (POCT) is {{becoming}} an important adjunct to haematology laboratory practice. An {{important component of the}} blood count is the total white cell count (WBC). Previously, this required laborious microscopic cell counting, but it can now be performed by means of automation; however, in many under-resourced countries, costly automated counters are only available in very few central hospitals. Moreover, neither method is practical in most POCT situations. The HemoCue WBC has been developed as a simplified alternative method, consisting of a reagent pre-loaded disposable cuvette together with basic image analysis technology. This report describes an assessment of its utility. The WBC of 500 routine blood samples from the hospital were tested in parallel by the HemoCue WBC and by a reference <b>analyser</b> to assess <b>accuracy</b> and utility of the former. The tests included precision, linearity, type of blood sample and anticoagulant and potential interfering substances in blood specimens. In the tests for accuracy, 192 of the 200 showed percentage difference from the NEQAS reference of 2 % normoblasts or reticulocytosis showed significant differences from the reference measurements. The HemoCue WBC is reliable for WBC counts within the analytical range of 0. 4 – 30. 0 × 109 /l, except in samples where there are significant numbers of normoblasts or reticulocytes. It is simple to use and provides a valuable advance in the facilities available for POCT in haematology...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This thesis {{focuses on}} the coaxial-microstrip T-resonator {{measurement}} technique to determine the aperture plane capacitance and radiation resistance of electrically short monopoles above a finite ground plane at Radio Frequencies. The determination of these impedance parameters is of interest as they are needed in the Thévenin equivalent circuit of the monopole to establish {{the relationship between the}} monopole, the electromagnetic field within which it is immersed, and its surrounding medium properties. Electromagnetically short monopoles are used in various applications such as in permittivity and biomedical measurement techniques and near-field metrology. The coaxial-microstrip device allows the measurement of transmission coefficient nulls when connected to the network analyser. By measuring the frequency shift in transmission null points and analysing the results, the capacitance of short monopoles of various lengths can be obtained. The radiation resistance of the monopole can also be determined by comparing the depth of transmission coefficient nulls points at various resonant frequencies. Monopoles ranging from flush-mounted to various sizes of protruding centre conductors, both bare and insulated, are investigated in the frequencies ranging from 45 MHz to 3 GHz. The experimental results compare well with FEKO numerical predictions at the ranges where this technique is applicable. The technique is however not applicable near and beyond the resonant frequency of the monopole where it is considered to be electrically long. Measurements to obtain monopole impedance parameters were conducted by connecting the device to the HP 8510 C Network <b>Analyser.</b> To enhance <b>accuracy,</b> the Network <b>Analyser</b> was calibrated using a high quality calibration kit with precisely defined standards. The technique used was found to accurately yield capacitances in the range of 0. 0211 to 1 pF and radiation resistances in the range of 0. 9245 to 12. 1 Ohms. These results were obtained for monopoles of length 0. 0062 < h/l < 0. 24. Results from literature, viz. W. R Scott, R. W. P. King and L. J. Cooper, show radiation resistance in the ranges: 2. 5 to 35 Ohms (0. 079 < h/l < 0. 22), 1. 26 to 74. 08 Ohms (0. 026 < h/l < 0. 28) and 5. 59 to 74. 98 Ohms (0. 1 < 0. 28) for electrically short monopoles. The results of this work are compared with those in the literature and show variations of less than 6 %. A technique capable of accurately measuring capacitance and radiation resistance of the monopole at various lengths of protruding centre conductor has been developed. The capacitance for a flush probe compares very well (agreement is less than 6 %) when compared with those obtained by the previous researchers. The technique is capable of yielding accurate results radio frequencies in the challenging low radiation resistance range around 1 Ohm...|$|R
