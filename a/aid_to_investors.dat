40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in selecting attractive Clean development mechanism (CDM) projects is {{the assessment of the}} potential projects regarding several eligibility criteria set by the CDM modalities and procedures as well as the assessment of the projects' additionality, contribution to sustainable development and financial feasibility. Furthermore, a very important problem is the high transaction costs associated with the initial assessment of attractive CDM projects. In this framework, this paper presents the CDM-PAT (clean development mechanism - pre-assessment tool), a freely accessible web-based project assessment tool, which incorporates the four stages: typical eligibility, viability, additionality and sustainability check and streamlines the CDM modalities and procedures. The CDM-PAT may provide a useful <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> potential <b>investors</b> and project developers, as a supportive preevaluation tool in order to eliminate the number of non-competitive project proposals and, additionally, may become an effective tool for the promotion of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency technologies.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of credit rating agency’s (CRA) {{reputation}} on the discretionary disclosures of corporate bond issuers. Academics, practitioners, and regulators disagree on the informational role played by major CRAs and the usefulness of credit ratings in influencing investors’ perception of the credit risk of bond issuers. Using management earnings forecasts {{as a measure of}} discretionary disclosure, I find that investors demand more (less) disclosure from bond issuers when the ratings become less (more) credible. In addition, using content analytics, I find that bond issuers disclose more qualitative information during periods of low CRA reputation <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>investors</b> better assess credit risk. That the corporate managers alter their voluntary disclosure in response to CRA reputation shocks is consistent with credit ratings providing incremental information <b>to</b> <b>investors</b> and reducing adverse selection in lending markets. Overall, my findings suggest that managers rely on voluntary disclosure as a credible mechanism to reduce information asymmetry in bond markets. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|Impact investors, seeking {{financial}} {{returns from}} investments that actively create social or environmental value, use {{a process known}} as due diligence to vet incoming investment opportunities. Some industry-wide tools have come <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>investors</b> in this task. Existing metrics are not sufficient to assess the environmental performance of investee companies, the result of which is an allocation of increasing investment dollars into ventures and industries that are not operating within the limits of the socio-ecological systems upon which society depends. This paper proposes the creation of an investor toolkit that would allow users to effectively integrate the principles of strategic sustainable development (SSD) into the due diligence process. Such a toolkit would explain how current due diligence support tools could be used to construct comprehensive sustainability analyses of potential investments. The proposed toolkit was conceived after interviews with impact investors, social entrepreneurs, and industry experts. The research findings confirm a need for <b>investors</b> <b>to</b> use a strategic understanding of sustainability during the due diligence process, in order to increase portfolio value over time...|$|R
40|$|The unit trust {{industry}} in Malaysia was first established by British investors in 1959 {{with the introduction}} of the Malayan Unit Trust Ltd. It is called unit trust instead of mutual fund because the ownership of the fund is divided into units of entitlement. Initially, the growth of the unit trust in Malaysia was very slow due to lack of public interest. The purpose of the study are to determine the types of NUTBâ€™s promotional strategies, to identify the level of effectiveness promotional tools used by National Unit Trust Berhad (NUTB), to describe the correlations between NUTBâ€™s promotional strategies with customer motivation to invest and to examine the effect of the promotional tools with the customer motivation to invest in NUTBâ€™s products. The findings from the study found that several strategies should be recommended to National Unit TrustBerhad (NUTB). Firstly, NUTB should increase sales promotion such as high income distribution/dividend, offer scheme death scheme <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> the <b>investors,</b> offer fixed and variable price as well as withdrawal or savings at any time for the investors as this can really encourage Bumiputera and non Bumiputera to invest in NUTB.

40|$|The European Directive on the EU ETS allows {{governments to}} auction up to 10 % of the {{allowances}} issued in phase II 2008 - 2012, without constraints being specified thereafter. This article reviews and extends the long-standing debate about auctioning, in which economists have generally supported and industries opposed a {{greater use of}} auctioning. The article clarifies the key issues by reviewing six `traditional' considerations, examines several credible options for auction design, and then proposes some new issues relevant to auctioning. It is concluded that greater auctioning in aggregate need not increase adverse competitiveness impacts, and could in some respects alleviate them, particularly by supporting border-tax adjustments. Auctioning within the 10 % limit might {{also be used to}} dampen price volatility during 2008 - 2012 and, in subsequent periods, it offers the prospect of supporting a long-term price signal <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>investor</b> confidence.

40|$|Portfolio selection, as {{proposed}} by Markowitz, suggests that investors' needs are best satisfied by selecting an efficient portfolio that minimizes risk and maximizes returns. In search of these efficient portfolios, international investors are now looking more towards emerging markets due to {{the high level of}} financial integration among the world's developed capital markets. Regional cooperation by bodies such as NAFTA, EU and ASEAN, have lead to an increase in the interdependency of the capital markets in these areas. The regional body in the Caribbean, CARICOM, has also undertaken many of the same policies as NAFTA, EU and ASEAN <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> {{in the development of the}} Caribbean. In this paper, we investigate the emerging capital markets of the Caribbean as a potential investment region <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> international <b>investors</b> in attaining an optimal portfolio allocation and to see if regional investors can still adequately diversify their portfolios through local markets. The results show that international investors can effectively diversify their portfolio by allocating capital to all three markets in the Caribbean. Furthermore, there is no evidence of cointegration among the markets of the Caricom region implying that the liberalization measures undertaken in the region have yet to take effect...|$|R

Little academic interest {{has been applied to}} determining economically viable urban agriculture crop production sites for business investment. A feasibility model <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>investors</b> in selecting appropriate sites for the development of urban agriculture food production within population centers was created. Lettuce crop trials were performed from August 2015 to December 2015 at the University of Arizona Controlled Environment Agriculture Center to validate the productivity of a unique high density hydroponic system designed for the rooftop environment. The feasibility model is based on this system and with a minimal number of inputs, ranging from size of growing space to growing media costs, determines a wide range of useful outputs. These outputs include crop productivity within the facility, material inputs and a cost breakdown of starting a new agricultural venture. The model utilizes multiple sheets within one excel document to give the user a clear and organized financial perspective of a hypothetical growing operation in the main sheet. With this model, investors into urban agriculture will have a means to gain an objective view of financial considerations before substantial investment is completed...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is divided}} into an introductory chapter and four essays. Chapter one discusses {{the importance of the}} study and describes the development and growth of the market as well. The first part (Chapters 2 & 3) examines stock returns behaviour and trading activity around earnings announcements. The second part (Chapters 4 & 5) examines price impact asymmetry and the price effects of block trades in the market microstructure context. Each essay addresses some aspects of market microstructure and stock returns behaviour in order <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> researchers, <b>investors</b> and regulators <b>to</b> understand a market which lacks research coverage. The research provides empirical evidence on issues such as the efficiency of the market, information asymmetry, liquidity and price impact of block trades. In first part of the thesis, event study and regression analysis were used to measure the price reaction around earnings announcements and to examine trading activity, information asymmetry and liquidity. In second part the determinants of the price impact of block trades were examined with regard to trade size, market condition and time of the day effects using transaction data. Liquidity and information asymmetry issues of block trades were also studied in this part. I Acknowledgement...|$|R

40|$|Multinational {{enterprises}} (MNEs) {{are expanding}} their global reach, carrying their products and brands to ever more remote {{corners of the}} world. They encounter business environments that vary not only from their country of origin, but also vary greatly amongst each other. Thus foreign <b>investors</b> have <b>to</b> adapt their strategies, most notably their marketing and acquisition strategies, to the local context. In this paper, we outline why globalisation drives MNEs into emerging economies, and we provide conceptual frameworks that may <b>aid</b> <b>investors</b> <b>to</b> adapt their strategies to emerging economy contexts. MNEs have to develop a portfolio of local and/or global brands that matches their competences with local needs. If they aim for market leadership they may pursue a multi-tier strategy, but {{this needs to be}} supported by an appropriate foundation of global and local resources. This strategy in particular requires the acquisition of complementary local resources controlled by local firms. However, acquisitions in emerging economies are inhibited by institutional obstacles and weak local firms. Thus, foreign investors may pursue staged, multiple, indirect, or Brownfield acquisitions to build their projected operation. We illustrate our proposed strategies by analysing how one multination enterprise - Carlsberg Breweries - has developed its operations in three very different emerging economies: Poland, Lithuania and Vietnam...|$|R
