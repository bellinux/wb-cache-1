500|$|At 08:33:59, Atta announced, [...] "Nobody move, please. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the airport. Don't try to {{make any}} stupid moves." [...] At 08:37:08, the pilots of United Airlines Flight 175 {{verified}} Flight11's location and heading to flight control. Boston ARTCC bypassed standard protocols and directly contacted the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) in Rome, New York. NEADS called on two F-15 fighter jets at Otis Air Force Base in Mashpee, Massachusetts, to intercept. Officials at Otis spent a few minutes getting authorization for the fighters to take off. Atta completed the final turn towards Manhattan at 08:43. The order to dispatch the fighters at Otis was given at 08:46, and the F-15s took off at 08:53, roughly seven minutes after American Airlines Flight11 had already crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Of the four hijacked aircraft on 9/11, the nine minutes of advance notification about the hijacking of Flight11 was the most time that NORAD had to respond before the aircraft crashed into its target.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} many bands from {{previous}} decades are still active, like DDT, Korol i Shut and Splean, {{due to the}} lack of new bands gaining significant attention there is a common view that Russian rock is in decline. Ilya Chert from the band Pilot said: [...] "I can see the decline of Russian rock. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the times, when those who are really talanted and wise are operating in basements and clubs with the capacity of 50 people, as they don't commercialize themselves and no one commercializes them". Artemy Troitsky, the famous Russian rock critic, wrote an article called [...] "Rock died a long time ago, but the funeral was impressive", where he brought up the lack of new faces in the Russian rock scene, and accused bands like Mashina Vremeni and Garik Sukachev for [...] "selling out" [...] and not protesting against the current government. Already in 2008 MTV Russia cancelled the nomination [...] "Best Rock Project", with the resulting headlines being [...] "MTV Recognized the Death of Russian Rock".|$|E

2500|$|The {{hijacking}} {{began at}} 8:14am—15 {{minutes after the}} flight departed—when beverage service would be starting. At this time, the pilots stopped responding to air traffic control, and the aircraft began deviating from the planned route. At 8:18am, flight attendants Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney began making phone calls to American Airlines to report what was happening. Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, {{lack of access to}} the cockpit, and passenger injuries. At 8:24:38am, a voice believed to be Atta's was heard by air traffic controllers, saying: [...] "We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returning to the airport." [...] "Nobody move, everything will be OK. If you try to make any moves you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet." [...] "Nobody move, please. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves." [...] The plane's transponder was turned off at 8:28am.
