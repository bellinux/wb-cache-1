2500|$|Cambridge {{remained}} on this station for several years. In January 1759 Sir John was reinforced with a fleet dispatched from England {{under the command}} of Commodore Robert Hughes, consisting of eight two-deckers, a frigate and four bomb ketches. They were <b>also</b> <b>transporting</b> a number of troops {{under the command of}} General Peregrine Hopson. They were instructed to make attacks on French settlements in the West Indies. [...] The first of these was a British expedition against Guadeloupe, for which Moore transferred his flag to HMS Woolwich. Cambridge, in company with HMS Norfolk and HMS St George, were ordered to attack the main citadel. The resulting attack lasted from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, and succeeded in silencing the defences. After this success Commodore Hughes returned to Britain in June, taking Burnet and the Cambridge with him.|$|E

5000|$|The Spacecab {{spaceplane}} design concept {{consists of}} a large crewed [...] "carrier" [...] aircraft with a smaller [...] "orbiter" [...] attached on top, {{both of which are}} derived from Ascender. The carrier would take off from an airstrip and use its turbofan engines to accelerate to mach 2 at which point it would switch over to its LOX/Kerosene rocket engines to accelerate to mach 4. The orbiter craft would then detach and accelerate to orbital speeds and altitudes using its LOX/LH2 rocket. It would be capable of delivering up to 750 kg to low earth orbit, and <b>also</b> <b>transporting</b> supplies and crew to the International Space Station, an increasingly important capability following the retirement of the Space Shuttle.

50|$|During the negotiations, the British {{received}} {{a request to}} escort an ambulance carrying three injured civilian women through the town {{and on to the}} nearest medical facility. Two Warriors were assigned to protect them, with one positioned {{at the front of the}} ambulance and one at the rear. Edwards drove the lead Warrior which left the British base at Gornji Vakuf at 10.30am in the direction of the town centre. Edwards drove with the hatch in the 'open' position for greater visibility. The rear Warrior was <b>also</b> <b>transporting</b> the Regimental Medical Officer, Major Tracy Clarke RAMC. Approximately twelve minutes after leaving the base, as Edwards drove across a bridge, he was struck by a single shot in the head and his Warrior went out of control and mounted the pavement. He was dragged from the vehicle and given first aid while Clarke ran from the rear vehicle to attend him. More Warriors were called from the base and formed a defensive ring as Clarke attempted resuscitation but Edwards had died almost instantly. It is not known who fired the shot.|$|E
50|$|Right by Saint Nicolai Church, {{after the}} Copenhagen Fire of 1728, {{infrastructure}} to fight fires had been constructed because {{the area was}} very densely built up. A basin that could hold 400 barrels of water had been excavated for use. In addition, a pumping station was built that could pump water through an 800-foot-long hose. The pumps were able to raise the pressure to such a level that it could deliver one barrel of water per minute from the hose. But when a spark {{set fire to the}} church tower, nobody could find the key {{to the door of the}} pumping station. Only some time later did anyone think of kicking the door in. By then, the fire had already taken hold and the residents in the surrounding quarter were panicked. The road became so full of people, who were <b>also</b> <b>transporting</b> furniture to safety from the fire, that the water hoses could not be brought close to the fire. Soon the church burned to the ground, and with it the pumps. At that point, the Saint Nicolai quarter could not be saved.|$|E
50|$|At daybreak on 24 January 1761 Minerva, {{still under}} the command of Captain Hood, {{encountered}} a large two-decker ship about 90 nautical miles north-west of Cabo de Peñas in northern Spain. Minerva gave chase and finally caught her at 10.20 a.m. During a brisk engagement lasting no more than 40 minutes the enemy ship lost her main and fore top-mast, while soon after Minerva lost her bowsprit and fore-mast. Both ships were obliged to break off the action to clear the wreckage, but Minerva was ready to resume the fight first and closed with the enemy again at 4 p.m., forcing her to strike her colours after an hour. She proved to be the French ship Warwick (formerly , captured in 1756), a 60-gun ship, but armed with only 34, under the command M. le Vegerde Belair. She had sailed from Rochfort on 20 January, bound for the Isle de France (now Mauritius) loaded with provisions, ammunition, and stores, and <b>also</b> <b>transporting</b> a detachment of 74 soldiers and six other passengers. Warwick had 14 killed and 32 wounded, while aboard Minerve 14 were killed, and 34 wounded, three of whom later died.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we have characterised the {{transport}} of L-arginine and L-ornithine into mitochondria isolated from a wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain and an isogenic arg 11 knock-out mutant. The Arg 11 protein (Arg 11 p) is a mitochondrial carrier required for arginine biosynthesis [Crabeel, M., Soetens, O., De Rijcke, M., Pratiwi, R. & Pankiewicz, R. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25011 - 25019]. Reconstitution experiments have confirmed {{that it is an}} L-ornithine carrier <b>also</b> <b>transporting</b> L-arginine and L-lysine by order of decreasing affinity, but not L-histidine [Palmieri, L., De Marco, V., Iacobazzi, V., Palmieri, F., Runswick, M. & Walker, J. (1997) FEBS Lett. 410, 447 - 451]. Evidence is presented here that the mitochondrial inner membrane contains an L-arginine and L-ornithine transporting system distinct from Arg 11 p, in keeping with the arginine leaky phenotype of arg 11 knock-out mutants. The newly characterised carrier, which we propose to name Bac 1 p (basic amino acid carrier), behaves as an antiporter catalysing the electroneutral exchange of the basic amino acids L-arginine, L-lysine, L-ornithine and L-histidine and displays the highest affinity for L-arginine (Km of 30 microM). L-Arginine uptake has a pH optimum in the range of 7. 5 - 9 and is inhibited by several sulphydryl reagents, by pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate and by cationsPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|As U. S. {{firms have}} {{extended}} their global reach to embrace {{new sources of}} suppliers, they have also been faced with increased pressures to demonstrate that they are socially and environmentally responsible by adhering to sustainable supply chain management practices. Many firms have therefore embraced “sustainability reporting” {{as a means of}} ensuring all stakeholders that they are paying attention to their social and environmental impacts while also maintaining their economic viability. Although guidelines for sustainability reporting have been developed by various international organizations, including the World Resources Institute, the World Business Council on Sustainable Development and the United Nations, sustainability reporting and the reporting framework are voluntary endeavors. As a result, the guidelines may not be followed, and incomplete reporting or inconsistent reports may be disseminated. The objective of this research is to identify common reporting practices as well as discrepancies in environmental reporting of selected U. S. -based consumer goods companies. These global companies are <b>also</b> <b>transporting</b> and distributing products worldwide, giving rise to the second objective of this research which is to summarize environmental reporting practices with respect to transportation and distribution. This research shows that the companies reviewed for this study under-reported carbon emissions and greenhouse gases, often omitting emissions resulting from transportation and distribution; changed performance metrics between reporting periods; and generally engaged in inconsistent reporting practices. The research also shows that upstream supply chain partners tend to provide more thorough reports regarding environmental impacts than downstream supply chain partners. <br /...|$|E
