Referring to this and similar {{examples}} where Harrison placed his overlooked songs with other recording artists, Ken Scott has refuted the idea that he lacked confidence as a songwriter in the Beatles, saying: [...] "I think he was totally confident about the songs.

He had experienced symptoms {{for a number of years}} including blindness in one eye; numbness in both legs; and problems with his bladder, bowel, and stomach. Osbourne injects Copaxone medication daily, uses vitamin supplements and hormone replacement therapy, and has travelled to Europe for stem cell therapy. He has also made lifestyle changes such as minimising stress, exercising regularly, and significantly altering his diet. However, he has spoken of his fear of a rapid decline and has admitted that his doctors have urged him to stop participating in highly intensive physical workouts: [...] "Right now <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a wheelchair? No. But if I don't take care of myself, who knows."

5000|$|It's {{interesting}} about the theme song. Not only is it costly - and that never sort of drives what we do creatively, but I think fans don't understand that there's {{money on the table}} every time they hear the theme song. That sounds like a bullshit producer response, too, but that's a part of it because every year our budget is pretty challenged. Knowing that, when I looked at the jump ahead, the four year jump, I felt like [...] "I Don't Wanna Be" [...] was very much an anthem for their adolescent lives. It was very much about who <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> and who am I and who <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> someday. Not to mention that it was 42 seconds of screen time that I knew I could use for story. So a lot went into the decision to drop the theme song, it wasn't done lightly.|$|E

5000|$|Blues songs {{have the}} {{reputation}} of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. Bessie Smith recorded protest song [...] "Poor Man Blues" [...] in 1928. Josh White recorded [...] "When <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Called a Man" [...] in 1936 - at this time it was common for white men to address black men as [...] "boy" [...] - before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940's Chain Gang and 1941's Southern Exposure - An Album of Jim Crow Blues. Lead Belly's [...] "Bourgeois Blues" [...] and Big Bill Broonzy's [...] "Black, Brown and White" [...] (aka [...] "Get Back") protested racism. Billie Holiday recorded and popularised the song [...] "Strange Fruit" [...] in 1939. Written by Communist Lewis Allan, and also recorded by Josh White and Nina Simone, it addressed Southern racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including Madison Square Gardens. In the post-war era, J.B. Lenoir gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single [...] "Eisenhower Blues" [...] due to its title and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War. John Lee Hooker also sang 'I Don't Wanna Go To Vietnam" [...] on 1969 album Simply the Truth.|$|E

5000|$|Sen Dick Sears, D-Bennington, was a {{key figure}} in passing the resolution. He {{received}} a call from a constituent and became convinced that the strategy made sense. [...] "I think it's an important resolution," [...] Sears said. [...] "Congress isn't going to act, and we've got to do something to get this country back under control." [...] When the resolution reached the House, an emotional plea from South Burlington farmer Benjamin Brown brought about a sense of urgency. [...] "What am I going to tell my children, what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to say to them about this democracy?" [...] Brown asked the legislators. [...] "Vermont has an opportunity to lead right now it's not left and right, it's an issue of democracy," [...] he said. Rep. Mike Yantachka, D-Charlotte, agreed. He described the resolution as, [...] "an opportunity to kick-start a movement that I hope will spread throughout the country and let people become aware of the real problems we have with the influence of money on elections and on our public policy." [...] In contrast to these views, Senate Minority Leader Joe Benning, R-Caledonia, saw the resolution as a grave mistake. [...] "I see it as an attack on free speech," [...] Benning said. [...] "I did not want to give my vote to something that clearly restricts free speech, because I think the First Amendment {{is one of the most}} important amendments we have, if not the most important." ...|$|E
5000|$|The High Commissioner of India to the United Kingdom, V. K. Krishna Menon, was {{notified}} that a delegation would be arriving on 23 October {{to report their}} desire to nominate Nehru. He sent a telegram to Nehru, mistakenly referring to the vacant office {{as that of the}} Vice-Chancellor, and commenting that opinion within the University was in Nehru's favour. Nehru cabled back on the following day correcting the error, and instructing Krishna Menon to tell the delegation that he was [...] "deeply sensible of honour especially coming from my old University" [...] but that he could not accept when he could be of no service. He stressed that it would be undesirable to enter into a contested election. Nehru cabled again on 30 October when his nomination was announced, complaining that [...] "embarrassing questions are put to me" [...] and stated [...] "on no account <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a party to a contest". Krishna Menon replied that the Vice-Chancellor had formally written asking whether Nehru accepted nomination; he noted that in 1847 Prince Albert had not consented to nomination but did not interfere when he was actually nominated. Nehru consulted Lord Pethick-Lawrence, and replied at length on 2 November explaining that reaction in India were [...] "strongly unfavourable" [...] to his contesting the election, and imploring Krishna Menon to get his supporters to withdraw his name. One of Nehru's biographers has claimed that [...] "it was generally recognized that in any election Nehru would carry the majority".|$|E
5000|$|When Morris {{found out}} about her {{characters}} departure due to ABC's decision to not renew Getty's contract, she stated that she was [...] "surprised" [...] and [...] "sad", but added that the [...] "producers were great", and that she felt [...] "fortunate" [...] that Julia was not killed off. Of her reaction {{when she saw the}} script for [...] "Julia", she added; [...] "I was slightly nervous when I got the script and it was titled [...] "Julia" [...] because I thought, <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in every second of this episode? It was fun to get an episode dedicated to my character, and they didn't do what I was expecting. Julia leaves Tommy and makes a choice for herself. I like seeing that from her because she hasn't been the [...] "do things for herself" [...] type of character until this moment". On the characters departure storyline she commented that she was [...] "really happy". [...] "It was a nice farewell, but it was very sad. The one particular day when I had to shoot the dinner and toast the family, I was crying all day". However, Morris did say that she did feel that some aspects of the character were [...] "swept under the rug", adding that it was [...] "unfortunate". [...] "When it came out that both of us had had affairs, there was a scene when Julia says they needed help with their marriage. The show had already done the therapy storyline with Joe (John Pyper-Ferguson) and Sarah, so I get that they didn't want to go there again. But you never got to see them work through their problems. Also being new parents and the whole fertility story got rushed and crammed into one episode". She however did praise the expansion of her character from her affair adding that it is [...] "always more interesting to play someone flawed than someone perfect". [...] "When I first read it, I thought it was an easy way to keep them together, but at the same time, it was realistic that two people could go through something like that. People don't really talk about what happens when both cheat". Finally, Morris added that the character of Julia could return, but the character needed [...] "reinventing". However, Julia never returned, as Brothers & Sisters ended in 2011.|$|E

40|$|Background: There is a {{national}} drive to provide early dementia diagnoses. Patient and family attributions at symptom onset contribute to significant help-seeking delays. Most qualitative studies have interpreted retrospective accounts of the pre-diagnostic period. However, experiential attributions are demonstrated to change over time. Few studies have sought patient and family dyad perspectives prior to diagnosis. Aim: This qualitative study sought to explore patient and family experiences of early cognitive decline and help-seeking during the pre-diagnostic stage. Method: Five patient and familial dyads were interviewed separately to explore their experiences of early stage cognitive decline and help-seeking decisions. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was employed to identify emerging themes. Results: Five super-ordinate themes were identified: The inevitability of ageing; problem awareness; living with forgetting; disclosure to others; and how <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> today? Conclusions: Patient and family dyads have early insight into symptom onset. Before diagnosis, attributions towards ageing, co-morbid illness and contextual factors limit concern. Help-seeking was precipitated by functional decline exposing the individual to potential risks. Health services were a source of reassurance, particularly {{when there was a}} lack of social supports available. Improvements in public awareness of symptoms, assessment and available care for dementia may encourage earlier help seeking...|$|E
