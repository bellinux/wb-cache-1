5|$|An early medieval wall {{stands to}} the west of the Arch of Caracalla; it was built after the end of the Roman occupation, {{apparently}} some time in the 5th or 6th centuries, to protect the eastern side of the city's new residential area. It was oriented in a north-south direction and was constructed using stone looted from ruined buildings elsewhere in the <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> of the city.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants are {{generally}} intolerant of myrmecophiles (which are insects or other organisms that share positive interspecies associations with ants) {{living in their}} colonies, but Cyclotorna larvae are known to dwell in colonies. Although Sphallomorpha larvae sometimes prey on workers as discussed earlier, some are inquilines {{and live in the}} nest commensally. Unused or <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> inside colonies are sometimes occupied by other species of ants and in some cases, termites. Meat ants may deliberately destroy the colonies of the termite Amitermes laurensis if competition between the two intensify.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} factor dominating the river history in Bengal is the large proportion of silt carried by its rivers. It is the silt which has created the land and made it habitable by building it up through the centuries. It is silt which is fertilising the land, but the silt, {{which has been the}} most beneficial gift of nature, has also produced most of the river problems now confronting the people of Bengal. Silt deposited in the old river channel beds has forced them to change course, creating problems for <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> while assisting in developing new areas.|$|E

25|$|PA 61 enters Conyngham Township in Columbia County {{and heads}} {{northeast}} through dense forests as an unnamed four-lane undivided road. Farther northeast, the route narrows to a three lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. PA 61 curves east and becomes two-lane undivided Byrnesville Road, which is designated SR 2002. The former divided highway alignment of PA 61 past this point {{has been closed}} because of the Centralia mine fire {{that has made the}} road unsafe to travel on. The closed section of the road is used by pedestrians and bicyclists and is covered in graffiti. PA 61 follows Byrnesville Road northeast through forests before passing through the abandoned community of Byrnesville. The route curves northwest through more woods and rejoins the closed alignment, at which point SR 2002 ends. At this point, PA 61 enters the borough of Centralia, which has largely been abandoned because of the mine fire, as two-lane undivided Locust Avenue. The road runs north through <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> of the borough which have been overgrown with trees. PA 61 turns west onto West Centre Street, with PA 42 continuing north along Locust Avenue. From here, the route heads west through more abandoned sections of Centralia. The road leaves Centralia for Conyngham Township again and becomes a four-lane divided highway, heading through forested areas and passing to the south of a large coal mine.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{said that}} the second act of the game, {{taking place in the}} less-structured portion of the old Aperture facilities, may be {{confusing}} to some players. Young wrote that in the second act, the game [...] "cranks up the difficulty level at a speed that may dishearten casual gamers", and said that particularly when traveling between chambers, he had [...] "absolutely no idea where I was supposed to head next". [...] Kohler wrote that while the player can explore the <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> of Aperture, [...] "none of it ever does anythingit's just a lot of sterile, duplicated, non-interactive environments". Watters wrote that the loading time between the game's levels, in contrast to earlier Valve games, are [...] "long enough to make you take notice and wish they were shorter". Watters also said that it was unfortunate that the game lacks [...] "stand-alone test chambers and leaderboards...but even so, Portal 2 is not light on content" [...] without these. Welsh {{said that the}} attempt to recapture the spirit of the song [...] "Still Alive" [...] at the end credits of Portal 2 [...] "was a mistake". Video game critic Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw named it the best game of 2011 in his review show Zero Punctuation. However he wrote in his Extra Punctuation column that, while Portal 2 was a [...] "very good game", it unnecessarily retconned portions of the origin game's story, and did not really further the game's concept. However, this criticism was directed solely at the campaign, and he stated that he found the game's co-op to be [...] "much more appealing and much more within the spirit of the original".|$|E

The IDF {{said that in}} several cases Hamas used Wafa hospital as a military base and used ambulances to transport its fighters. According to the Israeli Shabak, many of the militants it interrogated said that [...] "everyone knew" [...] that Hamas leaders were using hospitals for hiding. Hamas security reportedly wore police uniforms and blocked access to {{certain parts of the}} hospitals. One of the interrogated militants reportedly said that civilians seeking medical attention usually were thrown out by the security. The Washington Post described Al-Shifa hospital as a [...] "de facto headquarters for Hamas leaders, who {{can be seen in the}} hallways and offices." [...] Amnesty International reported that: [...] "Hamas forces used the <b>abandoned</b> <b>areas</b> of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, including the outpatients’ clinic area, to detain, interrogate, torture and otherwise ill-treat suspects, even as other parts of the hospital continued to function as a medical centre".|$|E

Therefore, the research on the diversity of plant communities from <b>abandoned</b> agricultural <b>areas</b> as well as main directions and the rate of succession after the cessation of management was undertaken in the vicinity of twelve municipalities in south-eastern Poland. This research revealed that the dominating direction of changes of the <b>abandoned</b> agricultural <b>area</b> vegetation was vanishing of plant groups with segetal and meadow species and spreading of shrub communities. A general increase in the forestation rate of the researched <b>abandoned</b> agricultural <b>areas</b> from 10 - 40 % of the area in 1970 - 1971 to about 30 - 70 % in 2003 - 2004 may be the evidence of the occurrence intensity of those phenomena...|$|R
