40|$|Abstract. We have {{designed}} and built a passive haptic display by integrating an electromagnet into an infra-red optical mouse. When the electromagnet is <b>not</b> <b>energized,</b> the mouse acts normally, with the same low friction and only {{a slight increase in}} mass. Energizing the electromagnet attracts the mouse towards a ferromagnetic mouse pad, increasing the normal force, and thus the frictional force, between the mouse and the mouse pad. This allows a two-dimensional display of varying frictional forces. Our hypothesis was that an increase in friction over particular targets could enable the user to travel more quickly between those targets. In addition to several demonstrations, we designed a performance experiment to quantitatively determine how user performance is affected by friction feedback during a targeting task. The results of this experiment show a conclusive relationship between the field strength of the magnet and the targeting time...|$|R

40|$|U- 14 C]glycine uptake into barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Hasso) vacuoles was investigated. Glycine (2 millimolar) {{transport}} was stimulated two- to fourfold by NaATP. Stimulation was saturable {{with respect}} to ATP (1 millimolar) and linear up to 20 millimolar glycine. Stimulation by NaATP was suppressed by Mg 2 + in equimolar amounts. Neither MgATP nor Mg-inorganic pyrophosphate had any effect on basal transport rate. Thus, the proton motive force can be excluded as the driving force. Uncouplers (valinomycine/carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone) inhibited the basal rate up to 30 % but had no influence on NaATP-stimulated uptake.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common issues in {{permanent}} magnet motors for automotive applications is to improve their capability of operating over very wide speed ranges. For this purposes, various motor design techniques have been proposed in the literature. After a brief review of these techniques, the paper presents an idea for improving the flux weakening capability of permanent-magnet reluctance-assisted motors. The idea is based on using an auxiliary field circuit embedded in flux barriers and used to partly demagnetize the motor above the base speed. The field circuit is fed by a brushless permanent-magnet exciter and a diode rectifier. While at low speed the field is <b>not</b> <b>energized,</b> it automatically activates above the base speed by means of a centrifugal switch. As discussed in the paper, the auxiliary field current increases linearly with the speed so as to progressively reduce motor flux with a consequent beneficial reduction in the current to be fed by the inverter for flux regulation...|$|R

This is for safety for example, workers repairing downed power lines must be protected from [...] "downstream" [...] sources, in addition to being disconnected from the main [...] "upstream" [...] distribution grid. Note: A small generator simply lacks the power to energize a loaded line. This can only happen if the line is isolated from other loads, and is extremely unlikely. Solar inverters are designed for safety while one inverter could <b>not</b> <b>energize</b> a line, a thousand might. In addition, all electrical workers should treat every line as though it was live, even when they know it should be safe.|$|R

Polyphosphate is thought to act as the key intermediate in this process, but little is currently understood about how polyphosphate is synthesized or translocated within arbuscular mycorrhizas. Glomus sp. strain HR 1 was grown with marigold in a mesh bag compartment system, and extraradical hyphae were harvested and fractionated by density gradient centrifugation. Using this approach, three distinct layers were obtained: layers 1 and 2 were composed of amorphous and membranous materials, together with mitochondria, lipid bodies, and electron-opaque bodies, and layer 3 was composed mainly of partially broken hyphae and fragmented cell walls. The polyphosphate kinase/luciferase system, a highly sensitive polyphosphate detection method, enabled the detection of polyphosphate-synthesizing activity in layer 2 {{in the presence of}} ATP. This activity was inhibited by vanadate but not by bafilomycin A 1 or a protonophore, suggesting that ATP may <b>not</b> <b>energize</b> the reaction through H+-ATPase but may act as a direct substrate in the reaction.
