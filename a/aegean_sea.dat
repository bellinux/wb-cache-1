5|$|The Treaty of Phoenice {{prohibited}} Philip from expanding westward into Illyria or the Adriatic Sea, so {{the king}} turned his attentions eastwards to the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea,</b> {{where he started}} to build a large fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea</b> and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in {{no more than a}} few days. However snow is rare in the coastal areas of the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea</b> and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Vladimir Šaškijević {{replaced}} Pavić as captain. In August 1935, Dubrovnik visited Corfu and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia.

5|$|These maps also {{differed}} {{somewhat in}} the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea</b> and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman Rumelia) was debatable.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war in August 1914, Bruix was assigned to protect troop convoys from French North Africa to France before she was transferred to the Atlantic to support Allied operations against the German colony of Kamerun in September. She was briefly assigned to support Allied operations in the Dardanelles in early 1915 before she began patrolling the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea</b> and Greek territorial waters.|$|E
5|$|In 191 BC, Antiochus the Great, the Emperor of the Seleucid Empire of Asia, invaded Greece. The Romans {{decided to}} {{intervene}} and they defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Thermopylae. The defeat by Rome forced the Seleucids to retreat back to Asia Minor. The Romans followed them across the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea</b> and together with their allies, Pergamum, they decisively defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Magnesia.|$|E
5000|$|Acalyptris limonii is a moth of the Nepticulidae family. It {{is found}} along {{the coasts of}} Adriatic, Ionian and <b>Aegean</b> <b>Seas,</b> {{where it has been}} {{recorded}} from Croatia and Greece.|$|R
50|$|In September 1943, {{with the}} Italian {{collapse}} and {{the surrender of}} the Italian fleet, naval actions in the Mediterranean became restricted to operations against U-boats and by small craft in the Adriatic and <b>Aegean</b> <b>seas.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Mycale Strait {{separates}} the peninsula {{from the nearby}} island of Samos. Named after Mount Mycale, the strait is only about [...] long at its narrowest point, {{making it one of}} the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea's</b> smallest straits.|$|R
5|$|In the Balkans, on April 16 (Easter Sunday), Stefan Dušan was crowned in Skopje as Tsar {{of the new}} Serbian Empire, {{which now}} {{occupied}} much of southeastern Europe. Also in 1346, both Bulgaria and Byzantium (which at this time covered most of Greece) {{were in the middle}} of a series of civil wars. At the same time, the Christian-held islands and possessions around the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea</b> were subject to Turkish raids.|$|E
5|$|The 1802 Vrancea {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the Vrancea Mountains of Romania on , on St. Paraskeva's Day. With an estimated intensity of 7.9 on the moment magnitude scale, it is the strongest earthquake ever recorded in Romania {{and one of the}} strongest in European history. It was felt across an area of more than two million square kilometers in Eastern Europe and the Balkans, from Saint Petersburg to the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among other achievements, Bachelder {{developed}} {{methods for}} the purification {{of the rare}} elements tellurium and indium. Other aspects of her broad scientific expertise found application {{in the field of}} marine archaeology, when she determined the chemical composition of brass cannons found in the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea</b> on sunken ships. She also made contributions to astrochemistry, when NASA asked her to analyze the chemistry of Moon rocks which had been collected from the Moon's surface during the Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{participated in}} the Italo-Turkish War of 191112.

50|$|The Corinth Canal, {{carrying}} ship traffic {{between the}} Ionian and the <b>Aegean</b> <b>seas,</b> is about 4 km east of Corinth, {{cutting through the}} Isthmus of Corinth. Corinthia is increasingly {{seen as part of}} the wider metropolitan area of Athens, with municipalities, such as Agioi Theodoroi in the easternmost part of the regional unit, being considered suburbs of Athens.|$|R
5|$|At that time, {{the newly}} {{restored}} Byzantine Empire, {{under the leadership}} of Michael VIII Palaiologos, sought to recover Euboea, which was the major Latin insular possession in the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea</b> and a base for piratical activity directed against his lands. Furthermore, along with the Principality of Achaea it presented the major obstacle to his complete recovery of Greece. Already in 1269/1270, a Byzantine fleet under Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos had attacked and captured many Latin nobles, the town of Oreos.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Italian Armistice in September 1943, two boats were scuttled by their crews. The four {{surviving}} Italian boats were taken over by German forces and commissioned in the Kriegsmarine (German Navy), serving largely in the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea</b> until they were finally scuttled in October 1944 as the Germans withdrew from Greece. The two boats that had escaped to the Allies in 1941 returned to Yugoslavia after the war. They were commissioned in the new Yugoslav Navy and remained in service until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|During the Third Republic (1870–1940) the Louvre {{acquired}} new pieces mainly via {{donations and}} gifts. The Société des Amis du Louvre donated the Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, and in 1863 an expedition uncovered the sculpture Winged Victory of Samothrace in the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea.</b> This piece, though heavily damaged, has been prominently displayed since 1884. The 583-item Collection La Caze donated in 1869, included works by Chardin; Fragonard; Rembrandt – such as Bathsheba at Her Bath – and Gilles by Watteau.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} argued that the zone of Dacian speech {{extended}} beyond the confines of Dacia, as defined by Ptolemy, and Moesia. An extreme view, presented by some scholars, is that Dacian was the main language spoken between the Baltic sea and the Black and <b>Aegean</b> <b>seas.</b> But the evidence for Dacian as a prevalent language outside Dacia and Moesia appears inconclusive: ...|$|R
50|$|Several serious {{accidents}} and deaths {{have occurred in}} Europe {{as a result of}} migrant smuggling, both in the Mediterranean Sea, due to the capsizing of crowded and unseaworthy migrant smuggling vessels, and on European soil, due to the use of standard cargo trucks by smugglers to transport illegal migrants. The vast majority of deaths occurred while persons were being illegally smuggled across the Mediterranean and <b>Aegean</b> <b>Seas.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{relations}} between Turkey and Greece {{during most of the}} 20 th century might be best characterised as one of hostility or perhaps even outright enmity. Since 1974 the Aegean confl ict concerning not only territorial air and sea rights but also sovereign rights over the <b>Aegean</b> <b>seabed</b> and its subsoil has been the central bone of contention between these two eastern Mediterranean countries. For both the economic, security and political implications of the issue are profound...|$|R
5|$|In mid-April 1912, the {{division}} escorted the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions of the Italian fleet from Taranto {{to the eastern}} <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea</b> where it bombarded the fortifications defending the Dardanelles to little effect before the main body departed for Italy on the 19th. Several months later, Vettor Pisani supported an unsuccessful sortie by five torpedo boats into the Dardanelles {{in search of the}} Ottoman fleet on the night of 18/19 July.|$|E
5|$|Napoli saw {{action in}} the Italo-Turkish War in 1911 and 1912; she {{took part in the}} attack on Derna, Libya, and the amphibious assaults on the islands of Rhodes and the Dodecanese in the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea.</b> Napoli {{remained}} in service during World War I in 191518, but saw no action {{as a result of the}} cautious policies of both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. She remained in the Italian inventory until she was stricken from the naval register in August 1926 and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{then moved}} {{north along the}} Ionian coast towards Samos, before {{abruptly}} turning west into the <b>Aegean</b> <b>Sea.</b> The fleet sailed next to Naxos, in order to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition that the Persians had mounted there a decade earlier. Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; those that the Persians caught were enslaved. The Persians then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians.|$|E
50|$|The Balkan Peninsula is {{surrounded}} by the Adriatic Sea to the west, the Mediterranean Sea (including the Ionian and <b>Aegean</b> <b>seas)</b> and the Marmara Sea {{to the south and}} the Black Sea to the east. Its northern boundary is often given as the Danube, Sava and Kupa Rivers. The Balkan Peninsula has a combined area of about 470000 km2 (slightly smaller than Spain). It is more or less identical to the region known as Southeastern Europe.|$|R
5000|$|The {{presence}} of marine shells at Tell Aqab attests to links further afield, {{to the nearby}} Mediterranean or Black Seas. Two specimens of Nassarius circumcinctus and one of Calliostoma zizyphinum were found in mid-to-late Halaf contexts at Tell Aqab. A survey {{of the distribution of}} shellfish in the [...] "Seas of Turkey", no C. zizyphinum nor N. circumcuntus was found in the Black Sea or Sea of Marmara, however both were found in the Mediterranean and <b>Aegean</b> <b>Seas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Venetian galley fleet {{that had}} been on a raiding {{expedition}} in the Mediterranean reached the anchorage off Brondolo on January 1, 1380; this fleet was under the command of Carlo Zeno, who had left on a plundering expedition before the battle of Pola and had been inflicting damage on Genoese trade in the Tyrrhenian and <b>Aegean</b> <b>seas</b> as far as Beirut and Rhodes. Zeno returned home in time to join the blockade of Chioggia. It was the Genoese who now were encircled.|$|R
