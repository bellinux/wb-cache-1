5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, <b>a</b> <b>treadmill</b> (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E
5|$|Kelly and Mission Specialist Linda Godwin {{used the}} Shuttle's robotic arm {{to lift the}} Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from the shuttle payload bay and attach it to a berth on the station's Unity node. The crews began {{unloading}} supplies the same day. Mission managers extended Endeavour's flight duration to 12 days to allow the crew to assist with additional maintenance tasks on the station, including work on <b>a</b> <b>treadmill</b> and replacing a failed compressor {{in one of the}} air conditioners in the Zvezda Service Module. A change of command ceremony took place on December 13 as Expedition 3 ended and Expedition 4 began. STS-108 returned to Earth with the previous ISS crew of three men.|$|E

5|$|Ono {{was also}} an {{experimental}} filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, {{often referred to as}} Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on <b>a</b> <b>treadmill.</b> The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film.|$|E
5|$|The tour's {{production}} and staging {{consisted of a}} 60 foot tall rotating LED cuboid {{referred to as the}} 'Monolith', <b>a</b> <b>treadmill</b> runway and a secondary stage that stores and produces 2,000 gallons of water. The theme of the tour was described as following the same linear chapters to that of the tour's supporting album Lemonade, with each rotation of the aforementioned 'Monolith' representing a new chapter of the show. Several music critics gave the show positive reviews, with a variety of publications praising both the tour's {{production and}} Beyoncé's performance and vocal abilities. The tour had a variety of notable opening acts, including a number of special guests joining prominent opener DJ Khaled on stage. Supporting acts also included artists signed to Beyoncé's own management company, Parkwood Entertainment, such as the duo CHLOE X HALLE, who were relatively unknown at the time.|$|E

40|$|Time limited {{exercise}} on <b>a</b> self powered <b>treadmill</b> was evaluated {{as a method}} of assessing functional capacity in patients with mild heart failure. The characteristics of the treadmill were established by exercising 11 controls at three speeds and two inclinations and comparing oxygen consumption with that on <b>a</b> motorised <b>treadmill</b> under the same conditions. Oxygen consumption on the self powered <b>treadmill</b> at <b>an</b> equivalent speed and inclination was significantly higher because of the work needed to overcome the friction of the belt. Unlike <b>a</b> conventional <b>treadmill,</b> increasing the gradient on the self powered treadmill did not increase oxygen consumption. The distance walked in 12 minutes on the self powered treadmill was measured in eight patients with mild heart failure and ten controls. Maximal oxygen consumption was measured in the same group on <b>a</b> conventional <b>treadmill</b> by <b>a</b> mass spectrometer. There was a significant correlation between the distance walked and maximum oxygen consumption. In patients with mild heart failure the distance travelled in 12 minutes on <b>a</b> self powered <b>treadmill</b> provides <b>a</b> practical, inexpensive, and sensitive method of assessing functional capacity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare perceptual and {{physiological}} variables between running on three different modalities – an indoor athletics track, <b>a</b> motorized <b>treadmill,</b> and <b>a</b> non-motorized curved <b>treadmill</b> – for 1000 m at three different velocities. Ten male athletes (age 24 ± 3 years, body mass 69. 8 ± 6. 91 kg, height 1. 80 ± 0. 06 m, VO 2 peak 69. 0 ± 6. 70 ml/kg/ min) conducted three 1000 m laps at increasing velocity on three different running modalities. The athletes had a 3 -minute recovery between each lap, where the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was registered and the blood lactate concentration and heart rate were measured. Oxygen uptake was measured using a portable metabolic analyser. The physiological (oxygen uptake, heart rate, and blood lactate concentration) and perceptual (RPE) variables were higher when running on <b>a</b> non-motorized curved <b>treadmill</b> compared with running on the track or <b>a</b> motorized <b>treadmill.</b> No differences were found between running on <b>a</b> motorized <b>treadmill</b> and the track except for the RPE, which was lower when running on the track compared with the motorized <b>treadmill.</b> Running on <b>a</b> non-motorized curved <b>treadmill</b> at three different velocities results in a higher oxygen uptake (37 %) and heart rate (22 %) and is subjectively much harder than running on a track or <b>a</b> motorized <b>treadmill</b> at the same velocities. The difference is around 4 km/h when comparing the physiological and perceptual responses. Thus, when performing training sessions on <b>a</b> non-motorized curved <b>treadmill,</b> subjects should subtract 4 km/h from their regular pace on a track or motorized treadmill to get the same response considering oxygen uptake, heart rate, RPE and blood lactate concentration...|$|R
40|$|Microgravity and bedrest (BR) {{result in}} similar {{physiological}} decrements such as loss of muscle mass, muscle strength and balance. Previous studies analyzing exercise within lower body negative pressure (LBNP) {{have found that}} gait is similar in LBNP on <b>a</b> vertical <b>treadmill</b> and overground exercise on <b>a</b> horizontal <b>treadmill.</b> Since treadmill exercise is known to increase muscular strength and endurance, we tested the hypothesis that LBNP exercise on <b>a</b> vertical <b>treadmill</b> would prevent or attenuate many of the physical decrements which occur during bedrest. Based on our positive results from diverse tests of post-BR function, we believe that exercise within LBNP is worth pursuing as a countermeasure for reducing the physical deterioration that occurs during bedrest and microgravity...|$|R
40|$|Locomotion on <b>an</b> aquatic <b>treadmill</b> or anti-gravity <b>treadmill</b> may be <b>a</b> {{safe and}} {{effective}} alternative to exercise on <b>a</b> traditional land <b>treadmill</b> in those with Parkinson’s disease as the removal of body weight in these environments may allow the participant to exercise with less concern of falling at higher speeds before reaching volitional fatigue. PURPOSE: To determine the training effects of three different treadmill modalities on dynamic balance, gait, and fine motor control in older adults diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. METHODS: Ten adults diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (70 ± 5 years of age) completed 8 exercise sessions (4 weeks, 2 x/week) each separately on <b>a</b> land <b>treadmill,</b> aquatic treadmill, and anti-gravity treadmill at 50...|$|R

25|$|Task-specific gait {{training}} {{may also}} lead to long-term gait improvement for patients with Parkinson's disease. Previous research studies have utilized body weight support systems during gait training, where individuals are suspended from an overhead harness with straps around the pelvic girdle as they walk on <b>a</b> <b>treadmill.</b> This form of gait training {{has been shown to}} improve long-term walking speed and a shuffling gait following a one-month intervention period.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of walking, including bushwalking, racewalking, beach walking, hillwalking, volksmarching, Nordic walking, trekking and hiking. Some people prefer to walk indoors on <b>a</b> <b>treadmill,</b> or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a pedometer to count their steps. Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the United States and South Africa for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or just walking in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic. Australians also bushwalk. In English-speaking parts of North America the term walking is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities. Snow shoeing is walking in snow; a slightly different gait is required compared with regular walking.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the efficacy of different remobilization protocols in different skeletal muscles considering the changes induced by hindlimb suspension of the tail. Thirty-six female Wistar rats were divided into six groups: control I, control II, suspended, suspended free, suspended trained on <b>a</b> declined <b>treadmill</b> and suspended trained on <b>a</b> flat <b>treadmill.</b> Fragments of soleus and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle were frozen and processed by different histochemical methods. The suspended soleus showed a significant increase in the proportional number of intermediate/hybrid fibers and a decrease in the number of type I fibers. Some of these changes proved to be reversible after remobilization. The three remobilization programs led to the recovery of both the proportional number of fibers and their size. The TA muscle presented a significant increase in the number and size of type I fibers and a cell size reduction of type IIB fibers, which were recovered after training on <b>a</b> declined <b>treadmill</b> and free movement. Especially regarding the soleus, the present findings indicate that, among the protocols, training on <b>a</b> declined <b>treadmill</b> was found to induce changes of a more regenerative nature, seemingly indicating a better tissue restructuring after the suspension procedure...|$|R

25|$|A typical gait {{analysis}} laboratory {{has several}} cameras (video and / or infrared) placed around a walkway or <b>a</b> <b>treadmill,</b> which {{are linked to}} a computer. The patient has markers located at various points of reference of the body (e.g., iliac spines of the pelvis, ankle malleolus, and the condyles of the knee), or groups of markers applied to half of the body segments. The patient walks down the catwalk or the treadmill and the computer calculates the trajectory of each marker in three dimensions. A model is applied to calculate {{the movement of the}} underlying bones. This gives a complete breakdown of the movement of each joint. One common method is to use Helen Hayes Hospital marker set, in which a total of 15 markers are attached on the lower body. The 15 marker motions are analyzed analytically, and it provides angular motion of each joint.|$|E
25|$|Treadmill {{training}} (more {{commonly known}} as body weight supported treadmill training) can be applied via manual (therapist) or robotic assistance. In manual treadmill training the therapists provide assistance to facilitate an upright posture and a normal stepping pattern. Therapist assistance may be provided at the patient’s pelvis, leg and foot, and a third therapist controlling the treadmill settings. In robotic-assisted treadmill training, a device replaces the need for therapists to assist the patient in generating a normal stepping pattern. Currently, there are three different models available: Hocoma's Lokomat, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer II. The Lokomat is a driven gait orthosis that consists of a computer -controlled exoskeleton that secured to the patient’s legs while being supported over <b>a</b> <b>treadmill.</b> In addition to a belt driven treadmill and an overhead lift, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator also includes a pair of articulated arms (that drives the hip and knee joints) and two upright structures that house the computer controls and body-weight unloading mechanism. Unlike the first two, the Mechanized Gait Trainer II does not work {{in conjunction with a}} treadmill; instead it is based on a crank and rocker gear system which provides limb motion similar to an elliptical trainer. Robotic-assisted treadmill training was developed with three goals in mind: 1. to decrease therapist physical demand and time, 2. to improve repeatability of step kinematics, and 3. to increase volume of locomotor training.|$|E

40|$|Individuals {{with certain}} types of central nervous system damage, such as stroke, have an {{asymmetric}} walking gait. Using <b>a</b> split-belt <b>treadmill,</b> where each leg walks at a different speed, {{has been shown to}} help rehabilitate walking impaired individuals, but there is one distinct drawback; the corrected gait does not transfer well to walking over ground. To increase the gait transference to another environment, we designed and built a passive shoe that admits a motion similar to that felt when walking on <b>a</b> split-belt <b>treadmill.</b> Our gait enhancing mobile shoe (GEMS) alters the wearer’s gait by causing one foot to move backward during the stance phase while walking over ground. No external power is required since the shoe mechanically converts the wearers downward and horizontal forces into a backward motion. This shoe would allow a patient to walk over ground while experiencing the same gait altering effects as felt on <b>a</b> split-belt <b>treadmill,</b> which should aid in transferring the corrected gait to walking in natural environments...|$|R
