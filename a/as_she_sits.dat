5|$|Azar and {{a healer}} provide {{alternative}} treatment for Waterston, who fully recovers. He announces {{that he still}} wants a relationship with Scully, but she realizes {{she is no longer}} the same person she was those many years ago and rejects him. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> outside the hospital on a bench, Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again, but {{it turns out to be}} Mulder. Later, the two agents sit in Mulder's apartment talking about the events of the last few days. Mulder begins to speak more existentially about what transpired, implying that fate has brought them together but, when he turns to look at Scully, he sees that she has fallen asleep.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and features a tearful and distraught Stefani, lying in bed as she begins to sing to the camera. In a white inside-out L.A.M.B. T-shirt, she wanders around her apartment lost and questioning her lover, who is in fact absent from the video. The lyrics describe an argument, which she has with an off-screen lover throughout the video. After lying around her apartment and crying during a bath, she leaves her house at night and travels in a car, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> tearfully in the back. The video ends with Stefani rolling on the bed.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E

500|$|Like the song's dancehall style, {{the lyrics}} depict the band's post-show parties from touring {{in support of}} Return of Saturn. The song details female groupies who {{attended}} the parties {{to hook up with}} the male band members. Stefani commented that [...] "if you're talented and you're up there, girls want to make out with you." [...] Bassist Tony Kanal described it as [...] "a very PG version" [...] of the licentiousness that took place while touring. The song also touches on Rock Steadys overall theme of Stefani's impatience in her long-distance relationship with then-boyfriend Gavin Rossdale (whom she eventually married in 2002), <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> [...] "sipping on chamomile/watching boys and girls and their sex appeal".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] was {{directed}} by Robert Hales, who previously directed the video for [...] "Can't Be Tamed", and filmed on November 6 and 7, 2010 at the Meadow Brook Hall in Rochester Hills, Michigan. The video commences with Cyrus asleep, blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom. She awakens and writhes on the mattress. Following, Cyrus proceeds to a bathroom, her attire is composed of a white tank top, white boy shorts, a fishnet hair wrap, rollers, and heavy metal jewelry. While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> {{on the edge of}} a bathtub and prepares herself for an upcoming party. With the arrival of the song's refrains, Cyrus appears writhing in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hots pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and big hair. Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing atop a big, wooden table. In the continuation of the video, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video concludes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] {{was the second}} video Carey's directed. In it, she is the {{seemingly}} happy narrator of a tale of young love, {{as a young boy}} and a girl elope {{in the middle of the}} night. The video was filmed on location at Carey's sponsored charity, the Fresh Air Fund upstate New York camp. The video begins with scenes of Carey on a lakeside tire-swing, smiling and beginning to retell a story of young love. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> upon the swing, scenes of two children sneaking out of their bungalow in the middle of the night are shown. They frolic together beside a fireplace, soon coming up to the lakeside swing Carey had been on before. They soon go swimming wearing their clothes, much like Carey did in her video for [...] "Dreamlover" [...] though she does not jump into the water herself this time. As they jump into the water, Carey is then seen by the campfire they passed on their journey to the lake, smiling with friends and enjoying herself by the fire. Eventually the boy and girl are seen kissing underwater. The video concludes with scenes of the young boy and girl walking together back to their bungalow, walking hand-in-hand. Having possibly witnessed the entire event, Carey is seen once again by the large swing, chuckling and staring into the night's sky.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sophisticated as I may appear"--it was her {{frequent}} phrase--she {{had found}} sympathy her best resource. It gave her plenty to do; it made her, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> also said, <b>sit</b> up. <b>She</b> {{had in her}} life two great holes to fill, and <b>she</b> described herself <b>as</b> dropping social scraps into them <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had known old ladies, in her early American time, drop morsels of silk into the baskets in which they collected the material for some eventual patchwork quilt.|$|R

500|$|Opening {{with the}} {{disclaimer}} [...] "No mythological creatures were harmed {{in the making}} of this video", Kesha appears sitting next to two unicorns pouring champagne while having a conversation on how she was elected to the parliament of Uzbekistan, [...] "So I grabbed the bear by the throat and I looked him right in the eyes, and I said, 'Bear, you have till the count of zero to put some pants on and apologize to the president.'" [...] The music begins and Kesha makes eyes at James Van Der Beek. After the eye contact Kesha grabs one of the unicorns and kisses him then removes her bra and throws it across the room, Van Der Beek then does the same with his bra, puzzling Kesha as to why he was wearing a bra. The music fades in the background as the two then {{make their way to the}} center of the dance floor and exchange words ("Well, well, well. If it isn’t James Van Der Douche.", [...] "I don't appreciate you slander-Beeking my name, Ke dollar sign ha.") before engaging in a gun fight. They begin shooting lasers at one another, killing multiple unicorns. Van Der Beek gets hit in the shoulder and falls. Kesha steps on his arm to stop him from reaching for his gun, as he begs for mercy, which Kesha denies. At the end of the video, it is revealed that Kesha killed Van Der Beek and that she has mounted his head on her wall with the plaque reading, [...] "James Van Der Dead", <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> with two unicorns laughing. She then frowns at the camera and it switches to Van Der Beek one more time before the screen goes black.|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts the}} Greek and Roman goddess Diana ("Artemis" [...] in Ancient Greece) with four of her companions. She wears a loose fitting, yellow dress with an animal-skin sash and, on her head, a diadem with {{a symbol of}} the crescent moon. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> on a rock, a nymph washes her left foot. Another, behind Diana, sits with her partially bare back to the viewer (the most skin Vermeer shows on a figure in any of his extant paintings), a third nymph, sitting at Diana's left, holds her own left foot with her right hand. A fourth stands in the rear, somewhat apart {{from the rest of the}} group and facing them and the viewer at an angle, her eyes cast down, her fists in front of her. A dog sits in the lower left-hand corner near Diana, its back to the viewer as it faces the goddess, her attendants and, immediately in front of it, a thistle.|$|E
2500|$|Stonehouse {{wrote that}} wreck of [...] " [...] the Mather {{is one of}} the best known {{examples}} a wooden freighter still available for examination." [...] The Mather is a popular wreck site for scuba diving <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> upright with an intact deck and mostly intact stern superstructure. Overall, she is in very good condition, likely because she sank slowly enough for pressures to equalize. [...] The wreck of the Mather lies at [...] [...] Her mast can be reached at 75 feet, her deck at 155 feet, and the bottom at 180 feet. [...] Although the Mather is not the deepest dive in the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve, she claimed the life of three scuba divers, one in 1998 and one in 1999, and the third in 2012. Great Lakes diver Harrington cautions that [...] "divers must be certain of their abilities and equipment" [...] when diving the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the music}} video, Melua is first seen walking forward slowly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sings. <b>She</b> <b>sits</b> {{on a wooden}} {{chair in front of}} a stage. Melua dances onto the stage playing a character, and she bows. Her hair is straggled and {{sticking}} out at odd angles as is her make-up, complete with a teardrop, and her clothes are like a shabby red dance costume. The Sun newspaper compared Melua's appearance to that of The Cure's Robert Smith.http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,4-2006390273,00.html As she sings to the Melua in front of her, a ghostly dancer appears and starts to dance around behind her. The ghost is a tall, slender young woman, played by Elena Glurdjidze, who is wearing a leotard, and who dances in a sprightly fashion around the stage.|$|R

2500|$|The viewer {{thinks this}} is the end of the movie and that it has a happy ending. [...] But we then learn, in a final twist, the truth. [...] Amaya did not really kidnap Toby. [...] When Amaya {{explained}} to Toby who her father really was, Amaya was able to enlist Toby (using the magic of Santa Muerte) to help exact an even worse revenge on Jack/Roberto. [...] Amaya tells Toby that her father will kill her mother (which in fact happened earlier when Jack was duped by the assassin he tortured into killing Katie to find Toby). [...] Amaya told Toby that Santa Muerte magic would give her the strength to carry out a terrible revenge on her father for that murder. [...] So Amaya purposefully let Jack and Toby escape. [...] Her plan was for them to live happily for many years and then for Toby to kill her father. [...] In the final scene, we see Jack and Toby fleeing deeper into Mexico on an old bus. [...] <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>sits</b> and watches the countryside go by, we hear Toby reciting the same Santa Muerta chant for power that others (including Jack) said throughout the movie.|$|E

50|$|Spreading {{over about}} 2 acres of land, this shrine is Sakta and the {{presiding}} deity {{of the temple}} is Goddess Varahi, locally called <b>as</b> Matsya Varahi. <b>She</b> <b>sits</b> in lalitasana on a cushion placed on a plain platform with her right foot resting on the buffalo mount carved on the pedestal. <b>She</b> is presented <b>as</b> the pot-bellied goddess {{with the face of}} a boar. She has two arms and holds a fish in her right hand and a bowl in her left hand. A third eye is tightly engraved into her forehead. Here Barahi is worshipped in accordance with the tantric rituals. Goddess Varahi is offered fish every day.|$|R
50|$|After a happy {{two years}} Pwyll comes under {{pressure}} from his nobles, to provide an heir. He refuses to set Rhiannon aside as barren, and {{in the third year}} their son is born. However, on the night of his birth, the newborn disappears while in the care of Rhiannon's six sleepy maids. Terrified of being put to death, the women kill a puppy and smear its blood on Rhiannon's sleeping face. In the morning they accuse her of infanticide and cannibalism. Rhiannon takes counsel with her own advisers, and offers to undergo a penance. Pwyll is again urged to set her aside, but refuses, and sets her penance instead. <b>She</b> must <b>sit</b> every day by the gate of the castle at the horse block, to tell her story to travelers. She must also offer to carry them on her back as a beast of burden, though few accept this. However, {{as the end of the}} story shows, Pwyll maintains her state as his queen, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> still <b>sits</b> at his side in the hall at feasting time.|$|R
5000|$|The lady {{in green}} says {{that someone has}} taken all of her [...] "stuff". She feels {{that she is the}} only one that knows and can {{appreciate}} the value of her stuff.

[...] The person who stole her stuff is a man. She made too much room for this man who has run off with her stuff, especially because he doesn't even know that he has it. By the end of the monologue she demands her stuff back from this man.|$|R

He thought that he could look forward with some satisfaction towards the close of his own career, in having been the hero of such a love-story. At any rate, if such a story were to be his story, the melancholy attached to it should arise from no fault of his own. He would still press her to be his wife. And then as he remembered {{that he was only}} twenty-seven and that she was twenty-four, he began to marvel at the feeling of grey old age which had come upon him, and tried to make himself believe that he would have her yet before the bloom was off her cheek.|$|R
60|$|There lay {{the only}} alternative: in work. She might slave her days away {{teaching}} the piano, as Miss Frost had done: she {{might find a}} subordinate post <b>as</b> nurse: <b>she</b> might <b>sit</b> in the cash-desk of some shop. Some work of some sort would be found for her. And she would sink into the routine of her job, as did so many women, and grow old and die, chattering and fluttering. She would have what is called her independence. But, seriously faced with that treasure, and without the option of refusing it, strange how hideous she found it.|$|R

Frequently enough homes are not what fond fancy paints them, while in the bosom of strangers there is much kindliness.|$|R
