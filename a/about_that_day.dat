25|$|Cash {{was very}} close to his older brother, Jack. In May 1944, Jack was pulled into a {{whirling}} head saw in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two. He suffered {{for more than a week}} before dying on May 20, 1944, at the age of 15. Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident. According to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but Johnny and his mother, and Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother. Jack insisted on working since the family needed the money. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in Heaven.|$|E

6000|$|All the way {{to school}} the next morning Peter Rabbit did his best to guess who it might be that they were to learn <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> [...] "Old Mother Nature said that he is related to some one who lives in Farmer Brown's barnyard," [...] said Peter to himself. [...] "Now who can it be?" [...] But try as he would, Peter couldn't think of any one. He asked Jumper the Hare if he had guessed who it could be. Jumper shook his head.|$|E
60|$|All the way {{to school}} the next morning Peter Rabbit {{wondered}} who they would learn <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> He was so busy wondering that he was heedless. Peter is apt to be heedless at times. The result was that as he hopped out of a bramble-tangle just within the edge of the Green Forest, he all but landed in something worse than the worst brambles that ever grew. It was only by a wild side jump that he saved himself. Peter had almost landed among the thousand little spears of Prickly Porky the Porcupine.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Cluppins having once {{broken the}} ice, {{thought it a}} {{favourable}} opportunity for entering into a short dissertation on her own domestic affairs; so she straightway proceeded to inform the court {{that she was the}} mother of eight children at that present speaking, and that she entertained confident expectations of presenting Mr. Cluppins with a ninth, somewhere <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> six months. At this interesting point, the little judge interposed most irascibly; and the effect of the interposition was, that both the worthy lady and Mrs. Sanders were politely taken out of court, under the escort of Mr. Jackson, without further parley.|$|E

And Mr. Griff came all glittering, like Richard Coeur de Lion, and saved us all that night. [...] But Ellen cried to think what she had done, and mamma said it showed what it was to speak to a strange young man; and she has never let Ellen and me go out of the grounds by {{ourselves}} since that day.' ...|$|E
60|$|The Hours of the Ave Bell, {{are eight}} and twelve in the Morning, and {{six in the}} Evening. They pretend at the first to fall down in beg that God would be pleas'd to prosper them in all things they go <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>Day.</b> At twelve they return Thanks for their Preservation to that time; and at six for that of the whole Day. After which, {{one would think that}} they imagine {{themselves}} at perfect Liberty; and their open Gallantries perfectly countenance the Imagination: for tho' Adultery is look'd upon as a grievous Crime, and punish'd accordingly; yet Fornication is softened with the title of a Venial Sin, and they seem to practise it under that Persuasion.|$|E

"When {{the coachman}} who had driven the down coach that day {{came up to}} town, we saw him, and he remembered {{perfectly}} that on or <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> he had picked up a passenger at Kingston--a gentleman who was in very weak health. There were only three inside passengers besides himself, {{and he had to}} be assisted into the coach. The way bill, on being turned up, showed that an inside passenger had been taken up at Kingston. I have already sent down men to make inquiries at every village in the district between Reigate and Kingston, and I trust that we shall lay hands on him, especially now we have got an accurate description of him, while before we were working in the dark in that respect." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was {{excuse for}} it, for just then, the {{arguments}} about {{the conditions of the}} race had waxed loud, degenerating into mere clamour. It almost looked as if the more excited ones were about to settle their differences with their flourishing fists. But Mary was scarcely conscious of what was passing before her; she was mentally occupied recalling certain things which she had heard two or three days ago; also things she had seen without attention. Fan, Tom, and Arthur had told her <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> spent in Exeter. At their destination their party had been increased to four by Arthur's clerical friend, Frank Arnold. This young gentleman had acted as guide to the cathedral, and had also entertained them at luncheon, which proved a very magnificent repast to be given by a young curate in apartments. It was all a dull wretched affair, according to Tom; the young fellow had never left off making himself agreeable to Fan until she had got into her carriage to return to Sidmouth. And yet Fan had scarcely mentioned Mr. Arnold, only saying that she had passed a happy day. How happy it must have been, thought Mary, a new light dawning on her mind, for the sparkle of it to have lasted so long! ...|$|E
5000|$|Every {{night at}} 6:15 and 6:40 pm, {{they did a}} regular segment called [...] "Driving It Home with John and Ken".

I stole out of the darkness. I flung my arms around him. He struggled. Ah, how he struggled; but it was all no use. Ha! ha! ha! I was too strong for him. I held him tighter and tighter, till I nearly strangled him, and he gasped and gurgled and moaned. Oh! it was fine to see him. Then I found a cord in the drawer there and I bound him, and while I fastened the knots I laughed and I talked to him. I talked about that night in the storm when he threw his father"--he pointed a long, quivering finger at me--"threw him into the slate quarry, and <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> {{when he came to the}} Castle gate and brought me to the plantation, and suddenly caught me by the throat till he thought he had strangled me, and beat me on the head.

60|$|It {{was a day}} {{early in}} that year--I think in January, because there was thin, crisp snow on the grass, and we noted that only two other people {{had been to the}} Pagoda that day. I've a curious {{impression}} of greenish colour, hot, moist air and huge palm fronds about very much of our talk, as though we were nearly {{all the time in the}} Tropical House. But I also remember very vividly looking at certain orange and red spray-like flowers from Patagonia, which could not have been there. It is a curious thing that I do not remember we made any profession of passionate love for one another; we talked as though the fact of our intense love for each other had always been patent between us. There was so long and frank an intimacy between us that we talked far more like brother and sister or husband and wife than two people engaged in the war of the sexes. We wanted to know what we were going to do, and whatever we did we meant to do in the most perfect concert. We both felt an extraordinary accession of friendship and tenderness then, and, what again is curious, very little passion. But there was also, in spite of the perplexities we faced, an immense satisfaction <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> It was as if we had taken off something that had hindered our view of each other, like people who unvizored to talk more easily at a masked ball.|$|E
50|$|After {{getting them}} out of the car, she would tell them that they would be having a Holiday at Home. She would present them with a clue about what they would be doing the next day. Each night every person did a video diary <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

30|$|Study 2 had a {{randomized}} controlled design with four parallel groups. Group 1 completed the same gratefulness activity {{as described in}} the first study (writing about three things for which they were grateful), group 2 consumed an ice cream, group 3 completed the gratefulness activity while consuming an ice cream, and group 4 completed a neutral writing task. The neutral writing task involved writing <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>day’s</b> weather, serving as a naturalistic control activity, given that the weather is a frequent topic of conversation in this culture. There were two study days in study 2 (Tuesday & Wednesday) during which the participants received one of the activities above depending on the group to which they were randomly allocated.|$|R
