40|$|This paper {{presents}} a SIMULINK block {{set for the}} behavioral modeling and high-level simulation of RF receiver frontends. The toolbox includes a library with the main RF circuit models that are needed to implement wireless receivers, namely: low noise amplifiers, mixers, oscillators, filters and programmable gain amplifiers. There is also a library including other blocks like the <b>antenna,</b> <b>duplexer</b> filter and switches, required to implement reconfigurable architectures. Behavioral models of building blocks include the main ideal functionality {{as well as the}} following non-idealities: thermal noise, characterized by the noise figure and the signal-to-noise ratio, and non-linearity, represented by the input-referred second-order and third-order intercept points, IIP_ 2 and IIP_ 3, respectively. In addition to these general parameters, some block-specific errors have also been included, like oscillator phase noise and mixer offset. These models have been incorporated into the SIMULINK environment making an extensive use of C-coded S-functions and reducing the number of library block elements. This approach reduces the simulation time while keeping high accuracy, which makes the proposed toolbox very appropriate to be combined with an optimizer for the automated high-level synthesis of radio receivers. As an application of the capabilities of the presented toolbox, a multi-standard direct-conversion receiver intended for 4 G telecom systems is modeled and simulated considering the building block requirements for the different standards.

50|$|Standard {{repeaters}} require {{either the}} use of two antennas (one each for transmitter and receiver) or a duplexer to isolate the transmit and receive signals over a single <b>antenna.</b> The <b>duplexer</b> is a device which prevents the repeater's high-power transmitter (on the output frequency) from drowning out the users' signal on the repeater receiver (on the input frequency). A diplexer allows two transmitters on different frequencies to use one antenna, and is common in installations where one repeater on 2 m and a second on 440 MHz share one feedline up the tower and one antenna.|$|R

The presented prototype integrates the LNA, down-converters, VCO, quadrature generator, up-converter and pre-amplifier on a single die. A high level of integration is achieved by using a low-IF topology for reception, a direct quadrature up-conversion topology for transmission and an oscillator with on-chip integrated inductor.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} three RF self-interference reduction {{techniques for}} full-duplex wireless links, which specifically target integration in compact radios. Concretely, a self-interference cancelling front-end, a dual-polarized antenna, and an electrical balance duplexer are proposed.

40|$|Frequency {{division}} duplex (FDD) cellular standards, like WCDMA and LTE, {{require the}} simultaneous {{operation of the}} transmitter and receiver while sharing the same <b>antenna.</b> A <b>duplexer,</b> currently implemented as two highly selective off-chip SAW filters separates the transmit and receive signals. A high isolation is required to avoid saturating the receiver and keep its noise and linearity requirements feasible. The need for high-Q resonators to implement these filters prohibits duplexer integration in a CMOS process. For each band of a modern multi-band transceiver, an off-chip duplexer is required. With over forty bands currently envisioned for mobile applications, the system cost and complexity rises significantly. Replacing the bank of off-chip duplexers with a single integrated tunable duplexer would enable a fully integrated and reconfigurable multiband transceiver. In this dissertation, the performance of hybrid transformer based integrated duplexer was significantly improved, making it suitable for reliable multiband operation. A hybrid transformer relies on electrical balance rather than frequency selectivity to achieve isolation, making duplexer integration in a CMOS process that lacks high-Q passives possible. Prior demonstrations of integrated hybrid transformer duplexers suffered from high insertion loss, poor common-mode isolation and isolation sensitivity to antenna mismatch. Novel solutions were reached in this research to solve most of these issues. Power recovery by using an RF-DC converter can effectively reduce the loss in the duplexer. A discrete prototype that achieves 60 % power recycling efficiency with constant input impedance over wide dynamic range was demonstrated. A differential implementation of the hybrid transformer allows for both high differential and common-mode isolation. Implemented in a 90 nm CMOS process, it maintains more than 60 dB of differential to common-mode isolation. And finally, an antenna impedance tracking loop was demonstrated to track any antenna impedance variation and maintain high isolation. Together with a novel high power balance network, that allows high isolation in both the transmit and receive bands, this 65 nm CMOS chip achieves an isolation of more than 50 dB in the transmit and receive bands, with an antenna VSWR within 2 : 1. This work is the first implementation of a CMOS integrated, high-power and antenna mismatch tolerant duplexe...|$|R
40|$|Integrating RF bio-chemical {{sensors and}} RF duplexers helps to reduce cost and {{area in the}} current {{applications}}. Furthermore, new applications can exist based on the large scale integration of these crucial blocks. This dissertation addresses the integration of RF bio-chemical sensors and RF duplexers by proposing these initiatives. A low power integrated LC-oscillator-based broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) system is presented. The real relative permittivity ??r is measured as {{a shift in the}} oscillator frequency using an on-chip frequency-to-digital converter (FDC). The imaginary relative permittivity ??r increases the losses of the oscillator tank which mandates a higher dc biasing current to preserve the same oscillation amplitude. An amplitude-locked loop (ALL) is used to fix the amplitude and linearize the relation between the oscillator bias current and ??r. The proposed BDS system employs a sensing oscillator and a reference oscillator where correlated double sampling (CDS) is used to mitigate the impact of flicker noise, temperature variations and frequency drifts. A prototype is implemented in 0. 18 ?m CMOS process with total chip area of 6. 24 mm^ 2 to operate in 1 - 6 GHz range using three dual bands LC oscillators. The achieved standard deviation in the air is 2. 1 ppm for frequency reading and 110 ppm for current reading. A tunable integrated electrical balanced duplexer (EBD) is presented as a compact alternative to multiple bulky SAW and BAW duplexers in 3 G/ 4 G cellular transceivers. A balancing network creates a replica of the transmitter signal for cancellation at the input of a single-ended low noise amplifier (LNA) to isolate the receive path from the transmitter. The proposed passive EBD is based on a cross-connected transformer topology without the need of any extra balun at the <b>antenna</b> side. The <b>duplexer</b> achieves around 50 dB TX-RX isolation within 1. 6 - 2. 2 GHz range up to 22 dBm. The cascaded noise figure of the duplexer and LNA is 6. 5 dB, and TX insertion loss (TXIL) of the duplexer is about 3. 2 dB. The duplexer and LNA are implemented in 0. 18 ?m CMOS process and occupy an active area of 0. 35 mm^ 2...|$|R
40|$|The term {{submillimeter}} confocal imaging active module (SCIAM) denotes {{a proposed}} airborne coherent imaging radar {{system that would}} be suitable for use in reconnaissance, surveillance, and navigation. The development of the SCIAM would include utilization and extension of recent achievements in monolithic microwave integrated circuits capable of operating at frequencies up to and beyond a nominal radio frequency of 340 GHz. Because the SCIAM would be primarily down-looking (in contradistinction to primarily side-looking), {{it could be useful}} for imaging shorter objects located between taller ones (for example, objects on streets between buildings). The SCIAM would utilize a confocal geometry to obtain high cross-track resolution, and would be amenable to synthetic-aperture processing of its output to obtain high along-track resolution. The SCIAM (see figure) would include multiple (two in the initial version) antenna apertures, separated from each other by a cross-track baseline of suitable length (e. g., 1. 6 m). These apertures would both transmit the illuminating radar pulses and receive the returns. A common reference oscillator would generate a signal at a controllable frequency of (340 GHz + (Delta) f) /N, where (Delta) f is an instantaneous swept frequency difference and N is an integer. The output of this oscillator would be fed to a frequency- multiplier-and-power-amplifier module to obtain a signal, at 340 GHz + (Delta) f, that would serve as both the carrier signal for generating the transmitted pulses and a local-oscillator (LO) signal for a receiver associated with each <b>antenna</b> aperture. Because <b>duplexers</b> in the form of circulators or transmit/receive (T/R) switches would be lossy and extremely difficult to implement, the antenna apertures would be designed according to a spatial-diplexing scheme, in which signals would be coupled in and out via separate, adjacent transmitting and receiving feed horns. This scheme would cause the transmitted and received beams to be aimed in slightly different directions, and, hence, to not overlap fully on the targets on the ground. However, a preliminary analysis has shown that the loss of overlap would be small enough that the resulting loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) would be much less than the SNR loss {{associated with the use of}} a 340 -GHz T/R switch...|$|R
