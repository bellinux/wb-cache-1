25|$|A {{very strong}} {{way to express}} <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> {{frustration}} {{is to use the}} words tabarnak, sacrament, and câlice. Depending on the context and the tone of the phrases, it might make everybody quiet, but some people use those words to add rhythm or emphasis to sentences.|$|E

25|$|Quebec French swear {{words can}} be {{combined}} into more powerful combinations to express extreme <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> disgust. These intricate uses of French profanities {{can be difficult to}} master. The combinations are endless; some people in the French-Canadian community consider mixing and matching swear words to be a sort of skilled art.|$|E
25|$|Bill collectors' {{emotional}} labor consists of not letting angry and hostile debtors make them angry {{and to not}} feel guilty about pressuring friendly debtors for money.

25|$|A fast bowler {{can also}} employ intimidatory tactics to <b>anger</b> (<b>or</b> frustrate) a batsman into playing a rash shot, by {{directing}} {{the ball to}} strike the batsman. Intimidatory bowling plays a part in every fast bowler's attack to some degree, and even the best batsmen sometimes sustain serious injuries that can force them off the field {{and out of the}} game. In almost all instances verbal 'sledging' accompanies the attack.|$|E
25|$|The film is {{also thought}} notable for {{being one of}} the first adult films to be {{produced}} or directed by Bernard Natan. Scholars have expressed surprise that a beginning filmmaker would produce a work which contained sex acts which might <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> offend the target audience (straight men). That Bernard would do so is a testament, film historians have said, to his willingness to take risks and his subtle understanding of the role homoeroticism and homosexuality play in French male sexual identity.|$|E
25|$|Horncastle {{left the}} Downs on 5 April 1793, bound for St Helena and China. The French Revolutionary Wars had begun {{two months earlier}} so Horncastle {{received}} a letter of marque dated 28 February 1793. This would permit him to engage in offensive action against the French should the opportunity present itself. Princess Royal reached St Helena on 11 July. Unfortunately, on 29 September three French warships captured her off <b>Anger</b> (<b>or</b> Anjere) Point {{while she was still}} on her way to China.|$|E
50|$|However, {{he showed}} no {{physical}} deformity, as Suetonius notes that when calm and seated {{he was a}} tall, well-built figure of dignitas.

Claudius himself claimed that he had exaggerated his ailments to save his life.|$|R

25|$|As Mormon thinkers recognized, {{application}} of the blood atonement doctrine to the sin of murder seemingly created some difficulties. The Book of Mormon states that murderers can receive forgiveness by repentance. Nevertheless, a passage in the Doctrine and Covenants says that murder is unpardonable. Attempting to resolve this seeming conflict in a Deseret News article on July 4, 1883, Apostle Charles W. Penrose taught {{that in some cases}} such as murder done in <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> provocation, murder might be forgiven, but only after the guilty party atones for the murder by the shedding of blood.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th century, opium {{was found}} to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its {{sedative}} and tranquilizing properties, it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis, help with people who were considered insane, and also to help treat patients with insomnia. However, despite its medicinal values in these cases, it was noted that in cases of psychosis, it could cause <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> depression, and due to the drug's euphoric effects, it could cause depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects wore off because they would get used to being high.|$|E

25|$|Anxious-resistant {{insecure}} attachment is {{also called}} ambivalent attachment. In general, {{a child with}} an anxious-resistant attachment style will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the caregiver is present. When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when they return. The Anxious-Ambivalent/Resistant strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and that the displays of <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> helplessness towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
25|$|A Howler is a blood-red {{letter sent}} to signify extreme <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> {{to convey a}} message very loudly and publicly. When it is opened, the sender's voice, which has been magically {{magnified}} to a deafening volume, bellows a message at the recipient and then self-destructs. If it is not opened or there is a delay in opening it, the letter smolders, explodes violently, and shouts the message out even louder than normal. In the film version, the Howler folds itself into an origami-style set of lips and eyes, and shouts the message out and then shreds itself into scraps of paper before it burns itself.|$|E
25|$|Since {{newspapers}} {{began as}} a journal (record of current events), the profession involved {{in the making of}} newspapers began to be called journalism. In the yellow journalism era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around World War II. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived bias; and scandals involving plagiarism and fabrication.|$|E

"It's {{only one}} word, Kilcullen," [...] said the father, who {{was afraid of}} <b>angering</b> <b>or</b> irritating his son, now {{that he thought he}} was in so fair a way to obtain the heiress and her fortune. [...] "I'll not detain you half a minute;" [...] and then he said in a whisper, [...] "take my advice, Kilcullen, and strike when the iron's hot." ...|$|R

His mate, Zhaneel, {{is said to be}} the first true-bred [...] "Gryfalcon" [...] type, but she is not the first. While he can usually enunciate perfectly, while <b>angered</b> <b>or</b> injured his speech distinctively rolls the rs and s's so more people are likely to take notice.|$|R
5000|$|The film's {{marketing}} {{was going}} to focus on Kirk Cameron, then {{at the height of his}} popularity. However Jerry Weintraub over-rode them and insisted on ads that emphasised the fact the film dealt with a debate about abortion, hoping to stir up controversy. The movie was a flop at the box office. [...] "Fans were neither <b>angered</b> <b>or</b> disturbed, they simply stayed away," [...] wrote the Wall Street Journal.|$|R
25|$|People with BPD {{can be very}} {{sensitive}} to the way others treat them, by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness. Their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> dislike after a disappointment, a threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem {{in the eyes of}} someone they value. This phenomenon, sometimes called splitting, includes a shift from idealizing others to devaluing them. Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers. Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy.|$|E
25|$|Primal {{therapy is}} a trauma-based {{psychotherapy}} created by Arthur Janov, who argues that neurosis {{is caused by}} the repressed pain of childhood trauma. Janov argues that repressed pain can be sequentially brought to conscious awareness and resolved through re-experiencing specific incidents and fully expressing the resulting pain during therapy. In therapy, the patient recalls and reenacts a particularly disturbing past experience usually occurring early in life and expresses normally repressed <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> frustration especially through spontaneous and unrestrained screams, hysteria, or violence. Primal therapy was developed as a means of eliciting the repressed pain; the term Pain is capitalized in discussions of primal therapy when referring to any repressed emotional distress and its purported long-lasting psychological effects. Janov criticizes the talking therapies as they deal primarily with the cerebral cortex and higher-reasoning areas and do not access the source of Pain within the more basic parts of the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Considered {{the most}} {{powerful}} wizard in the world, Dumbledore is benevolent and wise, a good wizard {{in the style of}} Merlin. He almost constantly gives off an aura of serenity and composure, rarely displaying intense emotions of <b>anger</b> <b>or</b> fear. Yet despite his benign nature, it is said that Dumbledore was the only wizard Lord Voldemort ever truly feared. Dumbledore is very eccentric and even slightly effeminate; he is very fond of knitting patterns and frequently wears flamboyant clothing (at one point, he is seen wearing a flowered bonnet). He is also known for his odd displays of whimsicality; he often uses humour to make people feel comfortable in his presence. As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore displays numerous examples of extraordinary powers. His abilities as a wizard are combined with a kind of cunning and subtlety of mind that allowed him to comprehend human nature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, love, and friendship) to Voldemort's disadvantage in particular.|$|E
5000|$|Eduardo (voiced by Tom Kenny) - A Latin American friend {{created by}} a young girl, Nina Valerosa, to protect her in a {{dangerous}} neighborhood. Eduardo is big, hairy and violet-purple, has horns, a snout, a pointy demon-like tail and large teeth. Despite his large size, overwhelming strength, and menacing appearance, Eduardo is docile, timid and scared of almost anything. However, he can be ferocious if <b>angered</b> <b>or</b> when danger befalls his friends.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{of their}} large, {{powerful}} bodies and impressive horns, takins have few natural enemies other than bears or wolves. They are generally slow moving but can react quickly if <b>angered</b> <b>or</b> frightened. When needed, a takin can leap nimbly from rock to rock. If a takin senses danger, it warns the others {{with a loud}} [...] "cough" [...] that sends the herd running for cover. Takins can also make an intimidating roar or bellow.|$|R
50|$|An {{organization}} faces {{a crisis}} of malevolence when opponents or miscreant individuals use criminal means or other extreme tactics {{for the purpose of}} expressing hostility <b>or</b> <b>anger</b> toward, <b>or</b> seeking gain from, a company, country, or economic system, perhaps with the aim of destabilizing or destroying it. Sample crisis include product tampering, kidnapping, malicious rumors, terrorism, and espionage.|$|R
