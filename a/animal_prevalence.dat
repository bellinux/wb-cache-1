An overall individual <b>animal</b> <b>prevalence</b> of 46. 8 % (548 of 1171 animals) and a herd prevalence of 91. 7 % (11 of 12 farms) were recorded in 12 dairy farms by the CIT test.

There was positive correlation (r = 0. 41) between herd size and prevalence of bovine tuberculosis. Furthermore, {{a negative linear association}} (R 2 = 0. 24) was found between mean score of management of the farm and prevalence, indicating that the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis could be improved by sanitary measures.

The widespread occurrence of BTB in the study farms and isolation of M. bovis from the milk of reactor cows signify its economic importance and potential risk to public health.

Method Coverage of sampled vs expected number of sheep and goats, absolute number of positive <b>animals,</b> <b>prevalence,</b> frequency distribution, and classes of disease prevalence were retrospectively analyzed at the village level for 2004 - 2006. A comparative analysis of the disease prevalence in the investigated villages was also performed. The percentage of slaughtered animals was analyzed for 2000 - 2006.

Traditionally maintained flocks and migratory flocks were considered to be responsible for the transmission of the disease. The absolute number of positive animals and the number of infected vs non-infected holdings did not decrease over the study period. Most of the villages had between 1 and 10 positive animals. Between 2000 and 2006, 55 % of the positive animals were slaughtered, 41 % in 2001 and up to 79 % in 2002.

This distribution does not fit that of animal fascioliasis. Certain aspects (higher prevalence in females in a local survey, although a trend non-significant throughout Argentina) but not others (patient’s age 3 - 95 years, mean 37. 1 years) resemble human endemics in Andean countries, although the lack of intensity studies and surveys in rural areas does not allow for an adequate evaluation. Human infection occurs mainly in January-April, when higher precipitation and temperatures interact with field activities during summer holidays. A second June peak may be related to Easter holidays. The main risk factor appears to be wild watercress ingestion (214) during recreational, weekend outings or holiday activities, explaining numerous family outbreaks involving 63 people and infection far away from their homes.

Considered {{the most}} {{widespread}} and prevalent of zoonoses, the emergent infectious leptospirosis disease is found throughout tropical regions in particular, with annual mean incidence rates in Hawaii consistently {{the highest in the}} United States. As a tropical archipelago with relatively low host and leptospiral diversity, Hawaii represents an exceptional opportunity for investigations in the ecology and evolution of this bacterial pathogen. In an effort {{to gain a better understanding}} of disease transmission dynamics and environmental drivers in Hawaii, the studies presented in this dissertation each take a distinct approach to examining the associations between three main components underlying the ecology of leptospirosis across the archipelago; namely, the Leptospira pathogen, animal hosts, and climate. First, I employed a longitudinal dataset of <b>animal</b> infection <b>prevalence</b> from a period of 14 consecutive years across five maintenance host species and three main islands to describe the epizootiological distribution of pathogenic leptospires in Hawaii. In a second study, I combined field biology and molecular lab techniques to characterize the 16 S rRNA genetic diversity of Leptospira amongst a community of small mammals in a local rainforest. Finally, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit and Wald assessments of multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between rainfall and leptospiral <b>animal</b> infection <b>prevalence</b> at multiple spatio-temporal scales. The key findings in this dissertation address evolutionary patterns of host specificity, provide a preliminary examination of leptospiral genetic diversity in host vectors, and show that precipitation is an environmental driver of host infection prevalence at specific spatial and temporal scales. These results shed light on leptospiral transmission dynamics in a tropical region enzootic for the bacterial pathogen, and lay the foundation for an integrated eco-evolutionary model of leptospirosis in Hawaii...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria with {{antimicrobial}} resistance {{can be transferred}} from animals to humans and may compromise antimicrobial treatment in case of infection. To determine the {{antimicrobial resistance}} situation in bacteria from Swiss veal calves, faecal samples from 500 randomly selected calves originating from 129 farms were collected at four big slaughterhouses. Samples were cultured for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp. and Campylobacter sp. and isolated strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents by the minimal inhibitory concentration technique using the broth microdilution method. From 100 farms, data on farm management, animal husbandry and antimicrobial treatments of the calves were collected by questionnaire. Risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance were identified by logistic regression. In total, 467 E. coli, 413 Enterococcus sp. and 202 Campylobacter sp. were isolated. Of those, 68. 7 %, 98. 7 % and 67. 8 %, respectively, were resistant {{to at least one}} of the tested antimicrobial agents. Resistance was mainly observed to antimicrobials frequently used in farm <b>animals.</b> <b>Prevalence</b> of resistance to antimicrobials important for human treatment was generally low. However, a rather high number of quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter sp. were detected. External calf purchase, large finishing groups, feeding of milk by-products and administration of antimicrobials through feed upon arrival of the animals on the farm significantly increased the risk of antimicrobial resistance at farm level. Participation in a quality assurance programme and injection of a macrolide upon arrival of the animals on the farm had a protective effect. The present study showed that veal calves may serve as a reservoir for resistant bacteria. To ensure food safety, veal calves should be included in the national monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in farm animals. By improving farm management and calf husbandry the prevalence of resistance may be reduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{prevalence}} {{study was to determine}} the prevalence of digital dermatitis, interdigital hyperplasia and interdigital necrobacillosis on farms in the Netherlands. This is relevant due to the effects of lameness, a common symptom of these three diseases, on animal welfare and economic results. The data were collected within a clinical trial, required for the authorisation of a new topical treatment for digital dermatitis, set in October to December of 2013. Trained veterinary students collected data for this paper. The front and hind claws of each cow participating in the trial were inspected whilst the cow was in a trimming chute. Herds preferably contained over 100 cows, had a herd digital dermatitis prevalence level of 20 % or more, were housed in cubicle systems, were of the Holstein Friesian breed and no preventive claw treatment on herd-level was executed in the three weeks prior to the trial. After visiting four farms, the goal of inspecting at least 300 cows was met, with a total of 373 <b>animals.</b> <b>Prevalence</b> was calculated per farm and an overall prevalence was calculated after visiting all four farms for each disease. A 95 % confidence interval was calculated for each disease to establish whether the results differed significantly from values found in literature. Herd prevalence for digital dermatitis varied from 23. 0 % to 59. 3 %. For interdigital necrobacillosis, values varied from 0. 0 % to 1. 6 %. Interdigital hyperplasia varied in herd prevalence from 5. 7 % to 12. 9 %. The overall prevalence of digital dermatitis, interdigital necrobacillosis and interdigital hyperplasia was 40. 8 %, 1. 1 % and 8. 3 %, respectively. The results of interdigital hyperplasia did not differ significantly from those found in literature, the results of digital dermatitis and interdigital necrobacillosis did...|$|R
