50|$|The {{estimated}} future cost {{of removing}} the tanks in 40 years is $15,000 * (1.025 ^ 40) = $40,275.96. The {{present value of}} this cost is $40,275.96 / (1.09 ^ 40) = $1,282.29. At installation of the tanks, the company books an <b>asset</b> <b>retirement</b> cost (asset) and an <b>asset</b> <b>retirement</b> obligation (liability) of $1,282.29. The asset is depreciated, usually straight-line, over 40 years (depreciation expense of $32.06 per year). The liability is accreted (interest for each period is calculated and added to the balance), using the interest method. (Accretion expense would be $115.41 the first year, $125.79 the second year, etc.) Over the 40 year life, the liability thereby increases to $40,275.96. At retirement of the tank, the expenses actually incurred to remove the tank are booked against the ARO, and a gain or loss is recognized for the difference.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the determinants of the <b>retirement</b> <b>assets</b> held in Individual Retirement Accounts, Keogh accounts, and current and future pensions. A second purpose was to investigate the determinants of the amount in stock within those <b>retirement</b> <b>assets.</b> Building upon the theory of human capital, the theory of planned behavior, and the bargaining power model, this study proposed that human capital, attitudes related to finances, and the relative bargaining power of the spouse would influence an individual 2 ̆ 7 s <b>retirement</b> <b>assets</b> and the amount in stocks within the <b>retirement</b> <b>assets.</b> ^ Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, Study 1 explored the relationship between the three proposed domains and the amount in <b>retirement</b> <b>assets</b> and the amount in stock within the <b>retirement</b> <b>assets.</b> In Study 2, the relationship between the proposed domains was examined using similar variables but with a relatively older sample (e. g., the Health and Retirement Study). ^ The results of both studies supported the theory of human capital and the theory of health capital. Those who had higher education and those who had better health {{were more likely to have}} more in <b>retirement</b> <b>assets,</b> and they have more in the amount of stock within <b>retirement</b> <b>assets.</b> Those who saved regularly and were more likely to take risk when saving and investing had more <b>retirement</b> <b>assets</b> and they have more in the amount of stock within <b>retirement</b> <b>assets.</b> The results on the influence of the spouse on <b>retirement</b> <b>assets</b> and the amount in stock within <b>retirement</b> <b>assets</b> showed some support for the bargaining power model. The <b>retirement</b> <b>assets</b> and the amount in stocks within <b>retirement</b> <b>assets</b> were influenced by the spouse. Age, education, working status of the spouse, and who was the more financial knowledgeable person among the two would influence the <b>retirement</b> <b>assets</b> and the amount in stock within <b>retirement</b> <b>assets</b> of the household head. ^ The results of the study supported the existing literature on human capital and health capital. There was some support for the bargaining power model. The results suggest that educators and financial advisors should encourage couples to discuss their plans about saving for retirement with each other and their advisors. However, many people will be single during some or all of their retirement so individual plans for retirement savings should also be carefully developed. This is an important role for educators and financial advisors. However, older adults with fewer resources (e. g. education, employer-sponsored pension plans) will continue to need the support of Social Security. ...|$|R

50|$|In accounting, {{accretion}} expense is {{a periodic}} expense recognized when updating {{the present value}} of a balance sheet liability, which has arisen from a company's obligation to perform a duty in the future, and is being measured by using a discounted cash flows approach. In particular, accretion expense is a phrase used in topic 410-20 of the United States GAAP Codification of Accounting Standards (SFAS 143), which is the topic of reporting <b>asset</b> <b>retirement</b> obligations. This kind of liability typically has a long and predetermined life on a company's balance sheet, and so it is valued using a discounted cash flow measurement. The accretion expense amounts to a change in the liability due to time and the discount rate applied.|$|E

The research will Identify possible losses from liquidation of current and prospective operational clients and propose suitable valuation procedure for equipment to be secured. The researcher conducted a case study survey from the IDC’s operational strategic business units (SBUs) employees. The data for the {{research was}} collected using a questionnaire in a structured survey format and examining current records on trends with regards to the propositions. For each of the SBUs, copies of well-structured questionnaires were given to an account manager. The study also sampled valuation reports prepared by valuers at IDC. The contents of valuation reports were examined and compared with data recovered by IDC after a client default. The researcher noted that recoveries from physical collateral generally lagged behind expected recoveries as reported in valuation reports. There were, however, mixed responses on the certainty and uncertainty of valuation figures reported. The key findings were that there was a need to re-look at the factors considered in the valuation practice. The recognition of appraisal depreciation considers the progressive decline in value as operational use and changes to the technical and economic environment diminish the worth of an asset. The expected <b>asset</b> <b>retirement</b> profile with its influence on life characteristics, in addition to the applied operation and maintenance policies, influences the rate of asset depreciation.
