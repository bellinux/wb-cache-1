5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute <b>antiretroviral</b> drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing <b>antiretroviral</b> drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV/AIDS, provides <b>antiretroviral</b> drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 kwacha per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides <b>antiretroviral</b> therapy through its outpatient department, and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes <b>antiretroviral</b> drugs to patients for free in the Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell <b>antiretroviral</b> drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi. In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling <b>antiretroviral</b> drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to <b>antiretroviral</b> drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people using <b>antiretroviral</b> therapy in Malawi has {{increased}} dramatically in the past decade: between 2004 and 2011, an estimated 300,000 people gained access to <b>antiretroviral</b> treatment. In addition to improving access to <b>antiretroviral</b> therapy, in 2008, Malawi introduced the World Health Organization's treatment guidelines for <b>antiretroviral</b> therapy, which improved the quality of treatment available to Malawians. However, Malawi's proposal for a new <b>antiretroviral</b> treatment plan in 2011, which would have cost $105 million per year, {{was rejected by the}} Global Fund, threatening Malawi's ability to continue expanding access to <b>antiretroviral</b> treatment.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task {{shifting}} strategies {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task shifting, which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of <b>antiretroviral</b> therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate <b>antiretroviral</b> therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate <b>antiretroviral</b> therapy. Another form of task shifting involves training health-oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|E

5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child <b>antiretroviral</b> medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, <b>antiretroviral</b> treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|In the State of the Union {{address in}} January 2003, Bush {{outlined}} a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against <b>antiretroviral</b> therapies.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: CD 4 {{cell count}} and viral loads {{are used in}} {{clinical}} trials as surrogate endpoints for assessing efficacy of newly available <b>antiretrovirals.</b> If <b>antiretrovirals</b> act through other pathways or {{increase the risk of}} disease this would not be identified prior to licensing. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the CD 4 cell count and viral load-specific rates of fatal and nonfatal AIDS and non-AIDS events according to current <b>antiretrovirals.</b> METHODS: Poisson regression was used to compare overall events (fatal or nonfatal AIDS, non-AIDS or death), AIDS events (fatal and nonfatal) or non-AIDS events (fatal or nonfatal) for specific nucleoside pairs and third drugs used with more than 1000 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) after 1 January 2001. RESULTS: Nine thousand, eight hundred and one patients contributed 42372. 5 PYFU, during which 1203 (437 AIDS and 766 non-AIDS) events occurred. After adjustment, there was weak evidence of a difference in the overall events rates between nucleoside pairs (global P-value = 0. 084), and third drugs (global P-value = 0. 031). As compared to zidovudine/lamivudine, patients taking abacavir/lamivudine [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 1. 22; 95 % CI 0. 99 - 1. 49] and abacavir and one other nucleoside [aIRR 1. 51; 95 % CI 1. 14 - 2. 02] had an increased incidence of overall events. Comparing the third drugs, those taking unboosted atazanavir had an increased incidence of overall events compared with those taking efavirenz (aIRR 1. 46; 95 % CI 1. 09 - 1. 95). CONCLUSION: There was little evidence of substantial differences between <b>antiretrovirals</b> in the incidence of clinical disease for a given CD 4 cell count or viral load, suggesting there are unlikely to be major unidentified adverse effects of specific <b>antiretrovirals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Clinically {{significant}} drug-drug interactions (CSDIs) involving <b>antiretrovirals</b> {{are frequent}} and under-recognizedin developed countries, but data are lacking for developing countries. Methodology and Principal Findings: To investigate {{the prevalence of}} CSDIs between <b>antiretrovirals</b> and coadministered drugs, we surveyed prescriptions dispensed in a large HIV clinic in Kenya. Of 1040 consecutive patients screened, 996 were eligible for inclusion. CSDIs were defined as ‘major’ (capable of causing severe or permanent damage, contraindicated, avoid or not recommended by the manufacturer, or requiring dose modification) ‘moderate’ (manufacturers advise caution, or close monitoring, or capable of causing clinical deterioration).

5|$|If a {{woman is}} untreated, two years of {{breastfeeding}} results in an HIV/AIDS risk in her baby of about 17%. Treatment decreases this risk to 1 to 2% per year. Due to the increased risk of death without breastfeeding in many areas in the developing world, the World Health Organization recommends either: (1) the mother and baby being treated with <b>antiretroviral</b> medication while breastfeeding being continued (2) the provision of safe formula.|$|E
5|$|Malawians gained {{access to}} <b>antiretroviral</b> drugs in 2003, and, with a {{donation}} from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and the election of new President Bingu wa Mutharika in 2004, government interventions increased substantially. However, soon after his election, Mutharika experienced tensions with Muluzi after implementing an anti-corruption program, which distracted the government from addressing the nation's food and HIV/AIDS-related crises. Despite these obstacles, Mutharika successfully developed a National AIDS Policy and appointed a Principal Secretary for HIV/AIDS during his presidency.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{adverse events}} {{are related to}} the <b>antiretroviral</b> agent taken. Some {{relatively}} common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects. Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.|$|E

50|$|Long-term nonprogressors {{typically}} have viral loads under 10,000 copies RNA/ml blood, {{do not take}} <b>antiretrovirals,</b> and have CD4+ counts within the normal range. Most people with HIV not on medication have viral loads which are much higher.|$|R
25|$|Nevirapine is an inducer of {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. It {{may reduce}} levels of several co-administered drugs including the <b>antiretrovirals</b> efavirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, {{as well as}} clarithromycin, ketoconazole, forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone.|$|R
5|$|<b>Antiretroviral</b> {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E
5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of <b>antiretroviral</b> drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E
5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to <b>antiretroviral</b> drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E
50|$|Lamivudine/nevirapine/stavudine (3TC/NVP/d4T) is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} HIV/AIDS. It is a fixed dose combination of lamivudine, nevirapine, and stavudine. It is either used by itself or along with other <b>antiretrovirals.</b> It is taken by mouth twice a day.|$|R

In the following review we want to focus on the new class of HIV integrase inhibitors and discuss present data with regard to special issues of HIV and HCV co-infection. </p...|$|R
5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended <b>antiretroviral</b> prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.|$|E
