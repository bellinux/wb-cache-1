5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one {{polyadenylation}} site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there <b>are</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E
