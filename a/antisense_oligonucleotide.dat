40|$|AbstractAntisense {{therapy for}} the {{treatment}} of bacterial infections is a very attractive alternative to overcome drug resistance problems. However, the penetration of <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> into bacterial cells is a major huddle that has delayed research and application in this field. In {{the first part of this}} study, we defined efficient conditions to encapsulate plasmid DNA and <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> in a fluid negatively charged liposome. Subsequently, we evaluated the potential of liposome-encapsulated <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> to penetrate the bacterial outer membrane and to inhibit gene expression in bacteria. It was found that 48. 9 ± 12 % and 43. 5 ± 4 % of the purified plasmid DNA and <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> were respectively encapsulated in the liposomes. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, it was shown, after subtraction of the fluorescence values due to the aggregation phenomenon measured at 4 °C, that about 57 % of bacterial cells had integrated the encapsulated <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> whereas values for free antisenses were negligible. The uptake of the encapsulated anti-lacZ <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> resulted in a 42 % reduction of β-galactosidase compared to 9 % and 6 % for the encapsulated mismatch <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> and the free <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> respectively. This work shows that it is possible to encapsulate relatively large quantities of negatively charged molecules in negative fluid liposomes and suggests that fluid liposomes could be used to deliver nucleic acids in bacteria to inhibit essential bacterial genes...|$|R
40|$|Neuritic {{extension}} is {{the resultant}} of two vectorial processes: outgrowth and retraction. Whereas myosin IIB {{is required for}} neurite outgrowth, retraction is driven by a motor whose identity has remained unknown until now. Preformed neurites in mouse Neuro- 2 A neuroblastoma cells undergo immediate retraction when exposed to isoform-specific <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> that suppress myosin IIB expression, ruling out myosin IIB as the retraction motor. When cells were preincubated with <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> targeting myosin IIA, simultaneous or subsequent addition of myosin IIB <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> did not elicit neurite retraction, both outgrowth and retraction being curtailed. Even during simultaneous application of <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> against both myosin isoforms, lamellipodial spreading continued despite the complete inhibition of neurite extension, indicating an uncoupling of lamellipodial dynamics from movement of the neurite. Significantly, lysophosphatidate- or thrombin-induced neurite retraction was blocked {{not only by the}} Rho-kinase inhibitor Y 27632 but also by <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> targeting myosin IIA. Control <b>oligonucleotides</b> or <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> targeting myosin IIB had no effect. In contrast, Y 27632 did not inhibit outgrowth, a myosin IIB-dependent process. We conclude that the conventional myosin motor, myosin IIA, drives neurite retraction...|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanism}} behind exon skipping is a mutation specific <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> (AON). An <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotide</b> is a synthesized short {{nucleic acid}} polymer, typically fifty or fewer base pairs in length that will bind to the mutation {{site in the}} pre-messenger RNA, to induce exon skipping. The AON binds to the mutated exon, {{so that when the}} gene is then translated from the mature mRNA, it is “skipped” over, thus restoring the disrupted reading frame.

Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the synergistic effects of the Clusterin <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> and Docetaxel on two prostate cancer cell lines. Methods: This study was conducted in the Research Institute for Biotechnology affiliated to the Iranian Research Organization for science and technology, 2013. <b>Antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> in phosphorothioate form targeting Clusterin were delivered into androgen-independent PC 3 and androgen-dependent LNCaP cell lines with 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 nanomolar concentrations.

40|$|Induction of {{specific}} exon skipping during {{the processing of}} the dystrophin gene transcript is being pursued as a potential therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. <b>Antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> directed at motifs involved in pre-mRNA processing can manipulate dystrophin exon incorporation in the mature gene transcript. We have compared the exon skipping ability of oligodeoxyribonucleotides with compounds of the identical sequence incorporating 2 ′-O-methyl modified bases. <b>Antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> composed entirely of 2 ′-O-methyl modified bases on a phosphorothioate backbone were consistently more efficient at inducing exon skipping than comparable oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Chimeric <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides,</b> mixtures of unmodified and 2 ′-O-methyl modified bases, induced intermediate levels of exon skipping. In addition, we describe terminal modifications that may {{be incorporated into the}} 2 ′-O-methyl <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> to further enhance efficiency of exon skipping.

Murine <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> inhibited IL- 1 -stimulated PGE 2 synthesis by murine fibroblasts in culture in a time (days) and concentration-dependent (3 microM- 30 microM) fashion. Murine sense oligonucleotide and an <b>oligonucleotide</b> <b>antisense</b> to human IL- 1 receptor were without effect. Moreover, murine <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> did not affect tumor necrosis factor- or bradykinin-stimulated PGE 2 synthesis by murine fibroblasts. Similarly, <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> to the human, but not the murine, IL- 1 receptor inhibited IL- 1 -stimulated PGE 2 synthesis by cultured human fibroblasts. The attenuation of the cellular response to IL- 1 caused by the <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> correlated with a loss in cell surface receptors for IL- 1, without {{any change in the}} number of bradykinin receptors on these cells. When <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> were encapsulated in liposomes, they blocked completely the appearance of newly synthesized IL- 1 receptors and IL- 1 -stimulated PGE 2 synthesis.

40|$|AbstractSystemic lupus {{erythematosus}} is an autoimmune disease that manifests in widespread complement activation and deposition of complement fragments in the kidney. The complement pathway {{is believed to}} {{play a significant role}} in the pathogenesis and in the development of lupus nephritis. Complement factor B is an important activator of the alternative complement pathway and increasing evidence supports reducing factor B as a potential novel therapy to lupus nephritis. Here we investigated whether pharmacological reduction of factor B expression using <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> could be an effective approach for the treatment of lupus nephritis. We identified potent and well tolerated factor B <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> that resulted in significant reductions in hepatic and plasma factor B levels when administered to normal mice.

40|$|Neuromuscular {{disorders}} such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neurodegenerative genetic diseases characterized {{primarily by}} muscle weakness and wasting. Until recently there were no effective therapies for these conditions, but <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides,</b> {{a new class of}} synthetic single stranded molecules of nucleic acids, have demonstrated promising experimental results and are at different stages of regulatory approval. The <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> can modulate the protein expression via targeting hnRNAs or mRNAs and inducing interference with splicing, mRNA degradation, or arrest of translation, finally, resulting in rescue or reduction of the target protein expression. Different classes of <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> are being tested in several clinical trials, and limitations of their clinical efficacy and toxicity have been reported for some of these compounds, while more encouraging results have supported the development of others. New generation <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> are also being tested in preclinical models together with specific delivery systems that could allow some of the limitations of current <b>antisense</b> <b>oligonucleotides</b> to be overcome, to improve the cell penetration, to achieve more robust target engagement, and hopefully also be associated with acceptable toxicity.
