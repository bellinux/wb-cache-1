In this technique, the canvas is first divided diagonally into quarters. Then the same motif is worked in horizontal stitches in two opposite areas, and vertical stitches in the remaining two areas. The resulting design frequently resembles <b>a</b> <b>kaleidoscope</b> effect.|$|E

Pampanga is the tilapia capital of the country because of its high production reaching 214,210.12 metric tons in 2015. In addition to farming and fishing, the province supports thriving cottage industries that specialize in wood carving, furniture making, guitars and handicrafts.

500|$|Rock critic Robert Christgau, {{writing for}} Rolling Stone {{magazine}} in 2007, called Younger Than Yesterday [...] "the Byrds' first mature album, {{a blend of}} space-flight twang and electric hoedown infused with the imminent glow of 1967 yet underlined with crackling realism." [...] Critic John Nork gave the album a glowing review on the Analogue Planet website, calling it [...] "a scrumptious smorgasbord of eclectic musical styles and groundbreaking innovation", before concluding that [...] "in every sense, Younger Than Yesterday is an utterly brilliant album, arguably the Byrds' best." [...] Alan Bisbort, writing in the book Rhino's Psychedelic Trip, described Younger Than Yesterday as [...] "an essential snapshot of an incense-scented, acid-drenched world in motion: <b>a</b> <b>kaleidoscope</b> whose every turn yielded some fantastic window on the age." ...|$|E
500|$|Writers often extolled McCain for {{his courage}} {{not just in}} war but in politics, and wrote sympathetically about him.

[...] By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of <b>a</b> <b>kaleidoscope</b> of contradictory tendencies, including, as one writer listed, [...] "the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter...." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{reported}} that Ocean was really stretching {{the limits of the}} term “song” on [...] "Pyramids", and that there are [...] "more ideas on this track than on most albums". The single runs the gamut of Ocean’s various influences, pulling from European electronic dance music and Prince's early 80s discography, notably Purple Rain. The moody tune finds Ocean moaning over ethereal swirls and pulses while cooing about [...] "working at the pyramid" [...] and finding [...] "my Black queen Cleopatra." [...] It entails a multitude of [...] "suites and <b>a</b> <b>kaleidoscope</b> of moods and tones" [...] from [...] "vainglorious to melancholic" [...] and has been called the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] of R Although Ocean is often labeled as an R artist, he has [...] "entirely steered clear of confining himself to one genre" [...] with the song.|$|E
500|$|According to Encyclopedia of Popular Music writer Colin Larkin, Something/Anything? {{has since}} been [...] "rightly {{regarded}} as one of the landmark releases of the early 70s". AllMusic especially praised the album's endearing tone and often adventurous variety of styles, commenting that [...] "Listening to Something/Anything? is a mind-altering trip in itself, no matter how many instantly memorable, shamelessly accessible pop songs are scattered throughout the album." [...] Robert Christgau also applauded the strong variety: [...] "The many good songs span styles and subjects in a virtuoso display... And the many ordinary ones are saved by Todd's confidence and verve." [...] Rolling Stone found the songs [...] "perfectly composed" [...] while deeming the record Rundgren's [...] "best-selling, most-enduring work born of desperation", one that [...] "demonstrates his command of the studio, unfurling his falsetto over <b>a</b> <b>kaleidoscope</b> of rock genres". Axl Rose declared in a 1989 Rolling Stone interview that [...] "Today, my favorite record is Todd Rundgren's Something/Anything".|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with a title screen of the song and Hamasaki's name. It then shows a boy looking towards the camera, until shifting to Hamasaki wearing a colorful outfit whilst surrounded by star-like shapes. The boy walks through the stars whilst Hamasaki sings the song; the second look is inspired by the artwork of [...] "To Be". He opens a case that holds <b>a</b> <b>kaleidoscope</b> and looks through it, seeing various versions of Hamasaki in different colored outfits and wigs singing the song. All these scenes start to re-appear {{throughout the rest of}} the song, and ends with a black and white image of Hamasaki, apparently cracked in the kaleidoscope, which then has the boy looking upset. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), a self-titled DVD (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E

500|$|Michael and Carole turn {{to crime}} {{as a means}} of getting by, with Carole taking the role of a prostitute. Carole flirts with a sleazy {{businessman}} and brings him to a hotel room, where Michael beats him to death with a lead pipe. The two walk out into a pinball background with the dead man's cash. Just then, Shorty shows up and shoots Michael {{in the head with a}} gun that Angie gave him to finish the job before Ida chases him; the bullet is seen going through Michael's skull in slow motion.

500|$|The album's lyrics {{generally}} {{deal with}} themes of adult love, meaningful sex, and romance. Andrew Ryce from Pitchfork interprets its [...] "overarching theme" [...] to be [...] "the highly sexualized {{seen through the}} lens of the eager and innocent." [...] Miguel's lyrics express modesty, yearning, vulnerability, and cheeky humor. Kelley likens his songwriting to Tony! Toni! Toné! and observes [...] "Little Richard-level insinuations" [...] and [...] "absurd provocations in the style of Akinyele". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis views that Miguel eschews braggadocio and is [...] "man enough to admit his own insecurities and question whether he's worthy of love—or lustful indulgence." [...] Kaleidoscope Dream also explores the anxiety and momentary nature of sex and clubbing. Consequence of Sound's Jeremy D. Larson views that Miguel employs a [...] "fangs-out approach to R" [...] similar to Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, writing that [...] "nothing shrouds Miguel and his directives, and worries, and prayers, and cat calls– it's all there, full of light and love, refracting through <b>a</b> <b>kaleidoscope</b> of rocks glasses, rainy windshields, and blood-shot eyes." ...|$|E

500|$|Mike Wass {{from the}} website Idolator called the show a [...] "concert extravaganza {{in the style}} of Michael Jackson or Madonna" [...] praising the fact that the singer made a {{progress}} in the production values compared with her previous performances, mostly due to the expensive and high-quality visual projections which [...] "create atmosphere and add another layer to the production". He further praised the singer's [...] "extraordinary talent" [...] during the performances hailing her as [...] "the greatest entertainer of her generation" [...] after seeing the show which showcased [...] "an icon at top of her game". Tiffany Poole from The Oklahoman praised the fashion, video backdrops and [...] "some of the most impersonated dance moves on YouTube" [...] concluding, [...] "To say that Beyoncé puts on a good show would be grossly understated." [...] Billboard writer Gail Mitchell hailed the concert as a [...] "musical and visual extravaganza" [...] complete with <b>a</b> <b>kaleidoscope</b> of colorful imagery and dancing, which according to him enhanced the music complete with the singer's strong vocals, rather than overshadowing it. He concluded that the tour claimed [...] "the multi-talented artist's intent to join the rarefied ranks of ultimate entertainer". Nick Hasted of The Independent wrote that the tour followed the stadium trends containing [...] "big-budget movie clips and Broadway musical dance moves, with platoons of backing singers and dancers acting as extras" [...] further hailing it as a [...] "Cecil B. DeMille spectacle". He finished his reviews by concluding, [...] "what makes this show's largely enervating juggernaut breathe is Beyoncé's tireless physical effort.
