5|$|No. 11 Group was {{relocated}} to RAF Martlesham Heath in 1958, when control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to RAF Technical Training Command {{and the entire}} site became known as RAF Uxbridge.

Southern Region <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Services HQ and the Royal Observer Corps' South East Communications Centre moved into the house in 1960.

5|$|Domestically, {{air travel}} between Paris {{and some of}} France's largest cities such as Lyon, Marseille, or Strasbourg {{has been in a}} large measure {{replaced}} by high-speed rail due to the opening of several high-speed TGV rail lines from the 1980s.

5|$|In May 2007, the TSB {{released}} {{copies of}} the audio recordings of the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control transmissions associated with the flight. The transcripts of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada's Access to Information Act and Privacy Act, the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal rejected this argument in 2006 in a legal proceeding concerned with <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control recordings in four other air accidents. The Supreme Court of Canada did not grant leave to appeal that decision and consequently the TSB released {{a copy of the}} Swissair 111 <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control audio recordings to the Canadian Press, which had requested the recordings under the Access to Information Act.

5|$|On 8 March 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 {{disappeared}} {{en route}} from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, China with 239 persons aboard; a search in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand was promptly initiated near the aircraft's last voice contact with <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control and final contact with secondary radar (the type of radar used by <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control). A week after the disappearance, Malaysia announced that military radar determined that the aircraft had traveled west across the Malay Peninsula after being lost by <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control.

5|$|On October 13, 2006, {{two days}} after the crash, the FAA banned all fixed-winged {{aircraft}} from the East River corridor unless in contact with local <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control. The new rule, which took effect immediately, required all small aircraft (with the exception of helicopters and certain seaplanes) to seek the approval of and stay in contact with <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control while in the corridor. The FAA cited safety concerns, especially unpredictable winds from between buildings, as the reason for the change.|$|E

5|$|The {{evidence}} {{collected during}} this investigation strongly supports {{the conclusion that}} this accident was caused by N600XL and GOL1907 following ATC clearances which directed them to operate in opposite directions on the same airway at the same altitude resulting in a midair collision.
