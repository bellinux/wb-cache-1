I wonder if he sees to all the boarders this way. How the O-t-a-r-d merchants must hate him, and the pastry-cooks too. I wish I had a good pie to pass the time. I wonder if they ever make pumpkin pies in Paris? So I've got {{to stay in this}} room all the time. Somehow I'm bound to be a prisoner, one way or another. Never mind, I'm an ambassador; that's satisfaction. Hark! The Doctor again.--Come in." ...|$|E

5000|$|When tea-drinking {{was first}} {{introduced}} to England circa 1660, tea was rare and expensive, {{as a consequence of}} which teacups <b>and</b> <b>teaspoons</b> were smaller than today. This situation persisted until about 1710, when the East India Company began importing tea directly from China. As the price of tea declined, the size of teacups <b>and</b> <b>teaspoons</b> increased. By the 1730s, the teaspoon as a unit of culinary measure had increased to [...] of a tablespoon, but the apothecary unit of measure remained the same. Nevertheless, the teaspoon, usually under its Latin name, continued to be used in Apothecaries' measures for several more decades, with the original definition of one fluid dram.|$|R

50|$|The {{school year}} at Madame Grelaud's began October 1 {{and went through}} August 31. The girls had the month of September for vacation. Each girl was {{required}} to bring an initialed silver mug <b>and</b> <b>teaspoon</b> for the school year. The girls wore coal scuttle bonnets with short, narrow frocks for school uniforms. Grelaud's students underwent a rigorous academic curriculum. Girls at these schools were expected to speak French fluently and to excel in history, philosophy, natural science, and geography. Ornamental subjects were also emphasized, including art, dance, languages, and music. Outings into the city provided opportunities to not only shop in upscale boutiques, but also to observe the manners and fashions of elite ladies and gentlemen. Parties and balls were also considered {{an important part of}} the young ladies' education, allowing practice in conversation and interaction with other members of the upper class. Madame Grelaud often hosted parties featuring accomplished musicians. She also allowed students to accept invitations to parties and the theater under proper supervision.|$|E
40|$|Taxation {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a possible preventive strategy to address the serious public health concern of childhood obesity. Understanding the public’s viewpoint on the potential role of taxation is vital to inform policy decisions {{if they are to}} be acceptable to the wider community. A Citizens’ Jury is a deliberative method for engaging the public in decision making and can assist in setting policy agendas. A Citizens’ Jury was conducted in Brisbane, Australia in May 2013 to answer the question: Is taxation on food and drinks an acceptable strategy to the public in order to reduce rates of childhood obesity? Citizens were randomly selected from the electoral roll and invited to participate. Thirteen members were purposively sampled from those expressing interest to broadly reflect the diversity of the Australian public. Over two days, participants were presented with evidence on the topic by experts, were able to question witnesses and deliberate on the evidence. The jurors unanimously supported taxation on sugar-sweetened drinks but generally did not support taxation on processed meats, snack foods and foods eaten/ purchased outside the home. They also supported taxation on snack foods on the condition that traffic light labelling was also introduced. Though they were not specifically asked to deliberate strategies outside of taxation, the jurors strongly recommended more nutritional information on all food packaging using the traffic light <b>and</b> <b>teaspoon</b> labelling systems for sugar, salt and fat content. The Citizens’ Jury suggests that the general public may support taxation on sugar-sweetened drinks to reduce rates of obesity in children. Regulatory reforms of taxation on sugar-sweetened drinks and improved labelling of nutritional information on product packaging were strongly supported by all members of the jury. These reforms should be considered by governments to prevent childhood obesity and the future burden on society from the consequences of obesity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A common {{procedure}} {{to determine the}} metal concentration mine waste piles is the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) Method 1311 developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This test takes considerable time and sample amount hindering the remediation process by slowing it down.

With a reaction time of 1 hour <b>and</b> <b>teaspoons</b> of contaminated sediment needed, this scaled-down version of the TCLP may provide a rapid screening assessment tool that will speed up remediation decisions. _________________________ 1 Poster paper presented at the 7 th International Conference on Acid Rock Drainage (ICARD) ...|$|R
5000|$|Frappé is in Greece {{available}} in three degrees of sweetness, {{determined by the}} amount of sugar used. These are: glykós (γλυκός, pronounced , [...] "sweet", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> of coffee <b>and</b> 4 <b>teaspoons</b> of sugar); métrios (μέτριος, [...] "medium", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> of coffee <b>and</b> 2 <b>teaspoons</b> of sugar); <b>and</b> a skétos (σκέτος, [...] "plain", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> of coffee <b>and</b> no sugar). All varieties may be served with evaporated milk (με γάλα [...] ), in which case they may be called in slang φραπόγαλο (frapógalo, , [...] "frappé-milk"), or without. Sometimes, frappé is served without any water (besides the water used in the foam) and milk is used instead. This variation is most commonly found in Cyprus.|$|R

Results A total of 71 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>and</b> 49 tablespoons were provided from the 25 female (mean age 48. 0 years) study participants. When these utensils were filled with water, the volume capacity of the 71 teaspoons ranged from 2. 5 to 7. 3 ml; mean volume was 4. 4 ml; median was 4. 4 ml. When the standardized teaspoon was used, the volume ranged from 3. 9 to 4. 9 ml among the total of the 25 study participants. When a subset of 5 study participants filled this teaspoon with paracetamol syrup, mean volume was 4. 8 ml.
