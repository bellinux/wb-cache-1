40|$|Two {{popular and}} robust {{approaches}} to analysing affected sib pair (ASP) data for linkage are the traditional <b>excess</b> <b>sharing</b> methods and the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT). Here we derive an overall test of linkage for multi-allelic ASP marker data which comprises two component tests: one <b>for</b> <b>excess</b> <b>sharing</b> and one <b>for</b> transmission disequilibrium. This method has several advantages. Firstly the overall test of linkage {{is often more}} powerful than {{either of the two}} component tests. Secondly the method makes it possible to determine the contribution of linkage disequilibrium (LD), in addition to linkage, to an overall positive linkage result. This is useful because the presence of LD in addition to linkage may suggest that the marker locus is in very close proximity to a disease susceptibility gene, Thirdly the method provides estimates of the risk associated with transmission of the different marker alleles...|$|R

A recent analysis of transmission distortion in humans reported significant <b>excess</b> <b>sharing</b> among full siblings. Dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs are a special case of the simultaneous survival of two genotypes, {{and there have been}} reports of DZ pairs with <b>excess</b> allele <b>sharing</b> around the HLA locus, a candidate locus for embryo survival. We performed an allele-sharing study of 1, 592 DZ twin pairs from two independent Australian cohorts, of which 1, 561 pairs were informative for linkage on chromosome 6. We also analyzed allele sharing in 336 DZ twin pairs from The Netherlands. We found no evidence of <b>excess</b> allele <b>sharing,</b> either at the HLA locus or {{in the rest of the}} genome. In contrast, we found evidence of a small but significant (P =. 003 for the Australian sample) genomewide deficit in the proportion of two alleles shared identical by descent among DZ twin pairs. We reconciled conflicting evidence in the literature <b>for</b> <b>excess</b> genomewide allele <b>sharing</b> by performing a simulation study that shows how undetected genotyping errors can lead to an apparent deficit or <b>excess</b> of allele <b>sharing</b> among sibling pairs, dependent on whether parental genotypes are known. Our results imply that gene-mapping studies based on affected sibling pairs that include DZ pairs will not suffer from false-positive results due to loci involved in embryo survival.

40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) {{have been}} successful in identifying common variants that influence the susceptibility to complex diseases. From these studies it has emerged that there is substantial overlap in susceptibility loci between diseases. In line with those findings, we hypothesized that shared genetic pathways may exist between multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While both diseases may have inflammatory and neurodegenerative features, epidemiological studies have indicated an increased co-occurrence within individuals and families. To this purpose, we combined genome-wide data from 4, 088 MS patients, 3, 762 ALS patients, and 12, 030 healthy control individuals in whom 5, 440, 446 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were successfully genotyped or imputed. We tested these SNPs <b>for</b> <b>excess</b> association <b>shared</b> between MS and ALS, and also explored if polygenic models of SNPs below genome-wide significance could explain some of the observed trait variance between diseases. Genome-wide association meta-analysis of single SNPs as well as polygenic analyses fail to provide evidence in favor of an overlap in genetic susceptibility between MS and ALS. Hence, our findings do not support a shared genetic background of common risk variants in MS and ALS. status: publishe...|$|R

The glycerol is a by-product in the biodiesel production. For every 9 kg of biodiesel produced, about 1 kg of a crude glycerol is formed.

They can be separated from reaction mixture, are reusable, do less harm to the environment and have not corrosion or disposal of effluent problems.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{identified}} evidence for linkage between {{type 2 diabetes}} and the regions on chromosomes 12 and 20 containing the maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes, hepatocyte nuclear factor- 1 alpha (HNF- 1 alpha) and HNF- 4 alpha. Two studies examining the HNF- 1 alpha region have demonstrated evidence for linkage at genome-wide levels of significance, whereas four studies examining the HNF- 4 alpha locus have resulted in evidence for linkage at more suggestive levels of significance. The demonstration of linkage to these regions in additional patient series will strengthen the evidence that susceptibility alleles exist at these loci. We therefore assessed the evidence for linkage to these regions using a large cohort of United Kingdom Caucasian type 2 diabetes-affected sibling pairs. A maximum total of 315 affected full sibling pairs were typed for microsatellite markers across the MODY regions and, in a subset of families, for markers spanning the whole of chromosome 20. Evidence for linkage was assessed using a multipoint, mode of inheritance-free method. Linkage analysis did not reveal any significant evidence <b>for</b> <b>excess</b> allele <b>sharing</b> {{at any of the}} regions studied. Loci contributing sibling recurrence risks, relative to the general population risk, of 1. 75 and 1. 25 could be excluded for the HNF- 1 alpha and HNF- 4 alpha regions, respectively.

40|$|In this dissertation, I assess {{under which}} {{circumstances}} normality {{can be a}} good descriptive model for the U. S. excess returns. I explore two possible sources of deviations from normal-ity: structural breaks and regime switching in long term aggregate time series. In addition, I study temporal aggregation (i. e., considering the frequency of data as a variable) for ex-cess returns in short term time series. My main findings are summarized as follows. First, using long spanning monthly time series data from 1871 to 2010, I find that (1) there are structural breaks in monthly excess returns between pre-WWII and post-WWII data; and, (2) while pre-WWII data is consistent with normality, post-WWII data is not. Second, I provide evidence of two market regimes <b>for</b> <b>excess</b> returns in post-WWII data. These regimes may be seen as bull and bear market conditions. Third, using high frequency post-WWII data, I check for aggregational Gaussianity, from daily to annual data. I find that Gaus-sianity depends on the frequency of data: it may hold for highly aggregate data (starting from semi-annual to annual data) but it does not hold for high frequency data (less than semi-annual). My main contribution is to demonstrate the ânormality survival â when fre-quency is taken as a variable. After a careful look at the available literature on aggregational Gaussianity, I found no previous <b>applications</b> and results <b>for</b> <b>excess</b> returns...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{accuracy}} of the usual procedure for neutrino energy reconstruction which is based on the quasielastic kinematics. Our results are described in terms of a probability distribution for a real neutrino energy value. Several factors are responsible for the deviations from the reconstructed value. The main one is the multinucleon component of the neutrino interaction which in the case of Cherenkov detectors enters as a quasielastic cross section, increasing the mean neutrino energy which can differ appreciably from the reconstructed value. As an <b>application</b> we derive, <b>for</b> <b>excess</b> electron events attributed to the conversion of muon neutrinos, the true neutrino energy distribution based on the experimental one which is given in terms of the reconstructed value. The result is a reshaping effect. For MiniBooNE the low energy peak is suppressed and shifted at higher energies, which may influence the interpretation in terms of oscillation. For T 2 K at the Super Kamiokande far detector the reshaping translates into a narrowing of the energy distribution. Â© 2012 American Physical Society.

40|$|Thermo {{mechanical}} pulp (TMP) mills are large consumers of both steam and electricity. Large energy savings {{can be achieved}} through investments in thermal process integration or more energy efficient process equipments. Thermal process integration can help to reduce the hot and cold utility consumptions in a mill. A well known thermal process integration method is pinch analysis. This master thesis studies the potential for hot utility savings in four different TMP mills in Norway and Sweden. A detailed pinch analysis requires too much time, mainly for data gathering and especially for four mills so instead, a model named the Heat Load Model for Pulp and Paper (HLMPP) is used. The HLMPP {{can be considered as}} a simplified pinch analysis which needs a limited amount of input data and, thus, saves time compared to a detailed pinch analysis. Even though HLMPP gives accurate enough estimations, it does not have the precision of a detailed pinch analysis and does not explain how to upgrade the Heat Exchanger Network (HEN) in order to match the potential of steam savings and warm water available. The results for the four mills studied show promising potentials for steam savings, between 2. 1 % and 20. 3 % in total for the four reference cases. Moreover, the results show that large amounts of warm water (excess heat) should be available. However, this excess heat has a fairly low temperature, 65 - 72 Â°C (for three mills; for the fourth mill, it was even lower). Apart from the reference cases, different sensitivity analyses were studied e. g. a decrease of the fresh water consumption in the Paper Machines (PMs), removal of the internal district heating network, further cooling of waste water, installation of modern dryers with an higher exhaust air moisture content. The results from these sensitivity analyses show that even further steam savings could be possible, between 2. 8 % and 29. 7 % in total for the different mills as well as further amount of warm water available. <b>Applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>excess</b> steam and warm water are numerous. With steam savings giving excess steam, the mills can decide to sell it (export to a close mill or a town for district heating), use it on-site for biomass drying or driving a condensing turbine to produce electricity. Steam savings also enable fuel savings in the boilers or the replacement of old refiners by more efficient refiners (which consume less electricity) without having to burn more fuel in the boilers. Excess warm water can, in spite of being at quite low temperature, be either recovered by a heat pump, utilized in an Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) or used for preheating of other (external or new) process streams. According to the results for each mill, one can see the interest of carrying out a complete pinch analysis for all the mills in order to find the most profitable solution between the applications previously mentioned...|$|R

The condition has a genetic basis, although at present the number of genes is unknown. In order to identify such genes, we are utilising a linkage scanning approach using microsatellite markers and affected sibships. Here we provide evidence for the location {{of at least one}} hypertension susceptibility locus on chromosome 17. Analysis of 177 affected sibpairs gave evidence <b>for</b> significant <b>excess</b> allele <b>sharing</b> to D 17 S 949 (SPLINK: P= 0. 0029; MAPMAKER SIBS: P= 0. 0033; ASPEX: P= 0. 0061; GENEHUNTER: P= 0. 0096; ANALYZE (SIBPAIR) : P= 0. 0025) on 17 q 22 - 24, with significant allele sharing also indicated for an additional marker, D 17 S 799 (SPLINK: P= 0. 025; MAPMAKER SIBS: P= 0. 025) located close to the centromere. Since these two genomic regions are well separated, our results indicate that there may be more than one chromosome 17 locus affecting human blood pressure. Moreover, further investigation of this chromosome, utilizing a polymorphism within the promoter of the iNOS candidate gene, NOS 2 A, revealed both increased allele sharing among sibpairs (SPLINK: P= 0. 02; ASPEX: P= 0. 00004) and positive association (P= 0. 034) of NOS 2 A to essential hypertension.

40|$|The transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) is a popular, simple, and {{powerful}} test of linkage, {{which can be}} used to analyze data consisting of transmissions to the affected members of families with any kind pedigree structure, including affected sib pairs (ASPs). Although {{it is based on the}} preferential transmission of a particular marker allele across families, it is not a valid test of association for ASPs. Martin et al. devised a similar statistic for ASPs, T(sp), which is also based on preferential transmission of a marker allele but which is a valid test of both linkage and association for ASPs. It is, however, less powerful than the TDT as a test of linkage for ASPs. What I show is that the differences between the TDT and T(sp) are due to the fact that, although both statistics are based on preferential transmission of a marker allele, the TDT also exploits <b>excess</b> <b>sharing</b> in identity-by-descent transmissions to ASPs. Furthermore, I show that both of these statistics are members of a family of 2 Ì 7 TDT-like 2 Ì 7 statistics for ASPs. The statistics in this family are based on preferential transmission but also, to varying extents, exploit <b>excess</b> <b>sharing.</b> From this family of statistics, we see that, although the TDT exploits <b>excess</b> <b>sharing</b> to some extent, it is possible to do so to a greater extent - and thus produce a more powerful test of linkage, for ASPs, than is provided by the TDT. Power simulations conducted under a number of disease models are used to verify that the most powerful member of this family of TDT-like statistics is more powerful than the TDT for ASPs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background One {{implicit}} assumption in most {{linkage analysis}} is that live-born siblings unselected for a phenotype {{do not share}} alleles greater than the Mendelian expectation at any particular locus. However, since most families are recruited for genetic studies {{because of the presence}} of disease, there is little data available to confirm that this is the case. We hypothesized that loci that behave in a non-Mendelian fashion could be identified using genotype data from the Framingham Heart Study families. We tested the hypothesis that live-born sibs, either stratified by or irrespective of gender, demonstrate <b>excess</b> <b>sharing</b> of alleles on the autosomes, i. e., transmission ratio distortion. Multipoint linkage analysis of siblings either according to gender or not was performed using an allele-sharing method. Such observations may have implications for the mapping of loci for complex disease and quantitative traits in human pedigrees. Results No results that reached genome-wide significance were observed.
