Themes in current discourse on “arts” and “health” are broadly sketched to provide a context for discussion of arts practices. Approaches to knowledge validation in relation to each domain are discussed. These discourses are applied to the Irish healthcare context, offering a reading of three different art projects; it suggests a multiplicity of analyses beyond causal positive health gains. It is suggested that the social turn in medicine and the social turn in arts practices share some similar pre-occupations that warrant further attention...|$|R

Other measures, such as quote and trade sizes, prove to be only modest tools for assessing and tracking liquidity, while trading volume and frequency are in fact poor measures of liquidity...|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that geospatial intelligence {{can be described as}} a product occurring at the point of delivery, i.e., by the amount of analysis which occurs to resolve particular problems, not by the type of data used. For example, a database containing a list of measurements of bridges obtained from imagery is 'information' while the development of an output using analysis to determine those bridges that are able to be utilized for specific purposes could be termed 'intelligence'. Similarly, the simple measurement of beach profiles is a classical geographic information-gathering activity, while the process of selecting a beach that matches a certain profile for a specific purpose is an <b>analytical</b> <b>activity,</b> and the output could be termed an intelligence product. In this form it is considered to be generally used by agencies requiring definitions of their outputs for descriptive and capability development purposes (or, more cynically, as a marketing strategy).|$|R

These simulations are used to compare options and to optimize the chosen solution. Students are also led to understand and assess their roles in the design process...|$|E
