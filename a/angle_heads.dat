40|$|In general, recent {{critical}} {{studies of}} five-axis machine {{have tended to}} center {{on the question of}} effective machining to realize complex shape parts. However, the hydrostatic bearing and journal bearing, both of which are involved in the complex process of dividing the processing of internal precision-shape machining, must be optimized. Although the <b>angle</b> <b>head</b> is designed to machine the internal shape as it approaches the inner diameter of the work piece, research on the <b>angle</b> <b>head</b> in five-axis machining has received only minimal attention in domestic industries. In this study, an <b>angle</b> <b>head</b> which is optimized for effective internal shape machining is developed. In pursuit of this purpose, 3 D and 2 D designs of the <b>angle</b> <b>head</b> for five-axis machining are devised. Reliability is secured through static performance tests and machining accuracy evaluations of the <b>angle</b> <b>head</b> in keeping with the machining accuracy standard of 0. 2 mm for hydrostati...|$|R

Information in chemical signals {{is influenced by}} the hydrodynamic conditions of the environment. Hydro-dynamically distinct environments will contain different types of information, which will influence how organisms orient. This study was designed to examine how the orientation behavior of the brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) is influenced by flow regime. The experiment was conducted in a flume under two different flow conditions. Treatments consisted of control (no odor) and plain gelatin (odor). Percent success, swimming speed, turning <b>angle,</b> <b>heading</b> <b>angle,</b> <b>heading</b> <b>angle</b> upstream, and net-to-gross ratio were analyzed. Brown bullheads were 100 % successful in finding the odor source under no flow and 57 % success-ful in flow. Bullheads swam differently in the no-flow condition when compared to the flow condition. Since, these fish did not orient the same under different flow conditions, it appears that hydrodynamics plays a role in shaping their behavior.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general mathematical treatment of serial manipulators, an important example {{of which is}} the servo head. The paper includes validation by application to the <b>angle</b> <b>head</b> via comparison with the previously known transformations and a new application to the error analysis of the <b>angle</b> <b>head.</b> The usual approach to the error analysis of a servo head is to develop a geometrical model by elementary geometrical considerations using trigonometric relationships and various simplifying assumptions. This approach is very error prone, difŽ cult to verify and extremely time consuming. The techniques described here constitute matrix methods that have been programmed in a general way to derive automatically the analytical equations relating the angles of rotation of the head and alignment errors in the head to the position of the tool and errors in that position. The approach is to use rotation and transformation matrices to evaluate the in� uence of the various errors such as offsets and angular errors. A general approach to the sign convention and notation for angular errors is presented in an attempt to reduce the possibility of errors of deŽ nition...|$|R
