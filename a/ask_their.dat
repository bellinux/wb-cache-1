5|$|The {{season was}} {{affected}} by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which began on November 5, 2007 and ended on February 12, 2008. The season's show runners Tina Fey and Robert Carlock publicly committed to honor the strike themselves and to not <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> writers to do otherwise. As a result, only 15 episodes of the 22 episodes ordered could be produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} Hastings called {{for both the}} Solicitor General, Sir Henry Slesser, and Jimmy Maxton, to <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> opinion on the prosecution. Maxton knew Campbell, and {{revealed}} {{that he was only}} the temporary editor and had not written the article – the article had actually been copied from another newspaper. Along with Guy Stevenson, the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, Hastings then visited Ramsay MacDonald to explain the facts of the case. MacDonald blamed the Director of Public Prosecutions for starting the case, although Hastings intervened and admitted to Macdonald that it was entirely his fault. The Prime Minister said that he felt they should go through with the case now they had started, but Hastings suggested that a member of the Treasury Counsel appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court and withdraw the prosecution. MacDonald agreed, and the next morning Travers Humphreys appeared for the Crown at the Magistrates Court and had Campbell discharged.|$|E

If two businesspeople {{are competing for}} a government contract, the protected can <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> mafioso friends to bully their rival out of the bidding process. In another example, a mafioso {{acting on behalf of}} a coffee supplier might pressure local bars into serving only their client's coffee.|$|E

25|$|The {{first seven}} seasons were {{delivered}} to American audiences by Oxygen Media in 2002. The recorded program was very popular, but American viewers missed {{the opportunity to}} call in and <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> own questions. The U.S. version of Sunday Night Sex Show, called Talk Sex with Sue Johanson, produced especially for American audiences, debuted in November 2002 on the Oxygen Media.|$|E

Their duties are principally to examine the junior clergy, and the candidates for irremovable rectorships.|$|E
25|$|Question Period has a {{reputation}} for being quite chaotic due to the commonplace cat-calling and jeering from non-participating MPs, but notwithstanding the heckling, Question Period is actually tightly-regulated. Parties are only allowed to ask a predetermined number of questions based on the size of their caucus, and must <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> questions in a specific order, predetermined by their party leadership for that day on a list given to the Speaker.|$|E

25|$|Although Gozzi's La donna serpente was {{the source}} for Wagner's plot, he took the names of Die Feens two {{principal}} characters, Ada and Arindal, from Die Hochzeit. The libretto also introduced a fantastic theme that {{was not in the}} original play. The libretto displays themes and patterns that were to recur in Wagner's more mature works. These include redemption, a mysterious stranger demanding that their lover not <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> name, and long expository narratives.|$|E
25|$|Crypton and Toyota {{began working}} {{together}} to promote {{the launch of the}} 2011 Toyota Corolla using Hatsune Miku to promote the car. The launch of the car also marked the start of Miku's debut in the US alongside it. Crypton had always sold Hatsune Miku as a virtual instrument, but they decided to <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> own fanbase in Japan if it was okay with them to market her to the United States as a virtual singer instead.|$|E
25|$|Many {{collectors}} <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> {{family and}} friends to save stamps for them from their mail. Although the stamps received by major businesses and those kept by elderly relatives may be of international and historical interest, the stamps received from family members are often of the definitive sort. Definitives seem mundane but, considering their variety of colours, watermarks, paper differences, perforations and printing errors, they can fill many pages in a collection. Introducing either variety or specific focus to a collection can require the purchasing of stamps, either from a dealer or online. Large numbers of relatively recent stamps, often still attached to fragments or envelopes, may be obtained cheaply and easily. Rare and old stamps can also be obtained, but these can be very expensive.|$|E

25|$|At Springfield Elementary, Skinner is despondent at {{the thought}} that Edna could leave the school. Groundskeeper Willie lends Skinner his sports car so he can go to Orlando, where he surprises Edna with a kiss under the {{fireworks}} display. They are interrupted by Agnes, whom Skinner brought along, much to Edna's ire. During preparation for the awards ceremony, Skinner is shocked when he hears that the winner receives enough money to be able to retire. He requests Bart to help him sabotage Edna's chances of winning, though he has to resort to blackmail after Bart initially refuses. At the ceremony, each finalist must <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> nominating student a question. When Bart is asked what Edna would like to teach the world, he pretends to be illiterate, until Skinner tells the truth. Skinner asks Edna to marry him, and she agrees. Edna loses the award, but looks forward to marrying Skinner.|$|E
25|$|Mail {{was vital}} for the prisoners of war. Letters allowed {{them not only}} to receive news from home but also to <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> {{families}} to send parcels and inform them of their receipt. Every month, a prisoner {{had the right to}} write two letters (limited to six pages each for officers, and four pages for other ranks), on paper that he had to buy at the camp, and four postcards. These were the numbers in theory, at least, though very often the practice differed. For the German authorities, mail represented a considerable source of pressure; the right to write and receive mail was regularly denied. In the first half of 1915, French prisoners sent 350,000 letters to France; the figure doubled {{in the second half of}} the year. On an average week, French prisoners received 45,000 letters containing money. This number fluctuated significantly: 8,356 such letters between 8 and 24 October 1914, 79,561 between 22 and 28 November 1915. Many prisoners did not know how to write and asked others to write for them. Censorship and package inspections were daily occurrences.|$|E
25|$|Back in England, a petty quarrel between Richard Plantagenet and the Duke of Somerset has {{expanded}} to involve the whole court. Richard and Somerset <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> fellow nobles to pledge allegiance to one of them, and as such the lords select either red or white roses to indicate the side they are on. Richard then goes to see his uncle, Edmund Mortimer, imprisoned in the Tower of London. Mortimer tells Richard {{the history of their}} family's conflict with the king's family—how they helped Henry Bolingbroke seize power from Richard II, but were then shoved into the background; and how Henry V had Richard's father (Richard of Conisburgh) executed and his family stripped of all its lands and monies. Mortimer also tells Richard that he himself is the rightful heir to the throne, and that when he dies, Richard will be the true heir, not Henry. Amazed at these revelations, Richard determines to attain his birthright, and vows to have his family's dukedom restored. After Mortimer dies, Richard presents his petition to the recently crowned Henry, who agrees to reinstate the Plantagenet's title, making Richard 3rd Duke of York. Henry then leaves for France, accompanied by Gloucester, Exeter, Winchester, Richard and Somerset.|$|E

25|$|Greece {{is ranked}} {{as the first}} country in the Balkans with most people who were awarded as Righteous Among the Nations. The Greek {{population}} was significantly active in hiding fellow Greeks of Jewish religion from the Nazi German forces during the Axis occupation of Greece. Even though Jews of Thessaloniki were easily deported from Thessaloniki, collaboration was minimal in capital Athens, where Nazi propaganda was not as effective, as the ancient Romaniote Jewish communities were well-integrated into the Orthodox Greek society and could not easily be singled out from the Christians, who in turn were more ready to resist the German authorities' demands. The Archbishop of Athens Damaskinos ordered his priests to <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> congregations to help the Jews and sent a strong-worded letter of protest to the collaborationist authorities and the Germans. Many Orthodox Christians risked their lives hiding Jews in their apartments and homes, despite threat of imprisonment. Even the Greek police ignored instructions to turn over Jews to the Germans. When Jewish community leaders appealed to Prime Minister Ioannis Rallis, he tried to alleviate their fears {{by saying that the}} Jews of Thessaloniki had been guilty of subversive activities and that this was the reason they were deported. At the same time, Elias Barzilai, the Grand Rabbi of Athens, was summoned to the Department of Jewish Affairs and told to submit a list of names and addresses of members of the Jewish community. Instead he destroyed the community records, thus saving the lives of thousands of Athenian Jews. He advised the Jews of Athens to flee or go into hiding. A few days later, the Rabbi himself was spirited out of the city by EAM-ELAS fighters and joined the resistance. EAM-ELAS helped hundreds of Jews escape and survive (especially officer Stefanos Sarafis), many of whom stayed with the resistance as fighters and/or interpreters.|$|E
500|$|Partners are {{normally}} {{allowed to talk}} to each other during the game. They can for instance ask for a specific piece, for more trades, ask to hold a piece, suggest moves or <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> partner to stall. Shouts like [...] "Knight mates!" [...] or [...] "Don't let him have a Rook!" [...] are common, and can lead to seemingly absurd sacrificial captures on the other board. Partners are not allowed to physically act on the other board.|$|E
500|$|Captured {{pieces are}} passed on and thus {{what happens on}} one board {{influences}} {{what happens on the}} other board. It is therefore natural for team members to communicate during game play. A common request of an attacking player would be [...] "trades are good", while players in trouble would <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> partner to hold trades with [...] "trades are bad". Equally a player can request a piece e.g. [...] "knight wins a queen" [...] or ask to hold a piece e.g. [...] "rook mates me".|$|E

500|$|Prose Writers of America, {{published}} in 1847, was prepared specifically {{to compete with}} a similar anthology by Cornelius Mathews and Evert Augustus Duyckinck. The prose collection earned Griswold a rivalry with the two men, which Griswold expected. As it was being published, Griswold wrote to Boston publisher James Thomas Fields that [...] "Young America will be rabid". In preparing his anthologies, Griswold would write to the living authors whose work he was including to <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> suggestions on which poems to include, {{as well as to}} gather information for a biographical sketch.|$|E

[...] A former general who was a part of the intelligence services said that Mubarak would have no qualms about [...] "setting the whole country on fire." [...] Western media suggested the possibility of civil war as violence between the two sides escalated, leaving over a thousand injured.|$|E

Patients who are invited {{to take part in}} a trial are advised to ask, among other things, for a written guarantee that the trial has been publicly registered, and that the main outcome of the trial will be published within a year of its completion.
