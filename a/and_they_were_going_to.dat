Teppei {{recruited}} his skate park friend Eddie Breckenridge to play bass, who then brought his brother Riley on as a drummer. In 1998, before their first show, they realized they needed a name. Hard-pressed for time, they decided {{to go with the}} name 'Thrice' out of desperation. Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> use it only temporarily for their first show. However, they began to gain fans with the name, and people started to associate them with it, so they were forced to keep it.|$|E
25|$|Temecula was a {{proposed}} city for a charter {{membership in the}} California Inline Hockey League based in San Diego then to Los Angeles. The California Inline Hockey league was a grassroots minor league professional Inline hockey league with clubs based {{in the state of}} California but later added two teams in Nevada. The CIHL awarded the city of Temecula a club which was {{to be a part of}} the CIHL's first season in 1995. The club was named the Temecula Desert Rats <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be members of the CIHL along with the San Francisco Seals, Santa Barbara Sandsharks, Los Angeles/Sacramento Golden Bears, High Desert (Adelanto) Rattlers later moved to Las Vegas, Fresno Fire who merged with the Bakersfield Bombers, Orange County Crushers, Sacramento/Reno Express, Carson City/Modesto-Stockton Mavericks, Santa Cruz/Monterey Bay Tritons, and {{a proposed}} team in San Diego (the San Diego/San Jose/Golden Gate Goals) which like Temecula suspended operations for 1995. Temecula's reason for suspending operations was because no suitable rink was available for the club and was the reason the club moved to Phoenix, Arizona for the 1996 season. The team was going to be called the Phoenix Desert Rats, but the team reappeared in Palm Desert, California to become the Palm (Springs) Desert Rats, to replace the Roller hockey team the Palm Desert Silver-Cats who later relocated to Ontario, California, to represent the Riverside-San Bernardino area. The CIHL folded in 1999 with the remaining teams: the California Desert Rats, Inland Empire InlinE-men (Ontario), (Orange) County Web Warriors (also the name of a team in Pro Beach Hockey) and SouthLand Sun-Dogs of San Diego and Del Mar, California (Solana Beach).|$|E

Of course, our method of dealing with that was Crow Dog should go take care of Spotted Tail's family, and if he didn't do that we'd banish him from the tribe. But that was considered too barbaric, and thought perhaps we should hang him like civilized people do, so they passed the Major Crimes Act that said we don't {{know how to handle}} murderers <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> show us." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation. He said, [...] "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." [...] He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving {{at the end of the}} third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, [...] "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> graduate eventually. I don't think I thought it was going to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming." [...] However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation does not mean that they will leave the show. Falchuk insisted that [...] "it was never our plan or our intention to let them go.... They are not done with the show after this season." ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning {{it was a lot of}} guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kinks' next single, [...] "Waterloo Sunset", was {{released}} in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to {{have been inspired by}} the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, [...] "It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> emigrate and go to another country." [...] Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for [...] "Waterloo Sunset" [...] lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: [...] "We {{spent a lot of time}} trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while." [...] The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Makers chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it [...] "the most beautiful song in the English language", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as [...] "possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era".|$|E

500|$|The {{next season}} Kennedy's {{juvenile}} team {{made it to}} the finals. During the season, Kennedy had scored seven goals in one game and six in another and it was efforts such as those which were attracting the attention of professional hockey people. The first team to approach Kennedy was the NHL's Montreal Canadiens, although for Kennedy [...] "It was a boyhood dream to play for Toronto." [...] Dinty Moore, also of Port Colborne, brought Kennedy to the attention Montreal General Manager Tommy Gorman and Kennedy was put on their negotiation list. In the fall of 1942, Montreal contacted the sixteen-year-old about joining the Canadiens. Kennedy's mother was wary of a career in hockey for her son as he was also headed towards studying business at the University of Western Ontario. She agreed to let her son attend the training camp when Montreal scout Dinty Moore assured her Ted was going to receive a good education at Montreal's prestigious Lower Canada College <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cover the cost. Upon arriving in Montreal, foreshadowing future troubles, Kennedy discovered there was no one from the Canadiens to greet him at the train. The teenager was left to his own devices to check into a hotel and make his way around the new city. Then later, as he tried to combine hockey and school, he became concerned his studies were suffering and approached Canadien management to ask if they could find him accommodation closer to the school. He felt they were unresponsive and he soon became disillusioned with the experience in Montreal. After three weeks in Montreal he was feeling homesick and upon completing spring training with the Montreal Royals, he returned to Port Colborne in mid-November.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{before the}} derailment, {{witnesses}} recalled observing the train {{passing through the}} crossing at an excessive speed with no locomotive lights, [...] "infernal" [...] noise and sparks being emitted from the wheels. Gilles Fluet, a Musi-Café patron who was leaving the site just before the derailment, said the wheels were smoking lots of white smoke. The runaway train passed [...] behind him moving at highway speed. Travelling with no signals, the train jumped the track, sending a river of burning oil into the lake. [...] "It was moving at a hellish speed ... no lights, no signals, nothing at all. There was no warning. It was a black blob {{that came out of}} nowhere. I realized they were oil tankers <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> blow up, so I yelled that to my friends and I got out of there.

David Steward, {{an employee of}} seven years, then posted on an office bulletin board the Dilbert strip of October 26, 2007 that compared management decisions to those of [...] "drunken lemurs". The casino called this [...] "very offensive"; they identified him from a surveillance tape, fired him, and tried {{to prevent him from}} receiving unemployment insurance benefits. However, an administrative law judge ruled in December 2007 that he would receive benefits, as his action was not intentional misbehavior. Scott Adams said that it might be the first confirmed case of an employee being fired for posting a Dilbert cartoon. On February 20, 2008, {{the first of a series}} of Dilbert strips showed Wally being caught posting a comic strip which [...] "compares managers to drunken lemurs". Adams later said that fans should stick to posting Garfield strips, as no one gets fired for that.|$|E

Despite being one of the heavier songs on the album, [...] "Falling Down" [...] received moderate airplay, leading to it initially being considered. Max Illidge stated in 2002 [...] "We could have made a video for it and maybe if the video was shocking enough it would have given us a bigger push, but London-Sire just decided to scrap [...] "Falling Down" [...] and go with [...] "Wither Away" [...] for the video. I mean we were literally going to leave in like a few days to shoot the video for ‘Wither Away" [...] — en route to LA — we had the plane tickets and the actresses schedules and just all that, and we were about three days away from the day of shooting and we got the phone call that we weren’t doing it <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> wait until early next year, but we knew that they were folding.
