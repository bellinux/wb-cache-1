40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>intervention</b> {{detection}} – {{an advanced}} computer-based tool – {{can be used}} to distinguish companies with fraudulent data from those with no indication of fraudulent reports. Financial managers, auditors, and fraud examiners are eager to find an automated, timely approach to discovering which publicly traded companies may be harboring financial frauds. Investors, corporate treasurers, and portfolio managers all want a dependable, automatic process to help them sift through voluminous financial data to find the few firms among hundreds that give investors bad information. Sadly, recent history includes many seemingly attractive investment opportunities that became worthless once fraud was discovered. Imagine, for example, the tasks of the investment operations manager of a university endowment who administers, say, $ 2 billion in investments. This individual is responsible for analyzing and understanding the performance of all the university's publicly traded, fixed income, and real estate investments. Of course, this individual would find audit reports useful, but they {{take a lot of time}} to review and are issued months after the company's books are closed. However, SEC filings and other financial information about these investments is available electronically and could be processed automatically long before the audit is completed. While an automatic process may not definitively identify which investments display fraudulent activity, the process could help the manager choose which investments should be studied more closely than the others. Among the almost endless variety of possible frauds that impact publicly held companies, many are perpetrated by altering the firm's financial records. These direct modifications are termed “interventions ” in the terminology of the “Box-Jenkins ” time series analysis. This article summarizes a study we conducted, which evaluated whether <b>automatic</b> <b>intervention</b> detection (AID) based on Box-Jenkins can be effectively used to distinguish companies with fraudulent reported data from those with no indication of fraudulent reports...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{development}} and prototypical realization of a driver assistance system {{with the purpose of}} predictive pedestrian protection. The system shall help the driver to avoid collisions with pedestrians by issuing a noticeable warning to the driver prior to a possible collision. If the driver fails to react to the warning and the criticality of the situation increases, the system will initiate an <b>automatic</b> braking <b>intervention</b> in order to prevent or mitigate the collision. One of the main challenges for the system is to correctly estimate the risk of an impending collision. For a successful driver warning it is necessary to issue the warning early enough, enabling the driver to react. Therefore, the time before the collision, at which the decision to warn the driver is made, has to be significantly longer than the reaction time of the driver (up to 2 s). Because of this comparatively long time span it is vital for the system to predict the possible movements of the pedestrian as accurately as possible. This also holds true for the <b>automatic</b> braking <b>intervention.</b> With a high assumption placed upon the movement capabilities of pedestrians, the decision for an automatic braking is not possible up to a few hundred milliseconds before the collision, rendering the benefit of the system comparatively small. Therefore, {{the first part of the}} thesis concentrates on the development of a situation analysis approach which considers the movement capabilities of pedestrians. The possible and relevant trajectories of pedestrians in typical accident scenarios are analyzed and contribute to the development of the pedestrian motion model. For this model, a test study is designed and conducted to measure the movement capabilities of different test persons in relevant situations. The results of the study are analyzed and integrated into the model. The prediction of the movement capabilities depends on the current velocity of the pedestrian, as well as the available time and direction of movement, which yields significant improvements of the results in the situation analysis. The results show that a decision for an <b>automatic</b> braking <b>intervention</b> based upon the prediction of an unavoidable collision can be made earlier which leads to a reduction in the collision velocity. The second part of the thesis analyzes the sensor system which is used to recognize pedestrians in front of the vehicle and the impact of this system's errors in the situation analysis. The prototypical realization of the system uses a stereo-vision system in order to detect pedestrians and to measure relevant data, for instance position and velocity of the pedestrian relative to the vehicle. The quality of this data is vital for the system to function, therefore, the implications of erroneous data are analyzed, and the requirements for the relevant input data are derived. For this purpose, a sensitivity analysis with a series of simulations is conducted. The artificial sensor data in the simulations is superimposed by artificial noise in order to determine the acceptable degree of noise for the system. The type of noise depends on the data and is derived from the analysis (theoretical as well as practical) of the stereo-vision system. The thesis is concluded by presenting the test-vehicle and an analysis of the system performance in 50 hours of test driving in urban areas...|$|R

40|$|Conversation is a {{critical}} element {{to the success of}} online communities, both for the communities as a whole and the individual members. Yet conversations often fail: Forty percent of potential thread-starting messages in Usenet groups receive no response. When this happens, those who are trying to get information, support, or discussion from a group receive no benefit from their efforts. This paper presents a multi-method series of studies into community responsiveness to two rhetorical strategies: self-disclosing introductions and making requests. Introductions signal legitimacy and commitment, and requests reduce community effort by making clear what is needed. An analysis of a longitudinal sample of 40, 931 messages from 99 Usenet groups shows that introductions referencing lurking and a personal connection to the topic of discussion increase the likelihood of getting a reply. So does making requests. Machine learning detects introductions and requests automatically within the text.

Forty participants {{were tested in}} a driving simulator and confronted with an inevitable collision. They performed a naïve drive and afterwards a repeated exposure {{in which they were}} told to hold the steering wheel loosely. In a third drive they experienced a false alarm situation. Data on driving behavior, i. e. steering and braking behavior as well as subjective data was assessed in the scenarios. Results showed that most participants held on to the steering wheel strongly or counter-steered during the system intervention during the first encounter. Moreover, subjective data collected after the first drive showed that the majority of drivers was not aware of the system intervention. Data from the repeated drive in which participants were instructed to hold the steering wheel loosely, led to significantly more participants holding the steering wheel loosely and thus complying with the instruction. This study seems to imply that without knowledge and information of the system about an upcoming intervention, the most prevalent driving behavior is a strong reaction with the steering wheel similar to an automatic steering reflex which decreases the system's effectiveness.

40|$|A Driver's Warning Assistant(DWA) {{differs from}} an {{automatic}} co-pilot by only presenting warning {{messages to the}} driver,instead of acting upon the vehicle or the environment. It {{is an open question}} whether combinations of both types of assistance system are feasible with <b>automatic</b> <b>intervention</b> if the driver has been warned without success, or if there is no chance for a warninq message leading to an appropriate action by the driver in due time. In this case difficult questions of task allocation and of responsibility have to be answered. The evaluation has begun and will continue with DWAs dedicated to special driving tasks, e. g. parking, lane keeping, overtaking, crossing. These DWAs have a competence limited to one of the driver's tasks, so that the driver can only expect support for this single task. In a car equipped with such a specialized DWA the driver has to learn the limits of the DWA's competence. Additionally, the case has to be considered in which a specialized DWA has limit ed competence for its task. This means that the support of a driver by the DWA is limited to a subset of all possible situations (e. g. to situations with good sight conditions). Under certain circumstances (e. g. hidden obstacles) the driver might not be supported. It has to be clarified whether this can be learned and will be accepted by the driver. A crucial topic {{in the development of a}} DWA is the timing of warning messages for the driver. The moment of warning on the one hand has to be chosen early enough to enable the driver to react appropriately. This means that the inevitable reaction time, which the driver needs to receive and process the DWA's message and to prepare a reaction, has to be considered. On the other hand the warning message should not be presented too early as this would annoy the driver and result in poor acceptance of the DWA. Therefore, it is important to integrate a time-budget analysis in the development phase and in the run-time version of a DWA, leading t...|$|E
40|$|Integrated {{electronic}} systems {{are more and}} more used in a wide number of applications and environments, ranging from mobile devices to safety-critical products. This wide distribution is mainly due to the miniaturization surrounded by an increasing computing power of semiconductor devices. However, there are many complex and arduous challenges associated to this phenomenon. One of these challenges is the reliability of {{electronic systems}}. Nowadays, several research e↵orts are aimed at improving the semiconductors reliability. Manufacturing processes, aging phenomena of components and environmental stress may cause internal permanent defects and damages during the lifetime of a device; in the other side, the environment in which these devices are employed could introduce soft errors (i. e., errors that do not damage the device but a data during the computation) in their internal circuitry, thus compromising the correct behavior of the whole system. Consequently, in order to guarantee product quality and consumer satisfaction, it is necessary to discover faults as soon as possible (both, in the manufacturing process and during the devices lifetime); moreover, it is equally important to provide the electronic systems with fault tolerance equipments aimed to assure a correct functioning in every condition. Despite the reliability requirements, modern electronic systems require also an increasing computational power to satisfy the customers needs. In order to face to this demand, {{in the last two decades}} di↵erent powerful computational devices have been designed and developed. They are mainly based on architectures allowing the execution of multiple computations in parallel at the same time. Among the others, the Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors are a particular type of multicore and reconfigurable processors; they have been developed to perform several operations in parallel, where the scheduling of the operations themselves is completely demanded at the compiler: VLIWs are suitable for systems requiring high computational performance maintaining a reduced power consumption. Another interesting type of multicore computational units are the General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) : their very high computational power, combined with low cost, reduced power consumption, and flexible development platforms are pushing their adoption not only for graphical applications, but also in the High Performance Computing (HPC) market and in embedded devices. Moreover, GPGPUs are increasingly used in some safety-critical embedded domains, such as automotive, avionics, space and biomedical. The main in common feature of VLIWs and GPGPUs is that they can be used in a System-on-Chip (SoC) as computational co-processors: in a typical SoC, in fact, the main Central Processing Unit (CPU) is in charge of demand and supervise the execution of data intensive operations to these architectures; in this way, the workload of the CPU itself is lower. As an example, in the NASA labs, VLIWs have been evaluated to efficiently perform image analysis on board a Mars rover for future space missions, while the main CPU of the system is available to perform other realtime control operations. In the other hand, the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) which are increasingly common in cars, uses GPGPUs or GPGPU-like devices to analyze images (or radar signals) coming from external cameras and sensors to detect possible obstacles, requiring the <b>automatic</b> <b>intervention</b> of the breaking system. In this PhD thesis, several new techniques have been developed with the common goal of improving the reliability characteristics of multicore processing units. More in particular, considering VLIW processors, new test and diagnostic methods have been studied and implemented in order to detect permanent faults; they are mainly based on the Software-Based Self-Test (SBST) technique. The final goal is to reduce the time required to perform the test of a generic VLIW processor, and to efficiently localize the faulty module. On the other hand, the present dissertation focus on the e↵ects introduced by soft errors in GPGPU devices; this works have been done through the execution of several neutron radiation tests. At the end of these analysis, new techniques finalized to the fault tolerance enhancement of GPGPU applications have been proposed. As industrial case, the validation of a programmable timing multicore co-processor module (i. e., the Generic Timer Module manufactured by Bosch) used in the today automotive Electronic Control Units (ECUs) has been designed and implemented. More in particular, an FPGA-based validation platform has been developed, where one of its main feature is the ability to efficiently verify the behavior of the module under test, thus ensuring a correct implementation of the software running on it. This work has been done in collaboration with General Motors Powertrain Europe (site of Torino, Italy...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the possibility}} of a procedure in one program to call a procedure in another program is a useful paradigm for developing distributed applications. However, in a distributed environment, programs should be allowed to be built and then changed in an independent manner, thus allowing inconsistent types to be declared in the expected and the actual remote procedure interface. If one cannot guarantee type consistency, the program executing the remote procedure would be vulnerable to invalid call requests. The paper describes how a persistent programming language can be used to implement an RPC mechanism that automatically supports type-safety. It is typesafe since the expected interface is checked against the actual remote procedure interface before a call is attempted and <b>automatic</b> because user <b>intervention</b> is only that needed otherwise (that is, to call a local procedure) ...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{arbitrage}} {{has been}} one of the major factors contributing to the severity of the crisis. Given the ever more complex set of future regulatory constraints, it may keep generating costly negative spillover effects on the whole economy. Moreover, rules-based regulation, however carefully constructed, will unfortunately never prevent bank failures. Neither should it attempt to do so. An effective overall regulatory regime must be sufficiently comprehensive and well-balanced. It must not put too much emphasis on lowering the probability of individual bank failure. The key components of an effective regulatory regime must be: Basel-type rules robust to off-balance-sheet arbitrage; little forbearance in monitoring and supervision by regulatory agencies, with a focus on systemic risk control; <b>automatic</b> and quick <b>intervention</b> as well as resolution mechanisms. While all components are necessary, none are sufficient; and without strong international coordination, none will be effective...|$|R

It is type-safe since the expected interface is checked against the actual remote procedure interface before a call is attempted, and <b>automatic</b> because user <b>intervention</b> is that already needed to call a normal local procedure. 1 Introduction A distributed application is usually composed of a number of programs communicating across a network. Remote procedure call (or RPC, for short) is a paradigm for providing high-level communication between these programs [3]. Using an RPC mechanism, a distributed application can have a procedure in a program calling a procedure in another (remote) program. In a distributed environment, one cannot assume that the types of the expected arguments will always match those of the actual remote procedure. Typechecking must be enforced in order to prevent programmers from making (even more) errors, particularly thos [...] ...|$|R
