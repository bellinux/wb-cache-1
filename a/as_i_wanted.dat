500|$|Ryan Brockington for the New York Post was {{critical}} of Hollywood Records decision to not include Rihanna and Brown's version on the soundtrack, writing [...] "the Pussycat Dolls are listed as the artist, and as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to believe it was}} a typo, I pressed play, and there was Nicole Scherzinger and her kittens singing away." [...] Brockington continued to express his distaste, writing [...] "Now I have to listen to some overproduced vocals by a pack of hyenas and their booty-slap noises." ...|$|E
500|$|Cotto's next {{scheduled}} {{match was}} against the then-undefeated Paul Malignaggi in a fight that took place on June 10, 2006 in Madison Square Garden. Cotto opened a cut over Malignaggi's right eye in the first round, which, according to Malignaggi, affected his performance {{over the course of}} the fight, by stating [...] "this was the first time in which I was cut, and the blood kept going into my eye. And it bothered me the entire fight. I was not able to see very well. Cotto's a great fighter, but I'm disappointed, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be the champion". Cotto won the fight by unanimous decision with scores of 116-111 and 115-112. Malignaggi suffered a fractured right orbital bone and his jaw was injured, he was taken to Roosevelt Hospital after the fight's outcome was announced.|$|E

500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall {{also had}} mixed comments, {{comparing}} the episode to House and stating, [...] "And yet {{as much as}} Veronica was annoying me, as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to yell at her for automatically jumping to conclusions with Weevil (more on that in a minute), this was maybe my favorite episode of the season. [...] Hell, they even had a cliffhanger ending to the mystery arc {{for the first time}} in forever. I dug it." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The Manfred Symphony {{would cost}} Tchaikovsky more time, effort and soul-searching than {{anything}} else he would write, even the Pathetique Symphony. It also became the longest, most complex work he had written up to that point, and though it owes an obvious debt to Berlioz due to its program, Tchaikovsky {{was still able to}} make the theme of Manfred his own. Near the end of seven months of intensive effort, in late September 1885, he wrote Balakirev, [...] "Never in my life, believe me, have I labored so long and hard, and felt so drained by my efforts. The Symphony is written in four movements, as per your program, although—forgive me—as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to, I {{have not been able to}} keep all the keys and modulations you suggested ... It is of course dedicated to you".|$|E
500|$|Stravinsky first {{conducted}} {{the work in}} 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he {{brought it to the}} Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that [...] "thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as [...] "the most important piece of music of the 20th century".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B+ {{and said that}} it [...] "isn't typically as heavy on the usual stock jokes that weigh the show down, and the adventures of Brian and Stewie drive more interest than most other characters." [...] Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.4 rating and called the episode and its sister episode, [...] "No Country Club for Old Men", [...] "a perfect representation of the wild extremes of this season." [...] He added [...] "it wasn't the funniest episode, but the way the parallel stories worked and intertwined was at least extremely interesting, lacking much of the lazy humor that at times plagued this season. Mark Trammell of TV Equals said [...] "All in all, an okay episode that benefited from the combination approach, but MacFarlane might want to retire both the time travel stuff and the [...] "road picture"-approach after this one, as the well is clearly running dry [...] To tell the truth, I didn't laugh as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to".|$|E
500|$|On his hiring, Baker explained, [...] "I did the Dino De Laurentiis {{version of}} King Kong in 1976 {{and was always}} {{disappointed}} because I wasn't {{able to do it}} as realistically <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted.</b> I thought Apes would {{be a good way to}} make up for that." [...] In addition to King Kong, Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on , , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's like going to the dentist at two in the morning and having people poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.|$|E
500|$|Bannon {{followed}} Odd Girl Out with I Am a Woman (In Love With a Woman — Must Society Reject Me?) in 1959. I Am a Woman (the {{working and}} common title) featured Laura after her affair with Beth, as {{she finds herself}} in New York City's Greenwich Village, and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack, and becomes his best friend. Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak, and a fascinating new character {{that proved to be}} her most popular of the series, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the description of a thoroughly butch lesbian. Beebo was smart, handsome, chivalrous, and virile. Once again based on what Bannon knew, Beebo was nearly [...] tall with a husky voice and a formidable physique. The personality however, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist. After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding anyone like her, Bannon instead created her. She remembered, [...] "I put Beebo together just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> her, in my heart and mind... She was just, quite literally, the butch of my dreams." [...] The resolution to I Am a Woman completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians.|$|E

The film, directed and produced by his father, centers on his character Rohit Mehra, a developmentally disabled young man, who comes in contact with an extraterrestrial being—a role that required him to lose nearly [...] Roshan recalls the experience of starring in the film fondly: [...] "I could live my childhood [...] I could eat as many chocolates <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted.</b> I became a baby and everybody was so caring towards me." [...] In the book Film Sequels, Carolyn Jess-Cooke drew similarities between the character and Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks in the titular film, but this idea was dismissed by Roshan. Film critics were polarised on {{their view of the}} film—some of them negatively compared its storyline to the 1982 Hollywood release E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial—but were unanimous in their praise for Roshan. In a 2010 retrospective of the Top 80 Iconic Performances of Bollywood, Filmfare noted [...] "how flesh and blood Hrithik's act is. Simply because he believes he is the part. Watch him laugh, cry or bond with his remote controlled alien friend and note his nuanced turn." [...] A Rediff.com critic agreed that Roshan was [...] "the turbojet that propels the film to the realm of the extraordinary". Koi... Mil Gaya was the most popular Bollywood film of the year, earning , and Roshan won both Filmfare Awards for Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics).|$|E
500|$|Among {{the more}} hostile press reviews {{was that of}} Le Figaros critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work [...] "a {{laborious}} and puerile barbarity" [...] and added [...] "We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely [...] "a rowdy debate" [...] between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: [...] "Couldn't we ask M. Astruc... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators?... We could at least propose to evict the female element". The composer Alfredo Casella thought that the demonstrations were aimed at Nijinsky's choreography {{rather than at the}} music, a view shared by the critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, who wrote: [...] "The idea was excellent, but was not successfully carried out". Calvocoressi failed to observe any direct hostility to the composer—unlike, he said, the premiere of Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902. Of later reports that the veteran composer Camille Saint-Saëns had stormed out of the premiere, Stravinsky observed that this was impossible; Saint-Saëns did not attend. Stravinsky also rejected Cocteau's story that, after the performance, Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Diaghilev and Cocteau himself took a cab to the Bois de Boulogne where a tearful Diaghilev recited poems by Pushkin. Stravinsky merely recalled a celebratory dinner with Diaghilev and Nijinsky, at which the impresario expressed his entire satisfaction with the outcome. To Maximilien Steinberg, a former fellow-pupil under Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky wrote that Nijinsky's choreography had been [...] "incomparable: {{with the exception of a}} few places, everything was <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it".|$|E

When interviewed at Gamescom 2009, Kojima stated that he got more involved with Peace Walker because, [...] "there was a lot of confusion within the team and it didn't proceed <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to. Therefore I thought that I needed to jump in and do Peace Walker".|$|E
2500|$|Cassatt admired Degas, whose pastels {{had made}} a {{powerful}} impression on her when she encountered them in an art dealer's window in 1875. [...] "I used to go and flatten my nose against that window and absorb all I could of his art," [...] she later recalled. [...] "It changed my life. I saw art then <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to see it." [...] She accepted Degas' invitation with enthusiasm, and began preparing paintings for the next Impressionist show, planned for 1878, which (after a postponement because of the World's Fair) took place on April 10, 1879. She felt comfortable with the Impressionists and joined their cause enthusiastically, declaring: [...] "we are carrying on a despairing fight & need all our forces". Unable to attend cafes with them without attracting unfavorable attention, she met with them privately and at exhibitions. She now hoped for commercial success selling paintings to the sophisticated Parisians who preferred the avant-garde. Her style had gained a new spontaneity during the intervening two years. Previously a studio-bound artist, she had adopted the practice of carrying a sketchbook with her while out-of-doors or at the theater, and recording the scenes she saw.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{original}} album's lukewarm sales and reception, Rowland re-entered recording studios to collect new songs for a reissue of Ms. Kelly, including production by Stargate, Jeff Dawson, CKB and Mark Feist. She was {{also expected to}} record with producer Danja, but deadline pressure prevented from happening; a new track by J. R. Rotem {{did not make the}} final cut. [...] "The sales weren't as good <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> them to be and to be honest, I did feel sad about that for a little while", Rowland stated in 2008, still blaming the final track listing for too many midtempos and ballads. [...] "I didn't realize it while I was recording it. After it was released [...] many fans said the songs would rock if they were more upbeat." [...] Branded with the title Ms. Kelly: Diva Deluxe, the United States re-release received a digital download release only on March 25, 2008, containing seven tracks — five new songs and two remixes of songs found from the standard edition of the album. The international edition of the Ms. Kelly re-release was released physically and digitally in May 2008, retitled as Ms. Kelly: Deluxe Edition. It removed eight tracks from {{the original}} release and replaced them with six of the seven Diva Deluxe tracks, as Rowland [...] "wanted to have another view on the record and close the Ms. Kelly chapter" [...] with the re-release. Previously unreleased song [...] "Daylight", a Bobby Womack cover and collaboration with Travie McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, served as the reissue's new lead single.|$|E
