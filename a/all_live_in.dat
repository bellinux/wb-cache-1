A Hobbit surname often indicates where the family came from: Samwise Gamgee's last name derives from Gamwich, where the family originated. Buckland was named for the Oldbucks (later called the Brandybucks).|$|E
25|$|Dark-skinned populations inhabiting South Asia, Africa, Melanesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia <b>all</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> some of {{the areas}} with the highest UV {{radiation}} in the world, and have evolved very dark skin pigmentations as protection from the harmful sun rays. Evolution has restricted humans with darker skin in tropical latitudes, especially in non-forested regions, where ultraviolet radiation from the sun is usually the most intense. Different dark-skinned populations are not necessarily closely related genetically. Before the modern mass migration, {{it has been argued}} that the majority of dark pigmented people lived within 20° of the equator.|$|E

500|$|To {{obtain a}} rating for a game, a {{publisher}} submits a detailed questionnaire and a DVD containing {{footage of the}} most graphic and extreme content found in the game to the ESRB, including content related to the game's context, storyline, reward system, unlockable and otherwise [...] "hidden" [...] content, and other elements that may affect its rating. They may also provide printed copies of the game's script and lyrics from songs in the game. The footage is reviewed {{by a team of}} at least three raters, who discuss what the most appropriate and [...] "helpful" [...] rating for the game would be, based on the footage and details provided. Raters represent various demographics, including parents, along with casual and [...] "hardcore" [...] gamers. Raters were formerly hired on a part-time basis, but in 2007, ESRB transitioned to a team of seven full-time raters, who <b>all</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the New York City area.|$|E
500|$|According to Jacobs, [...] "Ralph, Captain Corcoran, Sir Joseph and Josephine <b>all</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> their {{interactive}} music (particularly 'Never {{mind the}} why and wherefore'), {{and almost as}} much musical resource is lavished on two characters parodied from opera or melodrama, Little Buttercup with 'gypsy blood in her veins' and the heavy-treading Dick Deadeye." [...] Jacobs also opined that the leading tone that begins [...] "Never mind the why and wherefore" [...] "serves to emphasize the phrase like a Johann Strauss-ian grace-note". The Sullivan scholar David Russell Hulme noted Sullivan's parody of operatic styles, [...] "particularly the Handelian recitatives and the elopement scene (evocative of so many nocturnal operatic conspiracies), but best {{of all is the}} travesty of the patriotic tune in 'For he is an Englishman!'" [...] Buttercup's Act II song, in which she reveals the dark secret of the baby-switching is preceded by a quote from Franz Schubert's [...] "The Erl-King" [...] and also parodies the opera Il Trovatore. Jacobs notes that Sullivan also adds his own humorous touches to the music by setting commonplace expressions in [...] "Donizettian recitative". But on the serious side, he enhances the moments of true emotional climax, as in Josephine's Act II aria, and added musical interest to concerted numbers by [...] "subtly shifting the rhythms and bar groupings." ...|$|E
500|$|McFeely {{said the}} writing process began {{in the middle of}} 2011, around the release of The First Avenger, with him and Markus [...] "noodling on in hopes {{that there would be a}} second one and we did a lot of just {{throwing}} stuff at the wall and seeing what stuck". The first few months of writing were a back and forth process with Marvel, but after an outline was finished, the story did not change much. They opted to set the story in the present day, and, after [...] "experimenting with flashback elements for more period World War II stuff", decided to abandon the flashbacks as [...] "it became unwieldy." [...] The film would be [...] "Cap versus the world we <b>all</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> today", while averting excessive comedy regarding the hero's time displacement, as Markus considered the Captain [...] "the most adaptive man on the planet." [...] The tone would be more grounded in reality despite the advanced technology to contrast the fantasy elements from both the first Captain America and The Avengers. Despite that, the comic book origins guaranteed that the film would not have verisimilitude. This still proved a challenge in the reveal of Arnim Zola, that had to be extensively rewritten to convey how [...] "this grounded espionage paranoid thriller suddenly screeches to a halt and you switch gears really quickly with this ghost in the machine" [...] that introduces more science fiction elements.|$|E
