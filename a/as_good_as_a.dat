5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision {{that is at}} least <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors {{that are responsible for}} extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision at least <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors {{that form the}} lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds {{in a variety of}} ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E

500|$|Blyton's {{depictions of}} boys and girls are {{considered}} by many critics to be sexist. In a Guardian article published in 2005 Lucy Mangan proposed that The Famous Five series depicts a power struggle between Julian, Dick and George (Georgina), in which the female characters either act like boys or are talked down to, as when Dick lectures George: [...] "it's really time you gave up thinking you're <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> boy".|$|E

500|$|After {{learning}} of the murder, the Kentucky General Assembly authorized the governor to offer a reward of $3,000 for the arrest and conviction of Sharp's killer. The trustees {{of the city of}} Frankfort added a reward of $1,000, and friends of Sharp raised an additional $2,000 reward. Suspicion for the killing rested on three men: Beauchamp, Waring, and Patrick H. Darby. During Sharp's 1824 campaign for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives, Darby had remarked that, should Sharp be elected, [...] "he would never take his seat and would be <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dead man". Waring had made similar threats, boasting that he had already stabbed six men.|$|E
500|$|Nibali {{said after}} the race that his victory in Il Lombardia made his {{expulsion}} from the Vuelta a [...] "good thing" [...] as it helped him find some anger. He {{went on to say}} that his success had got his season back on track, particularly as he was the first Italian to win one of the Monuments in a long time. The last Italian to win any of the cycling Monuments was Damiano Cunego in the 2008 Giro di Lombardia. Nibali described the victory as being <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> win in Liège–Bastogne–Liège; he said also that, despite the risks he took on the descent from the Civiglio, Peter Sagan was [...] "crazier" [...] than him when descending.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal then {{travelled}} to the Reebok Stadium to play Bolton on 20 December 2003, {{the setting}} where their title challenge faltered eight months ago. Although they again picked {{up just a}} point, Wenger believed it was a useful one: [...] "Provided Bolton keep playing like that, we will look back at this result and feel very happy. They are <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> team as we have played." [...] On Boxing Day, Henry scored twice for Arsenal in a 3–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three days later, the team played Southampton. The only goal of the match came in the first half: Henry's through pass found Pirès [...] "who slid the ball beneath the exposed Antti Niemi". The win meant Arsenal had gone half the season without losing and the team according to The Times had begun to [...] "establish an aura of invincibility". Arsenal ended the calendar year in second place, with 45 points from 19 matches. They were one point behind leaders Manchester United and three ahead of Chelsea.|$|E

500|$|The tammar has 324° {{peripheral}} vision and 50° binocular vision. It can distinguish black/white gratings of different widths {{and in different}} light conditions better than most other small mammals, such as rabbits. It is nevertheless not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cat or a human. Tammars appear to have some colour vision: [...] its eyes have only blue sensitive and green sensitive photoreceptor cones, allowing it to see colour in the blue-green band of the colour spectrum, but not the longer wavelengths of the red-yellow band. Nevertheless, in the band where it can see colour, it can differentiate between two monochromatic colours with wavelengths as close as [...] apart. The pinna (ear) of the tammar is mobile, allowing it to track sounds {{from different parts of}} its surroundings without moving its head. A tammar can point its pinna at a sound source and increase its eardrum's sound pressure by 25–30 dB at 5kHz. When the pinna moves away from the sound source, the animal's hearing level quickly drops. When born, a tammar's sense of smell is already developed; this allows the newborn to find its mother's pouch by the scent.|$|E
500|$|Evans' process {{involved}} {{a number of}} steps. First, the line drawing of an illustration was photographed and printed onto block while the line drawing was engraved. Proofs of the key block were coloured by the illustrator; Evans would then [...] "determine the sequencing and register...to arrive at a close reproduction of the artist's original". Blocks were painted and engraved; one for each colour. A proof of each colour block was made before a final proof from the key block. [...] Ideally, the proof would be a faithful reproduction of the original drawing, but Evans believed a print was never <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> drawing. He took care to grind and mix his inks so they closely emulated the original. Finally, each block was placed so as to allow the individual colours to print on the page exactly as intended. Aware of costs and printing efficiencies, he used as few colours as possible. Illustrations were produced with a base of black, along {{with one or two}} colours and a flesh tone for faces and hands. In some cases, Evans may have used as few as four colour blocks: likely black, flesh and two primary colours; the addition of yellow allowed him a greater range. Each colour was printed from a separately engraved block; there were often between five or ten blocks. The chief problem was to maintain correct register, achieved by placing small holes in precise positions on each block to which the paper was pinned. If done correctly, the register of colours match, although sometimes ink squash is visible along the edges of an illustration.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, {{the pilot was}} viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Diana Steenbergen of IGN, who was [...] "hooked right away", gave the pilot episode a score of 8.5 out of 10. She felt it began [...] "heartbreakingly", and the [...] "genuinely scary" [...] death scenes of Mary and Jess [...] "will haunt...the viewers". Steenbergen praised both the writers and the lead actors for making the [...] " [...] still feel natural, for the most part", and noted Ackles and Padalecki were [...] "instantly convincing as brothers". Also credited for this [...] "well paced" [...] episode was director David Nutter, who did an [...] "excellent job of setting up the atmosphere and tone of the series". Likewise, BuddyTV's Don Williams posited, [...] "It's about <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pilot can get." [...] He ranked it ninth out of his favorite episodes {{of the first three}} seasons, believing it introduces the characters [...] "in a memorable fashion" [...] and [...] "wonderfully" [...] establishes the show's universe. Robert Bianco of USA Today deemed the series as possibly [...] "the simplest and the scariest" [...] of the season's new dark shows, and wrote, [...] "It wants nothing more than to frighten you — and tonight, it does." [...] He noted the episode [...] " [...] off a few surprises" [...] and [...] "works its way to an ending that lives up to Dean's 'no chick-flick moments'". However, Bianco criticized the [...] "pauses for comic relief"; he felt Ackles' [...] "comic touch" [...] was [...] "not yet as skillful as it needs to be", with Ackles' attempts at being [...] "humorously annoying" [...] leaving him [...] "simply annoying". Despite the episode having a somewhat unoriginal villain and a [...] "relatively simple" [...] solution, Brian Lowry of Variety deemed the series' debut as [...] "a promising plunge into the darkness". Lowry applauded Ackles, who [...] "brings an easygoing charm and engaging wise-ass personality to the absurd notion of traveling the country with a trunk full of wooden stakes and holy water".|$|E
