5|$|Muammar Gaddafi was <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> devastating {{counter-attack}} on Libya and {{the ensuing}} defeat at the Battle of Maaten al-Sarra. Forced to accede to a ceasefire, the defeat ended his expansionist projects toward Chad and his dreams of African and Arab dominance.|$|E

The block was lifted on March 21.|$|R
50|$|The {{programme}} was {{met with}} <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Greek public, leading to protests, riots and social unrest. On 5 May 2010, a national strike was held in opposition.

5|$|<b>Angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French surrender, {{and unhappy}} with British {{policies}} that affected them, an Ottawa chief named Pontiac organized 18 Native American tribes that attacked British {{military and civilian}} settlements beginning in April 1763. The tribes captured eight British forts and forced the evacuation of two more. General Amherst ordered the 17th to Albany in June 1763 to assist in combating the outbreak of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|By early 1943, {{the ship}} had been {{sufficiently}} repaired to begin the conversion process, but Hitler, <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> failure of German surface raiders at the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 ordered the cessation of all work. Gneisenau was disarmed and her 28cm and 15cm gun turrets were used in shore batteries. Turret Caesar was installed in a coastal fortress in Trondheim as the coastal battery Orlandet.|$|E
5|$|Raiden's debut role as {{the protagonist}} of Metal Gear Solid 2 was controversial, however, due to his {{unexpected}} substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics have defended the character, stating that fans were merely <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been highly praised for his role and Metal Gear Solid 4 redesign and even more for his role and design in Revengeance.|$|E

50|$|The contestants are {{informed}} of a twist—the {{men and women}} who had not been chosen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> trainers in the first episode have been training at home and the man and woman with the highest percentage of weight loss will be returning to the ranch. This is greeted with <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contestants who have been on the ranch.|$|R
50|$|In France Narbonne {{failed to}} carry the king or his colleagues along with him. The king took courage to dismiss him on 9 March 1792, whereupon the Legislative Assembly testified its {{confidence}} in Narbonne.

5|$|In June 1964, {{during a}} {{performance}} at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke {{the head of his}} guitar on the low ceiling of the stage. <b>Angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who's live set.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{supported}} the king during the Becket controversy between {{the king and}} Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury and was excommunicated by the archbishop twice. One excommunication occurred when Neville imprisoned one of Becket's chaplains, William of Salisbury, for six months in Corfe Castle in connection with Becket's actions against the king. Neville was absolved from this excommunication by Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, after Neville decided to go on crusade. Becket was <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bishop's action, even though Foliot made the absolution contingent on Neville getting a penance from the pope {{on his way to}} the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Some royal advisers, {{who were}} <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> trust the king placed in Rosenberg, {{regarded}} him with suspicion. For example, Walter M. Gibson, the Prime Minister of Hawaii, noted that King Kalākaua withheld {{most of the}} specific details of his conversations with Rosenberg from him. Kalākaua's autocracy and nativism, along with allegations of his corruption, convinced a powerful group of western businessmen and children of Christian missionaries that action should be taken against the king. This led to the June 1887 Constitution, which stripped Kalākaua of much of his power and significantly weakened the Hawaiian monarchy.|$|E
50|$|The {{commentary}} {{mentions that}} views, doubt, attachment to rites and rituals, jealousy and greed are thrown {{off at the}} first stage of Awakening (sotāpatti); gross sensual lust and <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> second stage (sakadāgāmitā) and even subtle forms of <b>the</b> same <b>by</b> <b>the</b> third stage (anāgāmitā); and conceit, lust for existence and ignorance <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fourth and final stage (arahatta).|$|R
50|$|The Greek government-debt crisis {{brought a}} package of {{austerity}} measures, put forth <b>by</b> <b>the</b> EU and the IMF; it was met with great <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Greek public, leading to riots and social unrest. On 27 June 2011, trade union organizations began a 48-hour labour strike in advance of a parliamentary vote on the austerity package, the first such strike since 1974.|$|R
25|$|The board, perhaps panicked {{into action}} {{by a lack}} of {{immediate}} success and disturbed by rumours of player indiscipline, sacked Mortensen. Their decision was met with a mixture of shock and <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Blackpool faithful, as Mortensen was as popular a manager as he was a player. Former Seasiders skipper Harry Johnston stepped in for the few remaining games of the campaign.|$|R
5|$|The Springfield townspeople, <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> new laws, {{surround}} the intellectuals in an angry mob and {{bring an end}} to Mensa's rule. Stephen Hawking has shown up to see what the Mensa group is up to and makes it clear he is unimpressed; however, he saves Lisa from being seriously injured by the angry townspeople. In the end, Hawking and Homer meet at Moe's Tavern for a drink. Homer imitates Hawking in an attempt to make him pay the tab and gets punched by a boxing glove on a spring, which is concealed in Hawking's wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} on April Fools' Day as Homer is playing pranks on Bart {{throughout}} the day. Bart, <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> numerous tricks he has fallen for, {{attempts to get}} revenge by shaking up a beer in a paint shaker. When Homer opens the beer, it results in a massive explosion that puts him in the hospital, paralyzed {{and placed in a}} wheelchair. While everyone waits for Homer to get well, the family remembers surviving similar hardships, shown in the form of clips from past episodes.|$|E
5|$|Throughout mid-1835, {{both governments}} {{continued}} their practice of one-upmanship, and constant skirmishes and arrests occurred. Citizens of Monroe County joined {{together in a}} posse to make arrests in Toledo. Partisans from Ohio, <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> harassment, targeted the offenders with criminal prosecutions. Lawsuits were not only rampant, they served {{as a basis for}} retaliatory lawsuits from the opposite side. Partisans from both sides organized spying parties {{to keep track of the}} sheriffs of Wood County, Ohio and Monroe County, Michigan who were entrusted with the security of the border.|$|E
5000|$|The murder {{became a}} {{sensation}} in the London press. At the trial Prince {{was found guilty}} but insane and sent to Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, where he died in 1936. His relatively mild sentence was met with <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> theatrical community, and Sir Henry Irving was later {{quoted as saying that}} [...] "Terriss was an actor, so his murderer will not be executed." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{financial}} crisis - particularly the austerity package put forth <b>by</b> <b>the</b> EU and the IMF - has been met with <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Greek public, leading to riots and social unrest, while {{there have been}} theories {{about the effect of}} international media. Despite - others say because of - the long range of austerity measures, the government deficit has not been reduced accordingly, mainly, according to many economists, because of the subsequent recession.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "fury" [...] denotes {{a type of}} <b>anger,</b> {{inspired}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Furies, mythological {{creatures in}} Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman mythology.|$|R
5|$|Woodfull {{told the}} Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce's leg side bowling was repeated, his men {{would leave the}} field and return to London. He further said that Australia would {{not return to the}} county in future. The {{following}} day, Voce was absent, ostensibly due to a leg injury. Already <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> absence of Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day. Australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the Tests.|$|E
5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (and McCain) would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E
5|$|Daenerys Targaryen {{attempts}} to convince Khal Drogo {{to return to}} her homeland and reclaim the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, but he is not interested. While Daenerys and her entourage go sightseeing at a market, Ser Jorah Mormont receives a pardon for him to return to the Seven Kingdoms from an informant of Lord Varys. Jorah realizes this means the order to assassinate Daenerys has been officially issued and quickly saves her from a wine merchant who tries to poison her. Drogo, <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> attempt on his wife's life, vows to his followers that he will lead his people to cross the Narrow Sea to invade the Seven Kingdoms as revenge and reclaim the Iron Throne for his unborn son.|$|E

5000|$|Prime Minister Mohamed's {{resignation}} {{was immediately}} met with <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> general public and many lawmakers. Apprehension regarding a possible resurgence of governmental corruption and lassitude, long-standing problems which Mohamed's administration had made significant strides toward eradicating, were cited as primary {{reasons for the}} consternation. According to one legislator, many policy-makers are trying to repeal the Kampala decision, as it also [...] "subjects the country to trusteeship". Another MP indicated that [...] "lawmakers are united in {{their opposition to the}} deal" [...] and [...] "will object to it until we throw it away".|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the other}} hand, to retire {{now would be}} to leave the whole Soudan {{in the hands of}} the Mahdi and his fanatics. It would mean the {{destruction}} of the settled government established <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Egyptians, and it would expose Egypt to incessant invasions, which we should be bound to repel. Common sense, humanity, and even economy seemed to favour the advance of the force to Khartoum. The British people, roused to <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fate of Gordon, would probably call loudly for the vindication of the national honour, and for an act of retribution on the murderers of Gordon.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the plans}} for Tracy and Jenna, Jack tells Liz—the head writer for TGS—to begin searching for a new cast member to help lessen this elitist image. Liz {{recruits}} TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to help in her search, planning trips to comedy clubs to find new talent. Both agree {{to try to keep}} the process secret from the cast and crew for fear that they would be angered over the idea of a new actor joining the cast. Liz and Pete give awkward answers trying to explain why they are going places together and ultimately tell the TGS writing staff. They also inadvertently tell Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) who, <b>angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news, quits the show.|$|E
5|$|During one leg of {{the return}} trip, the men were stopped by the Hukbalahap, Filipino Communist guerrillas who hated both the Americans and the Japanese. They were also rivals to Pajota's men. One of Pajota's lieutenants conferred with the Hukbalahap and {{returned}} to tell Mucci {{that they were not}} allowed to pass through the village. <b>Angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> message, Mucci sent the lieutenant back to insist that pursuing Japanese forces would be coming. The lieutenant came back and told Mucci that only Americans could pass, and Pajota's men had to stay. Both the Rangers and guerrillas were finally allowed through after an agitated Mucci told the lieutenant that he would call in an artillery barrage and level the whole village. In fact, Mucci's radio was not working at that point.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{the hunger}} strike {{was added to}} the WSPU's {{repertoire}} of resistance. On 24 June Marion Wallace Dunlop was arrested for writing an excerpt from the Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) on a wall in the House of Commons. <b>Angered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> conditions of the jail, Dunlop went on a hunger strike. When it proved effective, fourteen women imprisoned for smashing windows began to fast. WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration. Prison authorities frequently force-fed the women, using tubes inserted through the nose or mouth. The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.|$|E

50|$|After his appointment, Jacques de Châtillon entered Bruges. His recklessness, <b>the</b> extortions <b>by</b> his civil {{servants}} and the provocative visit of King Philip to Bruges in May 1301, at which occasion the French party held huge feasts {{which appeared to}} frivolously spend the funds expropriated from the commoners, resulted in <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> popular party. A number of popular movements erupted, such as in Bruges, where on 19 May 1302, the French party was murdered at the Brugse Metten. De Châtillon escaped with his life, but died {{a few months later}} at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in July 1302.|$|R
50|$|Back in Skala, Hâzadriën heals him and {{he announces}} that he will leave Alec alone as he doesn't believe he'll let himself be caught once again. This is {{received}} with <b>anger</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> retha'noi who resolve to destroy Sebrahn, which they call an abomination. He calls upon the owls, who blind the retha'noi archers while Sebrahn himself kills the witches. In the aftermath, Alec understands {{that he has to}} give up Sebrahn as he cannot care for {{him and he}} seems to need the presence of the other tayan'gil. They return to Rhíminee, and resume their Watcher lives.|$|R
