The inaccuracy of flight parameters and the sensor specific appearance of objects are the difficulties automatic registration suffers from.

The next {{generation}} of small satellites will require significant onboard data processing and information extraction capabilities {{to keep up with}} industry demands. The need for value added information products is growing as accessibility and user education is improving. Image geo-referencing is one of the image processing steps needed to transform raw images into usable information. Automating this process would result in a vast improvement in processing time and cost. As part of the background study, the imaging process is described and a model of the process is created. The sources of distortion that are present in the imaging process are described and techniques to compensate for them are discussed. One method that stands out is using wavelet analysis for the precision geo- referencing of images. Wavelets are used in this thesis for <b>automatic</b> ground <b>control</b> <b>point</b> identification.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} water {{resource}} management problems faced from an <b>Automatic</b> <b>Control</b> <b>point</b> of view. The {{motivation for the}} study {{is the need for}} an automated management policy for an artificial reservoir (dam). Two problems are addressed in the article: the control of the dam gate, that is a typical control problem, and the definition of the water flow to supply to the user, that is a decision problem. In particular, a mathematical model of the reservoir is deduced, and a PID controller with fuzzy (nonlinear) gains is designed to operate the dam gate. Moreover, a hybrid model of the reservoir is considered and implemented in Stateflow/Simulink, and a second fuzzy decision mechanism is implemented in order to produce different water release strategies. A new cost functional is proposed, able to weight user’s desiderata (in terms of water demand) with water waste (in terms of water spills). The parameters of the fuzzy system are optimized by employing Genetic Algorithms, which have proved very effective due to the strong nonlinearity of the problem. Copyright c© 2005 IFAC...|$|R

In the <b>automatic</b> ground <b>control</b> <b>points</b> (GCPs) extraction sub-module a two-step algorithm that utilizes vector roads as a reference layer and delivers GCPs for high resolution RapidEye images with near pixel accuracy was initially implemented.
