500|$|The <b>artificial</b> <b>propagation</b> of American {{paddlefish}} {{began with}} {{the efforts of the}} Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s, and focused primarily on maintenance of the sport fishery. [...] However, it was the growing importance of American paddlefish for their meat and roe that became the catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in the United States. [...] <b>Artificial</b> <b>propagation</b> requires broodstock which, because of the late sexual maturation of American paddlefish, are initially obtained from the wild and brought into a hatchery environment. [...] The fish are injected with LH-RH hormone to stimulate spawning. [...] The number of eggs a female may produce depends {{on the size of the}} fish and can range anywhere from 70,000–300,000 eggs. [...] Unlike most teleosts, the oviduct branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the ovaries; rather, they open dorsally into the body cavity. [...] To determine the status of progression toward maturation, ova staging is performed. [...] The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample oocytes. [...] The oocytes are boiled in water for a few minutes until the yolk is hardened, and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus. [...] The exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity.|$|E
2500|$|Oncorhynchus clarki {{cutthroat}} trout have declined {{in their native}} ranges. [...] Many local populations or distinct population segments of anadromous forms of steelhead have declined in their native ranges. [...] The resulting declines {{have resulted in a}} number of populations of Oncorhynchus species or subspecies being listed as either endangered, threatened or as [...] "Species of Special Concern" [...] by state, federal or international authorities. [...] Two Oncorhynchus clarki subspecies are considered extinct. [...] Declines are attributed {{to a wide variety of}} causes—over fishing, habitat loss and degradation, <b>artificial</b> <b>propagation,</b> stocking, and hybridization with or competition with introduced, non-native species. [...] For example, [...] the Yellowfin {{cutthroat trout}} (Oncorhynchus clarki macdonaldi) is extinct as a result of the introduction of non-native rainbow trout into its native waters.|$|E
2500|$|In {{biological}} research, chimeras are artificially {{produced by}} selectively transplanting embryonic cells from one organism onto the embryo of another, {{and allowing the}} resultant blastocyst to develop. Chimeras are not hybrids, which form from the fusion of gametes from two species that form a single zygote with a combined genetic makeup. [...] Nor are they Hybridomas which, as with hybrids, result from fusion of two species' cells into a single cell and <b>artificial</b> <b>propagation</b> of this cell in the laboratory. Essentially, in a chimera, each cell is from either of the parent species, whereas in a hybrid and hybridoma, each cell is derived from both parent species. [...] "Chimera" [...] is a broad term and is often applied to many different mechanisms of the mixing of cells from two different species.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Simulation {{method is}} a method of {{learning}} that can create a conducive learning atmosphere. The learning method {{is an important factor}} in improving student’s learning outcomes for all subjects, particularly on the subjects of Natural Sciences (IPA). The use of methods that do not comply with the purpose of teaching would be an obstacle in achieving the goal. Therefore, this study looked at and determined whether there was an influence between the applications of simulation methods to the learning outcomes of students in science subjects of <b>artificial</b> vegetative <b>propagation</b> in MI Pangeran Aji East OKU. Besides. The study was also aimed at finding out whether those factors support or inhibit the application of simulation methods of <b>artificial</b> vegetative <b>propagation</b> in improving student learning outcomes in science subjects in MI Pangeran Aji East OKU. This study used an experimental method, with data analysis by using product moment correlation. The final conclusion is that there was a significant relationship between the application of simulation methods to the learning outcomes of students in science subjects of <b>artificial</b> vegetative <b>propagation</b> as seen in the result where r t is smaller than r o;  0. 374 0. 478. By its antecedents, which does not require a large fee, students interest in learning was more increased. Moreover, teachers could assess the interaction of learning in groups. Whereas, the inhibiting factor was the high motivation of the students to make students communicate with friends so that they can exchange knowledge, the time required seemed slightly.   Keywords: Simulation m ethods, Learning a chievement, Science l esson </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This {{manuscript}} {{considers a}} new architecture to handwritten characters recognition based on simulation {{of the behavior}} of one type of artificial neural network, called the Error Back <b>Propagation</b> <b>Artificial</b> Neural Network (EBPANN). We present an overview of our neural network to be optimized and tested on 12 offline isolated Arabic handwritten characters (ي،و،م،ك،ف،غ،ط،ش ، ذ،ج,ت,ا) because the similarity of some Arabic characters and the location of the points in the character. Accuracy of 93. 61 % is achieved using EBPANN which is the highest accuracy achieved during Offline Handwritten Arabic Character Recognition. It is noted that the EBPANN in general generates an optimized comparison between the input samples and database samples which improves the final recognition rate. Experimental results show that the EBPANN is convergent and more accurate in solutions that minimize the error recognition rate.
