5|$|Polonium was {{discovered}} in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie, when it was extracted from uranium ore and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: {{it was the first}} element to be so discovered. Polonium was named after Marie Curie's homeland of Poland. Polonium has few applications, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> related to its radioactivity: heaters in space probes, antistatic devices, and sources of neutrons and alpha particles. Polonium's intense radioactivity makes it dangerously toxic.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Carr {{requested}} a doctor for Williams, as he was feeling {{the combination of the}} chloral hydrate and alcohol he had drunk on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville. Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was coughing and hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> believed to be his last words. Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized that Williams was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} unique {{homomorphism}} from the two-element Boolean algebra 2 to every Boolean algebra, since homomorphisms must preserve the two constants <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> the only elements of 2. A Boolean algebra with this property is called an initial Boolean algebra. It {{can be shown}} that any two initial Boolean algebras are isomorphic, so up to isomorphism 2 is the initial Boolean algebra.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{situations}} when {{an inferior}} vena cava filter is considered advantageous, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> if anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated (e.g. shortly after a major operation), {{or a person}} has a pulmonary embolus in spite of being anticoagulated. In these instances, it may be implanted to prevent new or existing DVTs from entering the pulmonary artery and combining with an existing blockage. In spite of the device's theoretical advantage of preventing pulmonary emboli, {{there is a lack}} of evidence supporting its effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|The {{solutions}} of the Einstein field equations are metrics of spacetime. These metrics {{describe the}} structure of the spacetime including the inertial motion of objects in the spacetime. As the field equations are non-linear, they cannot always be completely solved (i.e. without making approximations). For example, there is no known complete solution for a spacetime with two massive bodies in it (which is a theoretical model of a binary star system, for example). However, approximations are usually made in these cases. These are commonly referred to as post-Newtonian approximations. Even so, there are numerous cases where the field equations have been solved completely, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> called exact solutions.|$|E

Revere was picked to lead off the Phillies' Opening Day lineup for the 2013 season against the Atlanta Braves over Jimmy Rollins after a strong spring training performance. After acquiring Revere, Phillies General Manager (GM) Rubén Amaro commented, [...] "He can go {{to the top of the}} order or bottom of the order.

500|$|The single was an indie hit in Seattle, and [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] became Mudhoney's most {{recognizable}} song.

[...] The single's success caught the band by surprise; Arm had initially dismissed the song as a [...] "B-side toss off". [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] and B-side [...] "Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More" [...] were later included on the Mudhoney compilation albums Superfuzz Bigmuff Plus Early Singles (1990) and March to Fuzz (2000).|$|E

I can promise you that Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone else {{is going to have to}} have trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win. If you ask some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty." ...|$|E

500|$|News of Barrymore's {{success in}} Hamlet piqued the {{interest}} of Warner Bros., which signed him as {{the lead in the}} 1924 film Beau Brummel. Unhappy in his marriage, Barrymore– aged 40 at the time– sought solace elsewhere and had an affair with his 17-year-old co-star Mary Astor during filming. Although the film was not an unqualified success, the cast, including Barrymore, was generally praised. Around this time, Barrymore acquired the nickname [...] "the Great Profile", as posters and photographs of him tended to favor the left-hand side. He later said: [...] "The right side of my face looks like a fried egg. The left side has features that {{are to be found in}} almost any normal anthropological specimen, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> the apples I try to keep on top of the barrel." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1957, the Egyptian was {{the last}} {{passenger}} train to travel through the city. Between 1940 and 1960 Harrisburg lost another 20% of its population due to economic standstill. With only 9100 people left {{in the city that}} once had 16,000, then Senator John F. Kennedy made a campaign stop on October 3, 1960. Speaking at the Saline County Court House he said [...] "This district, which is built on the land and which has been nourished by the land, personifies the kind of problems which I think the United States is going to face in the 1960s. This district has depended in the main for its resources, its growth, its wealth, upon the minerals underground and upon the food that is grown on the ground. <b>And</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> those industries that have faced serious problems in the 1960s." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Jervis {{clearly had}} a strong impact during the Napoleonic Wars and {{afterwards}} {{on the development of}} the Navy, surprisingly few contemporary biographies of Jervis are available, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> seriously lacking in breadth and thoroughness. The most recent work related to Jervis is The Remaking of the English Navy by Admiral St. Vincent: The Great Unclaimed Naval Revolution by Charles Arthur, 1986, but this focused more on Jervis's reforms to the docks, and less to other parts of his life. Evelyn Berkman's Nelson's Dear Lord: Portrait of St. Vincent (1962), as the bibliographer Eugene Rasor points out, is merely an [...] "effort" [...] to create a biography. The same bibliographer says much the same about William Milbourne James's [...] "Old Oak": The Life of John Jervis, Earl St. Vincent (1950) and Owen Sherrard's A life of Lord St. Vincent (1933), pointing to both as mediocre. Ruddock Mackay published an article which documented the early life of Jervis.|$|E

500|$|In August 2015, Butters {{and fellow}} {{executive}} producer Chris Dingess stated that Madame Masque {{would appear in}} the season, and that an actress had been cast in the role. Everett was confirmed to be playing the character that October. After being cast and seeing {{a picture of the}} comic version of the character, Everett felt [...] "'They got the wrong girl,' only because I look nothing like her. I was very nervous about it ... thought, 'They will probably dye my hair dark, and I'm going to need to work out a bit. <b>And</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> some pretty big boobs.'" [...] However, the producers were looking to take a different approach to the character, taking inspiration from [...] "Hollywood icons like Hedy Lamarr and Lauren Bacall". The character also does not wear the gold mask from the comics, though the show does reference this, with masks appearing in the background of many scenes featuring Frost. Ivy George and Olivia Welch portray younger versions of Cully during her time growing up in Broxton, Oklahoma.|$|E
500|$|Before {{production}} began, {{the production}} team sought out Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or Korean vocal talents. Tia Carrere {{was an early}} candidate to voice the title character, and Lea Salonga, {{who had been the}} singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, was also cast as Mulan's speaking voice, but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, so Ming-Na Wen was brought in to speak the role. Salonga returned to provide the singing voice. Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers listened to her narration at the beginning of The Joy Luck Club. Coats reflected on her decision, stating [...] "When we heard Ming-Na doing that voice-over, we knew we had our Mulan. She has a very likable and lovely voice, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> the qualities we were looking for." [...] For the role of Mushu, Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams's performance as the Genie, and approached Eddie Murphy, who at first balked during recording in the Disney studios, and asked to record the voice in his basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood, New Jersey. For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang, B. D. Wong was hired, although his singing voice, for the song [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You", was performed by Donny Osmond, who had originally auditioned as the speaking voice of the title character in Hercules. Osmond's casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director, and throughout recording, Osmond studied Wong's dialogue tapes, and aimed to match his inflections and personality. Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally [...] "made it" [...] in show business when he was in a Disney film. Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa, June Foray provided for the speaking voice, and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice.|$|E
