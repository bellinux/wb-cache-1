Somerset Walpole, himself the son of an Anglican priest, hoped that his eldest son would follow him into the ministry. Walpole was too {{concerned}} for his father's feelings to tell him he was no longer a believer, and on graduation from Cambridge in 1906 he took a post as a lay missioner at the Mersey Mission to Seamen in Liverpool. He described that as one of the [...] "greatest failures of my life... The Mission to Seamen was, and is, a splendid institution... but it needs men of a certain type to carry it through <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> of that type." [...] The head of the mission reprimanded him for lack of commitment to his work, and Walpole resigned after six months.|$|E

It found its final form in 1561, {{when he was working}} in the Colegio de San Gregorio. Originally planned as a six-volume work, each volume {{describes}} a decade {{of the history of the}} Indies from the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 to 1520, and most of it is an eye-witness account. It was in the History of the Indies that Las Casas finally regretted his advocacy for African slavery, and included a sincere apology, writing, [...] "I soon repented and judged myself guilty of ignorance. I came to realize that black slavery was as unjust as Indian slavery... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> sure that my ignorance and good faith would secure me in the eyes of God."

2500|$|On April 2, 2010, Badu {{was charged}} with disorderly conduct for her public nudity, a class C {{misdemeanor}} indicating a $500 fine, when a witness came forward. According to Dallas Deputy Police Chief Mike Genovesi, the witness [...] "had two small children with her and was offended". In an interview for the Dallas Morning News, Badu said that her part in the video foreshadowed the controversy and reaction to the video, stating [...] "I knew that would happen, {{so as soon as}} the thought came to my mind, I decided to assassinate myself as a gesture. Because {{it was going to happen}} anyway. The video is a prediction of what is happening now". In an April 3, 2010 interview on The Wanda Sykes Show, she explained in response to critics of the video that she did not intend to disrespect the memory of John F.

2500|$|In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher {{he lived}} with until 1974. Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his memoir in 1977: [...] "Basically {{it came down to}} this: she was a {{well-balanced}} woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life." [...] Baker has described Schwarzenegger as [...] " [...] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic" [...] but claims {{towards the end of the}} relationship he became [...] "insufferable– classically conceited– the world revolved around him". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S – their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in Santa Monica for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had [...] "little understanding of polite society" [...] and she found him a turn-off, she says, [...] "He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be – he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive … I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me." ...|$|E
