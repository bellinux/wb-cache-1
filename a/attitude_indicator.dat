25|$|Air India Flight 855 – another {{accident}} {{in which the}} <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> failed, causing the pilot to bank {{too far to the}} left and lose control.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} the cockpit {{received}} an upgrade when an STC was developed for {{the installation of the}} Garmin G500H as well as the Mid-Continent MD302 Standby <b>Attitude</b> <b>Indicator.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite initial {{reports that}} {{technical}} issues {{had resulted in}} the accident, the cause {{was found to be}} spatial disorientation of the pilot following the loss of the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator.</b> Flying in poor weather conditions, the flight crew would have had to rely only on their instruments; such a situation is known as instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The failure of the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> was caused by the failure of both generators and the crew using an outdated checklist and not adhering to a checklist; the battery was therefore drained of power in less than half the time that it {{should have been able to}} supply power for.|$|E
5000|$|Electrically driven <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> {{typically}} use mercury {{switches to}} keep the gyro axis vertical. When the gyro is off vertical, mercury switches trigger torque motors that move the gyro position back to the correct position.

5000|$|<b>Attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> {{are also}} used on manned {{spacecraft}} and are called Flight Director <b>Attitude</b> <b>Indicators</b> (FDAI), where they indicate the craft's yaw angle (nose left or right), pitch (nose up or down), roll, and orbit relative to a fixed-space inertial reference frame, for which an FDAI can be configured to use known positions relative to Earth or the stars, so that the engineers, scientists and astronauts can communicate the relative position, attitude, and orbit of the craft.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary cause}} of the crash was that both pilots had lost spatial {{orientation}} due to their inexperience with the Western type of <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> on the aircraft. Lack of adequate rest, poor crew resource management, and alcohol consumption by the captain {{also contributed to the}} accident.|$|E
25|$|The Command Module had two DSKYs {{connected}} to its AGC: one {{located on the}} main instrument panel and a second located in the lower equipment bay near a sextant used for aligning the inertial guidance platform. The Lunar Module had a single DSKY for its AGC. A flight director <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> (FDAI), controlled by the AGC, was located above the DSKY on the commander's console and on the LM.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} accident was the loss of spatial orientation by the crew and chiefly by the Captain who was piloting the aircraft during the landing phase. The plane banked left, overturned and went into a rapid descent. The loss of spatial orientation occurred in the night, while flying in the clouds, with autopilot and autothrottle switched off. Poor CRM and insufficient training for using the Western type of attitude indicators contributed to the accident. The pilots had previously flown Tupolev Tu-134 and Antonov An-24 with {{a different type of}} <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> (where the bank angle is shown by the movements of an aircraft symbol, and the indicator's background does not turn left or right).|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} proposed {{two possible}} causes: a short-time negative thrust due to {{failure of the}} far right engine and false readings of the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators,</b> even though both causes {{could lead to the}} disaster only in the presence of other factors.|$|R
50|$|On 25 January 2008 United Airlines Flight 731 {{experienced}} a serious glass-cockpit blackout, losing {{half of the}} ECAM displays {{as well as all}} radios, transponders, TCAS, and <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators.</b> The pilots were able to land at Newark Airport without radio contact in good weather and daylight conditions.|$|R
50|$|Over Kano, Glenn {{took control}} of the {{spacecraft}} and started a major yaw adjustment. He allowed the spacecraft to continue the yaw maneuver until it was facing into its flight path. Glenn noticed that the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> disagreed with what he observed were the true spacecraft attitudes. Even with the incorrect instrument readouts, he was pleased to be facing forward instead of backward on his orbital path.|$|R
500|$|Film {{taken from}} the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some [...] from the descent stage, {{whipping}} violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple: [...] "The ascent stage of the LM separated... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator,</b> but I looked up {{long enough to see}} the flag fall over." [...] Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least [...] from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.|$|E
500|$|In February 2014, {{work began}} on a multi-year upgrade of 62 B-1Bs, {{scheduled}} {{to be completed by}} 2019. The vertical situation display upgrade (VSDU) replaces existing flight instruments with multifunction color displays, a second display aids with threat evasion and targeting, and act as a back-up display. Additional memory capacity is to be installed for the diagnostics database. [...] Procurement and installation of the IBS upgrades is expected to cost $918 million, research and engineering costs are estimated at $391 million. [...] Other additions are to replace the two spinning mass gyroscopic inertial navigation system with ring laser gyroscopic systems and a GPS antenna, replacement of the APQ-164 radar with the Scalable Agile Beam Radar – Global Strike (SABR-GS) active electronically scanned array, and a new <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|E
500|$|Investigators {{identified}} {{evidence of}} arcing in wiring of the {{in-flight entertainment system}} network, but this did not trip the circuit breakers. [...] The investigation was unable to confirm if this arc was the [...] "lead event" [...] that ignited the flammable covering on MPET insulation blankets that quickly spread across other flammable materials. The crew did not recognize that a fire had started and were not warned by instruments. Once they {{became aware of the}} fire, the uncertainty of the problem made it difficult to address. The rapid spread of the fire led to the failure of key display systems, and the crew were soon rendered unable to control the aircraft. Because he had no light by which to see his controls after the displays failed, the pilot was forced to steer the plane blindly; intentionally or not, the plane swerved off course and headed back out into the Atlantic. Recovered fragments of the plane show that the heat inside the cockpit became so great that the ceiling started to melt. The recovered standby <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> and airspeed indicators showed that the aircraft struck the water at 300 knots (560km/h, 348mph) in a 20 degrees nose down and 110-degree bank attitude, or almost inverted; the impact force of the aircraft crashing into the Atlantic Ocean was later calculated to be 350 times the force of gravity ("g"s). Death was instantaneous for all passengers and crew due to the impact forces and deceleration.|$|E
50|$|Traditional, {{self-contained}} <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> use a gyroscope (powered via vacuum or electrically) {{to establish}} an inertial platform. The gyroscope is geared to a display that has two degrees of freedom, simultaneously displaying pitch and bank. The display may be colored to indicate the horizon as the division between the two colored segments (typically blue for sky and brown for ground), and {{is intended to be}} intuitive to use. The actual bank angle is calibrated around the circumference of the instrument. The pitch angle is indicated by a series of calibration lines, each representing 5° or 10° of pitch depending on design.|$|R

2500|$|Second transatlantic flight The Columbia {{was flown}} to Toronto, renamed Maple Leaf after the song [...] "The Maple Leaf Forever". The plane was then {{demonstrated}} at the 1930 Canadian National Exhibition. The aircraft had an early Sperry <b>Attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> installed, {{taken out of}} Jimmy Doolittle's Lockheed Vega. Pilot Roger Q. Williams, held up the flight for three weeks with legal disputes with Levine over back pay. On October 9, 1930, Maple Leaf performed the first transatlantic flight by a Canadian between Canada and London, England in 36 hours, 10 minutes. The aircraft was piloted by Erroll Boyd, and Harry P. Conner, who traveled with $18 in their pockets and an unpaid Toronto Hotel bill. Upon arrival they flew a tribute flight {{in honor of the}} R-101 crash victims.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was on a}} non-scheduled international passenger flight from Düsseldorf, Germany to Chicago with stopovers in Shannon and Gander, Newfoundland for refueling. [...] Shortly after takeoff from Shannon Airport's runway 24, the pilots were cleared for a right-hand turn, but they instead turned left and kept turning until the aircraft had reached a bank angle of about 90 degrees or more. [...] Unable to recover, the aircraft plummeted into the River Shannon 5,000ft. {{from the end of}} the runway. [...] There were no survivors among the 83 passengers and crew. [...] Subsequent investigations indicate that the crash probably resulted from a malfunctioning <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator,</b> a fault in the starboard ailerons, or both. [...] Poor weather conditions and crew fatigue were also cited as possible contributing factors. Irish State Papers released in 1994 indicated that the pilot had alcohol in his blood and that the airline was insolvent at the time of the accident.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) {{element of}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) is striving to {{eliminate}} poor visibility as a causal factor in aircraft accidents as well as enhance operational capabilities of all aircraft. To accomplish these safety and situation awareness improvements, the SVS concept {{is designed to provide}} {{a clear view of the}} world ahead through the display of computer generated imagery derived from an onboard database of terrain, obstacle, and airport information. The ability of a pilot to ascertain critical information through visual perception of the outside environment can be limited by various weather phenomena, such as rain, fog, and snow. Since the beginning of flight, the aviation industry has continuously developed various devices to overcome lowvisibility issues, such as <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators,</b> radio navigation, and instrument landing systems. Recent advances include moving map disp...|$|R

50|$|The {{center of}} the PFD usually {{contains}} an <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> (AI), which gives the pilot information about the aircraft's pitch and roll characteristics, and {{the orientation of the}} aircraft with respect to the horizon. Unlike a traditional <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator,</b> however, the mechanical gyroscope is not contained within the panel itself, but is rather a separate device whose information is simply displayed on the PFD. The <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> is designed to look very much like traditional mechanical AIs. Other information {{that may or may not}} appear on or about the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> can include the stall angle, a runway diagram, ILS localizer and glide-path “needles”, and so on. Unlike mechanical instruments, this information can be dynamically updated as required; the stall angle, for example, can be adjusted in real time to reflect the calculated critical angle of attack of the aircraft in its current configuration (airspeed, etc.). The PFD may also show an indicator of the aircraft's future path (over the next few seconds), as calculated by onboard computers, making it easier for pilots to anticipate aircraft movements and reactions.|$|E

40|$|Analysing {{the use of}} {{marijuana}} is challenging in part {{because there is no}} widely accepted single measure of individual use. Similarly, there is no single response variable that effectively captures attitudes toward its social and moral acceptability. One approach is to view the joint distribution of multiple use and <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> as a mixture of latent classes. Pooling items from the annual 'Monitoring the future' surveys of American high school seniors from 1977 to 2001, we find that marijuana use and attitudes are well summarized by a four-class model. Secular trends in class prevalences over this period reveal major shifts in use and attitudes. Applying a multinomial logistic model to the latent response, we investigate how class membership relates to demographic and life style factors, political beliefs and religiosity over time. Inferences about the parameters of the latent class logistic model are obtained by a combination of maximum likelihood and Bayesian techniques. Copyright 2006 Royal Statistical Society. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine out the {{existing}} language attitudes among first year English as a Foreign Language (EFL) college students using five personality traits namely self-image, inhibition, risk-taking, ego-permeability and tolerance for ambiguity as language <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators.</b> In addition, the challenges that EFL teachers have in dealing with developing language attitudes among students as well as factors that may influence the formation of language attitudes among students were also unravelled. Besides student-survey, interviews with teachers and student participants were also conducted to gain more comprehensive insights into EFL students’ attitudes with regards to learning. The results indicated that the participants demonstrated low self-image, high inhibition, low risk-taking, high ego-permeability and low tolerance for ambiguity in learning EFL. The findings from teacher and student interviews were congruent with the personality traits that emerged from the survey data. Discussion was focused on how instruction may help improve EFL learners’ language attitudes towards learning...|$|R
