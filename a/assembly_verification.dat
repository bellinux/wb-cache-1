The ~ 100 kbp haplotype length variation results from different AFGP copy number, suggesting substantial dynamism existed in the evolutionary history of the AFGP gene family.

One of the main assumptions of the project is the most accurate and automated simulation, recording and gathering data about operations performed by employees during manual <b>assembly</b> <b>verification</b> workshops. The problem could be approached by design of shop-floor sensing architecture and application {{of a set of}} various sensors, including optical sensors and MEMS. However, some manual assembly operations cannot be accurately described by means of optical sensors and MEMS. Generally, the problem is the accurate identification and location of small objects that are close to each other. One example is mounting a screw in a thread during tail light assembly of a car. This is the case, when threads are in close proximity of each other. Information if a screw was mounted in a proper thread is expected. Therefore, in order to avoid manual supplementation of this kind of data, light-responsive RFID tags are proposed to be applied.

The avionic system consists of three main subsystems, i. e. the on-board data handling, the electric power and the health management subsystem, and supports a technological experiment which focuses on the investigation of passive thermal control subsystem. The <b>Assembly,</b> Integration and <b>Verification</b> (AIV) campaign is a fundamental step of the design process, as the final objective of the AIV is to demonstrate that the end product meets the specified requirements. The selection of simple technical solutions and the necessity to keep cost down have driven the definition of the AIV plan, which has been tailored for the avionic system under consideration. Main purpose of the methodology for the <b>Assembly,</b> Integration and <b>Verification</b> is to provide the designer with a step-by-step procedure to accomplish the verification and validation of the avionic system. The methodology shall pursue an incremental approach, which defines the test plan from components to parts, subsystems and system levels through subsequent integrations.

40|$|A liquid scintillator-based neutron {{coincidence}} counting {{system designed}} to address a number of safeguards applications is under development by the IAEA {{in collaboration with the}} Joint Research Centre-ITU and Hybrid Instruments LTD. Liquid scintillators are a promising technology due to their good fast-neutron detection capabilities. The characteristic fast response of scintillators is particularly beneficial for coincidence counting applications, for which a performance level higher than that associated with moderated thermal detectors might be expected. Fast neutron detection requires no thermalization process and therefore, does not incur the resulting neutron detection delays. These features reduce the length of the coincidence gate by three orders of magnitude, reducing practically at negligible values the accidental coincidence rate which dominates the uncertainty in thermal neutron detectors. Recent progress in fast electronic digitizers offers the possibility to perform on-line, real-time pulse shape discrimination (PSD) between gamma and neutron radiation detection, making this technology suitable for nuclear safeguards and security applications.

40|$|In {{industry}} today, virtual design {{tools are}} used in the realization of a new product. As changes in the design and planning concepts are extremely costly in the later verification and production phases, much can be gained if a product design can be optimized and verified with respect to the assembly process with simulation tools as early as possible. A topic of special interest is the virtual preparation of deformable 1 D objects such as electrical cables and wiring harnesses, hoses, pipes and tubes. They are geometrically characterized as one-dimensional in the sense that one dimension is significantly larger than the other two and can deform when subject to external forces and moments. These types of flexible components are usually located where there is restricted design space and are often associated with quality problems and late on-line adjustments due to geometrical interference. Hence, there is a strong motivation to further strengthen the virtual product realization process in this area. This thesis will present three computational methods for geometrical design and verification of deformable 1 D objects. The main scientific challenge is to deal with the complexity of coupling a simulation model with iterative algorithms for optimization, path planning and variation simulation in an efficient way. The methods rely on a simulation model based on Cosserat rod theory that enables efficient and accurate computations of large spatial deformations of flexible 1 D objects. The first method solves the problem of routing a deformable 1 D object with respect to geometrical design constraints. The method is segregated in a deterministic grid search step and a simulation-based local optimization step. The second method solves the <b>assembly</b> <b>verification</b> problem for a deformable 1 D object with a given design. If the verification is true, the method produces a smooth manipulation of a set of grip points that installs the object in the target configuration. The third and final method is in fact a methodology for performing analysis and visualization of geometrical variation in a deformable 1 D object. Here, the main innovation is the construction of a discrete envelope for given tolerances based on convex hull computations and silhouette generation. Together, the three methods form a powerful tool set for geometrical design and verification. Quality problems and geometrical interference in the assembled product can now to a larger extent be addressed in the concept phase, thus saving significant development time and reducing the number of iterations between the design phase and the planning and verification phases. The methods are implemented as an integral part in the commercial software IPS Cable Simulation as of version 3. 1 (2016) ...|$|E
