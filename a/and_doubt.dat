5|$|Phil England {{writes in}} The Ecologist that the {{strength}} of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Ross Gelbspan’s The Heat is On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial <b>and</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear <b>and</b> <b>doubt</b> among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} why Keats settled on the phrase 'negative capability', but some {{scholars}} have hypothesized that Keats was influenced in his studies of medicine and chemistry, and that {{it refers to the}} negative pole of an electric current which is passive and receptive.

25|$|On 9 September 1986, the company's course {{division}} invited representatives {{form the}} largest customers to {{a dialog with}} ND's top management.

In {{the middle of the}} meeting, Skår chose to leave to reach another meeting. A summary was distributed to all employees and soon was creating headlines in the press. The process also created mistrust <b>and</b> <b>doubt</b> within the organization and within a short time all the employees in the course division had quit.|$|E
25|$|Canterbury was the RNZN's fourth Type 12 frigate. She {{was laid}} down on 12 June 1969 by Yarrow Shipbuilders and {{launched}} 11 months later on 6 May 1970. She {{was the last}} Leander-class frigate and the last steam-driven warship to serve in New Zealand. The order for the ship went ahead after some controversy <b>and</b> <b>doubt</b> generated by the then Minister of Finance, Robert Muldoon. She was built {{at the end of}} the production line for Leanders to fit in with a British Government programme requiring seven more Leanders to be built for the Royal Navy, the RNZN and the Chilean Navy within 2.5 years using a modular construction.|$|E

Hundreds of detainees were forced at gunpoint to lie shackled and prone in Army trucks, stacked like cordwood. The trucks were delayed from moving to the detainment area for hours. The 84 victims {{were reported to have}} been asphyxiated, crushed or died of overheating. The precise nature and cause of death have been subject to controversy <b>and</b> <b>doubt</b> because of lack of transparency and absence of depth in investigations made.

An hourglass indicates the time of life on earth and also the belief that death is not the end, as the hourglass can be inverted to start over. The hourglass denotes Santa Muerte's relationship with {{time as well as}} with the worlds above and below. It also symbolizes patience. An owl symbolizes her ability to navigate the darkness and her wisdom. The owl is also said to act as a messenger. A lamp symbolizes intelligence and spirit, to light the way through the darkness of ignorance <b>and</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|E
25|$|In chapter ten, {{which is}} {{entitled}} Distrust <b>and</b> <b>Doubt</b> and has 10 sections, {{the focus is}} on international consequences of Iran’s decision to launch the Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF), including a letter written by three European foreign ministers; contacts with Thabo Mbeki (then South African president), Kofi Annan (then Secretary-General of the UN) and Chinese and Russian officials and their recommendations to Iran to postpone the inauguration of the UCF; receiving the final European plan; the trip to Geneva; and the last negotiations with three European foreign ministers. It also explains the plan prepared by Iran to work with like-minded countries instead of pursuing agreement with the European states, after the final efforts by the Steering Committee in London failed.|$|E
25|$|On 12 February 1912, after {{rounds of}} negotiations, Longyu issued an {{imperial}} edict bringing about the abdication {{of the child}} emperor Puyi. This brought an end to over 2,000 years of Imperial China and began {{an extended period of}} instability of warlord factionalism. The unorganized political and economic systems combined with a widespread criticism of Chinese culture led to questioning <b>and</b> <b>doubt</b> about the future. In July of 1917, there was an abortive attempt to restore the Qing monarch led by Zhang Xun, which was quickly reversed by republican troops. In the 1930s, the Empire of Japan invaded Northeast China and founded Manchukuo in 1932, with Puyi, as the emperor. After the invasion by the Soviet Union, Manchukuo collapsed in 1945.|$|E

25|$|In the 15th and 16th centuries, the High Renaissance {{gave rise}} to a stylised art known as Mannerism. In place of the {{balanced}} compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art {{at the dawn of the}} 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, <b>and</b> <b>doubt.</b> The unperturbed faces and gestures of Piero della Francesca and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of Pontormo and the emotional intensity of El Greco. In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of Italian Baroque are Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Artemisia Gentileschi, Mattia Preti, Carlo Saraceni and Bartolomeo Manfredi. Subsequently, in the 18th century, Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Canaletto. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with Antonio Canova's nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, George Stinney, a 14-year-old black youth, {{was accused}} of murdering two girls, aged 11 and 8, near Alcolu at Clarendon County. Alcolu was a small working-class mill town, where residences of whites and blacks were {{separated}} by railroad tracks. Stinney was interrogated by police in a locked room with several white officers and no other witnesses, and it was claimed that he had confessed to the killing within an hour. Stinney's father was fired from his job at local lumber mill, {{and his family had}} to either leave the city or risk getting lynched. Given the two white female victims, and an all-white male jury, Stinney was rapidly convicted. Stinney's court-appointed attorney Charles Plowden was a tax commissioner with political aspirations, and scholars have considered him ineffective. On June 16, 1944, Stinney was executed at South Carolina State Penitentiary in Columbia. Seventy years later, historians question whether he was guilty <b>and</b> <b>doubt</b> that he received a fair trial. On December 17, 2014, Stinney's conviction was vacated on the grounds that his constitutional rights had been violated, and his confession had most likely been coerced.|$|E
