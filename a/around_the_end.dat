5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 19th century, the {{increase}} in coal mining and steel works around Wales led to the immigration of Italian workers. The workers brought families who integrated their culture into Welsh society, bringing with them Italian ice cream and Italian cafes, now a staple of Welsh society.|$|E

This hypothesis was confirmed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 19thcentury, and opening the skull to relieve pressure was then proposed as a treatment.|$|E
5|$|By 1846, {{the station}} was already very busy, {{handling}} trains from Wigan and the south, Bolton, Fleetwood, Blackpool, Lancaster and the north, and Blackburn. There were no footbridges; passengers had to cross the lines escorted by station staff. North of {{the station was}} a network of goods lines <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Lancaster Canal. The coal yards and sidings here continued to operate long after the canal had fallen into commercial disuse.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{dominance}} of rugby union {{there have been few}} football teams of note {{in the history of the}} Rhondda Valleys. Several teams were formed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 19th century, but most folded during the depression, including Cwmparc F.C. in 1926 and Mid-Rhondda in 1928. The most successful club from the area is Ton Pentre F.C..|$|E

On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots.

5|$|Upon commissioning, both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet and Hercules became the flagship of the division. The 2nd Division was renamed the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. The sisters participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the year, Colossus was transferred to the 1st BS. Hercules became a private ship in early 1913 and joined her sister in the 1st BS two months later.|$|E

5|$|While the {{earliest}} megalodon remains were reported from the Late Oligocene dated to around 28 {{million years ago}} (mya), competing figures still exist as to when it evolved, such as 16 mya and 23 mya.

5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how {{the presence or absence of}} coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E
5|$|FFH16 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with County Road 436 (CR436, Smokey Lake Road) near Horseshoe Lake in rural Iron County's Stambaugh Township. The roadway runs north from this location east of Smokey Lake through forest lands {{that are part}} of the Ottawa National Forest. Near Golden Lake and the Golden Lake National Forest Campground, FFH16 and US Highway 2 (US2) intersect. FFH16 continues north and curves to the northwest <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Golden Lake. The routing of the road provides access to several more lakes in rural Iron County such as Paint, Silk and Hehe lakes, as well as an older routing of US2, before crossing into southern Houghton County.|$|E

5|$|In 1438, {{another of}} John Manners' sons, Robert, {{inherited}} the castle and the estates. The lands {{had fallen in}} value considerably over the preceding years, {{as a result of}} the wars with the Scots, the feuding with the Herons and the poverty of the lands. Robert's son, another Robert Manners, inherited the property in 1464, and passed the castle onto his son, George, on his death in 1495. George inherited the title of Baron de Ros from his mother's side of the family and the castle was abandoned as a residence by the family <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 15th century when the Manners moved closer to the royal court.|$|E
5|$|In late 1931, {{the state}} {{transferred}} US31 {{to a new}} routing between the St. Joseph and South Haven areas; in the process, the former route of US31 between Watervliet and South Haven was redesignated as M-140. The highway was extended southward from Watervliet to the Niles area in late 1934 or early 1935. The concurrency between M-62 and M-140 was eliminated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of 1957 when the former highway was truncated to terminate east of Eau Claire instead of continuing west into town. At {{the end of the}} 1950s, the route north of Watervliet to the county line was realigned, smoothing several sharp curves.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde {{announced}} on 23 January 2009 {{that he would}} be stepping down as leader of the Independence Party for health reasons: he has been diagnosed as having a malignant oesophageal tumour. He said he would travel to the Netherlands <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of January for treatment. Education Minister and Independence Party vice-chairman Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir was to serve as Prime Minister in his absence. The leader of the Social Democratic Alliance, Foreign Minister Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, was also unwell, undergoing treatment for a benign brain tumour since September 2008. The government recommended that elections be held on 9 May 2009.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} many years since position-specific residue {{preference}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of a helix was revealed. However, all the existing secondary structure prediction methods did not exploit this preference feature, {{resulting in low}} accuracy in predicting <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of secondary structures. In this study, we collected a relatively large data set consisting of 1860 high-resolution, non-homology proteins from the PDB, and further analyzed <b>the</b> residue distributions <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of regular secondary structures. It was found that there exist position-specific residue preferences (PSRP) <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of not only helices but also strands. Based on the unique features, we proposed a novel strategy and developed a tool named E-SSpred that treats the secondary structure {{as a whole and}} builds models to predict entire secondary structure segments directly by integrating relevant features. In E-SSpred, the support vector machine (SVM) method is adopted to model and predict <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of helices and strands according to the unique residue distributions around them. A simple linear discriminate analysis method is applied to model and predict entire secondary structure segments by integrating end-prediction results, tri-peptide composition, and length distribution features of secondary structures, as well as the prediction results of the most famous program PSIPRED. The results of fivefold cross-validation on a widely used data set demonstrate that the accuracy of E-SSpred in predicting ends of secondary structures is about 10 % higher than PSIPRED, and the overall prediction accuracy (Q 3 value) of E-SSpred (82. 2 %) is also better than PSIPRED (80. 3 %).

The manor of Hallamshire passed to William de Lovetot, the {{grandson}} of a Norman baron who had come over to England with the Conqueror. William de Lovetot founded the parish churches of St Mary at Handsworth, St Nicholas at High Bradfield and St. Mary's at Ecclesfield {{at the start of}} the 12th century in addition to Sheffield's own parish church. He also built the original wooden Sheffield Castle, which stimulated the growth of the town.|$|E
5|$|The Murano was {{announced}} in 2005 when Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was experiencing a condominium boom that had begun in the late 1990s; between 1998 and 2004 more than 70 Center City office and manufacturing buildings had been converted into rental and condominium apartments. The project was jointly developed by Thomas Properties Group of Los Angeles and P Associates of Philadelphia. The planned site of the Murano was on West Market Street in Center City, an area which had not had any residential development until 2002 when 2121 Market Street was converted into apartments. Construction began <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of 2005.|$|E
