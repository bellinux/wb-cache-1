500|$|The group drew {{inspiration}} from short-lived punk bands like the Fat Sluts, The Lone Reagans and Forbidden Mule, whom Ferguson describes as [...] "like all punk bands... very fast and furious." [...] Much of the band's provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers, where to get people's attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics—the group would sometimes walk {{into the street and}} stop traffic to get noticed. [...] "Sometimes we have to do really ugly or horrendous things to get people's attention, and we're not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. We'll hit someone if it gets a bit of discourse going," [...] said McDermott.|$|E
500|$|Perkinson {{reveals that}} he {{previously}} met Pierre Michel {{on a train}} and that Michel had told him of the plan to murder Cassetti, {{but he was too}} <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. Since the others had not seen Michel in person, Perkinson volunteered to impersonate Michel and stab Cassetti on his behalf so that he could get revenge for Teresa's death. He then reveals that a now 13-year-old Daisy Armstrong, whom he had been raising as his own daughter, is alive and has been hidden in the baggage compartment of the train during the journey. Daisy then comes out to meet the people who thought she was dead. Poirot, Dr. Constantine, and Marceau decide to tell the police officials the first solution – that an unknown assassin came aboard the train, killed Rachett, and left. The passengers are overjoyed that Daisy is alive and Poirot concludes that it is [...] "a most satisfying ending." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{return to}} {{composing}} {{after the war}} led to what Richard Stoker, in the [...] Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, [...] calls [...] "his best period". However, Bush's attempts to secure {{a place in the}} concert repertoire were frustrated. A contributory factor may have been [...] what the critic Dominic Daula [...] calls Bush's [...] "intriguingly unique compositional voice" [...] that challenged critics and audiences alike. But the composer's refusal to modify his [...] pro-Soviet stance following the onset of the Cold War alienated both the public and the music establishment, a factor which Bush acknowledged 20 years later: [...] "People who were in a position to promote my works were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. They were afraid of being labelled". [...] Stoker comments that [...] "in a less tolerant country he would certainly have been imprisoned, or worse. But he was merely ignored, both politically, and, which is a pity, as a composer". [...] Nancy Bush writes that the BBC considered him persona non grata, and imposed an almost complete [...] though unofficial broadcast ban that lasted for some 15 years after the war.|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of 2013, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters made multiple annual movie lists dedicated to underappreciated or underrated films. Movies.com opined it [...] "is, hands down, the most underappreciated film of the year…'Proper' filmmaking or not, if you've got me cheering at the screening, grinning big and then walking out with a little extra adrenaline, you’ve done something right." [...] Ryan Doom from JoBlo.com wrote that [...] "while usually that’s the thing I mock, [...] somehow ended up pretty damn enjoyable…Why not? It never takes itself serious and it knows exactly what it is: a silly film that isn't <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what the hell it wants." [...] Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters has hence been labeled as a cult film {{by a number of}} horror-fantasy film fans, as well as by some critics who initially saw no merit in the movie. This significant financial and fan following have led some to question the initial perception of the film in relation to its debut in January, considered to be [...] "a refuge for films that don't have a shot of generating good word of mouth or having a leggy run." [...] While Renner's box office draw and the film's [...] "well-articulated premise" [...] have been listed as major factors behind its [...] theatrical success, its ability to maintain a lasting fan following has also been attributed to its original concept, excellent gore and action sequences, Renner's and Arterton's tongue-in-cheek performances, and the film's ability to not take itself too seriously. The film was nominated for the 40th People's Choice Awards in the category Favorite Horror Movie, but lost to Carrie.|$|E
2500|$|This re-introduction of {{teleology}} (which Schiller sometimes calls a re-anthropomorphizing of the world) is what Schiller {{says the}} naturalist has become <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Schiller's method of concrete metaphysics (i.e. his humanism) allows for {{an appeal to}} metaphysics when science demands it. However: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1862, the war effort was going poorly for the United States and President Abraham Lincoln. [...] The {{commander-in-chief}} wished to release a proclamation that would free the slaves in the southern states, but was <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so for fear that the Union's border states still practicing slavery would secede. [...] If he issued the proclamation prematurely, it would appear as a last cry for help to both {{the country and the}} world. [...] Lincoln needed a military victory so that he could announce the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.|$|E
60|$|Several boats hurtled {{past them}} in the next half-hour,--small boats, boats of their own size, boats <b>afraid,</b> unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> aught but run madly on. Then a ten-ton barge, at {{imminent}} risk of destruction, lowered sail to windward and lumbered down upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Obey {{the last}} order," [...] is a precept {{inviolable}} at sea. So the land-lubber, <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> refuse <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything, rushes about distracted, and does nothing: {{in the end}} receiving a shower of kicks and cuffs from all quarters.|$|R

2500|$|In 1438, at {{the turn}} of Burmese {{calendar}} year 800, Mohnyin Thado on the advice of a court astrologer decided to renumber the calendar by subtracting two years. When the monks cautioned him that kings who alter the calendar die, he said [...] "If I must die, let me die. I will not be put in a song as a king who was <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his duty". The king died just over a year later, and his change of the calendar was discarded. He was succeeded by his son Minye Kyawswa.|$|E
2500|$|Gullit's {{brilliance}} prompted George Best {{to comment}} in 1990, [...] "Ruud Gullit {{is a great}} player by any standards. He has all the skills. He's not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things with the ball. And he looks as if he's enjoying every second of it. By my reckoning that's what makes him an even better player than Maradona. Both have the key quality you will find in all the best players: balance. You just can't knock them off the ball. It was the same with Pelé, Beckenbauer and Cruyff." ...|$|E
2500|$|The theatre had {{multiple}} exits: a little known side-door {{was used by}} those in the orchestra and back stage while an upper balcony exit was a clear way out. In the panic of the fire, many people were pushed and fell, and {{they were unable to}} escape. Many people jumped out of the windows of the theatre. Others who were assembled near the window were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The editor of the Richmond Standard, present at the scene, urged people to jump; he, with help from many others on the ground, then heroically saved the lives of many of those who chose to do so.|$|E

2500|$|He {{asked the}} Court {{to reflect on}} what was being {{challenged}} in the case, [...] "that the Executive Branch officials at the conferences {{spent too much time}} talking about faith-based groups and not enough talking about community-based groups. If that isn't intrusive on the Executive Branch, I don't know what is." [...] Clements said that if the Court had to reverse Flast it should not be <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, [...] "if you have to choose between the logic of Flast and the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III, I think it's an easy choice. You don't abandon the basic requirements of Article III that distinguish the Judiciary from the political branches of Government." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the poem}} is {{concerned}} primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator, {{it can be difficult}} to interpret. Laurence Perrine wrote, [...] " [...] presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person's head within a certain time interval, in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical". This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine exactly what is literal and what is symbolic. On the surface, [...] "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" [...] relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle-aged man who wants to say something but is <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, and ultimately does not. The dispute, however, lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking, whether he is actually going anywhere, what he wants to say, and to what the various images refer.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the initial}} {{recording}} sessions, Aguilera released her first greatest hits album, , which featured two new songs that {{were derived from}} electronic music, and she announced that the compilation was in the vein of where the upcoming album was going to go, which was a very futuristic approach to music. [...] "I get off on working with creative energy", Aguilera said. [...] "That's when I'm most at home and feel happiest. And all these people brought about new sides of me. It was a big collaboration-fest, and it felt so good and rewarding in the end, because I was just so happy with the work and the new territories that I ventured out to." [...] Aguilera also remarked that her son inspired her to experiment in ways [...] "that maybe I've been <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the past, to allow myself {{to go to a}} place of 'less singing,' [...] " [...] she says. [...] " [...] is just about the future – my son in my life, motivating me to want to play and have fun." ...|$|E

6000|$|Marston was puzzled; somehow Don Felix looked afraid.

60|$|After Ronald {{had been}} removed from the court the woman was questioned. She {{asserted}} that her master was away, and was, she believed, in France, and that in his absence she often let lodgings to strangers. That two days before, a man whom she knew not came and hired a room for a few days. That on the evening before, hearing a noise in the attic, she went up with him, and met Ronald coming down stairs. That when Ronald said there were strange men outside the house, and when immediately afterwards there was a great knocking at the door, the man drew his sword and ordered her to come up stairs with him. That he then made her assist him to pull up a plank, and thrust it from the attic to the wall, and ordered her to replace it when he had gone. She supposed he was a thief flying from justice, but was <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> refuse <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his bidding.|$|R

Malachi's pregnant girlfriend, Ruth, waves goodbye to him and begins to weep. It is revealed that she has a secret hatred for He Who Walks Behind the Rows and dreams of setting the cornfield on fire, but is <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>do</b> so because He Who Walks Behind the Rows can see everything, including the motives inside human hearts. The story ends with the simple statement that the corn surrounding Gatlin is pleased.|$|R

The morning after the wedding, therefore, while Lady Lillycraft was making preparations for her departure, an audience was requested by her immaculate hand-maid, Mrs. Hannah, who, with much primming of the mouth, and many maidenly hesitations, requested leave to stay behind, and that Lady Lillycraft would supply her place with some other servant.
