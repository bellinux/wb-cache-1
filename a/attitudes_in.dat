Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural <b>attitudes</b> <b>in</b> the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E

However, the lack of knowledge regarding premastication and its prohibition by missionaries and doctors instead caused severe anemia in the infants of the population, or resulted in malnourished infants and children deprived of nourishment.|$|E

5|$|The temperance movement, {{which had}} been absorbed into the moralistic system of the Nonconformist chapels, caused a shift in social <b>attitudes</b> <b>in</b> the mid- to late-19th- and early-20th century Rhondda.

5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic <b>attitudes</b> <b>in</b> response to the epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies {{to protect themselves from}} HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} part of Diệm's rule, a {{centerpiece}} of the rural pacification campaign was the large-scale construction of strategic hamlets, whereby villagers were compelled to move into fortified camps in an attempt to lock out insurgents. However this failed as many were able to infiltrate the settlements, whereas a previous implementation of such principles in Malaya had been successful as the local communists were ethnic Chinese who were physically distinguishable from the anti-communist ethnic majority. It also angered the peasants, who were forced to abandon their ancestral lands and homes, and build new dwellings in the new villages. Many of these hamlets were subsequently overrun in communist attacks, something many villagers found to their liking. General Lê Văn Kim oversaw the future of the program for Minh and it was decided to liberalize the system to try to win over the peasants. They forecast that they could reduce the insurgency's support by 30% alone through these less restrictive arrangements, citing more cooperative <b>attitudes</b> <b>in</b> Mekong Delta regions heavily populated with Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài. However this upset and aroused suspicions among the Americans.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> predicting an individual’s behavior, research on IT adoption has discounted the role of <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> explaining technology acceptance behavior. Additionally, the attitude construct has often been omitted in research on IT acceptance. In this study, we {{call attention to the}} role of <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> explaining technology acceptance behavior. In developing our research model, we draw on both the concept of attitude strength and previous technology acceptance studies. Empirical examination of our research hypotheses indicates that attitude toward system use fully mediates the effects of salient beliefs on behavioral intention when attitude is strong, whereas it partially mediates the effects when attitude is weak. Our findings provide additional insights in predicting technology acceptance behavior...|$|R
