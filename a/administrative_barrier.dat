40|$|International audienceThe cloud {{model is}} rapidly evolving, with {{maturing}} intercloud architectures and progressive integration of sparse, geodistributed resources into large datacenters. The single-provider <b>administrative</b> <b>barrier</b> is also increasingly crossed by applications, allowing new verticals {{to benefit from}} the multicloud model. For instance, in home healthcare systems, transparent usage of resources from multiple providers enables "follow-me" scenarios, where healthcare services are accessible anywhere, anytime, with quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. However, transparency might be at odds with security and jurisdictions, imposing restrictions on where data and applications might be stored and run. Existing intercloud approaches either disrupt application deployment mechanisms or compromise infrastructure homogeneity, making enforcing a uniform QoS level more complex, notably for protection. This article introduces Orchestration for beyond Intercloud Security (Orbits), an infrastructure-as-a-service-level architecture that enables flexible and legacy intercloud application deployment for mobile remote healing, while providing a homogeneous service abstraction across multiple clouds. The authors also present a work-in-progress prototype and several benchmarks to demonstrate the viability of the approach and highlight key implementation choices...|$|E

This phenomenon changes {{the structure of}} the population of a country. The question is how to analyze the impact on the border region. A demographic and geopolitical analysis of borders requires an interdisciplinary approach. An isonymic analysis can be a useful tool. Surnames are part of cultural history, sociocultural features transmitted from ancestors to their descendants through a vertical mechanism similar to that of genetic inheritance. The analysis of surname distribution can give quantitative information about the genetic structure of populations. The isonymic relations between border communities in southern Bolivia and northern Argentina were analyzed from electoral registers for 89 sections included in four major administrative divisions, two from each country, that include the international frontier. The Euclidean and geographic distance matrices where estimated for all possible pairwise comparisons between sections. The average isonymic distance was lower between Argentine than between Bolivian populations. Argentine sections formed three clusters, of which only one included a Bolivian section. The remaining clusters were exclusively formed by sections from Bolivia. The isonymic distance was greater along the border. Regardless of the intense human mobility in the past as in the present, and the presence of three major transborder conurbations, the Bolivian-Argentine international boundary functions as a geographical and <b>administrative</b> <b>barrier</b> that diffferentially afffects the distribution and frequency of surnames.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of a specialized pediatric palliative home care team (PPHCT) as experienced by parents and health care professionals (HCPs). METHODS: Parents and HCPs involved in the care of terminally ill children who died and whom the PPHCT was in charge of were surveyed with questionnaires focusing on satisfaction with the PPHCT, satisfaction with the course of the dying phase, and the development of anxiety, depression, and prolonged grief disorder. RESULTS: Forty-three parent dyads participated (return rate, 88 %). Satisfaction with the PPHCT scored a median of 10 (numeric rating scale, 0 - 10). The child's death was predominantly experienced as very peaceful (median, 9); 71 % died at home. According to parents, involvement of the PPHCT led to highly significant (p< 0. 001) improvements in the children's symptoms and quality of life, as well as in aspects of communication and <b>administrative</b> <b>barrier</b> reduction. Anxiety was detected in 25 % of parents, depression in 19 %, and prolonged grief disorder in 13 %. HCPs (return rate, 83 %) evaluated all investigated care domains (particularly cooperation/communication/family support) as being significantly improved (p< 0. 001). Thirty-five percent of HCPs felt uncertain concerning pediatric palliative care; 79 % would welcome specific training opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: Involvement of a PPHCT is experienced as a substantial improvement of care by parents and HCPs. Coordination of palliative care during the last phase of life appears to be an important quality factor for the home care of dying children and their families...|$|E
40|$|Background: Kenya {{has made}} a policy {{decision}} to use contributory health insurance {{as one of its}} key pre-payment health financing mechanisms. The National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) is the main health insurer in Kenya. While the NHIF has hitherto focused its efforts on providing health insurance coverage to individuals in the formal sector, it has recently broadened its focus to include individuals in the informal sector. This paper provides an analysis of the perceptions, and experiences of informal sector individuals in Kenya with regard to enrolment with the NHIF.  Methods: We collected data through key informant interviews (39) in two purposefully selected counties. Study participants were drawn from healthcare facilities contracted by the NHIF, and current, former, and prospective informal sector members. We analyzed data using a grounded approach.  Results: Participants felt that the NHIF provided inadequate information about the registration and membership processes as well as benefit entitlements. There was variable and inconsistent communication by the NHIF. There was also variance between the official benefit package and the actual benefits received by members. The NHIF registration requirements and processes presented an <b>administrative</b> <b>barrier</b> to obtaining membership. The NHIF premium level and contribution mechanism presents a financial barrier to current and prospective members. Healthcare providers discriminated against NHIF members compared to cash-payers or private insurance holders.  Conclusions: The NHIF could improve enrolment and retention of informal sector individuals by; 1) using communication strategies that are effective at reaching the informal sector, 2) improving the affordability of the premium rates, 3) simplifying the enrolment requirements and process, and 4) strengthening accountability mechanisms between itself and healthcare facilities to ensure that enrolled members receive the benefits that they are entitled to, and that client experience at healthcare facilities are satisfactory...|$|E

Kohteena ovat Haaparannan-Tornion seutu, Suomen ja Ruotsin Pello, Tohmajärvi, Haapalampi (Karjalan Tasavallassa Venäjällä), Lappeenranta ja Viipuri. Esiin nostetaan näillä seuduilla asuvien nuorten käsityksiä itse rajasta ja sen takaisesta yhteiskunnasta. Pääasiallisena tutkimusaineistona ovat nuorten kirjoitelmat kotiseudustaan ja sen tulevaisuudesta 20 vuoden päästä. Lähtökohtana on, että nämä nuorten tuottamat tekstit ovat luonteeltaan poliittisia. Niissä tehdään poliittisia rajanvetoja 'meihin' ja 'heihin' kuuluvien ihmisten sekä 'meidän ja 'heidän' paikkojen välille. Tässä mielessä tutkimus kytkee yhteen politiikan tutkimuksellisen ja aluetieteellisen, määrättyjä tiloja (space) tarkastelevan tutkimusotteen. Kirja tuo esille sen, miten voimakas vaikutus valtiollisilla rajoilla on sen lähiseuduille. Rajan eri puolilla asuvat nuoret elävät eri maailmoissaan. Entiset valtioiden rajoja noudattamattomatkin seudut, Karjala ja Tornionlaakso, saavat nuorilta kansallisesti eriytyneet tulkintansa. Nuorille on myös kehittynyt erityinen rajaseutuidentiteetti, jonka kautta he erottautuvat, paitsi rajantakaisesta yhteiskunnasta, myös kansallisista keskuksista. Eri paikkakunnilla ja eri maissa asuvien nuorten välillä on kuitenkin eroja sen suhteen, miten jyrkkiä rajoja he eri kansallisuuksien ja valtioiden välille vetävät. Kirjassa tuodaan esille näitä vaihteluita ja pohditaan rajat ylittävän yhteistyön ja kansallisperustaisen ajattelun tulevaisuuden kehitystä. This {{research}} examines eight {{cases of}} national borderlands: four {{close to the}} Finnish-Swedish border and four close to the Finnish-Russian border. The basic principle underlying this research is that national borders (or boundaries) delineate national space and, thus, define the territorial space of a state. The other function of national borders is that they help to construct self-other relationships; borders are markers of national identities. However, neither spatial nor cultural borders need to be strictly separating lines; they can be of other types as well. As {{in the case of}} the U. S-Mexican border, even though the border creates social and economic asymmetry, it can also promote cultural integration and co-operation. Integrating, cross-border activities have a long history in Finnish-Swedish borderlands, first in the name of 'Norden', later in the form of the European Union's internal border cooperation. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Finnish-Russian border has, similarly, become more open and permissive for all kinds of cross-border cooperation, albeit the border traffic has been controlled as strictly as before. But does all this mean that boundaries no longer have any significance? This is hardly the case. In fact, it has been claimed that in spite of all the economic and administrative cross-border activity, cultural boundaries, stored in peoples' minds, can - and often do - remain unchanged. Cultural boundaries between identity groups are often handed down for centuries. This research examines how youth living in national borderlands interpret and map their worlds. How persistent or alternatively transient, are the boundaries that they construct? The analysis is based on a recent survey of textual material (essays and answers to a questionnaire), produced by young people (aged 10 to 16) living in borderlands. The research questions were: - How do young people define their worlds? What kind of spaces and identity groups do they construct? - What meanings do they give to national borders? How does the state boundary near which they live affect their spatial consciousness? - What kind of boundaries do they create between different spaces and identity groups? A hypothetical question was, whether the young people form such a political group that promotes a specific trans-border space and its identity? At first glance, it could be presumed that Finland's eastern and western borders are - more or less - clear antipodes. The western border exudes peace, harmony and free movement, and the eastern border reminds of the former Iron Curtain, a strictly controlled fence. However, when the spatial consciousness of borderlands youth was examined, these borders seemed to share more similarities than differences. National cleavages were evident even in the Finnish-Swedish borderland, Tornio River Valley and spatial identities (even local or regional ones) were constructed in relation to the different, 'other' nation or state, on the other side of the border. Despite the fact that there was practically no <b>administrative</b> <b>barrier</b> in the Tornio River Valley and the twin town Haparanda-Tornio was even infrastructurally integrated, local youth wanted to sustain the national-cultural boundaries between themselves, divisions into Finns and Swedes. Young people had also no interest whatsoever in moving across the border and living on the other side; in contrast, they were oriented towards national or provincial capitals. The cases along the Finnish-Russian border were even more extreme in this respect. Definitions of Finns and Russians where clear and protectionist patriotism flourished. Many literally turned their backs on the border. On the other hand, besides the fact that young people constructed cultural borders separating them from the 'other' side of the state boundary, they also built boundaries distinguishing their regions from the national centers. Therefore, the state boundary not only helped to create juxtapositional relations with the neighboring state/nation, but it had also encouraged a particular national borderlands mentality to develop. The latter aspect was experienced, however, both negatively and positively. For instance, the youth of Lappeenranta felt that their home district was a marginalized national periphery, or a transit zone of irritating and polluting cross-border traffic. The youth from the northernmost cases, of Lapland, in contrast, felt that their borderlands home was quiet and peaceful, an unspoilt natural reserve, far from urban and industrial problems, like congestion, heavy traffic or pollution. In sum, national state-boundaries have had a major influence on their surrounding country and communities; they have strongly differentiated the development of their adjacent areas. In each of the eight local cases, young people thought differently, and they had their own particular world views and spatial orders. Even if young people used the same place names and even if these places had a history of being trans-border (if not completely borderless) districts, like the Karelia or Tornedalia, these places were given completely different, both nationally and locally specific, meanings in the different localities. On the other hand, there were differences in opinions about the openness of the state-boundary. Russian youth seemed to be more outwards- and cross-border oriented than their Swedish or Finnish counterparts, albeit the possibilities for Russians to actually cross the border were - above all economically - more limited than in Sweden or Finland. Why was it meaningful to study youth in this matter? Shouldn't young people under voting age be treated as rather apolitical persons? Quite the contrary. This study was based on a broad conception of politics, adopted from Kari Palonen, according to which politics is an aspect, possible anywhere and practiced by anyone. In addition, every spatial representation and definition was seen here as a political act. Youth, however, have hardly been recognized as capable of making these kind of political statements. The significance of their 'us' - 'them', 'our place' - 'their place' dichotomies has been very much neglected. Therefore, this research contains a moral task of bringing forth the political voice of youth in this matter...|$|E
40|$|This article articulates the {{potentially}} fatal consequences of <b>administrative</b> <b>barriers</b> {{to the goal}} of developing poor countries and suggests retooling the current trade norms and policies in a developmentally-friendly manner. The article constructs the concept of <b>administrative</b> <b>barriers</b> centering on domestic regulations, i. e., antidumping measures, regulatory standards, and rules of origin, which have the most potential to obstruct development. It then highlights developmental hazards of these <b>administrative</b> <b>barriers.</b> It observes that both protectionist antidumping duties and the excruciating investigative procedures tend to offset developing countries 2 ̆ 7 comparative advantages in favor of developed countries 2 ̆ 7 domestic producers.

The article also contends that most preferential trade agreements between developed and developing countries are not a solution but yet another problem to development because of their complicated rules of origin which cancel out most opportunities for development through beneficial trade. The article then suggests retooling the current trade norms and policies to remedy this situation. It proposes that antidumping investigations be suspended or curtailed for low-income developing countries, that regulatory dialogue be pursued between rich importing countries and poor exporting countries in order to streamline standards and build capacity, and that rules of origin be loosened and simplified to offer developing countries expanded access to rich countries 2 ̆ 7 markets.

On the other hand, regions that have established low buy-out prices and taken steps to remove unnecessary <b>administrative</b> <b>barriers</b> to land privatization appear to have higher rates of land ownership by businesses, and to face lower levels of corruption in the privatization process.

Foreign investment is attracted by predictable, transparent, non-discriminatory regulations of the host country. Consequently, negative <b>administrative</b> <b>barriers</b> (legal and regulatory requirements for establishing, operating and locating a business) can deter foreign investors. Administrative processes in South Africa are not consistent, efficient and transparent and they generally interfere with the operation of free markets.

Although the implementation of standard care can lead to decrease the postoperative complications, but some factors causes the negative attitude in nurses and consequently lead to implementing the routine and non-standard care. The current study was conducted aimed to determine the level of observing standard tracheostomy care and some barriers from perspective of nurses.  Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study 42 nurses who were working in two selected hospitals in Tehran in 2013 were entered the study through census. Data were gathered through researcher made questionnaire for demographic data, observation checklist for standard tracheopstomy care and its barriers. The researcher observed 3 times concerning the how to care of tracheostomy by nurses and then nurses completed the demographic and barriers to standard care questionnaires. Data were analyzed by SPSS 21 using one sample T-test, independent T-test, chi-square, ANOVA and Pearsons’ correlation coefficient.   Results: According to results, only 2 nurses (4. 8 percent) performed the standard tracheostomy care.
