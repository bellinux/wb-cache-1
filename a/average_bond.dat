2500|$|Dunbar et al. also {{obtained}} X-ray crystallographic {{data for}} the TBP crystals at different temperatures. With respect to Figure 11, the equatorial Fe(1) atom is on the left, Fe(2) {{is in the middle}} and Fe(3) is on the right. Crystallographic data showed that the average M-L bond lengths for Fe(2) and Fe(3) ions to their respective cyanide ligands at 30 K were 1.94 Å and 1.95 Å and 1.96 Å and 1.96 Å at 110 K, respectively,. This is typical and representative of a LS FeII bond distance. The Fe(1) was significantly higher at 2.11 Å suggesting significant HS FeII character even though typical values reported for HS FeII sites are slightly higher. Typically, bond lengths determined by X-ray crystallography show a small decrease at increasing temperatures due to an increase in the amplitude of atom vibrations, which is the case seen here above 110 K for the average Co-N bond lengths (1.90 Å at 200 K and 1.89 Å at 298 K for the top axial CoIII ion and 1.88 Å at 200 K and 1.84 Å at 298 K for the bottom axial CoIII ion, Figure 11). This however, is not the case for the Fe-N bonds which show a systematic increase. At room temperature, 298 K, the <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> lengths for Fe(1) at 2.17 Å [...] and Fe(3) at 2.15 Å, are typical for HS FeII. The temperature induced change in the cluster geometry indicates a spin transition at these FeII sites. The Fe(2) site does not show a complete spin transition at room temperature however, with an <b>average</b> <b>bond</b> length of only 1.97 Å. Close examination of the crystal structure reveals that Fe(2) is slightly different from the other FeII equatorial sites, in that the 3, 4, 7, 8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, (tmphen), ligands on the Fe(1) and Fe(3) centers are engaged in intramolecular p-p interactions with both of the tmphen ligands on the Fe(2) center. With the information provided by these three techniques, it can be concluded that the FeII centers in this pentanuclear complex undergo SCO and that the phenomenon is affected by its coordination and solvent environment.|$|E

40|$|The {{conditions}} {{favorable for}} the development of uniform bond stress in a short anchorage length of a reinforcing bar in a pull-out test are rarely present in practical reinforced concrete (RC) members. The determination of a representative <b>average</b> ultimate <b>bond</b> stress for use when designing the anchorage of tensile bars in RC flexural members is complicated by fluctuating bond stress conditions arising from the presence of cracks crossing the anchorage length. This research is aimed at assessing typical bond failures at the anchorages of tensile bars in RC beams and slabs, and hence determining the representative value of <b>average</b> ultimate <b>bond</b> stress for designing the anchorages. An experimental study was conducted to assess the impacts of monotonically increasing loads on the anchorage requirements of small diameter deformed bars in tension, including the cases of end development and lapped splices. The study revealed that the value of the <b>average</b> ultimate <b>bond</b> stress that develops at failure in an anchorage is not only heavily dependent on the bar diameter, but is also dependent on the anchorage length. The measured value of <b>average</b> ultimate <b>bond</b> stress for shorter anchorage lengths is higher than that for longer anchorage lengths. Analytical modelling based on the structural mechanics of bond has been undertaken to reasonably represent the variable degree of plasticity in the concrete around an anchored bar, and to calculate a more reliable estimate of the <b>average</b> ultimate <b>bond</b> stress. The practical implications of the mean local bond stress-slip models for modelling longer anchorages have been assessed, and the bond-slip models have been recalibrated to account for the variations of <b>average</b> ultimate <b>bond</b> stress for different anchorage lengths and bar diameters. The recalibration of the bond-slip laws for selected RC anchorage specimens has been undertaken according to a viable analytical modelling procedure, and a modified model of the peak bond stress has been proposed for the splitting type bond failures typically observed in RC flexural members. Finite element modelling of the RC anchorage specimens has been undertaken using the recalibrated bond-slip laws and the numerical results are in good agreement with the laboratory measurements. The analytical and numerical modelling provides for rational simulations of the strength and failure modes of anchorages of tensile bars in RC flexural members...|$|R
