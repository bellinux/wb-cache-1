40|$|Superfine down powder was {{produced}} from down fiber {{after it was}} cut into short pieces and ground on a purpose-built machine. Scanning electron microscopy photographs showed that the down fiber was ground into particles with some fiber fragments and {{a large amount of}} rod-shaped ultrafine powder. Particle size distribution <b>analysis</b> indicated <b>that</b> the average size of the down powder was 1. 546 lm. Fourier transform infrared <b>analysis</b> showed <b>that</b> the absorbing peaks around 1640, 1520, and 1230 cm- 1 were sharper than those of the down fiber.

Thermogravimetric <b>analysis</b> showed <b>that</b> the thermal stability decreased when the down fiber was ground into powder.

5|$|Constantine Samuel Rafinesque briefly {{described}} the blackmouth catshark in his 1810 Caratteri di alcuni nuovi generi e nuove specie di animali e piante della Sicilia: con varie osservazioni sopra i medesimi, wherein he referenced the distinctive black interior of its mouth (from which the specific epithet melastomus is derived). No type specimen was designated. This species {{may also be}} called the black-mouthed dogfish. A 2005 phylogenetic <b>analysis</b> <b>that</b> included five Galeus species, based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found that G.melastomus forms a clade with G.murinus, apart from the clade of G.eastmani, G.gracilis, and G.sauteri.

5|$|Richardson {{envisioned a}} large {{auditorium}} {{of thousands of}} people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, {{and the size of the}} grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical <b>analysis,</b> <b>that</b> this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers.|$|E

5|$|The smog {{event of}} 1966 {{was preceded by}} two other major smog episodes in New York City: one in November 1953, and one in January–February 1963. Using {{statistical}} <b>analysis</b> <b>that</b> compares {{the number of deaths}} during periods of smog with the number of deaths during the same time in other years, medical scientists led by Leonard Greenburg were able to determine that excess deaths occurred during those smogs, from which it can be inferred that the smog caused or contributed to those deaths. An estimated 220–240 deaths were caused by the six-day 1953 smog, and an estimated 300–405 deaths were caused by the two-week 1963 smog. Other episodes of smog had occurred in the city prior to 1966, but were not accompanied by significant excess deaths.|$|E

5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy <b>analysis</b> <b>that</b> requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological <b>analysis</b> <b>that</b> studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E

5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow <b>analysis</b> <b>that</b> will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Mireille {{were from a}} poorly-organized area of convection, or thunderstorms, {{associated}} with the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands on September13. That day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began tracking {{the system as a}} tropical depression. The system moved westward, developing a large increase in thunderstorms over the center on September15. That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 21W at 00:00UTC, estimating 1‑minute sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph). About six hours later, the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Mireille, after satellite imagery indicated the storm was very compact and intensifying quickly. The JTWC later determined in a post-storm <b>analysis</b> <b>that</b> Mireille had attained tropical storm status 12hours earlier on the previous day.
