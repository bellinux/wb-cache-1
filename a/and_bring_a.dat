5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977). Despite its popularity, disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, the Thursday preceding the All-Star break. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> disco record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.|$|E

The Teamsters were vitally important to the Chicago labor movement, for a sympathy strike by the Teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout the city <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> strike into nearly every neighborhood.|$|E

25|$|The Teamsters were vitally {{important}} to the labor movement, for a strike or sympathy strike by the Teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> strike into nearly every neighborhood. It also meant that Teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes {{in order to avoid}} strikes, and control of a Teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues. During Shea's presidency, the entire Teamsters union was notoriously corrupt. Noted labor historian John R. Commons famously concluded that during this time, the Teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization.|$|E
25|$|Ben-Matityahu had Yodfat's limited {{supply of}} water rationed before the siege began. The Romans had heard of this and began to use their {{artillery}} to target efforts to draw water, hoping to exacerbate an already difficult situation <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> swift end to the siege. The Jews confounded these expectations by wringing out their clothes over the battlements until the walls were running with water, leading the Romans to believe they had some hidden {{supply of water}}. According to Josephus, this had the double effect of strengthening Roman resolve to take the city by force and the defenders' resolve to fight, hoping to die by the sword rather than thirst or starvation.|$|E
25|$|The {{world of}} concert touring was changed by Kiss's {{practice}} of erecting uniquely designed stage sets. Tours got larger, carrying more personnel and equipment, including sets, costumes, sound and lighting gear, pyrotechnics, all requiring more trucking, {{and the total}} cost increasing by millions of dollars. Kiss also innovated with a significant expansion of concert merchandising, selling non-musical Kiss-branded goods to concertgoers. The sales of merchandise helped pay for the concert expenses <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> profit to the band as well as give them more of a presence without relying solely on radio. Other bands copied Kiss by selling their own branded goods at concerts, a practice which became more of a necessity in the 1980s with increasing costs of touring.|$|E

25|$|The Siege of Namur, 25 May–30 June 1692, {{was a major}} {{engagement}} of the Nine Years' War, and {{was part of the}} French grand plan (devised over the winter of 1691–92) to defeat the forces of the Grand Alliance <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> swift conclusion to the war. Namur, sitting on the confluence of the Meuse and Sambre rivers, was a considerable fortress, and was a significant political and military asset. French forces, guided by Vauban, forced the town's surrender on 5 June, but the citadel, staunchly defended by Menno van Coehoorn, managed to hold on until 30 June before capitulating, bringing an end to the 36-day siege. Concerned that King William III planned to recapture the stronghold, King Louis XIV subsequently ordered his commander-in-chief, the duc de Luxembourg, to join battle with the Allies in the field, resulting in the bloody Battle of Steenkerque on 3 August.|$|E

25|$|Between 39–38 BC, the Roman general Publius Ventidius Bassus {{defeated}} the Parthian army, sending troops {{under the command}} of Poppaedius Silo to await the arrival of Herod. Herod landed at Ptolemais and began his campaign against Antigonus with the conquest of the Galilee, marched down the coast to take Jaffa and then relieved Masada, where his family was still holed up. He then marched on Jerusalem, hoping to capture the city <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>a</b> swift end to the war. Faced with corruption among his Roman officers, mutinuous Roman troops and Antigonus' guerrillas, however, Herod was forced to abandon his siege of Jerusalem. He operated in Judea, Samaria and the Galilee instead, fighting against both insurgents and bandits, while sending his brother Joseph to deal with Idumaea. By late 38 BC, reinforced by several Roman legions and having fought two years of counter-insurgency, Herod was finally able to pacify the Galilee and march south towards Jerusalem. Antigonus attempted to face Herod in a pitched battle, striking against both Jericho and Samaria, but both efforts were defeated. Herod once again pitched camp outside Jerusalem, though the onset of winter brought military operations to a halt.|$|E
