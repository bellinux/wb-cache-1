Telomeres are the extreme ends of chromosomes and shorten progressively during every cell cycle and therefore can be considered an indicator of biological age. In heart failure, telomere length is severely reduced. In the current review, we will discuss the emerging role of telomere biology in the pathophysiology of heart failure.

40|$|Abstract. Excavations {{conducted}} at the cemeteries of Marcianopolis, <b>a</b> <b>major</b> Roman city of Moesia Inferior Province, revealed both typical and some unusual funerary practices used by local citzens. Most of burials were made by inhumation and only a fey by cremation. The funerary practices at Marcianopolis show a diversity, which was due to its multi-ethnical population and various traditions in the city. Ever since its localization in early 19 th century, the ancient city of Marcianopolis in Moesia Inferior (in Northeastern Bulgaria) has always attracted the minds and efforts of many scholars because of its long and most successful history. During 2 nd- 3 d c. AD it was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> Roman <b>economical,</b> military and administrative centre, which benefited a lot due to its closeness to the Western Black Sea coastline and well organized road system in the region. After late 3 d c.

AD (Gerov 1975, 49 - 72). Now its ruins are covered over by the contemporary town of Devnya. According to Iordanes, the city was established under Trajan {{at the beginning of}} 2 nd c.
