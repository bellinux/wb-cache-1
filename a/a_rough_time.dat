They also lost Asia Cup, World T20 and Champions Trophy very cheaply and moved down to 8 ad 7 places in rankings as well. With all these, Bangladesh toured Sri Lanka and drawn all formats, whereas Zimbabwe also recorded their first series win against Sri Lanka and the captaincy of Mathews was criticized for many reasons for their losses. Though he injured several times in his captaincy career, and replaced by Upul Tharanga in many winning notes, reporters suggested that Mathews will not captain until 2019 Cricket World Cup.|$|E
500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>time.</b> She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E

At various times, but particularly during the tenure of Bobby Robson, the media campaigned for the appointment of Brian Clough. Robson once told FA chairman Bert Millichip [...] "I'm having <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>time</b> and everybody wants Brian– give the job to him. If he's successful, everybody's happy. If he fails, that's {{the end of the}} clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager." [...] Robson added, [...] "He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed the corridors of power but I think {{he would have been a}} good England manager. He had good judgement, knew how to design a team and was a great motivator." [...] Terry Venables was also the subject of a media campaign for dismissal during his time as manager but was then supported by the press to return to the role in 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Clough was {{a popular}} choice to be {{appointed}} England manager throughout the 1970s and 1980s. However, it was widely felt that the FA were uneasy about appointing him {{on account of his}} numerous outspoken comments about the English football authorities. He was interviewed for the job twice, in 1977 and 1982, but lost out to Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson respectively. Such was the demand for Clough to be given the job that incumbent manager Robson told then-FA chairman Sir Bert Millichip: 'I'm having <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>time</b> and everybody wants Brian – give the job to him. If he's successful, everybody's happy. If he fails, that's the end of the clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} {{were written in}} October 2013, when Gunnulfsen was highly {{inspired}} by ghosts and spirits. These same two items–ghosts and spirits–would {{be incorporated into the}} Gunnulfsen's lyrics. [...] "St. Patrick" [...] was written in the fall of 2013, during a day-off from tour; a demo of it was recorded within two hours. The song is about Gunnulfsen's girlfriend, who helped her during <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> <b>time</b> in her life. Gunnulfsen didn't think the band would record it; she thought it was [...] "too poppy." [...] "My House" [...] is about a poltergeist and is [...] "also a metaphor for a person, being like, 'Go away.'" [...] "Holy", according to Gunnulfsen, is [...] "one of the most personal and honest songs" [...] featured on the album. The song is about a person who had a problem with Gunnulfsen being gay. [...] "White Noise" [...] came about as a spur of the moment idea. Gunnulfsen had previous noticed something on Tumblr about Poltergeist and [...] "I was like, 'Oh! That's perfect". The demo of the song was under the working title [...] "White Boiz" [...] and featured a different drum beat in the chorus. The group replaced this different drum beat with a [...] "half-time, really dragging beat" [...] and experimented with an EBow. [...] "Fire" [...] was written after [...] "a very intense" [...] encounter with a person, resulting in the song coming across as [...] "very raw and real", according to Gunnulfsen.|$|E
