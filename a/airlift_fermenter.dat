40|$|Two {{types of}} airlift fermenters, {{conventional}} (UT-ALF) and modified (CDT-ALF) were investigated {{to evaluate their}} performance with respect to baker’s yeast growth. The riser tube of conventional external loop <b>airlift</b> <b>fermenter</b> {{is replaced by a}} converging-diverging tube. The new reactor is called modified airlift reactor. The results were compared for the two types of <b>airlift</b> <b>fermenter</b> (UT-ALF and CDT-ALF). Growth rates (dx/dt) were determined from experimental data for both the reactors under identical operating conditions and compared. CDT-ALF always shows higher growth rate compared to UT-ALF under any operating condition. Maximum growth was reported in CDT-ALF at 50 gm/l initial glucose conc. and 1. 0 vvm air flow rate which was 20 % higher than UT-ALF. Yield (YX/S) was found to be 0. 51 which is theoretically very near to maximum achievable value...|$|E

40|$|Lipolytic fungi we {{isolated}} from the soil and food samples using a selective isolation medium. The isolated fungal cultures were screened for found to produce maximum lipase. The fungus Rhizopus arrhizus (isolate: 52) was found to produce maximum lipase. The fermentation medium M 5, consisting of (g/dm 3) :- olive oil, 20; yeast extract 1. 0; magnesium sulphate heptahydrate 0. 25; calcium carbonate, 5. 0 {{was found to be}} the best medium for lipase formation by Rhizopus arrhizus. The cultural conditions like medium composition, pH, aeration rate and incubation temperature were optimized for the production of the intracellular lipase by Rhizopus arrhizus in sake flasks. The optimization of the fermentation conditions resulted in about three fold increase in the production of lipases. This optimized medium gave 13. 5 g/dm 3 fungal biomass with 325 lipase units/g dry mycelium and bout 2. 4 units extracellular lipase per cm 3 of the broth. The fermentation was also carried out in 18 dm 3 stirred fermenter and 4 dm 3 airlift production. The <b>airlift</b> <b>fermenter</b> was found to be especially suitable for the intracellular lipase production. In it, the fungus Rhizopus arrhizus produced 375 units lipase per gram mycelium and 14. 2 g mycelium per dm 3 medium. In stirred fermenter,, however, both fungal biomass and intracellular lipase activity were comparatively low. Rhizopus arrhizus was also cultured in solid substrate fro extracellular lipase production. Different agricultural by products such as wheat bran, gram bran, rice husk, soybean meal and rice bran were evaluated for lipase production. A mixture of wheat bran and soybean meal, however, was found to be the best substrate. Additives like olive oil and the egg yolk emulsion increased lipase production. The extracellular and intracellular lipase of the mould Rhizopus arrhizus were used for the biocatalysis of esterification reactions. Free excellular lipase showed very low esterification activity (28 esterification units/g) whereas the celite immobilized lipase catalyzed synthesis of hexyl octanoate at the rate of 51 micromoloe/min/gram. Mycelial lipase of Rhizopus arrhizus, however, was very active in organic media and performed the synthetic work efficiently. In n-hexane, at 30 oC the mycelial lipase of Rhizopus arrhizus Catalyzed the synthesis of hexyl octanoate at a rate of 92 micromoles/min/gram mycelium. The mycelial lipase of Rhizopus arrhizus was also used for the production of fragrant esters from the fusel oil and terpene alcohols. Geranyl butyrate and butyrate of fusel oil were manufactured using a packed column reactor. In case of the fusel oil, ester yield of 87...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial spores are {{specialized}} {{differentiated cell}} types for types, {{specifically designed for}} the survival of adverse conditions. Their structure is highly unique and very different from the structure of normal vegetative bacterial cells. Spores cause massive problems in the food industry, because their remarkable resistance allows them to survive food processing and conservation methods. The spore-forming Bacillus cereus is an important food-borne pathogen, is famous for its ability to cause food poisoning, and is a n important spoilage organism in pasteurized dairy products. The work presented in this thesis has focused on the formation, structure and germination of B. cereus spores. An easy and efficient way of producing synchronized and homogeneous B. cereus spore batches was developed, using a chemically defined medium in combination with an <b>airlift</b> <b>fermenter</b> system. This setup allowed precise monitoring and manipulation of key growth- and sporulation parameters. The conditions employed resulted in synchronous growth and sporulation, which facilitated gene-expression studies. The kinetics of expression of sigA, sigB, sigF and sigG followed the model developed for Bacillus subtilis, underscoring the conservation of sporulation mechanisms among b acilli. B. cereus was able to form spores on the chemically defined medium without glucose but with lactate as a main carbon source. Sporulation was not induced by nutrient limitation, because significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen sources were still present when the cells started to sporulate. The presence of glutamate delayed the final stages of sporulation, but not the moment of sporulation initiation. Clearly, the concentration of glutamate influenced key spore properties such as heat resistance and germination. The alternative sigma factor σ B, encoded by the sigB gene, is an important stress response regulator of B. cereus. An increase in sigB transcription was observed upon glucose depletion, coinciding with the transition from exponential growth to the stationary phase. This increase was specifically associated with the depletion of glucose. Deletion of sigB {{had a significant impact on}} spore heat resistance and spore germination properties. Spore heat resistance is caused by the physicochemical structure of the spore, which protects vital spore components such as membranes, proteins, and the DNA. A spin-probe-based Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) method for measuring the internal structure of intact bacterial spores was developed and applied, and provided the first direct data on the aqueous environment in the various compartments of B. subtilis and B. cereus spores. From the results obtained, it was concluded that the core cytoplasm is not in a glassy state. Instead, a three-dimensional molecular matrix incorporating free but highly viscous water exists in the core. Notably, neither heat activation nor partial germination (the excretion of DPA but not full rehydration and enzyme activity) altered the structural properties of the core matrix significantly. Complete germination resulted in the disappearance of the structure in the core, and a decrease of the micro viscosity in the core cytoplasm to levels encountered in normal vegetative cells. For a quantitative analysis of the behavior of individual spores in a large, germinating spore-population, a flow cytometry (FCM) method was developed and applied. By using several different fluorescent dyes, distinct germination parameters such as DNA accessibility and esterase activity were quantified. Finally, spore properties from a large number of B. cereus strains, including the B. cereus laboratory model strain ATCC 14579 and a number of recent isolates from environmental and industrial settings were analyzed. The strains tested showed a large variation in heat resistance, and the majority had a higher heat resistance than the laboratory model strain. With respect to germination, many of the strains were less sensitive to the nutrients tested as compared to the laboratory model strain. Heat activation and ageing enhanced germination in response to several nutrients in various isolates. The knowledge that was gained and the methods that were developed in this study are expected to contribute to progress in the spore research field, and to enhanced spore control in the food industry...|$|E
