40|$|This paper {{describes}} an audio {{system that is}} wellsuited {{for use in a}} small confined area with many <b>audio</b> <b>transmitters</b> broadcasting different <b>audio</b> signals. The <b>transmitter</b> of the proposed system is constructed using visible light LHDs, in which current fed to the LEDs is modulated and encoded with audio information or messages. The audio system provides audio signal transmission in a free space optical link. The receiver, combined with an ear jack, is located at some distance from the transmitters. The handheld receiver is designed to demodulate the optically transmitted audio information and reproduce the messages with the car jack. For modulating emission of T,HDs, an oscillator is used to vary the frequency of on/off periods of the LCDs. The frequency of flicker is high enough to be indistinguishable by human eye and hence the LRDs appear to be constantly illuminated. © 1999 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5000|$|There {{would be}} at least one attempt to revive the Apex band concept. Beginning in May 1946, {{consulting}} radio engineer Sarkes Tarzian operated a 200-watt experimental AM station, W9XHZ, on 87.75 MHz in Bloomington, Indiana. After two years of successful operation of what he referred to as his [...] "HIFAM" [...] station, in 1948 he proposed that the FCC allocate a small high-frequency broadcast band, 400 kHz wide with 10 kHz spacing between frequency assignments. Tarzian promoted this as a low-cost alternative to expensive FM transmitters and receivers, saying that a $5.95 converter could be added to existing AM radios {{that would allow them to}} pick up the HIFAM stations. He continued to operate his experimental station, which eventually became KS2XAP, until 1950, although by then its transmitting hours were greatly restricted, as the FCC required the station to remain off the air whenever nearby WFBM-TV in Indianapolis was broadcasting. This was due to the fact that the TV station's <b>audio</b> <b>transmitter</b> used the same frequency as Tarzian's station. Moreover, after his station's final license expired on June 1, 1950 the FCC denied Tarzian any further renewals, concluding it would not reverse its earlier determination that there was no need for a second AM broadcast band.|$|E
5000|$|He {{founded the}} {{manufacturing}} company Sarkes Tarzian Enterprises in 1944, and {{was involved in}} early experiments in VHF audio broadcasting in 1946. In May of that year, he began operating a 200 watt experimental AM station, W9XHZ, on 87.75 MHz in Bloomington. He used the station to provide programming to the local community, including Indiana University and Bloomington High School Football games, special events, and live band music from local high schools. Because standard AM radios could not tune to his station's high frequency, Tarzian modified {{a small number of}} sets himself and distributed them throughout the community. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had recently established the FM radio band on 88.1-107.9 Mhz, but FM receivers were expensive purchases. After two years of successful operation of what he referred to as his [...] "HIFAM" [...] station, in 1948 Tarzian proposed that the FCC allocate a small high-frequency HIFAM broadcast band, saying that an affordable $5.95 converter could be added to existing AM radios to make them capable of receiving the HIFAM stations.

50|$|A common {{technique}} {{to deal with}} RFI within the observed frequency bandwidth, is to employ RFI detection in software. Such software can find samples in time, frequency or time-frequency space that are contaminated by an interfering source. These samples are subsequently ignored in further analysis of the observed data. This process {{is often referred to}} as data flagging. Because most transmitters have a small bandwidth and are not continuously present such as lightning or citizens' band (CB) radio devices, most of the data remains available for the astronomical analysis. However, data flagging can not solve issues with continuous broad-band transmitters, such as windmills, digital video or digital <b>audio</b> <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R
