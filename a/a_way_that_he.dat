25|$|The second volume, I Am Spock (1995), saw Nimoy {{communicating}} that {{he finally}} realized {{his years of}} portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely, Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never would have thought {{if he had not}} portrayed the character. As such, in this autobiography Nimoy maintains that in some meaningful sense he has merged with Spock {{while at the same time}} maintaining the distance between fact and fiction.|$|E
25|$|Ipomadon {{travels the}} world, {{fighting}} in tournaments, becomes King of Apulia following his father's death, and hears {{one day that}} the Proud is being besieged in her city by a knight called Lyoline. This ugly knight is threatening to take her away with him to India. Ipomadon {{makes his way to}} King Maleager's court once again, just in time to witness the arrival of the Proud's messenger, begging for some assistance for her lady. But curiously, Ipomadon has chosen to arrive at King Maleager's court in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not recognised, not even by the queen. He pretends to be a fool, and the reader (or listener) is treated to a comic scene in which the fool Ipomadon is first ridiculed and then accepted by the knights and noblemen, little knowing who he really is. Cabanus is conveniently absent from court on this occasion. The maiden who has been sent as a messenger by the Proud is mightily unimpressed that a fool should wish to take on the challenge, but since nobody else in the court seems at all inclined to offer their services, the king allows Ipomadon the fool to take it up.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1917, Werfel left the {{frontline}} for the Military Press Bureau in Vienna, where he joined other notable Austrian writers serving as propagandists, among them Robert Musil, Rilke, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Franz Blei. Through the latter, Werfel met {{and fell in love}} with Alma Mahler, widow of Gustav Mahler, the former lover of the painter Oskar Kokoschka, and the wife of the architect Walter Gropius, then serving in the Imperial German Army on the Western Front. Alma, who was also a composer, had already set one of Werfel’s poems to music, reciprocated despite Werfel being much younger, shorter, and having Jewish features that she, being both anti-Semitic and attracted to Jewish men, found initially distasteful. Their love affair culminated in the premature birth of a son, Martin, in August 1918. Martin, who was given the surname of Gropius, died in May of the following year. Despite attempts to save his marriage to Alma, with whom he had a young daughter, Manon, Gropius reluctantly agreed to a divorce in 1920. Ironically, Alma refused to marry Werfel for the next nine years. However, Alma, more so than with her first two husbands and lovers, lent herself to the development of Werfel’s career and influenced it in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became an accomplished playwright and novelist as well as poet. They married on 6 July 1929.|$|E

25|$|Being {{a lonely}} Serbian Anglophile Mijatović {{wished to be}} {{appointed}} as the first Serbian Minister in London, but {{had to wait until}} October 1884 when he became the second Serbian Minister at the Court of St James's. During this tenure he came into contact with many influential persons but his diplomatic post in London soon ended since he was appointed to be the sole Serbian negotiator in Bucharest where peace negotiations were scheduled following the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Serbia attacked Bulgaria on November 14, 1885 and within two weeks suffered a humiliating defeat. It was thanks to the Secret Convention signed with Austria-Hungary that Serbia was {{able to get out of}} the war without suffering more serious consequences. In Bucharest Miyatović and the Bulgarian representative Ivan Evstratiev Geshov concluded, on March 3, 1886, one of the shortest treaties in diplomatic history with one article only: „Article seul et unique. – L’état de paix qui a cessé d’exister entre le Royaume de Serbie et le Principauté du Bulgarie le 2–14 Novembre, 1885, est rétabli à partir de l’échange de ratification du present traité qui aura lieu à Bucharest.” Mijatović proved to be a peacemaker since he had ignored instructions from Belgrade that were prepared in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was supposed to find an excuse for new war. Apparently Mijatović was more worried about what sort of reputation he would have in England if negotiations failed than about criticism from Belgrade for his conciliatory approach.|$|E
25|$|Papak was {{the grand}} priest {{of the temple}} of Anahita in Istakhr {{and the father of}} Ardashir, the founder of the Sasanian house, with the {{beginning}} of whose reign religion sat on the Persian throne. Papak's religious credit might have helped him in taking the power from Gochihr, then Persian governor who had no interest in following the religion of fire. In a scratched picture, Papak and his son Shapur are shown on a wall in Takht-e Jamshid; in the picture, Papak and Shapur both wear the same helmet similar to that of Shapur I's in his coins; in the picture, Shapur is visualized in the dual place of shah-priest in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> squeezes the hilt of his sword by one hand and manipulates the fire in the fireplace and adds woods by the other hand; and Shapur, son of Papak, squeezes his sword by one hand and takes a ring having a ribbon which is the royal symbol by the other hand on horseback. In his coins, Ardashir, who replaces his brother Shapur as the ruler of Pars in 220, wears the same crown as Shapur's, from the front however, and the picture of his father Papak is drawn behind. Zoroastrianism was the believed and supported religion of the Sasanians until Ardashir's takeover. The current belief is that the priests of the fire temples became noticed and respected by Ardashir's uprising and the opponents were disturbed; but this narrative is the subject of controversy today. Although no remarkable authority of Zoroastrianism had a high rank in Ardashir's court, it seems that the first attempts to establish Zoroastrianism as a government religion was done during Ardashir's period; also the remaining Achaemenid, Hellenic and Parthian traditions were combined and used in that era.|$|E
500|$|When {{their efforts}} to get the Flood {{manuscript}} published failed, the Earps decided to appeal to Burns, whose own book was near publication. But he was not interested. His book {{was about to be}} published, free of the constraints imposed by a collaboration with Earp. Burns wrote them, [...] "I should not now care to undertake another book which, in part at least, would be upon much the same lines... I should have been delighted six months ago to accept your offer but it is too late now. My book has championed Mr. Earp's cause throughout and I believe will vindicate his reputation in Tombstone in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will like." [...] When Burns turned them down, Josephine actively worked to stop the publication of his book, fearful that {{their efforts to}} publish Wyatt's biography would be thwarted as a result.|$|E

500|$|Pomp, {{ritual and}} luxury were discarded. These caused Pedro II {{to be viewed}} as [...] "a great citizen" [...] in the popular imagination, {{but at the same time}} his image as a monarch, as a living symbol and {{authority}} figure diminished. As a German journalist remarked in 1883: [...] "It is a rare thing, in the Emperor's situation: he has no personal fortune and his civil list, already by itself insufficient, is almost all expended on charity, in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> cannot afford any pomp in the court, nor do anything to give any gleam to his residences [...] It undoubtedly does great honor to the man, but contributes little to the necessary prestige of the Emperor." [...] But the society in which the Emperor lived put great store in ceremonials and customs, and the Emperor had discarded much of the symbolism and aura with which the Imperial system was imbued.|$|E
500|$|In 1925, Earp {{began to}} {{collaborate}} on a biography {{with his friend}} and former mining engineer John Flood to get his story told in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> approved. Flood volunteered his time and attempted to write an authorized biography of Earp's life, based on Earp's recollections. The two men sat together every Sunday {{in the kitchen of}} Earp's modest, rented bungalow. While Wyatt sipped a drink and smoked a cigar, they tried to tell Earp's story, but Josephine was always present. She often interrupted and insisted, [...] "You can't write that! It needs to be clean." [...] She also demanded that they add more [...] "pep" [...] to the manuscript, which in her mind meant including the word [...] "CRACK!" [...] in all capitals. In the chapter about the shootout, the manuscript includes 109 uses of [...] "CRACK". She thought Earp needed to be shown as a hero, and the manuscript includes a chapter titled [...] "Conflagration" [...] in which Earp saves two women, one a cripple, from a Tombstone fire.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of [...] "The Broken Man", series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss spoke {{about some of the}} thought process behind the motivations of the characters that were featured prominently in the episode. David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E

500|$|Hata {{is known}} as a strong {{opponent}} of the attempts by some Japanese nationalists to revise Japan's wartime history in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> deems ideologically biased. Hata, whom the Wall Street Journal described as an advocate of the [...] "we-did-wrong view" [...] of Japanese history, has expressed grave concern about the advent of new historical revisionists seeking to apologize for Japan's wartime aggressions and absolve former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. In 1995 Hata stepped down from a government commission on {{the construction of a new}} war museum near Yasukuni Shrine in fear that the project would be used to glorify Japan's wartime actions. He favors the de-enshrinement of war criminals from Yasukuni Shrine and is also a critic of Yūshūkan, a museum near the shrine, for its nationalist-inspired portrayal of Japanese history. While he has been strongly critical of efforts by Japanese nationalist groups to alter history textbooks, Hata also agreed to testify for the Ministry of Education against left-wing historian Saburō Ienaga who believed that his textbook was being censored by the Japanese government. Hata has supported the work of the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, despite noting that the textbook which the Society had authored [...] "was colored more strongly by nationalism than others".|$|E
500|$|After a {{slow start}} to the 1914 season, Hobbs {{recorded}} a string of centuries, including a score of 226, his highest at that time. The looming First World War overshadowed much of the season. Cricket initially continued once the war began, but as the Oval had been requisitioned by the military, Hobbs' benefit match was moved from the Oval to Lord's. This move, and the public's preoccupation with the war, consigned the game to a financial failure; in total Hobbs' benefit raised £657, lower than most benefits and far less than usually raised for cricketers of Hobbs' standing. The Surrey committee agreed to give him another benefit when the war concluded. Hobbs scored his 11th century of the season before public pressure terminated the cricket season. During the winter, the MCC declared Surrey as County Champions; although the war prevented the completion of all the matches, Surrey led comfortably enough for the other counties not to object. This {{was the only time}} in Hobbs' career that Surrey were champions. In all first-class games in 1914, he scored 2,697 runs at 58.63. As the war began, Hobbs reputation was at its peak; he was described by Wisden as [...] "one of the greatest bats of his generation". McKinstry states that during the season: [...] "With his free-scoring method, [...] had dazzled in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was never to do again." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with many}} critics praising {{the return of}} Mac and the increased role of peripheral characters, the resolution to the rape mystery, and the setup of the next major story arc. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "great". He wrote that [...] "Spit & Eggs" [...] was a welcome episode for longtime fans, as it involved several plots converging in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> found satisfactory. He praised the final few scenes, writing that the episode transitions {{well into the next}} mystery of Dean O'Dell's death by developing it slowly {{over the course of the}} season's prior episodes, but he was more mixed towards the reveal of Mercer as the rapist, commenting [...] "the ultimate revelation can't help but be a little underwhelming, since not enough time has been spent on any of the credible suspects to really have a good handle on them or be invested in them one way or another." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, who was quite critical of the rape storyline in earlier episodes, said that the conclusion made the storyline slightly better overall. He praised the double reveal of Mercer and Moe as accomplices, stating, [...] "That twist overall is effective because it plays on everyone's expectations. The characters all believe there is a single culprit here. [...] It makes the revelations more plausible, while also making the need for those revelations less intense (the two are related)." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the open}} game world, Rocksteady {{included}} more villains to create challenges for Batman. Hugo Strange {{was selected as}} a primary antagonist, as his power and controlling manner help maintain the lockdown on Arkham City once Batman enters. Strange is aware of Batman's true identity, making Batman [...] "vulnerable and exposed in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has never been before", according to Hill. He noted that Strange is a character new to many players but that his backstory and character are detailed throughout the game. Catwoman was also included based on her long history with Batman, though she was given her own agenda running parallel to the events within Arkham City. Catwoman's missions initially ended with her coming to Batman's aide, but late in development, the developers decided to give the player an alternate choice, allowing them to have the morally grey Catwoman leave the city with her loot; the addition was implemented in two days. Batman's sidekick Robin also appears, featuring a shaved head and contemporary costume design that were intended {{to move away from}} his traditional [...] "Boy Wonder" [...] image. Senior concept artist Kan Muftic explained: [...] "Our vision of Robin is the one of a troubled young individual that is calm and introverted at times, but very dangerous and aggressive if provoked. The shaved head is inspired by cage fighters, because we thought that Robin might be doing that in his spare time to keep him on his toes. Still, we kept all the classic trademarks of Robin's appearance, such as the red and yellow colors of his outfit, the cape and the mask." [...] Rocksteady originally did not plan to include Robin in the main story but later decided to as an authentic means of delivering new gadgets to Batman, as well as to introduce their version of the character and his relationship with Batman.|$|E
500|$|Roxas' {{character}} {{has received a}} positive critical response from both fans and video game publications. During February 2010, Roxas was twenty-eighth in a Famitsu poll featuring the most popular video game characters from Japan. In another poll, Roxas was voted the second most popular Kingdom Hearts character with his fight against Sora ranked as the best scene from the series. His fighting sequences from the first game's secret ending were {{called one of the}} best video game cinematic moments by GameSpy. While reviewing Kingdom Hearts II Jeff Haynes of IGN said that Roxas was a [...] "likable kid". Ron Fahey of Eurogamer had a similar view, calling him a [...] "likeable enough young chap who just happens to be troubled by memories and visions of people he doesn't even know". His playable position in the game was regarded as a transitional arc, being used to introduce the gameplay to players who are new to the franchise. Cavin Smith of PSX Extreme also called Roxas a likable character and stated that the revelation regarding his existence in Kingdom Hearts II is [...] "a shocker of a revelation for any RPG!" [...] The New York Times liked the fact that the player controls Roxas in Kingdom Hearts IIs introduction instead of the protagonist Sora, avoiding the continuation of Sora's search for his friends. Additionally, the reviewer found the switch from Roxas' story to Sora's after a few hours [...] "a little jarring". Andrew Reiner from Game Informer emphasizes his role as a [...] "troubled boy," [...] calling his story arc [...] "an amazing chain of events," [...] particularly noting that the revelation of his nature as a Nobody creates a [...] "devilish yet remarkable plot twist" [...] which may impact the player in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "may not want Sora back". On the other hand, UGO Networks commented that due to the game's initial focus on Roxas, gamers would have to wait until playing as Sora to experience the most exciting parts of the title.|$|E
