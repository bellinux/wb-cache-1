5000|$|The {{story begins}} with a general {{description}} of [...] "the hunger artist" [...] and then narrows in on a single performer, the protagonist. The <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> performed in <b>a</b> cage for the curious spectators, and was attended by teams of watchers (usually three butchers) who ensured {{that he was not}} secretly eating. Despite such precautions, many, including some of the watchers themselves, were convinced that the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> cheated. Such suspicions annoyed the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist,</b> as did the forty-day limit imposed on his fasting by his promoter, or [...] "impresario". The impresario insisted that after forty days public sympathy for the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> inevitably declined. The <b>hunger</b> <b>artist,</b> however, found the time limit irksome and arbitrary, as it prevented him from bettering his own record, from fasting indefinitely. At the end of <b>a</b> fast the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist,</b> amid highly theatrical fanfare, would be carried from his cage and made to eat, both of which he always resented.|$|R

5000|$|These performances, {{followed}} by intervals of recuperation, were repeated for many years. Despite his fame, the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> felt dissatisfied and misunderstood. If a spectator, observing his apparent melancholy, tried to console him, he would erupt in fury, shaking {{the bars of}} his cage. The impresario would punish such outbursts by apologizing to the audience, pointing out that irritability was a consequence of fasting. He would then mention the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist's</b> boast that he could fast much longer than he was doing, but would show photographs of the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> near death {{at the end of}} a previous fast. In this way he suggested that the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist's</b> sadness and poor physique was caused by fasting, when, in the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist's</b> view, he was depressed because of the premature cessation of his fasts. The impresario's [...] "perversion of the truth" [...] further exasperated the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... "A Hunger Artist" [...] (German: [...] "Ein Hungerkünstler") is a {{short story}} by Franz Kafka first {{published}} in Die neue Rundschau in 1922. The story was {{also included in the}} collection <b>A</b> <b>Hunger</b> <b>Artist</b> (Ein Hungerkünstler), the last book Kafka prepared for publication, printed by Verlag Die Schmiede after Kafka's death. The protagonist, <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> who experiences the decline in appreciation of his craft, is an archetypical creation of Kafka: an individual marginalized and victimized by society at large. The title of the story has been translated also to [...] "A Fasting Artist" [...] and [...] "A Starvation Artist".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hunger</b> <b>artists</b> or {{starvation}} {{artists were}} performers, common in Europe and America in the 18th, 19th and early 20th century, who starved themselves {{for extended periods}} of time, for the amusement of paying audiences. The phenomenon {{first appeared in the}} 17th century and saw its heyday in the 1880s. <b>Hunger</b> <b>artists</b> were almost always male, traveled from city to city and performed widely advertised fasts of up to 40 days. Several <b>hunger</b> <b>artists</b> were found to have cheated during their performances.|$|R

Let Them Eat Jellybeans title was a portmanteau referring to Reagan's favorite candy and Marie Antoinette's monarchic [...] "Let them eat cake" [...] quip allengedly lobbed at France's starving peasantry two centuries hence. The phrase had gained popularity in the media after Reagan had cut food programs that supported children from low-income families, with military veterans during <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> strike, and <b>artist</b> Jimmy Ernst incorporated the phrase into his collage work in the early 1980s. The album cover and title also inspired an ironic Reagan-era button worn by critics of the president and traded by pin collectors. For the album's 35th anniversary, artist Shepard Fairey made an original print combining the Reagan motif with other emblems of Winston Smith's work with the Dead Kennedys.|$|R

50|$|Seemingly overnight, popular tastes {{changed and}} public fasting {{went out of}} fashion. The <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> broke his ties with the {{impresario}} and hired himself to a circus, where he hoped to perform truly prodigious feats of fasting. No longer a main attraction, {{he was given a}} cage {{on the outskirts of the}} circus, near the animal cages. Although the site was readily accessible, and crowds thronged past on their way to see the animals, any spectators who stopped to see him created an obstruction in the flow of people on their way to the animals. At first the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> looked forward to the passing of the crowds, but in time he grew irritated by the noise and disruption caused by the people, and the stench, the roaring, and the feeding of the animals depressed him. Eventually, the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> was completely ignored. No one, not even the artist himself, counted the days of his fast. One day an overseer noticed the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist's</b> cage with its dirty straw. He wondered why the cage was unused; when he and the attendants inspected it, however, they found the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> near death. Before he died he asked forgiveness and confessed that he should not be admired, since the reason he fasted was simply that he could not find food to his liking. The <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> was buried with the straw of his cage and replaced by a panther. Spectators crowded about the panther's cage because the panther took so much joy in life, unlike the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist.</b> The story also mentions that the panther was always brought the food he liked, a hint to the readers that can be interpreted in many ways.|$|R

50|$|The {{starving}} {{artist is}} a typical figure of Romanticism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, seen in many paintings and works of literature. In 1851, Henri Murger wrote about four starving artists in Scènes de la Vie de Bohème, {{the basis for the}} operas La bohème by Puccini and Leoncavallo by Leoncavallo. In 1890, Knut Hamsun's novel, Hunger, depicted a period of a starving artist's life. In 1924, Franz Kafka wrote a short story called <b>A</b> <b>Hunger</b> <b>Artist</b> about a man who is world-famous for his public performances of fasting.|$|E
5000|$|Whether the protagonist's {{starving}} is seen {{as spiritual}} or artistic, the panther {{is regarded as the}} <b>hunger</b> <b>artist's</b> antithesis: satisfied and contented, the animal's corporeality stands in marked contrast to the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist's</b> ethereality. <b>A</b> final interpretive division surrounds the issue of whether [...] "A Hunger Artist" [...] is meant to be read ironically. Some critics consider the story a sympathetic depiction of a misunderstood artist who seeks to rise above the merely animal parts of human nature (represented by the panther) and who is confronted with uncomprehending audiences. Others regard it as Kafka's ironic comment on artistic pretensions. The <b>hunger</b> <b>artist</b> comes to symbolize a joy-deprived man who shows no exuberance, who regards even his own tremendous discipline as inauthentic, and the panther who replaces him obviously is meant to show a sharp contrast of the two. Still at least one interpretation is that Kafka is expressing the world's indifference to his own artistic scruples, through the plight of the <b>hunger</b> <b>artist.</b>|$|R

It’s a classic Bildungsroman but with a fantastical twist that nods both to Hamsun’s Hunger and Kafka’s <b>A</b> <b>Hunger</b> <b>Artist.</b> It’s the story of Young Man, a shy 21-year old from a provincial and isolated country, who for the first time in his life is made to live on his own, in a big European city.

40|$|An {{important}} claim {{made for}} second-generation accounts of cognition {{is that they}} help {{solve the problem of}} dualism, which arguably remains unchallenged in much literary criticism. Kafka's short story “Ein Hungerkunstler” (<b>A</b> <b>Hunger</b> <b>Artist)</b> is about a profoundly embodied experience of (unsuccessfully) denying embodiment: fasting to death. With this text's cognitive realism as my focal point, I use insights from second-generation cognitive science (which acknowledges the embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended nature of human cognition), including research on eating disorders and starvation, to provide purchase on two traditional literary-critical concerns: thematic interpretation and paradox. I also suggest that a first-person perspective which acknowledges the complexities of individual real-world embodiment may sometimes enrich cognitive literary studies. This combined first-person and second-generation methodology can help us recognize that for the real people who read our scholarship and learn from us, the dangers of dualism are ethically as well as interpretively profound. </p...|$|E
