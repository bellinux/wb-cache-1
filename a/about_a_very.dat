25|$|The Crusades, 1095–1270, {{which were}} {{intended}} to wrest the Holy Places of Palestine from Islamic control, resulted {{in the building of}} castles in Syria and Palestine. The Crusades brought <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large movement of people and, with them, ideas and trade skills, particularly those involved in the building of fortifications and the metal working needed for the provision of arms, which was also applied to the fitting and decoration of buildings. The continual movement of people, rulers, nobles, bishops, abbots, craftsmen and peasants, was an important factor in creating a homogeneity in building methods and a recognizable Romanesque style, despite regional differences.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} {{stages of the}} Cold War, the Royal Navy was reconfigured with three anti-submarine warfare (ASW) {{aircraft}} carriers and a force of frigates and destroyers. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic. There were also mine countermeasures and submarine forces as well as support ships. As the Cold War ended, the Royal Navy fought in the Gulf War against Iraq, with Sea Skua anti-ship missiles sinking {{a large proportion of}} the Iraqi Navy. The WRNS was amalgamated with the RN in 1991. The RN also carried out many mine countermeasures operations. However, the end of the Soviet threat brought <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large reduction in the strength of the Navy. All its diesel-electric submarines were decommissioned in 1992 and more surface combatants left the fleet.|$|E

25|$|Much of Europe was {{affected}} by feudalism in which peasants held tenure from local rulers over the land that they farmed in exchange for military service. The result of this was {{that they could be}} called upon, not only for local and regional spats, but to follow their lord to travel across Europe to the Crusades, if they were required to do so. The Crusades, 1095–1270, brought <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large movement of people and, with them, ideas and trade skills, particularly those involved in the building of fortifications and the metal working needed for the provision of arms, which was also applied to the fitting and decoration of buildings.

500|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Harrison cited [...] "Simply Shady" [...] {{as the song}} that best summed up a fallow period in his personal life that ended when he found lasting happiness with Arias. Arias has commented on the surprising background to the song, saying, [...] "He's in India, a very spiritual place, writing <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> material experience", adding that a tape has been discovered of Harrison working on the composition while at the Lake Palace hotel in Udaipur. She told Mojo of this period in Harrison's career: [...] "Everything in his life had changed at that point: getting divorced, Apple was in turmoil, {{he had his own}} personal demons. '74 was one of those breaking-through-the-sound-barrier periods. You come through and it's just quiet on the other side." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{designed}} Two-Face's {{appearance in}} the film {{as one of the}} least disturbing, explaining, [...] "When we looked at less extreme versions of it, they were too real and more horrifying. When you look at a film like Pirates of the Caribbean– something like that, there's something <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> fanciful, very detailed visual effect, that I think is more powerful and less repulsive." [...] Framestore created 120 computer-generated shots of Two-Face's scarred visage. Nolan felt using make-up would look unrealistic, as it adds to the face, unlike real burn victims. Framestore acknowledged they rearranged the positions of bones, muscles and joints to make the character look more dramatic. For each shot, three 720-pixel HD cameras were set up at different angles on set to fully capture Aaron Eckhart's performance. Eckhart wore markers on his face and a prosthetic skullcap, which acted as a lighting reference. A few shots of the skullcap were kept in the film. Framestore also integrated shots of Bale and Eckhart into that of the exploding building where Dent is burned. It was difficult simulating fire on Eckhart because it is inherently unrealistic for only half of something to burn.|$|E

500|$|On December 10, 2006 the Merriam-Webster Dictionary {{announced}} that [...] "truthiness" [...] {{was selected as}} its 2006 Word of the Year on Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year, based on a reader poll, by a 5–1 margin over the second-place word google. [...] "We're {{at a point where}} what constitutes truth is a question on a lot of people's minds, and truth has become up for grabs", said Merriam-Webster president John Morse. Truthiness' is a playful way for us to think <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important issue." [...] However, despite winning Word of the Year, the word does not appear in the 2006 edition of the Merriam-Webster English Dictionary. In response to this omission, during [...] "The Wørd" [...] segment on December 12, 2006 Colbert issued a new page 1344 for the tenth edition of the Merriam Webster dictionary that featured [...] "truthiness". To make room for the definition of [...] "truthiness", including a portrait of Colbert, the definition for the word [...] "try" [...] was removed with Colbert stating [...] "Sorry, try. Maybe you should have tried harder." [...] He also sarcastically told viewers to [...] "not" [...] download the new page and [...] "not" [...] glue it in the new dictionary in libraries and schools.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{telling a story}} <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> famous Hollywood actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, {{standing}} on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set {{she sits on the}} star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!" [...] She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.|$|E

Wilson stated, [...] "I'm talking <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans, so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them.

2500|$|Journalist Jeff Jarvis {{acknowledged}} {{the film was}} [...] "well-crafted" [...] but called it [...] "the anti-social movie", objecting to Sorkin's decision to change various events and characters for dramatic effect, and dismissing it as [...] "the story that those who resist the change society is undergoing want to see." [...] Technology broadcaster Leo Laporte concurred, calling the film [...] "anti-geek and misogynistic". Sorkin responded to these allegations by saying, [...] "I was writing <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> angry and deeply misogynistic group of people".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Anderson has {{elsewhere}} {{stressed that the}} songs are not autobiographical, but [...] "often imaginary situations based on real sentiments, or real situations taken to their logical extreme". When asked about the pervasive {{use of the word}} [...] "he" [...] in his songs, Anderson stated that [...] "too much music is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> straightforward sense of sexuality... Twisted sexuality is the only kind that interests me. The people that matter in music... don't declare their sexuality. Morrissey never has and he's all the more interesting for that".|$|E
2500|$|According to Le Sage, after {{creating}} {{his first}} essay on gravitation, he was informed in 1748 by Firmin Abauzit <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> similar theory of Gabriel Cramer, {{who happens to}} have been Le Sage's teacher in Geneva. In later years Le Sage responded in two different ways to charges that his ideas on gravitation were only the result of studying Cramer's papers. First, he argued that his first essay was written before he knew of the theories of his predecessors. Second, he argued {{that even if he}} knew about Cramer's theory, it makes no difference, because Cramer's theory is too vague and scientifically not valuable. Le Sage did, however, accuse Cramer of plagiarising Fatio's theory. (Fatio himself had made the same accusation.) ...|$|E
