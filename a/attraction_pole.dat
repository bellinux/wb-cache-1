40|$|Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a {{multifactorial disease}} of the upper airways with a high {{prevalence}} (approximately 11 %) in the general population. Different immune and inflammatory mechanisms are involved in its pathogenesis. Alterations in the arachidonic acid pathway (leading to an imbalanced production of eicosanoids) {{have been linked to}} the pathophysiology of different diseases especially nasal polyposis, asthma, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Furthermore, viral and bacterial infections have been identified as important factors amplifying the pro-inflammatory reactions in these pathologies. This review summarizes the impact of an imbalance in the eicosanoid pathway and the effect of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins on the regulation of the pro-inflammatory network in CRS and their translation into disease severity.

40|$|Crotamine, a 5 -kDa peptide, {{possesses}} a unique biological versatility. Not only has its cell-penetrating activity become of clinical interest but, moreover, its potential selective antitumor activity {{is of great}} pharmacological importance. In the past, several studies have attempted to elucidate the exact molecular target responsible for the crotamine-induced skeletal muscle spasm. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether crotamine affects voltage-gated potassium (K-V) channels in an effort to explain its in vivo effects. Crotamine was studied on ion channel function using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique on 16 cloned ion channels (12 K-V channels and 4 Na-V channels), expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Crotamine selectively inhibits K-V 1. 1, K-V 1. 2, and K-V 1. 3 channels with an IC 50 of similar to 300 nM, and the key amino acids responsible for this molecular interaction are suggested. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the symptoms, which are observed in the typical crotamine syndrome, may result from the inhibition of K-V channels. The ability of crotamine to inhibit the potassium current through K-V channels unravels it as the first snake peptide with the unique multifunctionality of cell-penetrating and antitumoral activity combined with K-V channel-inhibiting properties. This new property of crotamine might explain some experimental observations and opens new perspectives on pharmacological uses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the transformation of high-temperature AlN (HT-AlN) interlayer (IL) and its effect on the strain relaxation of Al 0. 25 Ga 0. 75 N/HT-AlN/GaN. The HT-AlN IL capped with Al 0. 25 Ga 0. 75 N transforms into AlGaN IL in which the Al composition increases with the HT-AlN IL thickness while the total Ga content keeps nearly constant. During the HT-AlN IL growth on GaN, the tensile stress is relieved through the formation of V trenches. The filling up of the V trenches by the subsequent Al 0. 25 Ga 0. 75 N growth is identified as the Ga source for the IL transformation, whose effect is very different from a direct growth of HT-AlGaN IL. The a-type dislocations generated during the advancement of V trenches and their filling up propagate into the Al 0. 25 Ga 0. 75 N overlayer. The a-type dislocation density increases dramatically with the IL thickness, which greatly enhances the strain relaxation of Al 0. 25 Ga 0. 75 N. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.

We {{show that}} the intensity of each mode displays large amplitude oscillations but obeys a highly organized antiphase dynamics leading to an almost constant total intensity output. For each mode, regular switching is observed in the megahertz range, while the optical frequency {{as a function of}} time follows a well deﬁned sequence from blue to red. Using a multimode theoretical model, we identify that four-wave mixing is the dominant mechanism at the origin of the observed dynamics.

Commuting consists {{in the fact}} that an important fraction of workers in developed countries do not reside close to their workplaces but at long distances from them, so they have to travel to their jobs and then back home daily. Although most workers hold a job in the same municipality where they live or in a neighbouring one, an important fraction of workers face long daily trips to get to their workplace and then back home. Even if we divide Catalonia (Spain) in small aggregations of municipalities, trying to make them as close to local labour markets as possible, we will find out that some of them have a positive commuting balance, attracting many workers from other areas and providing local jobs for almost all their resident workers. On the other side, other zones seem to be mostly residential, so an important fraction of their resident workers hold jobs in different local labour markets.

We show that this conﬁguration intrinsically conceals in the transmitted variable the internal delay times, which are critical for decoding. The scheme also allows for the inclusion, in a very efﬁcient way, of a digital key generated as a long pseudorandom binary sequence. A single digital key can operate both in the internal and transmitted variables leading to a large sensitivity of the synchronization to a key-mismatch. The combination of intrinsic delay time concealment and digital key selectivity provides the basis for a large enhancement of the conﬁdentiality in chaos-based communications. © 2012 OSAThe authors thank L.
