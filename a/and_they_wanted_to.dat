His {{job was to}} monitor the health and physical fitness of the American troops stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little threat to the United States, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be someplace where their talents would be put to better use.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{make it look}} like tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E
5|$|At Elizabeth's first {{interrogation}} session, the Japanese {{told her}} that some ships had been sunk in the harbour <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know {{the location of a}} large amount of money. She claimed no knowledge of the matter but was repeatedly interrogated and beaten. At various times, the Kempeitai forced Elizabeth to kneel on some angled bars of wood on the floor. They stripped her topless and tied her to the wood so she could not go either forwards or backwards. Then they applied electric shocks to her. They even brought in her husband to let him see her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost half her body weight.|$|E

5|$|F-Zero GX is {{the first}} F-Zero game to feature a Story mode. Its story has the player {{assume the role of}} F-Zero pilot Captain Falcon in nine {{chapters}} of various racing scenarios; such as Falcon's training regiment, a race against a rival through a canyon with falling boulders, attack and eliminate a rival's gang, and escape from a collapsing building through closing blast doors. Each chapter can be completed on a normal, hard, and very hard difficulty setting. Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the game's co-producers, stated that this mode was included because the development team felt that the F-Zero universe was unique <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> explain some of the characters' motivations and flesh out the game world.|$|E
5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make sure that they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E
5|$|The British {{bargaining}} position had worsened; the American scientists {{had decided that}} the United States no longer needed outside help, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> prevent Britain exploiting post-war commercial applications of atomic energy. The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting {{the flow of information}} to what Britain could use during the war—especially not bomb design—even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all information sharing. The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them. They investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program, but determined that it could not be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe.|$|E

5|$|When Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, visited Athens in March 1918, {{to confer}} the Order of the Bath upon the king, Alexander feared that a {{marriage}} {{between him and}} Princess Mary of the United Kingdom would be discussed {{as part of an}} attempt to consolidate the relationship between Greece and Britain. To Alexander's relief, Arthur asked to meet Aspasia, and declared that, if he were younger, he would have sought to marry her himself. For the foreign powers, and particularly the British ambassador, the marriage was seen as positive. The British authorities feared that Alexander would abdicate in order to marry Aspasia if the wedding was blocked, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid Greece becoming a republic in case it led to instability or an increase in French influence at their expense.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins {{was moved}} to second base in 1984. That move made room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield. Until that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get Martínez's bat into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production. Wiggins {{retained}} the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of Tony Gwynn. During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying an NL record. In an August game, Wiggins unwittingly became a party {{to a series of}} fights. Wiggins was hit with the first pitch of the game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs. The tension resulted in three fights and several ejections.|$|E

25|$|Over {{a century}} after the Spanish left the Coosa Valley, the British {{established}} strong trading ties with the Creek bands of {{the area around the}} late 17th century, much to the dismay of France.

The main transportation of the day was by boat. The convergence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers near present-day Montgomery forms the Alabama River, which has its mouth at Mobile Bay, the port used by the French for travel around the Caribbean and to France. They wanted to retain control of both the Coosa and the Alabama rivers.|$|E

The burglars' first break-in attempt in late May 1972 had been successful, but several problems had arisen with poor-quality information from their bugs, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> photograph more documents. Specifically, the burglars were interested in information they thought was held by Lawrence F. O'Brien, head of the DNC. On their second attempt to break in, {{on the night of}} June 16–17, 1972, the burglars were discovered by hotel security. After the arrests of the burglars, Dean took custody of evidence and money from the White House safe of E. Howard Hunt, Jr., who had been supervising the Watergate burglaries, and later destroyed some of the evidence before it could be found by investigators.|$|E
25|$|One {{of these}} {{students}} was Edwin Catmull. Catmull had just come from The Boeing Company and {{had been working on}} his degree in physics. Growing up on Disney, Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered {{that he did not have}} the talent for drawing. Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be part of the revolution. The first animation that Catmull saw was his own. He created an animation of his hand opening and closing. He also pioneered texture mapping to paint textures on three-dimensional models in 1974, now considered one of the fundamental techniques in 3D modeling. It became one of his goals to produce a feature-length motion picture using computer graphics - a goal he would achieve two decades later after his founding role in Pixar. In the same class, Fred Parke created an animation of his wife's face.|$|E
25|$|March 23, 2007: Attorneys {{defending}} Addison {{planned to}} contest the use of capital punishment. They intended to explore controversial issues about the law and were expected {{to refer to a}} 1997 trial in which a man convicted of murdering a police officer was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. In addition, the defense attorneys wanted a change of venue, to gain stricter security; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> prevent newspaper and television media from taking photographs of Addison while he was in prison and entering or leaving the courthouse. The defense said that such photographs could bias viewers against him and complicate his right to a fair trial. Prosecutors wanted the trial to remain in Manchester and argued that moving Addison to a different courthouse would interfere with the trial. On April 13, 2007, the judge rejected the defense attorneys' request, saying that the trial would not affect jury selection and potential jurors had likely already seen published photos of Addison.|$|E
