5|$|The Kolberg class {{represented}} {{the first major}} improvement in combat power for German light cruisers, both qualitatively and quantitatively. They were <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> longer-barrel 10.5 cm SK L/45 gun, which had a higher muzzle velocity and thus greater range than the earlier L/40 weapon. In addition, they carried an extra pair of guns, which strengthened their broadside. This was on a displacement of over a thousand tons greater than the preceding Dresden class. All four ships were also powered by turbines, which granted them {{a significant increase in}} speed over the earlier vessels.|$|E

5|$|The T-26-4 {{with the}} KT tank gun passed tests {{successfully}} and five vehicles {{were built in}} 1933–1934 as pilot batch. Initially it was planned to arm three of these T-26-4 with the 76.2mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 {{and the other two}} tanks with the 76.2mm PS-3 tank gun. The PS-3 tank gun was developed at the Experimental Engineering-Mechanical Department (OKMO) of the Factory No. 174 by engineer P. Syachentov. The PS-3 had better specifications in comparison with the series-produced KT tank gun and also had several technical innovations (foot firing switch, original training gear, travelling position fixing, binocular optical sight). The T-26-4 <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> PS-3 tank gun was tested in October 1933 but {{it was found that the}} PS-3 was too powerful for the T-26 light tank—turret's race ring and hull roof were deformed during gun fire, and the suspension springs were damaged. It was decided to arm the T-26-4 with the 76.2mm KT tank gun only. All five experimental T-26-4 artillery tanks were tested during military exercises near Leningrad in September 1934 before scheduled series production of 50 such vehicles in 1935. But on 19 September 1934 an incident with a T-26-4 took place: a blow-back because of shell case destruction during gun fire. Despite the fact that this defect was unrelated to turret design, the military representatives cancelled the order to produce the T-26-4. Also the work to design turretless AT-1 artillery tanks <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> powerful 76.2mm PS-3 tank gun started at that time. The T-26-4's turret construction was the design used in the series-produced BT-7A artillery tank.|$|E
5|$|The textual {{description}} of Matrikas is generally awesome, frightening and ferocious. In the Mahabharata, all the seven mothers {{are described as}} fatal or serve as threats to foetuses or infants. They are described as living in trees, crossroads, caves and funeral grounds and they are terrible as well as beautiful. But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers. They are <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same weapons, wear the same ornaments, and ride the same vahanas and carry the same banners as their corresponding male deities.|$|E
5|$|Although the Panzer IV was {{deployed}} to north Africa with the German Afrika Korps, until the longer gun variant began production, the tank was outperformed by the Panzer III {{with respect to}} armor penetration. Both the Panzer III and IV had difficulty in penetrating the British Matilda II's thick armor, while the Matilda's 40-mm QF 2 pounder gun could knock out either German tank; its major disadvantage was its low speed. By August 1942, Rommel had only received 27 Panzer IV Ausf. F2s, <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> L/43 gun, which he {{deployed to}} spearhead his armored offensives. The longer gun could penetrate all American and British tanks in theater at ranges of up to , {{by that time the}} most heavily armored of which was the M3 Grant. Although more of these tanks arrived in North Africa between August and October 1942, their numbers were insignificant compared to the amount of matériel shipped to British forces.|$|E

5|$|<b>Armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men {{to cover the}} exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their Mesoamerican allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E
5|$|As the American Civil War approached, Colt {{supplied}} {{both the}} North and the South with firearms. He {{had been known}} to sell weapons to warring parties {{on both sides of}} other conflicts in Europe and saw no difference with respect to the war in America. In 1859 Colt considered building an armory in the South and as late as 1861 had sold 2,000 revolvers to Confederate agent John Forsyth. Although trade with the South had not been restricted at that time, newspapers such as the New York Daily Tribune, the New York Times and the Hartford Daily Courant labeled him a Southern sympathizer and traitor to the Union. In response to these charges, Colt was commissioned as a colonel by the state of Connecticut on May 16, 1861, in the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles of Connecticut <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Colt revolving rifle. Colt envisioned this unit as being staffed by men over six feet tall and armed with his weapons. However, the unit never took the field and Colt was discharged on June 20, 1861.|$|E
5|$|Authorities {{received}} the first distress {{call from a}} person who escaped from the restaurant at 12:38pm, and the first police car reached the building at 12:47pm. The policemen were <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> standard equipment for Czech police officers: holstered pistols (mostly with variants of CZ75 that was also used by Kovář), body armor, and a select-fire rifle stored in car. The first two officers to arrive immediately entered the building with body armor on and guns drawn. , taking cover behind a bar opposite to the door, opened fire on the officers {{as soon as they}} entered. The police noted people lying on the ground and sitting on chairs between them and the shooter. Not knowing the status of the civilians, the police decided not to return fire, covered the exits, and waited for the arrival of a tactical unit. By this time, other police units as well as the first ambulance car had arrived, taking away the wounded female victim who had escaped.|$|E

5|$|Both {{factions in}} Day of Defeat: Source {{have access to}} six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes are armed with pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with rifle grenades, the assault classes are armed with a single fragmentation grenade and a smoke grenade for providing concealment, while support classes have access to two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen are <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and are designed for medium to long range combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes are designed for medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from long range, and are consequently <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with long range scopes. Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is armed with a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is armed with either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E
5|$|Due to tank sales, Rheinmetall's L/44 {{tank gun}} has been {{manufactured}} for other nations. For example, the Leopard 2 <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 44 caliber long gun, {{has been sold}} to the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Finland, and other countries. Egypt had manufactured 700–800 M1A1 Abrams by 2005, and in 2008 requested permission to build another 125 tanks; their M256 main guns (the US version of the L/44) were manufactured by Watervliet Arsenal. The M1A1 has also been exported to Australia, while the M1A2 Abrams has been exported to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The American license-built M256 has also been offered by General Dynamics Land Systems {{as part of the}} M60-2000 Main Battle Tank which would upgrade older M60 Patton tanks to have capabilities of their M1A1 Abrams at a reduced cost, though the company has not yet found a buyer.|$|E
5|$|For the battle, Rotmistrov {{ordered his}} tanks {{to move forward}} at high speed to engage the German armour in order to nullify the {{advantages}} the Tiger tanks had in the range and firepower of their 88mm guns. He believed the more manoeuvrable T-34 medium tanks {{would be able to}} quickly close in and obtain effective flanking shots against the German heavy tanks. In fact, Soviet intelligence had greatly overestimated the numbers of Ferdinands and Tigers possessed by the II SS-Panzer Corps. In actuality there were no Ferdinands with the 4th Panzer Army or Army Group South, as they were all deployed on the northern side of the Kursk salient with the 9th Army. Soviet tank-crews frequently mistook the versions of Panzer IV tanks that were <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> KwK 40 anti-tank gun, which also had extra armour added to their turret, for Tigers; therefore Soviet reports tended to overestimate the number of Tigers employed by the German side during the Battle of Kursk.|$|E

5|$|In 1846 the Mexican–American War began. Davis {{resigned}} his House seat {{in early}} June {{and raised a}} volunteer regiment, the 155th Infantry Regiment, becoming its colonel {{under the command of}} his former father-in-law, General Zachary Taylor. On July 21 the regiment sailed from New Orleans for Texas. Colonel Davis sought to arm his regiment with the M1841 Mississippi rifle. At this time, smoothbore muskets were still the primary infantry weapon, and any unit with rifles was considered special and designated as such. President James K. Polk had promised Davis the weapons if he would remain in Congress long enough for an important vote on the Walker tariff. General Winfield Scott objected on the basis that the weapons were insufficiently tested. Davis insisted and called in his promise from Polk, and his regiment was <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rifles, making it particularly effective in combat. The regiment became known as the Mississippi Rifles {{because it was the first}} to be fully armed with these new weapons. The incident was the start of a lifelong feud between Davis and Scott.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{the only}} Soviet factory {{suitable}} for T-26 production was the Bolshevik Factory in Leningrad, which had had experience manufacturing the MS-1 (T-18) light tanks since 1927. It was also {{planned to use}} the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which was under construction at that time. But {{the production of the}} T-26 proved to be much more complicated than the semi-handicraft assembly of the MS-1, so the planned production of 500 T-26s in 1931 proved to be impossible. The Bolshevik Factory needed to convert all tank drawings from imperial units into metric, in order to develop a production technology, special tools, and equipment. The first 10 T-26s were assembled in July 1931 – they were identical to British Vickers 6-Ton tanks except for their armament. Soviet tanks were <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) gun in the right turret and the 7.62mm DT tank machine gun in the left turret. These T-26s from the development batch were of low quality and made from mild steel, but it was an important test of the new tank production technology.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February, {{the evening}} before the attacks, back in Sơn Dương, a large {{contingent}} of rebels made their final preparations before heading into battle. They met at three points; the homes of Bang and the local Confucian scholar, and in the fields. They then joined together for a final meeting before Nhu divided the combined forces in two groups. Nhu led one towards a barracks in Hưng Hóa, while the other would attack the town facilities in the district capital of Lâm Thao. Some members of the rebels wore khaki uniforms and they departed for their objective after midnight. Nhu was <b>armed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pistol, while the others were each given a scimitar and two bombs. The groups traversed rivers on boats and arrived outside their attack points, where they were to synchronised their assaults by sending a light signal.|$|E
