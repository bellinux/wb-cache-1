Analytical results show that when generic <b>advertising</b> leads to an inelastic demand, generic <b>advertising</b> would help brand <b>advertising</b> and could decrease the optimal brand <b>advertising</b> expenditures.

The obtained strategies provide information on the extent that the firms should be involved in <b>advertising.</b> While the retailer should increase <b>advertising</b> with subsidy, the manufacturer should reduce <b>advertising</b> since his subsidy to the retailer is an involvement in <b>advertising.</b> Thus without much spending on brand name and goodwill (national <b>advertising)</b> his product can still be successfully sold by subsidising retail <b>advertising.</b>|$|R

A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews.

This study examines the effectiveness of search engine <b>advertising</b> within a multimedia campaign, with explicit consideration of the interaction effects between search engine <b>advertising</b> and television and banner <b>advertising.</b> An <b>advertising</b> tracking study with about 300 respondents interviewed before and about 4, 700 respondents interviewed after the <b>advertising</b> campaign examines the effects on four consumer metrics: <b>advertising</b> awareness, brand awareness, brand image, and brand consumption. We estimate <b>advertising</b> effectiveness and control for correlations across the four ordinal response metrics using a multivariate ordered probit model. The results show that search engine <b>advertising</b> has significant effects on several consumer metrics, even among consumers who do not click on the sponsored advertisement. Television <b>advertising</b> also affects the consumer metrics. However, a negative interaction effect emerges between search engine <b>advertising</b> and television <b>advertising.</b> Banner <b>advertising</b> exerts a positive impact, but only in combination with television <b>advertising.</b> These substantial interaction effects indicate that firms must consider the investments in various media channels simultaneously when they design multimedia campaigns...|$|R
5|$|Some {{plants are}} thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of {{unpalatable}} chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns.

Some brightly coloured birds such as passerines with contrasting patterns may also be aposematic, at least in females; but since male birds are often brightly coloured through sexual selection, and their colouration is not correlated with edibility, {{it is unclear whether}} aposematism is significant.|$|E
