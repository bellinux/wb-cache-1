5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only <b>alarm</b> <b>button</b> to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
5|$|At 3:50 pm {{the prisoners}} left H7, {{and the driver}} and a prison orderly were taken back to the lorry, and the driver's foot tied to the clutch. 37 prisoners climbed {{into the back of}} the lorry, while Kelly lay on the floor of the cab with a gun pointed at the driver, who was also told the cab had been booby trapped with a hand grenade. At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners {{intended}} to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage. At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an <b>alarm</b> <b>button.</b> When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages. Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, and before he could raise the alarm he collapsed.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial of}} Doherty {{and the other}} members of the M60 gang began in early May 1981, on charges {{including}} three counts of murder. On 10 June, Doherty and seven other prisoners, including Angelo Fusco {{and the other members}} of the IRA unit, took a prison officer hostage at gunpoint in Crumlin Road Jail. After locking the officer in a cell, the eight took other officers and visiting solicitors hostage, also locking them in cells after taking their clothing. Two of the eight wore officers' uniforms while a third wore clothing taken from a solicitor, and the group moved towards the first of three gates separating them from the outside world. They took the officer on duty at the gate hostage at gunpoint, and forced him to open the inner gate. An officer at the second gate recognised one of the prisoners and ran into an office and pressed an <b>alarm</b> <b>button,</b> and the prisoners ran through the second gate towards the outer gate. An officer at the outer gate tried to prevent the escape but was attacked by the prisoners, who escaped onto Crumlin Road. As the prisoners were moving towards the car park where two cars were waiting, an unmarked RUC car pulled up across the street outside Crumlin Road Courthouse. The RUC officers opened fire, and the prisoners returned fire before escaping in the waiting cars. Two days after the escape, Doherty was convicted in absentia and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum recommended term of thirty years.|$|E

Due to numerous complaints of public prostitution affecting residents, Zurich began considering the project in 2010 and visited other facilities including those in Cologne and Essen, and Swiss news reports referred to the concept as sex-boxen (sex boxes).|$|R
2500|$|The Miami Airlines C-46 was {{preparing}} for a scheduled non-stop passenger flight from Newark to Tampa. [...] Of the aircraft's two engines, the right engine took longer to start up; ominously, people nearby could see smoke continuously coming from that engine. [...] At around 15:00 PM EST, the flight taxied out to runway 28, and was cleared for takeoff at 3:03. [...] Just after takeoff, however, Newark ATC personnel saw a trail of white smoke coming from {{the right side of}} the aircraft. [...] The tower controller, concerned about the danger of there being a fire, pressed the airport crash <b>alarm</b> <b>button.</b> [...] A Miami Airlines employee observing the takeoff from the ground also saw the smoke, which he believed was due to an overheated right brake. [...] The captain telephoned the control tower and warned for the aircraft to keep its landing gear down or, if it had already been raised, to extend it. [...] The tower relayed the captain's warning to the flight crew of the C-46, who acknowledged and started the process of lowering the landing gear.|$|E

25|$|Inside, Ruetten found Rasmussen dead on {{the living}} room floor, shot three times. There were signs of a struggle, such as a {{porcelain}} vase that had apparently been broken over Rasmussen's head prior to the shooting, a bloody handprint next to the burglar <b>alarm's</b> panic <b>button,</b> and a toppled credenza. It appeared that someone had bound her wrists, or tried to, at some point. She had defensive wounds and bore a bruise on her face that appeared to have been inflicted by the muzzle of a gun. The gun had been fired through a quilt, apparently to muffle the sound. The investigating criminalist also observed a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm, and took a swab from it.|$|R

40|$|In Sweden {{the need}} to recruit care assistants is {{increasing}} because of a growing older population together with their demands {{to stay in their}} own homes as long as possible. Swedish municipalities are responsible for organizing the social care and services for elderly with a coordination of some private provider companies. Moreover, to improve the care work a range of information and communication technologies (ICTs) e. g. safety alarm and electronic health record system are used to support care assistants’ daily activities and communication with elderly. Thus qualitative research aims to explore the care assistants’ use and experiences of existing ICTs. Furthermore, it examines the impact of the ICTs on their daily activities. The thesis pay attention also to care assistants demands, ideas and visions about future ICTs. The research found that care assistants were satisfied with the ICTs, they use today. However, the research also identified some problems related to ICT, which the care assistants are confronted with during their everyday work e. g. <b>alarm</b> <b>buttons</b> loosen and falsely triggered sensors. Care assistants expressed their ideas and visions about the ICT’s degree of involvement in their care activities and elderly’s lives. They had contradictions in their point of views related to the use of monitoring technologies for elder’s care. They also had negative feelings about these technologies. In short, the thesis explored two things; firstly, it reflected ICTs and care assistants’ demands and ideas related to the ICTs. Secondly, the daily activities of care assistants were examined. Therefore this research brings forward care assistants’ activities and makes their work more noticeable in order {{to be used in the}} development of new IT systems in the social care work...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{majority}} {{portion of}} the operations in modern manufacturing industries are performed by the implementation of automation technology. All automation technologies employ a graphical Human Machine Interface (HMIs) {{to interact with the}} machine. Color is a major component of the HMI. The main characteristic of the HMI is that it should be intuitive and user friendly. With the use of appropriate colors, the HMI can be designed {{in such a way that}} the user focuses only on the specific part of the interface at that specific time period. Choosing the right color for the background, control <b>buttons,</b> <b>alarms,</b> text and other objects is very critical to design a good HMI. This paper will briefly examine theoretical and practical aspects of these components and the established techniques for the effective use of color in graphical HMI.

The player character is cast as an apprentice Shaper in the first three games, as a neophyte rebel in the fourth, and as an unaligned amnesiac in the fifth. Crises in the game result from the Shapers' mistreatment of their creations while trying to ensure that their art does not wreak havoc on the world, versus the freedom of intelligent creations at the cost of said havoc. The player is left to determine what {{is the right thing to}} do, such as using mysterious skill canisters which may breed arrogance in the user in return for increased power.|$|R
40|$|Purpose The European Union-funded E-PILEPSY network aims {{to improve}} {{awareness}} of, and accessibility to, epilepsy surgery across Europe. In {{this study we}} assessed current clinical practices in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in the participating centers. Method A 60 -item web-based survey was distributed to 25 centers (27 EMUs) of the E-PILEPSY network across 22 European countries. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate the characteristics of EMUs, including organizational aspects, admission, and observation of patients, procedures performed, safety issues, cost, and reimbursement. Results Complete responses were received from all (100 %) EMUs surveyed. Continuous observation of patients was performed in 22 (81 %) EMUs during regular working hours, and in 17 EMUs (63 %) outside of regular working hours. Fifteen (56 %) EMUs requested a signed informed consent before admission. All EMUs performed tapering/withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs, 14 (52 %) prior to admission to an EMU. Specific protocols on antiepileptic drugs (AED) tapering were available in four (15 %) EMUs. Standardized Operating Procedures (SOP) {{for the treatment of}} seizure clusters and status epilepticus were available in 16 (59 %). Safety measures implemented by EMUs were: <b>alarm</b> seizure <b>buttons</b> in 21 (78 %), restricted patient's ambulation in 19 (70 %), guard rails in 16 (59 %), and specially designated bathrooms in 7 (26 %). Average costs for one inpatient day in EMU ranged between 100 and 2200 Euros. Conclusion This study shows a considerable diversity in the organization and practice patterns across European epilepsy monitoring units. The collected data may contribute to {{the development and implementation of}} evidence-based recommended practices in LTM services across Europe...|$|R
