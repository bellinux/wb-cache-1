40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{allocation}} of <b>active</b> <b>redundancies</b> to a k-out-of-n system with independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) components {{in the sense of}} the hazard rate order. It is shown that the system's hazard rate may be decreased by balancing the allocation of <b>active</b> <b>redundancies.</b> This generalizes the main result of Singh and Singh (1997) and improves the corresponding one of Hu and Wang (2009) as well. As an application, we build the reversed hazard rate order on order statistics from sample having proportional hazard rates, which strengthens the usual stochastic order in Theorem 2. 1 of Pledger and Proschan (1971) to the reversed hazard order in the situation that all components are of (rational) proportional hazard rates.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a reconfiguration strategy of the closed-loop control of a fault-tolerant hydraulic actuator for fly-by-wire helicopters, capable of compensating both failure effects and system nonlinearities. Actually, a basic concern about the control reconfiguration of systems with <b>active</b> <b>redundancies</b> is that a fault is typically compensated by increasing the demand to the remaining active lanes, but the resulting signal amplification can bring on system nonlinearities (e. g. voltage or current saturation) and unexpected dynamic behaviours. The study, focused on the actuator performance analysis in case of servovalve coil faults, points out that a standard reconfiguration based on the current demand amplification can imply “jump resonance” phenomena, and that these effects can occur in the frequency range of interest for helicopter flight controls. The proposed reconfiguration strategy, essentially based on the reduction of the current demand signal when saturation conditions are achieved, allows to eliminate the problem. The result is obtained by identifying the relationship between the jump resonance frequency and the system dynamic characteristics, and by inserting in the servovalve closed-loop control a dynamic notch filter, located at the estimated jump resonance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed via simulation, by using an experimentally-validated model of the reference actuator developed by the authors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} alternative architectural {{considerations for}} {{instrumentation and control}} (I&C) systems in high-reliability applications to support remote, autonomous, inaccessible nuclear reactors, such as a space nuclear power plant (SNPP) for mission electrical power and space exploration propulsion. This work supported the pre-conceptual design of the reactor control system for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) mission. Long-term continuous operation without intermediate maintenance cycles forces consideration of alternatives to commonly used <b>active,</b> N-multiple <b>redundancy</b> techniques for high-availability systems. Long space missions, where mission duration can exceed the 50 % reliability limit of constituent components, can make active, N-multiple redundant systems less reliable than simplex systems. To extend a control system lifetime beyond the 50 % reliability limits requires incorporation of passive redundancy of functions. Time-dependent availability requirements must be factored into the use of combinations of <b>active</b> and passive <b>redundancy</b> techniques for different mission phases. Over {{the course of a}} 12 to 20 -year mission, reactor control, power conversion, and thermal management system components may fail, and the I&C system must react and adjust to accommodate these failures and protect nonfailed components to continue the mission. This requires architectural considerations to accommodate partial system failures and to adapt to multiple control schemes according to the state of nonfailed components without going through a complete shutdown and restart cycle.

30|$|The {{redundancy}} {{strategy is}} divided in two classes: <b>active</b> and passive <b>redundancy</b> [17]. In <b>active</b> strategy, {{there are no}} standby replicas and all application replicas work in parallel. When one node fails, tasks executing at the failed node can be resumed in any remaining node. In passive redundancy, there is one working replica whereas remaining replicas are standby. When the main node fails, any standby replica can resume failed node tasks. Please note that this active strategy helps to provide load balancing to applications. However, maintaining consistency in the passive model is simpler, and so this strategy is used in different proposals [15].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the comparative {{analysis of the}} main structural schemes for reserved automatic control and regulation devices of important objects of power supply with increased reliability requirements. There were analyzed schemes of passive and active doubling with control device, passive and <b>active</b> tripling, combined <b>redundancy</b> and majority redundancy according to schemes: “two from three” and “three from five”. On the results of calculations fulfilled there was made comparison of these schemes for ideal devices of built-in control and ideal majority elements. Scales of preferences of systems according to criterion of average time maximum and average probability of no-failure operation were built. These scales have variable character, depending on intervals {{in which there is}} a parameter obtained by multiplication of failure rate and time. The sequence of systems’ preferences is changing and is depending on each system failures and in moments of curves crossing of average probability of no-failure operation of systems. Analysis of calculation results showed the advantages of tripling systems and combined redundancy in reliability and this is achieved by a great amount of expenses for these systems creation. Under definite conditions the reliability of system of passive tripling is higher compared to system of active doubling. The majority schemes allow determining not only the full but also single (metrological) failures. Boundary value of unreliability of built-in control device is determined, and this allows making a perfect choice between systems of <b>active</b> and passive <b>redundancy.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Time varying network induced {{delays in}} {{networked}} control systems (NCS) {{are known for}} degrading control system’s quality of performance (QoP) and causing stability problems. In literature, a control method employing modeling of communication delays as probability distribution, proves {{to be a better}} method. This paper focuses on modeling of network induced delays as probability distribution. CAN and MIL-STD- 1553 B are extensively used to carry periodic control and monitoring data in networked control systems. In literature, methods to estimate only the worst-case delays for these networks are available. In this paper probabilistic network delay model for CAN and MIL-STD- 1553 B networks are given. A systematic method to estimate values to model parameters from network parameters is given. A method to predict network delay in next cycle based on the present network delay is presented.

40|$|The {{classical}} Optimal Age-Replacement {{defines the}} maintenance strategy {{based on the}} equipment failure consequences. For severe consequences an early equipment replacement is recommended. For minor consequences the repair after failure is proposed. One way of reducing the failure consequences {{is the use of}} redundancies, especially if the equipment failure rate is decreasing over time, since in this case the preventive replacement does not reduce the risk of failure. The estimation of an <b>active</b> component <b>redundancy</b> degree is very important in order to minimize the life-cycle cost. If it is possible to make these estimations in the early phase of system design, the implementation is easier and the amortization faster. This work proposes an adaptation of the Optimal Age-Replacement method in order to simultaneously optimize the equipment redundancy allocation and the maintenance plan. The main goal is to provide a simple methodology, requiring the fewer data possible. A set of examples are presented illustrating that this methodology covers a wide variety of operating conditions. The optimization of the number of repairs between each replacement, in the cases of imperfect repairs, is another feature of this methodology...|$|R
