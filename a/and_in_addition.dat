5|$|Although American Graffiti {{is set in}} 1962 Modesto, California, Lucas {{believed}} the city had changed too much in 10 years and initially chose San Rafael as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated {{at the time it}} was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> to already running behind the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} the marshall of Jülich {{approached}} Mercator {{and asked him to}} prepare a set of European regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron's son, the crown prince Johannes. This remarkable collection has been preserved and is now held in the British Library under the title Atlas of Europe (although Mercator never used such a title). Many of the pages were assembled from dissected Mercator maps <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> there are thirty maps from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the tournament, an ICC panel selected their team of the tournament. The player of the tournament, England's Claire Taylor, was one of five English players, along with Katherine Brunt, Marsh, Sarah Taylor, and Charlotte Edwards, the last of whom was chosen as the team's captain. Finalists New Zealand had two representatives—Suzie Bates and Kate Pulford, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>addition,</b> Sophie Devine was selected as the twelfth player. Three Indians were included—Mithali Raj, Amita Sharma and Priyanka Roy—as was Shelley Nitschke of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names {{on the back of}} jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> it helped {{supporters}} new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Carolingian support {{may have}} been one of the factors that helped Ecgberht achieve the {{military}} successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>addition,</b> a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious—the first of a series of internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E

5|$|Eighteen clergymen {{have served}} as rector of Christ Church, Newton. The first, Uzal Ogden, Jr., {{was the son of}} Newark {{merchant}} and churchwarden. Ogden began to serve in northwestern New Jersey in 1770 <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> to Newton, covered an area of 2,000 square miles including St James Episcopal Church in Knowlton Township, New Jersey (founded in 1769). Because of the lack of a bishop in Britain's North American colonies, Ogden traveled to England to be ordained by the Rt Rev'd Richard Terrick, the Bishop of London, who had jurisdiction over all parishes of the Church of England in North America. After his departure in 1784, the pulpit remained unfilled until 1823. During this time, several clergymen, including the Reverend John Croes (1762–1832), later the first Bishop of New Jersey, officiated on occasion.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen poses {{a number}} of hazards to human safety, from {{potential}} detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a {{draftsman}} and designer, but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and he had started designing and selling pool cues as a more stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was very impressed with Szamboti's blanks <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E

5|$|Life in Nelson {{was hard}} for the colonists. The company had limited {{finances}} and tightened its expenditure which affected the salaries of its employees. In 1844, it had to halt its operations for a time. Although Nelson had 300 landowners, nearly two thirds were absentee owners and only 80 actually lived in the town. Brunner lived at Riwaka, a nearby village, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> to carrying out survey work along the Motueka River, helped {{in the design and}} building of houses in the area.

5|$|The Critters rule is a block {{cellular}} automaton in which, at each step, {{the cells of}} the automaton are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks.
