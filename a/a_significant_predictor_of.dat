25|$|According to this model, {{substance}} abuse problems may arise under two different personality traits: low BIS and high BAS. Since the BAS promotes {{the individual to}} pursue actions that may result in reward, BAS sensitivity {{is involved in the}} initiation of addiction. Significant associations have been found between high BAS such as alcohol misuse in school girls, hazardous drinking in men, illicit drug abuse, and tobacco use. BAS sensitivity is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> reactivity to substance cues, or cravings. Conversely, BIS sensitivity is involved in avoiding negative situations or affect (such as withdrawal). Low BIS has been positively associated with continuing the addiction to relieve feelings of withdrawal, or for continued use to alleviate negative affect.|$|E

Methods. Unadjusted and adjusted ordinal logistic regression models calculated odds ratio estimates and associated 95 % confidence intervals for the probability of having an excellent self-rated health response versus another response. Covariates considered in the analyses included number of coal mining-related facilities nearby one’s residence and employment in an occupation directly related to coal mining, as well as potential confounders age, sex, BMI, smoking status, income, and education.
