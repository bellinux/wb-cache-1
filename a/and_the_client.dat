5|$|Architects who {{push the}} {{boundaries}} of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed {{the expectations of the}} public <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really follies, deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG and {{features}} a persistent {{world in which}} players can {{interact with each other}} and the environment. Players create and customize their characters for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in the original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game world for characters to exist on. While servers are not explicitly delineated by language, data centers have been placed in the supported regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan) to improve the communication latency between the server <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> computer and players are recommended to choose a server in their region. Regardless of server or language, the game features a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases which allow players who speak different languages to communicate.|$|E
5|$|The team {{developing}} the Linux client {{had been working}} for a year before the announcement to validate that such a port would be possible. As of the official announcement, a near-feature-complete Steam client for Linux had been developed and successfully run on Ubuntu. Internal beta testing of the Linux client started in October 2012; external beta testing occurred in early November the same year. Open beta clients for Linux were made available in late December 2012, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> was officially released in mid-February 2013. At the time of announcement, Valve's Linux division assured that its first game on the OS, Left 4 Dead 2, wpuld run at an acceptable frame rate and with a degree of connectivity with the Windows and OS X versions. From there, it began working on porting other games to Ubuntu and expanding to other Linux distributions. Linux games are also eligible for SteamPlay availability. Versions of Steam working under Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux were released by October 2013. By June 2014, the number of Linux-compatible games on Steam had reached over 500, surpassing over 1,000 by March 2015. A year later, this number doubled to over 2,000.|$|E

25|$|Green {{building}} (also {{known as}} green construction or sustainable building) refers to both a {{structure and the}} application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort.|$|E
25|$|Art therapy may {{focus on}} the {{creative}} art-making process itself, as therapy, or on the analysis of expression gained through an exchange of patient and therapist interaction. The psychoanalytic approach {{was one of the}} earliest forms of art psychotherapy. This approach employs the transference process between the therapist <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> who makes art. The therapist interprets the client's symbolic self-expression as communicated in the art and elicits interpretations from the client. Analysis of transference is no longer always a component.|$|E
25|$|According to {{one study}} by Steinbach, a classic {{interaction}} in NLP {{can be understood}} in terms of several major stages including establishing rapport, gleaning information about a problem mental state and desired goals, using specific tools and techniques to make interventions, and integrating proposed changes into the client's life. The entire process is guided by the non-verbal responses of the client. The first is the act of establishing and maintaining rapport between the practitioner <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> which is achieved through pacing and leading the verbal (e.g., sensory predicates and keywords) and non-verbal behavior (e.g., matching and mirroring non-verbal behavior, or responding to eye movements) of the client.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} stage, Utzon worked {{successfully}} {{with the rest}} of the design team <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client,</b> but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.|$|E
25|$|Packaging is the {{operation}} {{to put the}} wine in the container in which it will be marketed. Over the ages it was kept in a barrel or cask <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> would fill his pitcher or bottle at the wine merchant. The appearance of the glass bottle revolutionized the world of wine. The absence of transfer and thus contact with the oxygen in the air has made a significant improvement {{to the quality of}} the product. Other containers have emerged: the brick from Tetra Pak, the bottle of polyethylene terephthalate or PET, the beverage can, and the Bag-In-Box. Their quality is in their chemical inertness in relation to wine and their hermetic character against oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista onwards, Terminal Services also {{includes}} a multi-party desktop sharing capability known as Windows Desktop Sharing. Unlike Terminal Services, which creates a new user session for every RDP connection, Windows Desktop Sharing can host the remote session {{in the context of}} the currently logged in user without creating a new session, and make the Desktop, or a subset of it, available over RDP. Windows Desktop Sharing can be used to share the entire desktop, a specific region, or a particular application. Windows Desktop Sharing can also be used to share multi-monitor desktops. When sharing applications individually (rather than the entire desktop), the windows are managed (whether they are minimized or maximized) independently at the server <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> side.|$|E

He also makes an ally of Ginger Corrigan, a girl whom he has met in the area, and who successfully draws Poppy out about the Pale Horse organisation. She obtains from her an address in Birmingham where he meets Mr Bradley, a disbarred lawyer who outlines to him {{the means by which}} the Pale Horse functions without breaking the law, i.e. Bradley bets that someone will die within {{a certain period of time}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> bets otherwise. If the person in question does die within a certain period of time, then the client must pay or else (one client who refused fell in front of an oncoming train and was killed).|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic counselors {{advocate}} his {{same process}} {{can be used in}} counseling to envision the bodily experiences of others in reality. For example, a client may present with tears while verbalizing feelings of pain and humiliation in response to a break up with a significant other. A therapist, using his memory of past embodied experiences of relationship heartache, can empathically envision in his imagination very closely to what the client is experiencing, therefore sharing that experience with the client and in turn enabling him to authentically relate to the client. Furthermore, this is precisely what enables the therapist <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> to work together to imagine new therapeutic possibilities. Mensch states that this capacity of human beings necessitates their responsibility to relate to and understand others as best they can. Humans may not always be able to, or entirely be able to, but their co-existence as embodied beings demands that they make the attempt.|$|E
25|$|The server {{component}} of RDS is Terminal Server (termdd.sys), which listens on TCP port 3389. When a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client connects to this port, it is tagged {{with a unique}} SessionID and associated with a freshly spawned console session (Session 0, keyboard, mouse and character mode UI only). The login subsystem (winlogon.exe) and the GDI graphics subsystem is then initiated, which handles the job of authenticating the user and presenting the GUI. These executables are loaded in a new session, rather than the console session. When creating the new session, the graphics and keyboard/mouse device drivers are replaced with RDP-specific drivers: RdpDD.sys and RdpWD.sys. The RdpDD.sys is the device driver and it captures the UI rendering calls into a format that is transmittable over RDP. RdpWD.sys acts as keyboard and mouse driver; it receives keyboard and mouse input over the TCP connection and presents them as keyboard or mouse inputs. It also allows creation of virtual channels, which allow other devices, such as disc, audio, printers, and COM ports to be redirected, i.e., the channels act as replacement for these devices. The channels connect to the client over the TCP connection; as the channels are accessed for data, the client is informed of the request, which is then transferred over the TCP connection to the application. This entire procedure {{is done by the}} terminal server <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>client,</b> with the RDP mediating the correct transfer, and is entirely transparent to the applications. RDP communications are encrypted using 128-bit RC4 encryption. Windows Server 2003 onwards, it can use a FIPS 140 compliant encryption schemes.|$|E
