50|$|Round 6 had Svidler losing out {{of opening}} against Anand, while Karjakin held a {{materially}} imbalanced position to a draw against Caruana. The Topalov-Giri game saw a practical novelty already at move 3, with a resulting drawn knight endgame after the 60-move mark. In the game Aronian-Nakamura, Aronian nurtured an advantage for some time, but the endgame {{appeared to be}} drawn. But on move 74, Nakamura made a fingerfehler and touched his king, forcing {{him to make a}} losing move (diagram). The incident was controversial as Nakamura initially tried to claim j'adoube, the international term to convey that one intends to <b>adjust</b> the <b>piece,</b> not move it. This win brought Aronian into the lead with Karjakin, with Anand just behind, going into the second rest day.|$|R

50|$|Hogarth and Einhorn (1992) {{proposed}} the belief-adjustment model {{to try to}} predict in which situations order effects would occur and what specific order effect will occur. According to Hogarth and Einhorn, early information forms an initial impression, which is called an anchor. This anchor is then adjusted as new information is processed. This model predicts order effects based {{on the type of}} mental processing that is used for the new information. For end-of-sequence processing, or processing that occurs once all of the information has been presented, the model predicts primacy effects. The initial piece of information serves as the anchor, and subsequent pieces of information are aggregated together to <b>adjust</b> the initial <b>piece</b> of information. Therefore, the initial piece of information is weighted more than subsequent pieces of information, leading to a primacy effect.|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} several years {{considerable}} experimenting has been aimed at developing methods for improving potato yields. One of the easiest and most effective ways found was to <b>adjust</b> the seed <b>piece</b> size and number of eyes per piece. Seed pieces were cut to meet the following size categories: 1 / 2, 1, 1 - 1 / 2, and 2 ounces and small whole tubers; 1 - 1 / 2, 2 and 2 - 3 ounces. Significant differences in yield were obtained between the various seed piece size treatments. The yield advantage was in favor of the larger size. The number of eyes per piece was less important except with the smallest size. In this case the seed pieces were incapable of adequately supplying plant growth from more than one eye. Small, whole tubers from good high yielding fields were found to be excellent for seed potato pieces...|$|R

40|$|In this {{position}} paper for the CHI 2015 workshop “Collaborating with Intelligent Machines,” we propose an application to easily adjust {{the emotion of}} a musical melody by using predefined settings. For the adjustment of the melody we rely on music production rules and musical structural characteristics related to predefined emotions that have been defined by prior work. Proposal Music plays an import role in our lives. Out of 162 emotion regulation strategies, listening to music has been listed as the second strategy that people most often use [6, 9]. This is not surprising, as music has shown {{to be able to}} induce bona fide emotions [7, 12]. Professional composers have shown to be able to express effectively the intended emotion of their music piece to their audience [10]. Although, we intuitively would say that the emotion of a music piece is conveyed by the lyrics, studies indicate that the piece’s emotion mainly lies within its melody. Even when lyrics and melody conflict in their expressed emotion, the melody has been proven dominant in emotion determination [1]. This provides opportunities to <b>adjust</b> the music <b>piece’s</b> emotion to any given situation regardless of the lyrics...|$|R
60|$|To build, {{literally}} to confirm, is {{by common}} understanding {{to put together}} and <b>adjust</b> the several <b>pieces</b> of any edifice or receptacle of a considerable size. Thus we have church building, house building, ship building, and coach building. That one edifice stands, another floats, and another is suspended on iron springs, makes {{no difference in the}} nature of the art, if so it may be called, of building or edification. The persons who profess that art, are severally builders, ecclesiastical, naval, or of whatever other name their work may justify; but building does not become architecture merely by the stability of what it erects; and it is no more architecture which raises a church, or which fits it to receive and contain with comfort a required number of persons occupied in certain religious offices, than it is architecture which makes a carriage commodious or a ship swift. I do not, of course, mean that the word is not often, or even may not be legitimately, applied in such a sense (as we speak of naval architecture); but in that sense architecture ceases to be one of the fine arts, and it is therefore better not to run the risk, by loose nomenclature, of the confusion which would arise, and has often arisen, from extending principles which belong altogether to building, into the sphere of architecture proper.|$|R

40|$|This thesis „Travel {{writings}} in biggest Estonian {{newspapers in}} 2010 “ gives a view about travel writing theory based on Estonian and English material and {{also helps to}} understand what does travel writing really means. The resent material in Estonia, used in this thesis, is from 1967 and is mostly based on notes of Juhan Peegel and Endel Mallene. The newer theory is based on English theory and is not over ten years old. Using English theory was important, because Estonian journalism is influenced by western journalism culture {{and there is no}} current theory of travel writing in Estonian language. Travel writing can be considered as one of the feature genre. Between travel writings and features there are many common parts. This fact is based on theory of both genres and also became obvious in the analysis. The biggest difference between these two genres is the subject. All the features can be written about events or people but all the travel writings focus on either travelling or on a place the author has visited. In both genres it is important to use characters, dialogs and carefully chosen details. These active journalists, who gave interviews, agreed that good details are very important in travel writings. Based on analysis of traditional travel writings, that were from Postimees, Õhtuleht, Maaleht Eesti Ekspress and Eesti Päevaleht, shows that these <b>pieces</b> <b>adjust</b> well in the theoretical conception of travel writing. In addition to the signs that described older travel writings, the most travel writings also included „in media res“-beginnings. Travel writings had thematic middle section or narrative middle section. The most common endings of travel writing included a satisfying conclusion and/or were tide up with the beginning. There were more traditional travel writings found from daily newspapers than from weekly newspapers. Whereby, daily newspapers published mostly travel stories from professional journalist and weekly newspapers mostly published travel stories from co-authors, who did not worked regularly for that paper. The reasons, why daily newspapers prefer to publish travel writings form editorial board were mentioned in interviews – professional journalist produce better pieces and editorial board do not have money to by them in. The author of this thesis found it interesting and exciting challenge to write it. The same time it helped to get a good overview of travel sections and travel writings of Estonian biggest newspapers...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there was}} not any {{suitable}} comprehensive educational text concerning physical bases of the absorption law which would be adequate to knowledge (physics, mathematics) and to skills of students of branch of radiology assistant and of related branches of study. For this reason, the bachelor thesis was written. The thesis set several partial goals which were successively achieved. Partial goals of the thesis are: 1. Selection of a theory of knowledge transfer {{to the level of}} branches of study stated above. 2. Creation of an educational text by a way which respects chosen theory. 3. Experimental verification of suitability of the educational text {{from the point of view}} of addressees. 4. Application of chosen statistical methods. On the basis of the analysis of the current state of the solved problem and setting partial aims the following hypotheses were stated: 1. Educational text for radiology assistants can be made by means of application of curricular process. 2. Knowledge of students acquired by means of the elaborated educational text will have a distribution close to normal distribution. As a convenient theory for knowledge transfer from science to educational sphere turned out to be theory of curricular process [1]. On the basis of the theory of the curricular process it was firstly important to analyse current scientific system of non-statistical quantum physics. The thesis deals with relationships between the absorption law and its three components especially in connection with absorption of x-rays and gamma radiation. In the area of conceptual curriculum the "Old quantum theory" became a solution. Sufficient physical base for the absorption law represents a thorough application of wave-particle duality. Mentioned physical pieces of knowledge were subsequently adjusted to the level of knowledge and skills of students for the area of intended and projected curriculum. Stated physical effects were derivated from initial conditions to formulas presented in scientific literature. <b>Adjusted</b> physical <b>pieces</b> of knowledge were subsequently transformed into a comprehensive educational text as a basic constituent of projected curriculum (see Annexe 1). By means of creation of the educational text the following hypothesis was proved: "Educational text for radiology assistants in the area of physical bases of the absorption law can be made by means of application of curricular process application". For verification of knowledge acquired by students an educational test was realised. The test had 23 question with one correct answer for every question (the test is presented in Annexe 2). Quantification of knowledge of students as a part of implemented curriculum- 2 was made by means of statistical inquiry. Besides methods of descriptive statistics a method of assignment of theoretical distribution to empirical distribution was used. On the basis of assignment of theoretical distribution to empirical distribution it was determined that knowledge of students can be expressed by Gauss distribution. This confirmed not only adequacy of the created educational text but also the second hypothesis of the thesis. Benefits of the bachelor's thesis: Theoretical benefits of the thesis: 1. Application of curricular process in education of radiology assistants in the area of the physical bases of the absorption law. 2. Application of algorithm of statistics on verification of the hypotheses of the thesis. Practical benefits of the thesis: 1. The old quantum theory in the form of wave-particle duality of photon and electron are an adequate physical base for understanding the absorption law in the area of x-rays and gamma radiation. 2. Recommendation for improving physical preparation of radiology assistants on the basis of the analysis of particular test questions. 3. Educational text and test can be used in the education of radiological physics for the branch radiology assistant and also for related branches...|$|R
