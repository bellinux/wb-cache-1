5|$|The Mozambican War of Independence was {{an armed}} {{conflict}} between the guerrilla forces of the Mozambique Liberation Front or FRELIMO (Frente de Libertação de Moçambique), and Portugal. The war officially started on September 25, 1964, and ended with a ceasefire on September 8, 1974, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> independence in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Adlertag ("Eagle Day") was {{the first}} day of Unternehmen Adlerangriff ("Operation Eagle Attack"), which was the codename of a {{military}} operation by Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe (German air force) to destroy the British Royal Air Force (RAF). By June 1940, the Allies had been defeated in Western Europe and Scandinavia. Rather than come to terms with Germany, Britain rejected all overtures for <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> peace.|$|E

5|$|American {{journalist}} H. R. Knickerbocker, who had met both Hitler and Hess, {{speculated that}} Hitler had sent Hess {{to deliver a}} message informing Winston Churchill of the forthcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, and offering <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> peace or even an anti-Bolshevik partnership. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin believed that Hess's flight had been engineered by the British. Stalin persisted in this belief as late as 1944, when he mentioned the matter to Churchill, who insisted {{that they had no}} advance knowledge of the flight.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, {{intervened in}} an attempt to produce <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> solution. Henry reached an {{agreement}} whereby after five weeks, the castle finally surrendered; the garrison were allowed to leave peacefully but the castle was handed over to the king. The deal struck by Miles and Henry appears to have left the surrounding estates {{in the hands of the}} Beauchamps, however, and in 1141 Miles returned and retook the castle itself, although no details are available as to how he achieved this.|$|E
5|$|Shoup's {{opposition}} to the war only increased over time; he initially pushed for <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> settlement but later supported a unilateral pullout from the country. As the Vietnamization strategy took effect and the U.S. increased its air operations, he remained opposed to any strategy that risked a nuclear war with China or the Soviet Union. His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Solachon {{was fought}} in 586 CE in {{northern}} Mesopotamia between the East Roman (Byzantine) forces, led by Philippicus, and the Sassanid Persians under Kardarigan. The engagement {{was part of}} the long and inconclusive Byzantine–Sassanid War of 572–591. The Battle of Solachon ended in a major Byzantine victory which improved the Byzantine position in Mesopotamia, but it was not in the end decisive. The war dragged on until 591, when it ended with <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> settlement between Maurice and the Persian shah KhosrauII (r. 590–628).|$|E
5|$|Under Ridgway's command, the Eighth Army pressed north {{again in}} January. He inflicted heavy {{casualties}} on the Chinese, recaptured Seoul in March 1951, and pushed {{on to the}} 38th Parallel. With the improved military situation, Truman now saw the opportunity to offer <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> peace but, on 24 March, MacArthur called upon China {{to admit that it}} had been defeated, simultaneously challenging both the Chinese and his own superiors. Truman's proposed announcement was shelved.|$|E
5|$|Worn {{down by the}} {{communist}} guerrilla war for Vietnamese independence and handed a watershed defeat by communist Viet Minh rebels at the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, the French accepted <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> abandonment of their colonial stake in Vietnam. In the Geneva Conference, peace accords were signed, leaving Vietnam divided between a pro-Soviet administration in North Vietnam and a pro-Western administration in South Vietnam at the 17th parallel north. Between 1954 and 1961, Eisenhower's United States sent economic aid and military advisers to strengthen South Vietnam's pro-Western regime against communist efforts to destabilize it.|$|E

5|$|A {{war with}} Serbia in 1331–1334 proved less {{successful}} for the Emperor when several towns in Macedonia were {{captured by the}} Serbs, led by the renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos. These gains were only curtailed when the assassination of Syrgiannes {{and the threat of}} a Hungarian invasion forced the Serbian ruler, Stefan Dušan, to seek <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> settlement. The subsequent peace treaty concluded between Andronikos III and Dušan was important for the future of Byzantine-Serbian relations. For the first time, the Byzantines recognized the extensive gains the Serbs had made at the Empire's expense in the central Balkans during Andronikos II's reign. In the aftermath of the pact, Dušan also moved his seat, and with it his realm's centre of gravity, south to Prilep.|$|E
5|$|As the {{economic}} situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the (still) ruling party {{of some of its}} burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> solution.|$|E
5|$|At the war's outset, FRELIMO {{had little}} {{hope for a}} {{conventional}} military victory, with a mere 7000 combatants against a far larger Portuguese force. Their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency, in order to force <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> independence from Lisbon. Portugal fought {{its own version of}} protracted warfare, and a large military force was sent by the Portuguese government to quell the unrest, with troop numbers rising from 8,000 to 24,000 between 1964 and 1967. The number of local soldiers recruited for the Portuguese cause rose to 23,000 in the same period. 860 Special Forces operatives were also being trained in Commando Instruction Centres by 1969.|$|E

5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war between Japan and China in July 1937 the Japanese government at first attempting to contain the fighting and sought <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> settlement to the war. However, after victory in the Battle of Shanghai expansionists prevailed within the Japanese military and on December 1 a campaign to capture Nanking was officially authorized. The task of occupying Nanking was given to General Iwane Matsui, the commander of Japan's Central China Area Army, who believed that the capture of Nanking would force China to surrender and thus end the war. Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek ultimately decided to defend the city and appointed Tang Shengzhi to command the Nanking Garrison Force, a hastily assembled army of local conscripts and {{the remnants of the}} Chinese units who had fought in Shanghai.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war on 3 September 1939 and the rapid conquest of Poland, Shaw was accused of defeatism when, in a New Statesman article, he declared the war over and demanded a peace conference. Nevertheless, when he became convinced that <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> peace was impossible, he publicly urged the neutral United States to join the fight. The London blitz of 1940–41 led the Shaws, both in their mid-eighties, to live full-time at Ayot St Lawrence. Even there they were not immune from enemy air raids, and stayed on occasion with Nancy Astor at her country house, Cliveden. In 1943, {{the worst of the}} London bombing over, the Shaws moved back to Whitehall Court, where medical help for Charlotte was more easily arranged. Her condition deteriorated, and she died in September.|$|E

25|$|On 6 August, the Defence Minister again {{expressed}} his dissatisfaction over the army’s inability to conquer Ayta ash-Sha'b.

5|$|In January 2013, {{the rebels}} {{terminated}} their operations, hoping for <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> settlement. Following a ceasefire and a power-sharing agreement, Séléka and Bozizé agreed to honour the rebel's demands {{for the release}} of rebel prisoners and the expulsion of foreign troops from the country. The agreement allowed Bozizé to complete his term in office and to include members of Séléka in a new government. It was also agreed that fresh elections would be held in 2016. The agreement was not honoured and the rebels captured Bangui on 23 March 2013, forcing Bozizé to flee the capital.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Stephen's siege, Henry returned to England {{again at the}} start of 1153, braving winter storms. Bringing only a small army of mercenaries, probably paid for with borrowed money, Henry was supported in the north and east of England by the forces of Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod, and had hopes of a military victory. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and his advisers at Stockbridge shortly before Easter in April. Details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and would not expect the bishops to attend his court.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period of turmoil, in February 865, that Caliph al-Musta'in (r. 862–866) and two of the senior Turkish officers, Wasif and Bugha the Younger, fled Samarra to Baghdad, where they could count on the support of the Tahirids. The Turkish army in Samarra then {{selected}} al-Musta'in's brother al-Mu'tazz (r. 866–869) as Caliph, and Abu Ahmad was entrusted with the conduct of operations against al-Musta'in and his supporters. The ensuing siege of Baghdad lasted from February to December 865, after which <b>a</b> <b>negotiated</b> settlement was reached. Contrary to the agreed terms, however, al-Musta'in was murdered. It was most likely during this time that Abu Ahmad consolidated his relationship with the Turkish military, especially with Musa ibn Bugha, who played a crucial role during the siege. Abu Ahmad further solidified these ties when he secured a pardon for Bugha the Younger.|$|E
