5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E
