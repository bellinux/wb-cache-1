5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is <b>a</b> <b>net</b> buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is <b>a</b> <b>net</b> lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates <b>a</b> <b>net</b> borrower (or debtor).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the notion of}} AND-OR reduction, which reduces <b>a</b> WF <b>net</b> to <b>a</b> smaller <b>net</b> by iteratively contracting certain well-formed subnets into single nodes until no more such contractions are possible. This reduction can reveal the hierarchical structure of <b>a</b> WF <b>net,</b> and since it preserves certain semantical properties such as soundness, it can help with analysing and understanding why <b>a</b> WF <b>net</b> is sound or not. The reduction {{can also be used}} to verify if <b>a</b> WF <b>net</b> is <b>an</b> AND-OR <b>net.</b> This class of WF nets was introduced in earlier work, and arguably describes nets that follow good hierarchical design principles. It is shown that the AND-OR reduction is confluent up to isomorphism, which means that despite the inherent non-determinism that comes from the choice of subnets that are contracted, the final result of the reduction is always the same up to the choice of the identity of the nodes. Based on this result, a polynomial-time algorithm is presented that computes this unique result of the AND-OR reduction. Finally, it is shown how this algorithm can be used to verify if <b>a</b> WF <b>net</b> is <b>an</b> AND-OR <b>net...</b>|$|R
