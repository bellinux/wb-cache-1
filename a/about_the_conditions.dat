5|$|Although the {{increase}} in jobs for women has had benefits in policy changes for families with working parents, there has been debates <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> of the work places. In Mexico, there is an influx of the maquila industry, which produces products that will be sold in the developed nations. The mostly female workforce is often exploited by having unsafe working conditions, and stress is {{a major cause of}} many illnesses of these women.|$|E
5|$|Jolie first {{witnessed}} {{the effects of}} a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world. Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots. To learn more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} war brought {{national}} attention to Oak Ridge, and there was bad publicity <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> that the Black residents were living in. Roane-Anderson dusted off plans for a village for them. The new village, called Scarboro, was built where the Gamble Valley Trailer Camp had once stood. Construction commenced in 1948, and the first residents moved in two years later. It housed the entire Black community of Oak Ridge until the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|The British Government had {{expected}} {{the campaign to}} be over within months, and the protracted war became increasingly unpopular especially after revelations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> in the concentration camps. Emily Hobhouse, a campaigner, had forced the British Government {{to set up the}} Fawcett Commission, led by suffragist Millicent Fawcett, into the conditions at the camps. Hobhouse published reports from the camps which told of thousands of deaths from disease and malnutrition. These reports helped to sway public opinion against the war. The demand for peace led to a settlement of hostilities, and in 1902, the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed. The two republics were absorbed into the British Empire, although the British were forced to make a number of concessions and reparations to the Boers. The granting of limited autonomy for the area ultimately led to the establishment of the Union of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{prisoner}} reformer John Howard {{reported in}} 1777 that the gaol was very small, forming a main room with three separate cages running along one side; {{one of these}} cages was reserved for female prisoners. The upper room {{was used as a}} chapel, and food for the inmates was lowered through a hole by the prison gaoler. In 1779, after complaints were made by <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions,</b> £500 was granted by Parliament and the gaol was enlarged to comprise a day room and a total of seven cells for male and female prisoners, with accommodation for the prison governor on the first floor. In exchange, the county agreed to take over the maintenance of the gaol. By 1795, Hugh Percy, the 2nd Duke of Northumberland, had become an important local landowner in the region and acquired the rights to the post of constable from the Duke of Cornwall, the then Prince George.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the diocese}} of Constance, Bernhardin Sanson was {{offering}} a special indulgence for contributors to the building of St Peter's in Rome. When Sanson arrived {{at the gates of}} Zurich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences. This was over a year after Martin Luther published his Ninety-five theses (31 October 1517). The council of Zurich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.|$|E

40|$|Gluten {{intolerance}} is {{a condition}} that affects {{a significant portion of}} the world’s population. While awareness <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> has recently increased, <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> remains poorly understood and therefore commonly mis- and underdiagnosed. In this paper, I examine the challenges in obtaining a gluten intolerant diagnosis and attempt to capture the experience of living gluten-free in a wheat-dependent society. Through interviews with gluten intolerant individuals in the Pacific Northwest, I expose a perceived lack of awareness and understanding <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> in <b>the</b> western biomedical community that presented challenges for the participants pre-diagnosis, as well as a perceived lack of awareness and understanding <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> in <b>the</b> general community that presented challenges for the participants post-diagnosis. Based on common themes extrapolated from these interviews, I argue that the western biomedical community as a whole lacks a complete understanding of the entire spectrum of gluten intolerance and that <b>the</b> information <b>about</b> gluten intolerance in published scientific literature does not match the lived experience...|$|R

25|$|As such, {{artificial}} language experiments are typically conducted to explore what the relevant linguistic variables are, what {{sources of information}} infants are able to use and when, and how researchers can go about modeling the learning and acquisition process. Aslin and Newport, for example, have used {{artificial language}}s to explore what features of linguistic input make certain patterns salient and easily detectable by infants, allowing them to easily contrast the detection of syllable repetition with that of word-final syllables and make conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> under which either feature is recognized as important.|$|E

25|$|In 1895 Lowell {{published}} a book titled Mars, which speculated about an arid, dying landscape, whose inhabitants built canals to bring water from the polar caps to irrigate the remaining arable land. This formed the most advanced scientific ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> on the red planet available to Wells at the time The War of the Worlds was written, but the concept was later proved erroneous by more accurate observation of the planet, and later landings by Russian and American probes such as the two Viking missions, that found a lifeless world too cold for water to exist in its liquid state.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{the role}} of social media in digital {{humanitarian}} efforts is a considerable one. During the summer of 2010, when open fires raged across Russia, causing many to die from smog inhalation, the use of social media allowed digital humanitarians to map the areas in need of support. This is because Russians who were hoping to be evacuated were posting online <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> they were in which prompted thousands of Russian bloggers to coordinate relief efforts online. The digital humanitarian efforts in Russia were crucial to responding to the fires in 2010 considering the Russian government was vastly unprepared {{to deal with such}} a large-scale disaster.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} {{of the many}} types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> under which they formed. Two important variables used for the {{classification of}} igneous rocks are particle size, which largely depends on the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars, quartz or feldspathoids, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas are all important minerals {{in the formation of}} almost all igneous rocks, and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals. Types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare, and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates.|$|E

25|$|As {{previously}} stated function {{refers to}} the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies {{that are likely to}} be effective.|$|E
25|$|O'Brien, {{alarmed at}} the {{increased}} activity of Sinn Féin in 1915, predicted {{the danger of}} a potential republican eruption, culminating in the IRB 1916 Rebellion, in which however Sinn Féin were not involved. He was forced to cease publication of his Cork Free Press in 1916 soon after the appointment of Lord Decies as Chief Press Censor for Ireland. Decies warned the press {{to be careful about}} what they published. Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the Cork Free Press. It was suppressed after its republican editor, Frank Gallagher, accused the British authorities of lying <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> and situation of republican prisoners in the Frongoch internment camp.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parts of}} the British press and British {{government}} expected the campaign to be over within months, and the protracted war gradually became less popular, especially after revelations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> in the concentration camps (where as many as 26,000 Afrikaner women and children died of disease and malnutrition).
