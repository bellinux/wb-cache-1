5|$|During {{the last}} years of his career, {{dedicated}} <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> the Sagrada Família, Gaudí reached the culmination of this naturalistic style, creating a synthesis of all of the solutions and styles he had tried until then. Gaudí achieved perfect harmony between structural and ornamental elements, between plastic and aesthetic, between function and form, between container and content, achieving the integration of all arts in one structured, logical work.|$|E
5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> women's rights, {{she was an}} active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike many {{of those involved in}} the women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E
5|$|According to David A. Norris, {{a scholar}} specializing in Serbian {{cultural}} history, conditions in 19th-century Serbia were unsuitable {{for the development}} of visual art. Materials were difficult to come by, studio and exhibition spaces were virtually non-existent, and there were no art patrons willing to financially support painters and purchase their finished works. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Serbian visual artists dedicated themselves <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> decorating the walls of churches and producing icons and other religious objects. There were some painters of Serb heritage living outside Serbia, such as Uroš Knežević and Jovan Popović, who resided in the Austrian Empire.|$|E

5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, a {{synthesis}} of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{ultimate}} {{aim was to}} help defeat the communist forces in the Soviet Union, the Corps was used <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> fight the Partisans in areas of occupied Yugoslavia, initially in a defensive role. At its maximum strength, it was composed of one cavalry regiment and four infantry regiments. Between the autumn of 1941 and the spring of 1944, the Corps was primarily responsible for protecting weapons factories, mines, roads, and railroads throughout occupied Serbia in accordance with priorities established by the German High Command. The Corps never operated as a unified force, the regiment being its largest operational unit. The regiments were later assigned to act as auxiliaries to German or Bulgarian occupying forces. During its existence, it was reinforced with younger émigrés and former Soviet prisoners-of-war (POW). Russian émigrés living in Bulgaria, the Axis puppet Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and Hungary also came to Belgrade to join the force. It was armed by the Germans with weapons captured from the Royal Yugoslav Army, and its command language was Russian. Throughout its existence it maintained {{good relations with the}} Nedić administration.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> {{permanent}} watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows {{and lakes}} with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is {{negatively associated with}} the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other Academy Awards, the Best Foreign Language Film Award is not {{presented}} {{to a specific}} individual. It is accepted by the winning film's director, but is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Over the years, the Best Foreign Language Film Award and its predecessors have been given <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> European films: out of the 68 awards handed out by the Academy since 1947 to foreign language films, 56 have gone to European films, six to Asian films, three to African films and three to films from the Americas. The late Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini directed four Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award-winning motion pictures during his lifetime, {{more than any other}} director. If Special Awards are taken into account, then Fellini's record is tied by his fellow countryman Vittorio De Sica. The Soviet epic War and Peace (1966–67), for its part, is the longest motion picture to have won the Best Foreign Language Film Award. Filmed from 1962 to 1966, it ran for more than seven hours.|$|E

25|$|Heriot-Watt's {{time as the}} Watt Institution {{marked a}} {{transitional}} period for the organisation, as its curriculum broadened to include several subjects beyond mathematics and the physical sciences. While the School of Arts had catered <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> working-class artisans and technical workers, the Watt Institution admitted {{a large number of}} middle-class students, whom it attracted with new subjects in the sciences, social sciences and humanities. By 1885, the skilled working class were no longer the majority in an institution that had been created explicitly for them.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. bid to {{host the}} 1986 World Cup after Colombia withdrew from {{contention}} due to economic concerns, but FIFA selected Mexico {{to host the}} tournament. In the last game of CONCACAF qualifying for the 1986 World Cup, the U.S. needed only a tie against Costa Rica to reach the final qualification group against Honduras and Canada. U.S. Soccer scheduled the game to be played in Torrance, California, an area with many Costa Rican expatriates, and marketed the game <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> <b>to</b> the Costa Rican community. Costa Rica won the match 1–0, and kept the U.S. from reaching its fourth World Cup finals.|$|E
25|$|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang did not, however, restart {{her film}} career or launch a career {{for her in}} episodic {{television}} despite several guest-starring roles in , Marcus Welby, M.D., Branigan and The Men From Shiloh.

In addition, musicals were now failing {{at the box office}} and that avenue was closed to her.
