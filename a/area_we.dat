25|$|A useful {{idea from}} {{mechanics}} {{is that the}} energy gained by a particle {{is equal to the}} force applied to the particle multiplied by the displacement of the particle while that force is applied. Now consider the first law without the heating term: dU = -PdV. The pressure P {{can be viewed as a}} force (and in fact has units of force per unit area) while dVis the displacement (with units of distance times <b>area).</b> <b>We</b> may say, with respect to this work term, that a pressure difference forces a transfer of volume, and that the product of the two (work) is the amount of energy transferred out of the system as a result of the process. If one were to make this term negative then this would be the work done on the system.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} four organizations {{at the airport}} that offer fixed based operator services for general aviation users. One name familiar to the <b>area</b> <b>we</b> live in also resides in Kalamazoo. Duncan Aviation, which {{is located on the}} west side of the airfield, offers a large variety of services as it is the only full-service fixed based operator on the field. Duncan handles the traditional FBO services such as fueling. Maintenance, hangaring, aircraft movement, and many other ground services while also providing weather equipment and crew rest areas for pilots. They also offer passenger service such as rental and courtesy cars, restrooms vending, and a lobby area. The Duncan facility is the terminal for entrance to the general aviation side of the airport. Kalamazoo Aircraft is another major fixed based operator at the airport that offers maintenance services to smaller general aviation aircraft; they offer inspections, maintenance, repairs, and alterations. The third FBO on the field is the Kalamazoo Pilots Association which operates a self-service fueling pump in the hangar area. The last fixed based operator is Aviation Assets which conducts a flight training school on the north side of the airport.|$|E

The unbeaten home record was obliterated, along with any pretence that England had nothing to learn from overseas rivals—they were totally outplayed by the fluid, fast-paced game of the Hungarians, which McKinstry comments was not dissimilar to Tottenham's push-and-run. Ramsey scored his third and final international goal in the game, from the penalty spot, and refused to accept that England had been outclassed, saying: [...] "Four of those goals came from outside the penalty <b>area.</b> <b>We</b> should never have lost."

In fact, the availability of this wood allowed the growth of the community, which was located in a relatively isolated promontory along the coast.

2500|$|At 15:38, Egyptian radar {{installations}} {{informed the}} EAF command {{that a second}} wave of around 16 Israeli aircraft was coming from over the Mediterranean at very low altitude. The Egyptians scrambled a final eight MiG-21s at Mansoura, while eight MiG-21s from the Abu Hamad air base were called upon to assist. The ensuing air battle was intense, involving large numbers of aircraft; at one point, the battle involved 62 MiG-21s and some 120 Phantoms and A-4 Skyhawks. A few Israeli fighter-bombers reached their target and [...] bombed the runway and the air defenses around the air base. While the final eight aircraft from Mansoura took off, Israeli aircraft were approaching to make their bombing run. Nasr Mousa, piloting {{one of the eight}} MiG-21s, spotted an Israeli Phantom lining up against him. Mousa made a sudden, hard right-hand turn that put him on the Phantom's tail. He shot down the Phantom with cannon fire, and no parachutes emerged. Medhat 'Arafa, an Egyptian pilot, recalls [...] "the battle was a frightening sight because I had never seen so many aeroplanes in one <b>area.</b> <b>We</b> were not only dogfighting, but also warning other pilots that they had an enemy on their tail..." [...] The Israeli Phantoms had to abandon their bomb-loads in order to dogfight with the more maneuverable MiG aircraft. Egyptian pilots had to land their aircraft, re-arm, refuel and take-off again within a period of seven minutes. Take-off usually took three minutes, but according to Naser, the pilots were able to accomplish it in one-and-a-half minutes during the air battle.|$|E
