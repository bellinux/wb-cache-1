500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat.

And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E

6000|$|Upon this Lynette fell alaughing {{in great}} measure and she said: [...] "Messire, since {{you ask me}} that thing, I {{have to tell you}} that this fellow is a certain kitchen knave, hight Beaumains, who hath {{followed}} me hither from the court of King Arthur, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you further that many times I have bid him begone and leave me, but he will not do so, but continually followeth after me." ...|$|E

Now, Beaumains, this is a very different sort of knight from any of those with whom you have hitherto had to do, wherefore be you advised that it is not meet for a kitchen knave to have to do in such an adventure as this.

60|$|Many {{travellers}} {{have told}} of the glories of Seville, to which ancient Moorish city I journeyed with all speed, sailing there up the Guadalquiver, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of lands from which no other wanderer has returned to England, and must press on to them. To be short then; foreseeing {{that it might be}} necessary for me to stop some time in Seville, and being desirous to escape notice and to be at the smallest expense possible, I bethought me that it would be well if I could find means of continuing my studies of medicine, and to this end I obtained certain introductions from the firm of merchants to whose care I had been recommended, addressed to doctors of medicine in Seville. These letters at my request were made out not in my own name but in that of 'Diego d'Aila,' for I did not wish it to be known that I was an Englishman. Nor, indeed, was this likely, except my speech should betray me, for, as I have said, in appearance I was very Spanish, and the hindrance of the language was one that lessened every day, since having already learned it from my mother, and taking every opportunity to read and speak it, within six months I could talk Castilian except for some slight accent, like a native of the land. Also I have a gift for the acquiring of languages.|$|E
6000|$|One {{legacy of}} his mother's Pen remembered, of which Laura could have no cognisance. It was that wish of Helen's {{to make some}} present to Fanny Bolton; and Pen wrote to her, putting his letter under an {{envelope}} to Mr. Bows, and requesting that gentleman to read it before he delivered it to Fanny. [...] "Dear Fanny," [...] Pen said, [...] "I have to acknowledge two letters from you, {{one of which was}} delayed in my illness" [...] (Pen found the first letter in his mother's desk after her decease and the reading it gave him a strange pang), [...] "and to thank you, my kind nurse and friend, who watched me so tenderly during my fever. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that the last words of my dear mother who is no more, were words of goodwill and gratitude to you for nursing me: and she said she would have written to you, had she had time--that she would like to ask your pardon if she had harshly treated you--and that she would beg you to show your forgiveness by accepting some token of friendship and regard from her." [...] Pen concluded by saying that his friend, George Warrington, Esq., of Lamb Court, Temple, was trustee of a little sum of money, of which the interest would be paid to her until she became of age, or changed her name, which would always be affectionately remembered by her grateful friend, A. Pendennis. The sum was in truth but small, although enough to make a little heiress of Fanny Bolton, whose parents were appeased, and whose father said Mr. P. had acted quite as the gentleman--though Bows growled out that that to plaster a wounded heart with a banknote was an easy kind of sympathy; and poor Fanny felt only too clearly that Pen's letter was one of farewell.|$|E

6000|$|We {{have now}} come to the first of those episodes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the way in which}} Cicero {{struggled}} with Verres, and how he conquered him. In 74 B.C. Verres was Prætor in Rome. At that period of the Republic there were eight Prætors elected annually, two of whom remained in the city, whereas the others were employed abroad, generally with the armies of the Empire. In the next year, 73 B.C., Verres went in due course to Sicily with proconsular or proprætorial authority, having the government assigned to him for twelve months. This was usual and constitutional, but it was not unusual, even if unconstitutional, that this period should be prolonged. In the case of Verres it was prolonged, so that he should hold the office for three years. He had gone through the other offices of the State, having been Quæstor in Asia and Ædile afterward in Rome, to the great misfortune of all who were subjected to his handling, as we shall learn by-and-by. The facts are mentioned here to show that the great offices of the Republic were open to such a man as Verres. They were in fact more open to such a candidate than they would be to one less iniquitous--to an honest man or a scrupulous one, or to one partially honest, or not altogether unscrupulous. If you send a dog into a wood to get truffles, you will endeavor to find one that will tear up as many truffles as possible. A proconsular robber did not rob only for himself; he robbed more or less for all Rome. Verres boasted that with his three years of rule he could bring enough home to bribe all the judges, secure all the best advocates, and live in splendid opulence {{for the rest of his}} life. What a dog he was to send into a wood for truffles! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] {{said the}} young man; [...] "this {{is the age}} of conveniences, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you of the last {{perfection}} of the sort. We have affairs in different places; and hence railways were invented. Railways separated us infallibly from our friends; and so telegraphs were made that we might communicate speedier at great distances. Even in hotels we have lifts to spare us a climb of some hundred steps. Now, we know that life is only a stage to play the fool upon {{as long as the}} part amuses us. There was one more convenience lacking to modern comfort; a decent, easy way to quit that stage; the back stairs to liberty; or, as I said this moment, Death's private door. This, my two fellow-rebels, is supplied by the Suicide Club. Do not suppose that you and I are alone, or even exceptional in the highly reasonable desire that we profess. A large number of our fellowmen, who have grown heartily sick of the performance in which they are expected to join daily and all their lives long, are only kept from flight by one or two considerations. Some have families who would be shocked, or even blamed, if the matter became public; others have a weakness at heart and recoil from the circumstances of death. That is, to some extent, my own experience. I cannot put a pistol to my head and draw the trigger; for something stronger than myself withholds the act; and although I loathe life, I have not strength enough in my body to take hold of death and be done with it. For such as I, and for all who desire {{to be out of the}} coil without posthumous scandal, the Suicide Club has been inaugurated. How this has been managed, what is its history, or what may be its ramifications in other lands, I am myself uninformed; and what I know of its constitution, I am not at liberty to communicate to you. To this extent, however, I am at your service. If you are truly tired of life, I will introduce you to-night to a meeting; and if not to-night, at least some time within the week, you will be easily relieved of your existences. It is now (consulting his watch) eleven; by half-past, at latest, we must leave this place; so that you have half-an-hour before you to consider my proposal. It is more serious than a cream tart," [...] he added, with a smile; [...] "and I suspect more palatable." ...|$|E

If you are caught, and you are transporting people like cattle, and anyone dies, death penalty. This is horrible. Can you imagine how hot that truck was? 100-degree temperatures. This sanctuary city thing is a lure, and brings lots of money into people who will do this kind of thing with an empty semi. So which is it going to be? Are we going to incentivize those people, which will lead to more death and destruction? Or are we going to say we have a border, take it seriously. Personally for the driver of this truck who knew and allowed these people to die, Texas death penalty should be coming his way. I hope he's got a hanging judge." ...|$|E
40|$|Being a {{historian}} {{is a bit}} of a slog: years in graduate school, more years in dusty libraries and archives, and even more years teaching students who sometimes don 2 ̆ 7 t seem interested in learning what you have to teach. But the job does have its pleasures, and one of the greatest [...] and surely the guiltiest [...] is watching people screw history up. Not a day goes by when we don 2 ̆ 7 t see someone get it wrong, dead wrong, or so wrong that it 2 ̆ 7 s not even wrong. To us, history is firmly anchored in authenticated sources that have been subjected to intense scrutiny and debate by people who know what they are talking about. To most other folks (though surely none of the people reading these words), history is something a dimly remembered teacher taught you, something you saw on the 2 ̆ 2 History Channel, 2 ̆ 2 or something someone told you once. This kind of history is not anchored in anything other than popular ideas and attitudes, which themselves are constantly changing. In this light, it 2 ̆ 7 s not particularly surprising that when most people talk about history, they don 2 ̆ 7 t get things quite right. When people make historical mistakes, we historians earnestly knit our brows and solemnly bemoan the deficit of historical knowledge. Privately we sometimes chuckle. I 2 ̆ 7 ve done this myself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you I feel bad about it. I can only imagine, then, that Christopher Krebs had an absolute blast writing A Most Dangerous Book: Tacitus 2 ̆ 7 s Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich (Norton, 2011), for it is an epic tale of getting it wrong, history-wise. Beginning about half a millennium ago, people began to say all kinds of wrongheaded things about Tacitus 2 ̆ 7 s thin volume: that Tacitus was writing about 2 ̆ 2 Germans 2 ̆ 2 (he wasn 2 ̆ 7 t); that he knew a lot about 2 ̆ 2 Germans 2 ̆ 2 (he didn 2 ̆ 7 t); that he uniformly praised 2 ̆ 2 Germans 2 ̆ 2 (nope); that the traits he ascribes to 2 ̆ 2 Germans 2 ̆ 2 can be found among modern German-speakers (wrong again). Were it not for the fact that these 2 ̆ 2 interpretations 2 ̆ 2 emboldened evil people (especially the Nazis) to do evil things (too numerous to recount), this exercise in bad history would be funny. But, as Krebs points out, it 2 ̆ 7 s really not very funny at all. It 2 ̆ 7 s a reminder that we professional historians have a duty to make sure we get what we say about the past straight, or else. Christopher Krebs is clearly fulfilling his duty in this important, readable, and very witty book. It deserves a wide audience. That means you...|$|E
