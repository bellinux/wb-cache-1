5|$|Akane Tsunemori {{was created}} by the Production I.G staff to be the most {{relatable}} character in the series.

One of the staff's main objectives was Akane's growth. Akane appears {{at the start of the}} first season as <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> rookie who matures through her experiences.

Hanazawa said one of the focal points of the series after the third episode was the changes Akane would undergo; she would be influenced by many unfamiliar, traumatic experience she must endure as part of her policing role.|$|E
