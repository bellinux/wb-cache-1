5|$|Defensive {{structures}} such as spines may be {{used both}} to ward off attack <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> and if need be to fight back against a predator. Methods of fighting back include chemical defences, mobbing, defensive regurgitation, and suicidal altruism.|$|E
5|$|Epiacum is in {{some ways}} a typical Roman fort: inside the wall are {{straight}} roads which cross, a headquarters building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, a set of barrack blocks for the cohort of auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food. Also as usual, there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> to Hercules.|$|E
25|$|Hone {{came from}} a cricketing family. <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> his father William played for Ireland, as did his uncle Nathaniel. Another uncle, Leland Hone also played for Ireland in {{addition}} to playing one Test match for England.|$|E

25|$|At higher luminosities, quasars {{take the}} place of Seyfert 1s, but, <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> the {{corresponding}} 'quasar 2s' are elusive at present. If {{they do not have the}} scattering component of Seyfert 2s they would be hard to detect except through their luminous narrow-line and hard X-ray emission.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> the lantern's {{structure}} {{is meant to}} symbolize the five elements of Buddhist cosmology. With the sole exception of the fire box, any parts may be absent. For example, an oki-dōrō, or movable lantern (see below) lacks a post, and rests directly on the ground. It also may lack an umbrella.|$|E
25|$|Dominance: <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> in {{this regime}} the enemy forces are equal. You can gain {{the upper hand}} through the proper {{selection}} and application teams. It {{is very important to}} be aware of the terrain on the battlefield and take into account certain weather conditions. In other words, use the single-player experience. Your goal - to capture and retain most of the victory points.|$|E

30|$|Note {{that the}} Einstein {{relation}} {{was used in}} deriving Equation 8, although Sentaurus Device provides the PMI to compute the diffusion coefficients independently [6], <b>as</b> was <b>already</b> <b>mentioned.</b> The second term in Equation 8 {{takes into account the}} thermal diffusion contribution to the current density.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> {{the castle}} with the {{surrounding}} land was purchased by Munthe who, as he hated hunting, made it a sanctuary for birds. Throughout his life, Munthe campaigned to abolish hunting {{and was able to}} convince Benito Mussolini himself to draw up legislation denying hunters access to the island. As of 1950, a year after Munthe's death, the castle became part of the Axel Munthe Foundation under the ownership of the Swedish Consulate.|$|E
25|$|Even {{more curious}} is the {{presence}} of patterns of glazed bricks and various plaques bearing initials and enigmatic symbols. <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> the porch gable contains glazed headers in a diamond shape (diapering) and a glazed header barge line (a diagonal line of bricks following the barge boards on the gable), but these embellishments are unevenly spaced so that the diamond is clearly off-center (see porch picture in gallery). This irregularity is true for the use of glazed headers throughout the structure.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> {{the methods}} and formalisms of {{universal}} algebra are an important tool for many order theoretic considerations. Beside formalizing orders in terms of algebraic structures that satisfy certain identities, one can also establish other connections to algebra. An example is given by the correspondence between Boolean algebras and Boolean rings. Other issues {{are concerned with the}} existence of free constructions, such as free lattices based on a given set of generators. Furthermore, closure operators are important in the study of universal algebra.|$|E
50|$|According to Harvard University {{professor}} Theodore Bestor, Japan {{does look}} very homogeneous {{from a distant}} perspective, but in fact {{there are a number}} of very significant minority groups - ethnically different minority groups - in Japan today. Such <b>as</b> the <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> Ainu and Ryukyuan people.|$|R

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> dwarfs {{were allowed}} to have several high ranked jobs and could move up the ranks during their career. Old Kingdom reliefs depict dwarfs {{performing}} mainly easy, rather creative jobs, because their shortened and fragile stature did not allow for hard or dangerous physical work. Unsurprisingly then dwarfs mainly worked as jewelers, tailors, cup-bearers and even as zookeepers. As at other periods, dwarfs were particularly valued as treasurers or jewellers, as their very distinctive appearance would make any dishonest dealings on their part that {{much more difficult to}} get away with.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> Vance and Frawley {{were offered}} {{a chance to}} take their {{characters}} to their own spin-off series. Frawley was willing, but Vance refused to ever work with Frawley again since the two did not get along. Frawley did appear once more with Lucille Ball — in an episode of The Lucy Show in 1965, which did not include Vance (who by then had ceased to be a regular on that show). However, this was his last screen appearance with his longtime friend. He died in Hollywood on March 3, 1966, of a heart attack at age 79.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> the Spanish {{version of}} the Halakot Gedolot, {{probably}} made about 1000, adopted these four sections as a complete treatise; hence one would not be far wrong in setting the 9th century as the date of composition. The first four sections date from a much earlier period. From their contents they may even have been an independent collection already in existence {{at the time of}} the Tannaim. At any rate this collection contains much that is old, even if it can not be proved that the Megillat Ḥasidim, which is cited in Abot de-Rabbi Natan (ed. Schechter, xxvi. 52), is identical with the treatise under discussion.|$|E
25|$|Factorials {{occur in}} algebra for various reasons, such <b>as</b> via the <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> {{coefficients}} of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.|$|R
30|$|While the {{geographical}} dispersion makes it quite hard for some developers to meet others and obtain new certificates, <b>as</b> we <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> {{there is a}} tradition in Debian to announce travels in a (private, developers-only) mailing list, and active developers often will gladly meet people traveling to their region just for a key signature exchange.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} {{commentary on}} the Torah, which, <b>as</b> has <b>already</b> been <b>mentioned,</b> was finished by Ibn Ezra shortly before his death, was called Sefer ha-Yashar ("Book of the Straight").|$|R
25|$|On May 21, 2001, the National Assembly of France {{passed the}} Taubira law, {{recognizing}} slavery {{as a crime}} against humanity. Apologies on behalf of African nations, for their role in trading their countrymen into slavery, remain an open issue since slavery was practiced in Africa even before the first Europeans arrived and the Atlantic slave trade was performed {{with a high degree}} of involvement of several African societies. The black slave market was supplied by well-established slave trade networks controlled by local African societies and individuals. Indeed, <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> in this article, slavery persists in several areas of West Africa until the present day.|$|E
25|$|The coins of Selinus are {{numerous}} and various. The earliest, <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> bear merely {{the figure of}} a parsley-leaf on the obverse. Those of somewhat later date represent a figure sacrificing on an altar, which is consecrated to Aesculapius, as indicated by a cock that stands below it. The subject of this type evidently refers to a story related by Diogenes Laertius that the Selinuntines were afflicted with a pestilence from the marshy character of the lands adjoining the neighboring river, but that this was cured by works of drainage, suggested by Empedocles. A figure standing on some coins is the river-god Selinus, who was thus made conducive to the salubrity of the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} modern Canadian cricket though {{come from the}} regions of Upper Canada, in {{particular}} Toronto, then known as York. During {{the early years of}} the nineteenth century, a schoolmaster by the name of George Anthony Barber encouraged the game there, and founded the Toronto Cricket Club in 1827. Barber instigated a game played between the Toronto Cricket Club and the cricket team of Upper Canada College in 1836, a game won by the college team. This game has been played annually ever since. <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> Canada played its first international against the USA in 1844 in New York at St George's Cricket Club, now the site of the New York University Medical Center.|$|E
30|$|This is {{predictable}} because, <b>as</b> it was <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> {{with increasing}} the substrate temperature, {{the size of}} the grains becomes larger {{on the surface of the}} films, which will lead to increasing the roughness of the deposited thin films.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, {{commentator}} Francis Buchanan-Hamilton noted: In Nepal, the Gangja, Charas, or Cannabis sativa, <b>as</b> I have <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> {{is a common}} weed : but in that country it is not cultivated, although much used {{for the purposes of}} intoxication.|$|R
60|$|The mate {{delivered}} them {{a copy of}} {{the scheme}} I had proposed, the reasons of it, the trade I had designed, the return I was to make, and everything, <b>as</b> I have <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> and bade them take it and consider of it.|$|R
25|$|The {{solar wind}} and the magnetosphere, being two {{electrically}} conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from {{the flow of the}} solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection. <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, due to {{the fact}} that one of the four Donau-Harbors (Donauhäfen) in Austria is located in Linz, it {{constitutes}} an attractive location in regards to logistic and trading enterprises. Nonetheless manufacturing plants can – for instance - be found at the waterfront as well. The economic importance of Linz was founded over centuries in trade. Moreover, the long-standing image of Linz as an industrial city was a result of the National Socialism. As a result of this large industrial enterprises are still located in Linz nowadays. Great examples in regards to this are Voestalpine AG or “Chemie Linz” – <b>as</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned</b> above. From an economical perspective they represent a large number of jobs and of course industry related enterprises.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of Hoveyda's premiership {{is marked by a}} sense of optimism. <b>As</b> <b>already</b> <b>mentioned,</b> in 1966, Hoveyda {{attempted}} to allure many elements of the intellectual community, as well as the opposition, into an informal agreement with the regime. Although talks between the two sides eventually broke down, Hoveyda never lost sight of what a partnership between the two could have accomplished. His pragmatic approach to politics allowed him to envision an incremental reform process that can be carried out through action. This is contrary to the path assumed by many Iranian intellectuals at the time, which involved quixotic solutions to problems such as electoral corruption and media censorship. Hoveyda resumed many of the reform initiatives set out by the Mansour administration. In particular, reform plans that were laid out by the Shah in the White Revolution. Although a secularist, he would even allocate government revenue to the clerical establishment. The clerical establishment was seen as a bulwark against Communism by the Shah, and was constantly reinforced (a policy that the Shah would later regret).|$|E
