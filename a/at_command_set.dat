The white giant stood beside him watching his every move. He was trying to understand why sometimes men killed one another and again defended and nursed.

50|$|The 4P had a slot for an {{internal}} modem board. The Radio Shack modem board used its own proprietary command set and only supported communications at 300 baud. Later a third-party company called Teletrends produced a 1200 baud modem board that used the industry-standard Hayes <b>AT</b> <b>command</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E
50|$|The mobile {{may also}} be {{connected}} to a desktop computer, laptop, or PDA, {{for use as a}} network interface (just like a modem or Ethernet card, but using one of the GSM data protocols described below instead of a PSTN-compatible audio channel or an Ethernet link to transmit data). Some GSM phones can also be controlled by a standardised Hayes <b>AT</b> <b>command</b> <b>set</b> through a serial cable or a wireless link (using IRDA or Bluetooth). The AT commands can control anything from ring tones to data compression algorithms.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{main purpose}} of this project is to {{authenticate}} the data transmitted between two P 2 P (Point to Point) modules. This connection pertains to wireless data communication for IP networks using radio frequencies. Session initiation protocol (SIP) is the application layer control protocol used in TCP/IP. Hardware P 2 P module facilitates transmission of real time asynchronous data using SIP protocol over IP networks. The serial device communicates with the P 2 P module using Attention Telephone (<b>AT)</b> <b>command</b> <b>set.</b> The P 2 P module selected is ARM 9 micro controller ported with Linux. The serial device selected is XR 16 C 850 UART which supports Intel and pc data mode data bus interface with a high speed of 2 Mbps...|$|E
50|$|In Mobile networks, the {{terminal}} adapter {{is used by}} the Terminal equipment to access the Mobile termination, using <b>AT</b> <b>commands</b> (see Hayes <b>command</b> <b>set).</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>AT</b> <b>commands</b> are old modem commands, e.g., Hayes <b>command</b> <b>set</b> and Motorola phone <b>AT</b> <b>commands,</b> and can {{therefore}} {{only be used}} on a device that has modem support. Using these commands one can only obtain information through the operating system, such that no deleted data can be extracted.|$|R
50|$|A {{voice modem}} is an analog {{telephone}} data modem {{with a built-in}} capability of transmitting and receiving voice recordings over the phone line. Voice modems are used for telephony and answering machine applications. Similar to the Hayes <b>command</b> <b>set</b> used for data modems, in which the host PC commands the modem via a series of <b>commands</b> known as <b>AT</b> <b>commands,</b> there exists a well-defined set of common voice <b>AT</b> <b>commands</b> that are somewhat consistent throughout the industry.|$|R
5000|$|In the Hayes <b>command</b> <b>set,</b> the <b>AT</b> <b>command</b> that {{switches}} local {{echo off}} (in command mode) is E0 and the command to switch it on is E1. For local echo in data mode, the commands are F1 and F0 respectively. (Note {{the reversal of}} the numbers. The [...] "F" [...] commands {{are not part of}} the EIA/TIA-602 standard, but the [...] "E" [...] commands are.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The USB mass-storage {{specification}} {{provides an}} interface {{to a number}} of industry-standard <b>command</b> <b>sets,</b> allowing a device to disclose its subclass. In practice, there is little support for specifying a <b>command</b> <b>set</b> via its subclass; most drivers only support the SCSI transparent <b>command</b> <b>set,</b> designating their subset of the SCSI <b>command</b> <b>set</b> with their SCSI Peripheral Device Type (PDT). Subclass codes specify the following command sets: ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{extended}} <b>command</b> <b>set</b> - An [...] "&" [...] (ampersand) and {{a capital}} character {{followed by a}} digit. This extends the basic <b>command</b> <b>set.</b> For example, &M1. Note that M1 is different from &M1.|$|R
50|$|SCSI Multimedia Commands (MMC) {{defines a}} SCSI/ATAPI based <b>command</b> <b>set</b> for {{accessing}} multimedia features on devices {{capable of such}} functionality. T10 subcommittee is responsible for developing {{it as well as}} other SCSI <b>command</b> <b>set</b> standards.|$|R
5000|$|SATA uses a <b>command</b> <b>set</b> that {{is based}} on the {{parallel}} ATA <b>command</b> <b>set</b> and then extended beyond that set to include features like native command queuing, hot-plugging, and TRIM. SAS uses the SCSI <b>command</b> <b>set,</b> which includes a wider range of features like error recovery, reservations and block reclamation. Basic ATA has commands only for direct-access storage. However SCSI commands may be tunneled through ATAPI for devices such as CD/DVD drives.|$|R
50|$|A trim command (known as TRIM in the ATA <b>command</b> <b>set,</b> and UNMAP in the SCSI <b>command</b> <b>set)</b> allows an {{operating}} system to inform a solid-state drive (SSD) which {{blocks of data}} are no longer considered in use and can be wiped internally.|$|R
50|$|The <b>command</b> <b>set</b> {{consists}} {{of a series of}} short text strings which can be combined to produce commands for operations such as dialing, hanging up, and changing the parameters of the connection. The vast majority of dial-up modems use the Hayes <b>command</b> <b>set</b> in numerous variations.|$|R
