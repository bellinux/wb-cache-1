5|$|A further {{revival of}} the company name took place: a company formed as Churchill Atlantic (Manchester) Co Ltd, company {{registration}} number 01469025, had been incorporated in 1979 and in 1999 was renamed The Churchill Machine Tool Co Ltd; two years later, in April 2001, it <b>also</b> <b>failed</b> and went into receivership. There is an Atlantic Street in Broadheath.|$|E
5|$|According to Stanley Karnow, the Pulitzer Prize-winning {{author of}} Vietnam: A History, the coup was ineffectively executed; {{although}} the rebels captured {{the headquarters of}} the Joint General Staff at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, they failed to follow the textbook tactics of blocking the roads leading into Saigon. They <b>also</b> <b>failed</b> to disconnect phone lines into the palace, which allowed Diệm to call for aid from loyal units.|$|E

On 6 July, Playford and the Executive Council {{decided not to}} reprieve Stuart, and he was due to be executed the next day, but {{an appeal to the}} Privy Council in London stalled proceedings again. However, this <b>also</b> <b>failed.</b> Labor then tried to introduce legislation to stall the hanging.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2012 Supreme Court ruling {{upholding}} ACA as constitutional, Republicans held another vote {{to repeal}} the law on July 11; the House of Representatives voted with all 244 Republicans and 5 Democrats in favor of repeal, which marked the 33rd, partial or whole, repeal attempt. On February 3, 2015, the House of Representatives added its 67th repeal vote to the record (239 to 186). This attempt <b>also</b> <b>failed.</b>|$|E
5|$|France {{eventually}} <b>also</b> <b>failed</b> {{to obtain}} {{orders from the}} remaining two FINABEL nations, Belgium and the Netherlands: the Dutch did not even test the type and the Belgians ordered the Leopard when France refused to allow partial component production of the AMX-30 in Belgium, fearing it would increase the unit cost.|$|E

5|$|The {{suppression}} of Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt signalled {{the end of}} the power of the tribal nobility of Iraq, which henceforth came under the direct control of the Umayyad regime's staunchly loyal Syrian troops. Later revolts, under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab and Zayd ibn Ali, <b>also</b> <b>failed,</b> and it was not until the success of the Abbasid Revolution that the Syrian dominance of Iraq was broken.|$|E
5|$|To {{support his}} {{religious}} conviction and {{his desire to}} become a pastor, in 1877 the family sent him {{to live with his}} uncle Johannes Stricker, a respected theologian, in Amsterdam. Van Gogh prepared for the University of Amsterdam theology entrance examination; he failed the exam, and left his uncle's house in July 1878. He undertook, but <b>also</b> <b>failed,</b> a three-month course at a Protestant missionary school in Laken, near Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars {{failed to}} {{circulate}} to any degree, except {{in and around}} Nevada casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams {{in honor of the}} bicentennial of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the Susan B. Anthony dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but that piece <b>also</b> <b>failed</b> to circulate. Due to their modest cost and the short length of the series, sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among collectors.|$|E

5|$|Another {{attempt was}} made to collect a {{specimen}} by Lord Crawford on his yacht Valhalla in 1905. A final {{attempt was made}} during the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, which passed by in April 1922 on its way back to Britain. This visit <b>also</b> <b>failed,</b> but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then able to use the skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, {{at a meeting of the}} British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E
5|$|At the 1999 Women's World Cup in the United States, the German team <b>also</b> <b>failed</b> {{to qualify}} directly, {{but managed to}} beat the Ukraine in a {{qualifying}} play-off. Germany started their World Cup campaign by drawing with Italy and winning 6–0 over Mexico. In the last group game, Germany drew 3–3 against Brazil; by conceding a last minute equalizer, Germany failed to win the group and subsequently {{had to face the}} hosts in the quarter-final. With 54,642 people in attendance, among them U.S. President Bill Clinton, the crowd at the Jack Kent Cooke Stadium was the biggest the German team had ever played in front of. Despite leading twice, they lost 2–3 to the eventual World Cup winners.|$|E
5|$|Both sides claimed victory {{after the}} battle, with the JNA hailing the {{evacuation}} of the garrison as its greatest success. However, they achieved only part of their objectives; the JNA failed to secure the area surrounding the barracks or remove all the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj <b>also</b> <b>failed.</b> Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing the garrison. Nonetheless, the JNA threat from the Logorište barracks was removed (freeing up forces assigned to the blockade of the barracks) {{and a large number}} of weapons were captured.|$|E

5|$|Despite having aided Togashi Masachika in {{his return}} to power, within a year the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga fell into {{conflict}} with him. Claiming that he failed to adequately deliver on his promises of economic reward, the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga revolted in 1474. Rennyo refused to support these rebellions, and the Ikkō-ikki were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in neighboring Etchū. Shimotsuma Rensu, a ji-samurai from Echizen and an advisor to Rennyo, led another revolt, falsely claiming that Rennyo authorized his actions. This revolt <b>also</b> <b>failed,</b> and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu.|$|E
5|$|Dundee United's league success {{saw them}} {{take part in}} the European Cup in 1983–84. Milne scored doubles against Hamrun Spartans and Standard Liège as United reached the semi-final, losing 3–2 on {{aggregate}} to Roma in an ill-tempered tie. Dundee United <b>also</b> <b>failed</b> to retain their league title, finishing in third place and 10 points behind champions Aberdeen. Milne's goal tally also dropped significantly from the previous year, down to five goals in the league and a total of 12 in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with these}} efforts, {{fundraising}} lagged. Grover Cleveland, {{the governor of}} New York, vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884. An attempt the next year to have Congress provide $100,000, sufficient to complete the project, <b>also</b> <b>failed.</b> The New York committee, with only $3,000 in the bank, suspended work on the pedestal. With the project in jeopardy, groups from other American cities, including Boston and Philadelphia, offered to pay {{the full cost of}} erecting the statue in return for relocating it.|$|E
