5|$|Although {{important}} to the local economy with spending generating over £53,000,000 GVA, Christchurch is not so heavily dependent on tourism as some of its neighbours. Tourism's contribution to the local economy is about 9% compared to 18% for Weymouth and Portland, 15% for Purbeck and 12% for Bournemouth. Visitor accommodation consists of 11 caravan <b>and</b> <b>camping</b> parks and some 900 bed spaces in eight hotels and 75 guest houses and bed and breakfast establishments.|$|E

5|$|Its name {{derives from}} potlatch, {{a type of}} {{ceremony}} held by the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest; one such tribe lived along the river {{for hundreds of years}} before the arrival of whites. Pioneers settled the watershed and established farms and ranches in the late 19th century. After that, logging eliminated most of the forests within the watershed and the ecology of the river is {{still in the process of}} recovery. Fishing, hiking <b>and</b> <b>camping</b> are popular recreational activities on the river; 14 percent the watershed lies on public lands. Before logging and agriculture, many varieties of riparian and forest plants once populated the catchment, and several species of fish still swim the river and its tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{has been}} the largest {{industry}} in Weymouth for decades, though {{the number of people}} employed in the sector has declined slightly since its peak in the late 1990s. Weymouth's coast and beaches, lakes, museums, aquarium, and two shopping centres are the main attractions for visitors. The visitor accommodation consists of hotels on the seafront, guest houses around the town centre, and caravan <b>and</b> <b>camping</b> sites just out of town, including three sites owned by Haven and British Holidays: Littlesea, Seaview and Weymouth Bay.|$|E
5|$|Tourism in Nunavut {{focuses on}} outdoor {{activities}} {{and culture of}} the local Inuit, the indigenous people of Nunavut. Wildlife watching is a popular tourist attraction, as the territory is home to a number of wildlife and bird sanctuaries. It is possible to spot walrus, polar bears, a large variety of birds and belugas throughout Nunavut. Outdoor adventure activities are also popular. Nunavut has a wide and lengthy river system, meaning that there are a large number of canoeing and kayaking opportunities to suit experienced travellers. Nunavut's vast expanse of uninhabited territory offers many opportunities for hiking <b>and</b> <b>camping.</b> However, the region's often extreme conditions and remote location often necessitates a guide, even for experienced campers.|$|E

40|$|In perifused immortalized GnRH neurons (GT 1 – 7), {{simultaneous}} {{measurements of}} GnRH <b>and</b> <b>cAMP</b> {{revealed that the}} secretory profiles for both GnRH <b>and</b> <b>cAMP</b> are pulsatile. An analysis of GnRH <b>and</b> <b>cAMP</b> pulses in 16 independent experiments revealed that 25 % of pulses coincide. Inversion of the peak and nadir levels was found in 33 % and random relationship between GnRH <b>and</b> <b>cAMP</b> found in 42 % of analyzed pulses. The random relation between GnRH <b>and</b> <b>cAMP</b> pulse resets to synchronous after an inverse relation between pulses occurred during the major GnRH release, indicating that GnRH acts as a switching mechanism to synchronize <b>cAMP</b> <b>and</b> GnRH release in perifused GT 1 – 7 neurons. Activation of GnRH receptors with increasing agonist concentrations caused a biphasic change in cAMP levels. Low nanomolar concentrations increased cAMP production, but at high concentrations the initial increase {{was followed by a}} rapid decline to below the basal level. Blockade of the GnRH receptors by peptide and nonpeptide antagonists generated monotonic nonpulsatile increases in both GnRH <b>and</b> <b>cAMP</b> production. These findings indicate that cAMP positively regulates GnRH secretion but does not participate in the mechanism of pulsatile GnRH release...|$|R
5|$|Traffic volumes on Highway35 vary {{considerably}} over {{the length of}} the highway, as well as {{over the course of the}} year due to its use for recreational purposes, including snowmobiling, cottaging <b>and</b> <b>camping.</b> Along the Highway35 and Highway115 concurrency, the average daily vehicle count is above 20,000. This drops as Highway35 splits off at Enterprise Hill to under 10,000. This volume is fairly consistent as far north as Minden, at which point the vehicle count drops below 5,000 and tapers off as low as 2,000 at Highway60.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{first entered}} {{what would become}} Indiana {{near the end of}} the last ice age. The region around Harrison County was of {{particular}} value to the early humans because of the abundance of flint. There is evidence of flint mining in local caves as early as 2000BCE; the stone was used to produce crude tools. Passing migratory tribes frequented the area which was influenced by succeeding groups of peoples including the Hopewells and Mississippians. One flint-working <b>and</b> <b>camping</b> location is known as the Swan's Landing Archeological Site; it is among the most important Early Archaic archaeological sites anywhere in eastern North America. Permanent human settlements in the county began with the arrival of American settlers in the last decade of the 18thcentury.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Arthur's arrival, Nova Scotia Power prepared and collected resources {{in case of}} power outages and other impacts in the region. Numerous weekend events were called off throughout the Canadian Maritimes, including the Stan Rogers Folk Festival. Multiple boat-owners and fisherman took extra precautions by battening down hatches and tying extra lines to wharves to keep ships and boats from coming loose in the storm. Environment Canada officials issued high wind warnings in addition to earlier tropical storm warnings for the Maritimes and considered imposing rainfall warnings for western portions of Prince Edward Island as well. Province-managed parks in Nova Scotia, including beaches <b>and</b> <b>camping</b> grounds, were shut down prior to Arthur's arrival, and several airlines waived transfer fees. Officials in Moncton stated that city personnel {{would be prepared to}} respond to potential issues caused by Arthur, such as flooding or fallen trees, while the Canadian Red Cross readied volunteers in case of the need for emergency assistance. The Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station took precautionary measures against the storm, with Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission employees deployed to the site.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} {{road was}} constructed from Military Road to the fort's rear gates. Its path is largely {{followed by the}} modern Queen Elizabeth II walk, though the former road was slightly to the south. This walk links the conservation park's visitor centre to the fort gates; {{some of the old}} road can still be seen close to the gates. What was the muster ground is partly taken up by the caravan <b>and</b> <b>camping</b> park and a car park. It was levelled and filled in the 1950s for this use. What remains of this ground, north of the caravan park, was returned to its 1880s profile in 1993 funded by a Federal Government grant. In the 19th century, the muster ground was used for training of the Volunteer Military Force including artillery, who camped on the site. As designed the fort's rear was protected with a wooden palisade or stockade. In 1881 a masonry wall was added, greatly strengthening defence. Most of the stockade was reconstructed in the 1970s; some of the original wooden structure is visible in the fort's north.|$|E
