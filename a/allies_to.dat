5|$|Ladislaus Löb {{writes that}} {{proposals}} and counter-proposals flew between Istanbul, London and Washington. The Jewish Agency and Brand wanted the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> string the Germans {{along in the}} hope of slowing the deportations. The Agency gave Brand a document, dated 29 May 1944, that offered $400,000 for every 1,000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine, one million Swiss francs per 10,000 Jewish emigrants to neutral countries such as Spain, and 10,000 Swiss francs a month if the deportations were to stop. If the SS would allow the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> supply food, clothes and medicine to the Jews in concentration camps, the Nazis would be supplied with the same. Rose writes that the agreement was intended only to give Brand something to take back to Budapest.|$|E

5|$|Bahrain {{participated in}} the Second World War on the Allied side, joining on 10 September 1939. On 19 October 1940, four Italian SM.82s bombers bombed Bahrain {{alongside}} Dhahran oilfields in Saudi Arabia, targeting Allied-operated oil refineries. Although minimal damage was caused in both locations, the attack forced the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> upgrade Bahrain's defences, an action which further stretched Allied military resources.|$|E
5|$|Despite being outnumbered {{and poorly}} equipped, certain Bulgarian units offered fierce resistance, delaying the Entente advance in Zborsko. However, the {{collapse}} of the front line enabled the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> assault Bulgarian positions from multiple directions and eventually quell the last pockets of resistance. The Central Powers' defeat at the Dobro Pole {{played a role in the}} Bulgarian withdrawal from the war and opened the way for the subsequent capture of Vardar Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losses}} {{that had brought}} the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> the border of their homeland, German morale was {{surprisingly}} strong.

5|$|Samoset {{returned}} to Plymouth on March 22 with a delegation from Massasoit that included Squanto; Massasoit joined them shortly thereafter.

5|$|Starting with a plea {{from the}} Slovakian rabbi Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl in May 1944, {{there was a}} growing {{campaign}} by Jewish organizations to persuade the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> bomb Auschwitz or the railway lines leading to it.

5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} {{found themselves in}} a difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that to capitalize on the success at Ulm, he had to force the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> battle and defeat them.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempted}} expedition had {{a significant}} consequence. Wassmuss left Constantinople to organise the tribes in south Persia to act against British interests. While evading British capture in Persia, Wassmuss inadvertently abandoned his codebook. Its recovery by Britain allowed the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> decipher German communications, including the Zimmermann Telegram in 1917. Niedermayer led the group following Wassmuss's departure.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed {{by these}} Athenian successes, the Persians stopped backing the allies and began {{supporting}} Sparta. This defection forced the <b>allies</b> <b>to</b> seek peace. The King's Peace, {{also known as}} the Peace of Antalcidas, was signed in 387 BC, ending the war. This treaty declared that Persia would control all of Ionia, and that all other Greek cities would be independent. Sparta was to be the guardian of the peace, with the power to enforce its clauses. The effects of the war, therefore, were to establish Persia's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's hegemonic position in the Greek political system.|$|E

5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. did not move from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> switch to the strategic initiative, {{paving the way for}} the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal Campaign is also regarded by some as {{a turning point in the}} Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the second}} and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further {{conflict}} in the region due to a tapestry of shifting rivalries, alliances and leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Greek city-state of Sparta stepped into the partial power vacuum in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from <b>allies</b> <b>to</b> prosecute the Roman-Spartan War, defeating a Spartan army at the Battle of Gythium in 195 BC. They also fought their former allies the Aetolian League in the Aetolian War, against the Istrians in the Istrian War, against the Illyrians in the Illyrian War, and against Achaia in the Achaean War.|$|E
5|$|Bouvet {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career alternating between the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons. At the outbreak of World War I, she escorted troop convoys from North Africa to France. She then joined the naval operations off the Dardanelles, where she participated in a major attack on the Turkish fortresses in the straits on 18 March 1915. During the attack, she was hit approximately eight times by shellfire, though did not suffer fatal damage. She struck a mine at around 3:15, and sank within two minutes; only some 50 men were rescued from a complement of 710. Two British battleships were also sunk by mines that day, and the disaster convinced the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> abandon the naval campaign {{in favor of an}} amphibious assault on Gallipoli.|$|E

5|$|Braham {{writes that}} several appeals {{were made to}} Horthy, {{including}} by the Swiss government, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Gustaf V of Sweden and, on 25 June, Pope Pius XII, possibly after Martilotti passed on the report. On 26 June Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva sent a telegram to England calling on the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> hold members of the Hungarian government personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted by the Hungarian government and shown to Prime Minister Döme Sztójay, who passed it to Horthy. Horthy ordered {{an end to the}} deportations on 7 July and they stopped two days later.|$|E
5|$|British {{control of}} Gibraltar enabled the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> control the {{entrance}} to the Mediterranean during the Second World War. It was attacked on several occasions by German, Italian and Vichy French forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the Gibraltarians themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to self-determination. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Despite their travails, Rejewski and Zygalski had {{fared better}} than some of their colleagues. Cadix's Polish {{military}} chiefs, Langer and Ciężki, had also been captured by the Germans, {{as they tried to}} escape from France into Spain on the night of March 10–11, 1943 along with three other Poles: Antoni Palluth, Edward Fokczyński and Kazimierz Gaca. The first two became prisoners of war; the other three were sent as slave labourers to Germany, where Palluth and Fokczyński perished. Despite the varyingly dire circumstances in which they were held, none of them Stefan Mayer emphasizes betrayed the secret of Enigma's decryption, thus making it possible for the <b>Allies</b> <b>to</b> continue exploiting this vital intelligence resource.|$|E
