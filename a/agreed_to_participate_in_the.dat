5|$|After Young Frankenstein was written, {{the rights}} {{were to be}} sold to Columbia Pictures, but after having trouble agreeing on the budget, Wilder, Brooks, and {{producer}} Michael Gruskoff went with 20th Century Fox, where both Brooks and Wilder had to sign five-year contracts. Young Frankenstein was a commercial success, with Wilder and Brooks receiving Best Adapted Screenplay nominations at the 1975 Oscars, losing to Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adaptation of The Godfather Part II. While filming Young Frankenstein, Wilder had an idea for a romantic musical comedy about a brother of Sherlock Holmes. Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> project, and Wilder began writing what became his directorial début, 1975's The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother.|$|E

5|$|At {{the urging}} of Groves and Furman, the Alsos Mission was created on 4 April 1944 {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Boris Pash to conduct {{intelligence}} in the field relating to the German nuclear energy project. The more experienced British considered creating a rival mission, but in the end <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alsos Mission as a junior partner. In June 1945, Welsh reported that the German nuclear physicists captured by the Alsos Mission were in danger of being executed by the Americans, and Jones arranged for them to be moved to Farm Hall, a country house in Huntingdonshire used for training by MI6 and the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The house was bugged, and the conversations of the scientists were recorded.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Halloween, Yablans and Akkad began working on Halloween II. There was initial {{discussion}} about filming Halloween II in 3-D, but the idea never came to fruition. After Halloween II was released, Carpenter and Hill were approached about creating a third Halloween film, but they were reluctant to pledge commitment. The pair <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new project only {{if it was not}} a direct sequel to Halloween II, which meant no Michael Myers. Most of the filming for Halloween III took place on location in the small coastal town of Loleta in Humboldt County, California. Familiar Foods, a milk bottling plant in Loleta, served as the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory, but all special effects involving fire, smoke, and explosions were filmed at Post Studios.|$|E

The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund in the 1990s to respond to the ongoing need for healing related to residential schools. In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice and Reconciliation Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established a Healing & Reconciliation Program.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 1800, the Neapolitan government, reinstated in Naples after being expelled the year before, finally <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> siege and 1,200 troops were embarked on a squadron led by Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's flagship HMS Queen Charlotte and landed on Malta. For a time, both Keith and Nelson remained with the blockade squadron, which consisted of six ships of the line, {{along with a few}} Neapolitan Ships of The Line, and several British and Neapolitan frigates. On 17 February a message arrived with the squadron from the frigate HMS Success, which had been stationed off Sicily to watch for French reinforcements. Captain Shuldham Peard reported that he was shadowing a squadron of six or seven French ships sailing in the direction of Malta. These vessels were a relief squadron, sent from Toulon with extensive food supplies and 3,000 additional troops under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée in Généreux, one of the ships of the line that had escaped at the Nile two years earlier. On 18 February, the convoy was sighted by lookouts on Alexander. In the ensuing chase, Success captured a French transport and attacked the much larger Généreux. Although the frigate was damaged in the exchange, Success second broadside mortally wounded Perrée and delayed the ship of the line long enough for HMS Foudroyant, under Lord Nelson, and HMS Northumberland to join the battle. Heavily outnumbered, Généreux surrendered.|$|E

25|$|In June 2006, Nature {{launched}} {{an experiment in}} parallel open peer review: some articles that had been submitted to the regular anonymous process were also available online for open, identified public comment. The results were less than encouraging – only 5% of authors <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experiment, and only 54% of those articles received comments. The editors have suggested that researchers {{may have been too}} busy to take part and were reluctant to make their names public.

25|$|Therefore, in 1993, the {{government}} introduced {{a policy to}} actively promote multi-municipal companies through Decree-law 379/93. The main vehicle to advance the reform process was the public Holding Company Águas de Portugal created in the same year, {{which was to be}} the majority owner of the newly created multi-municipal companies alongside with the participating municipalities. The government provided preferential access to EU structural funds to those municipalities that <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new multi-municipal companies, which were gradually created beginning in 1995. There was a strong continuity of sector policies, despite a change in government from the Social Democratic Party to the Socialist Party of Primer Minister António Guterres after the elections of 1995.|$|E
25|$|During this time, North Korea's major {{allies were}} China, the USSR, and Cuba. While Fidel Castro and Cuba staunchly defended North Korea, both the USSR and China <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> games. This major {{decision}} strained relationships that were {{vital to the}} North Korean economic system. Throughout the history of North Korea, North Korea relied heavily on the foreign aid. The countries that gave the most aid were the USSR and China. For that reason, the strained relationships had a major effect on North Korea. This {{played a major role}} in the North Korean isolationist policies of the 1990s. In addition, as a result of the undeniable success of the Seoul Games, the growing gap between these two nations was further put on display.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Zecharias Frankel (1801–1875) was {{a leading}} figure in mid-19th Century German Jewry. Known both for his traditionalist views and the esteem he held for {{scientific}} study of Judaism, Frankel was at first considered a moderate figure associated with the nascent Reform movement. He severely criticized the 1844 first Reform rabbinic conference of Braunschweig, yet eventually <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next, in spite of warnings from conservative friends such as Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport. He withdrew from the assembly, held in Frankfurt am Main in 1845, making a final break with the Reform camp after coming to believe their positions were excessively radical. In 1854 he became {{the director of a}} new rabbinical school, the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau.|$|E
25|$|On 29 May, Myers was {{informed}} by Cairo that Sicily {{was to be}} invaded in {{the second week of}} July and ordered that Greek resistance organizations were to commence Operation Animals a sabotage campaign throughout Greece. The operation was to begin on 21 June and last until 14 July and Myers immediately contacted local SOE agents and the leadership of ELAS, which <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> operation. The strategically-important Gorgopotamos bridge which had been destroyed during Operation Harling had been repaired and was to be blown again. Myers proposed to destroy the bridge across the river Asopus but the ELAS commander Stefanos Sarafis, thought it too dangerous and proposed to demolish the Kournovo tunnel; Myers eventually gave in and supplied ELAS with explosives. On the night of 1 June, an ELAS engineer unit, accompanied by 250 fighters, blew up the tunnel while a train loaded with ammunition and Italian soldiers on leave was passing through. About 200–300 Italians and seven Germans were killed while 100 more suffered burn injuries and 60 Greek prisoners of war perished in the explosions that followed. The tunnel suffered no serious damage and the Germans repaired the railroad tracks a week later. The Italian army conducted the reprisal killing of 106 prisoners of war in the Larissa concentration camp. On 20 June, a group of six SOE officers evaded German guards to scale a steep slope near the Asopus bridge, place explosives at its northern end and set them off. Upon hearing about the demolition, Adolf Hitler expressed his dissatisfaction with the level of protection of the Greek railroad network, while also acknowledging that such subversive acts could not be wholly avoided. The damage caused to the bridge severed the railroad connection between northern and southern Greece until 28 August and paved the way for Operation Animals.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the comic}} book {{industry}} crash of 1996, Norm Breyfogle sought new employment at DC Comics. Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant at the company, suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in.

Following encouragement from Breyfogle, Grant <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> project. The four-issue limited series, Anarky, was published in May 1997. Entitled [...] "Metamorphosis", the story maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace.|$|E
