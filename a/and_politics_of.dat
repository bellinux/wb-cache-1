5|$|Although {{he never}} {{finished}} the other works intended to comprise Scenes from a Military Life, Balzac {{returned to the}} people <b>and</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> Les Chouans in later works. Corentin reappears in his 1841 novel Une Ténébreuse Affaire (A Murky Business), and Hulot is featured in 1843's La Muse du département (The Provincial Muse). Later novels mention additional royalist uprisings, connecting them thematically to Les Chouans.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} {{had major}} implications {{for a large}} segment of the population, economy, <b>and</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> the entire United States. It has prompted a Congressional review of the Army Corps of Engineers and the failure of portions of the federally built flood protection system which experts agree should have protected the city's inhabitants from Katrina's surge. Katrina has also stimulated significant research in the academic community into urban planning, real estate finance, and economic issues in the wake of a natural disaster.|$|E

5|$|Between 1929 and 1935, {{under the}} strain of World Depression, {{political}} thinking worldwide received a jolt from the spread of international communism. Indian political parties, movements and considerable sections of leadership were also affected by inter-continental ideologies. The Self-Respect Movement also came {{under the influence of}} the leftist philosophies and institutions. E.V. Ramasamy, after establishing the Self-Respect Movement as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and socially. To accomplish this, he studied the history <b>and</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> different countries, and personally observed these systems at work.|$|E
5|$|Born in Caen, Normandy to {{an aristocratic}} family, Michel-Guillaume Hector St. John de Crèvecœur {{received}} a Jesuit {{education at the}} Jesuit Collège Royal de Bourbon. In 1754, having left school, Crèvecœur visited relatives in England where he became engaged; this visit would {{mark the beginning of}} a lifelong admiration for the culture <b>and</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> the country. Shortly after this, possibly due to the death of his fiancée, he joined a French regiment in Canada engaged in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). After being wounded in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), Crèvecœur resigned his commission and began traveling widely across Pennsylvania and New York.|$|E
5|$|Medieval: Total War {{is based}} upon the {{building}} of an empire across medieval Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It focuses on the warfare, religion <b>and</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> the time to ultimately lead the player in conquest of the known world. As with the preceding Total War game, Shogun: Total War, the game consists of two broad areas of gameplay: a turn-based campaign map that allows the user to move armies across provinces, control agents, diplomacy, religion, and other tasks needed to run their faction, and a real-time battlefield, where the player directs the land battles and sieges that occur.|$|E
