60|$|I say, it's a bit thick after <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> We're all so done up that we shan't {{be able to}} go a mile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yon cloud {{with that}} long purple cleft [...] Brings fresh {{into my mind}} [...] <b>A</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> which I have left [...] Full thirty years behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, we want {{something}} to pull us together on <b>a</b> dull <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Suppose we send out {{for a bottle of}} sparkling, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He did! But don't let's talk of it any more. It {{makes me}} angry {{to think of}} him, and there's no use spoiling <b>a</b> lovely <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> by getting angry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} great fun," [...] pursued Olaf. [...] "The shade would be so {{pleasant}} in <b>a</b> hot <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and we would not go far. What does it think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he began, [...] "but I {{ought to}} apologise {{for coming on}} <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> when you were not expecting to be interrupted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I judge I did. It was {{the talk}} of these realms--not for <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> barkeeper business, but for twenty years before the man died." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Church," [...] I said. [...] "You're {{surely not}} going to church <b>a</b> fine <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> I made sure you'd be playing tennis, or going on the river. You always used to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a delicious}} soft wind!" [...] he exclaimed, {{removing}} his unsightly hat. [...] "Really, I {{think that when}} we get <b>a</b> sunny <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> April is almost our most beautiful month." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Him! Why, he {{come running}} past, quick {{as he could}} go. I {{wondered}} what he was running for, <b>a</b> hot <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> He went round the corner {{at the bottom of}} the block." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{were the}} money," [...] he said boldly. [...] "I kin do one <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> at thirty dollers apiece, an' never feel the wear an' tear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I was principally {{going to}} smoke a cigar. I {{have been in}} all the morning, and on <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one gets restless after a time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{really looks}} very {{enticing}} on <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Don't {{you think it}} is a little hard on the Hoddam people to shut them out of it?" [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{only mean}} you were staring rather hard at nothing. It's a pity {{to try and}} stare out of <b>a</b> {{beautiful}} blue <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> don't you think?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] said Teddy, {{in a tone}} of satisfaction. [...] "That is what I call humpin' ourselves! It won't take <b>a</b> {{great many}} <b>days</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before we'll be on our feet in fine shape." ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Will they? If {{you think}} I {{am going to}} sit here on <b>a</b> fine <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> with my legs crossed waiting for great thoughts, you exaggerate my taste for them. I prefer marine golf. [Stopping short] Oh, by the way, I forgot something. I have a word or two to say to the Minister of health. [He goes back to his chair].|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "I'd rather {{know your}} heart. But I'll wait." [...] After a pause: [...] "Why do you carry a fan on <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> I ask, to make general conversation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Exactly!' {{replied the}} other, {{with a laugh}} of intelligence. 'I call <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> [...] "the blue room". It's the least draughty {{apartment}} in all the confoundedly draughty House of Life.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel like}} a gomeral," [...] says he, [...] "to be leaving Scotland on <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> It sticks in my head; I would maybe like it better {{to stay here and}} hing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a case of}} swimmin'; but I {{think we}} had better keep on our {{trousers}} and shirts, otherwise the flies and mosquitoes will make matters too lively for us," [...] Bob said, as he removed {{a portion of his}} clothing, and then waded into the water to launch the raft. [...] "On <b>a</b> hot <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> we shall soon dry off an' be none the worse for the bath." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, that's {{very much}} as I thought," [...] said Newson, looking {{into the face of}} each by turns. [...] "I said to myself, ay, a hundred times, when I tried to get a peep at her unknown to herself--'Depend upon it, 'tis best that I should live on quiet for <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> till {{something}} turns up for the better.' I now know you are all right, and what can I wish for more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He took them, and {{glancing at}} one of them threw {{it out on the}} ground. [...] "This is from Ricker," [...] he said, opening the other. [...] "If you'll excuse me," [...] and he began to read it. [...] "Well, that is all right," [...] he said, when he had run it through. [...] "He can manage without me a little while longer; but <b>a</b> few more <b>days</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> will put <b>an</b> end to my loafing. I begin to feel like work, {{for the first time since}} I came up here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop it, Pris. 'The best {{is yet to}} be.' Like the old Roman, we'll find a {{house or}} build one. On <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> there's no such word as fail in my bright lexicon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had to go}} out {{to bring}} a mad woman home," [...] he said. [...] "Kate Caynsard was out in her catboat <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> It was suicide if I hadn't reached her in time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't mean it, Saxon," [...] she whimpered. [...] "Honest, I didn't. I wouldn't {{never go}} that way. But I {{leave it to}} you, if <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> don't get on anybody's nerves. Listen to that!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The song is a {{collaborative}} effort between Björk and LFO's Mark Bell, who was credited {{for the majority of}} the album's co-production. Björk desired to have Mark Bell contribute to her albums Debut and Post, only finding him available for Homogenic. Björk wrote the song in a Nord Lead synthesizer. The final version was a result of Björk and Bell's improvised jam sessions in Málaga, Spain, where the album was recorded. Björk recalls: [...] "That was me and Mark having a laugh in Spain. It was <b>a</b> hot <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> We got <b>a</b> little amp outside and a keyboard and I just did all these really punk things, just really thinking heavy metal. Most of the tracks I wrote before Mark started on them, so they're more like song-songs, and then Mark would work on beats and arrangements with me afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear of {{the wife}} and child," [...] replied Stanley, patting his better half on the shoulder. [...] "If Indians should find out the camp, Oostesimow can palaver with them; and should Esquimaux pay you a visit, Moses will do the polite. Besides, had you not interrupted, I {{was going to have}} given special {{instructions}} to Frank regarding you. So, Master Frank, be pleased to take Eda off your shoulder, and give ear to my instructions. While you are examining {{the other side of the}} water, you will keep as much as possible within eye-shot, and always within ear-shot, of the camp. In <b>a</b> still <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> gun-shot can be heard five or six miles off; and should you see any sign of the natives having been here recently, return instantly to the camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's down below, young sir; I {{will show}} it you presently. We steer by that at night, or when it's foggy; but on <b>a</b> fine <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> {{there is no}} need for it. There are marks put up on all the sands, and we steer by them. You see, the way the wind is now we can lay our course for the Whittaker. That's a cruel sand, that is, and {{stretches}} out a long way from a point lying away on the right there. Once past that we bear away to the southwest, for we are then, so to speak, fairly in the course of the river. There is many a ship has been cast away on the Whittaker. Not that it is worse than other sands. There are scores of them lying in the mouth of the river, and if it wasn't for the marks there would be no sailing in or out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's good to feel {{alive on}} <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> but I suspect it was {{doubtful}} {{for a time}} whether I'd have that satisfaction," [...] Walthew remarked languidly. [...] "Guess I owe you both a good deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' {{said the}} driver, 'and what then? I would rather give a man a shillin' on <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> than put {{him off with}} a derision like a bawbee. I'm {{surprised}} at the like of you, Mr. Baigrey!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Jan. 15.--The nerves are {{a little}} unruly on <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> [...] between (official) life and death; so much of feeling mixes with [...] the more {{abstract}} question, which would be easily disposed of if it [...] stood alone. (Diary.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Our way lies {{over the}} Campagna, which looks more solemn on <b>a</b> bright blue <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> than beneath <b>a</b> darker sky; the great extent of ruin being plainer to the eye: and the {{sunshine}} through the arches {{of the broken}} aqueducts, showing other broken arches shining through them in the melancholy distance. When we have traversed it, and look back from Albano, its dark, undulating surface lies below us like a stagnant lake, or like a broad, dull Lethe flowing round the walls of Rome, and separating it from all the world! How often have the Legions, in triumphant march, gone glittering across that purple waste, so silent and unpeopled now! How often has the train of captives looked, with sinking hearts, upon the distant city, and beheld its population pouring out, to hail the return of their conqueror! What riot, sensuality and murder, have run mad in the vast palaces now heaps of brick and shattered marble! What glare of fires, and roar of popular tumult, and wail of pestilence and famine, have come sweeping over the wild plain where nothing is now heard but the wind, and where the solitary lizards gambol unmolested in the sun! ...|$|R
50|$|Jimmie Johnson won {{the pole}} {{with a time}} of 27.705 and a speed of 194.911 mph. “We’ve watched other cars get faster through {{qualifying}} sessions,’’ Johnson said. “That’s something the (Hendrick Motorsports) cars really haven’t had a lot. We did that tonight. We’re hitting on some things that should help us run faster longer.’’ Matt Kenseth and Kevin Harvick didn't get a lap in before time expired in the final round and started eleventh and twelfth as a result. “We had a big miscommunication tonight and didn’t get @KevinHarvick off of pit road in time to run a lap in the final qualifying session,’’ Childers tweeted. “Apologies to all of the sponsors and fans. We will make sure it doesn’t happen again.’’ While three of the Hendrick cars made it to the final round of qualifying, Jeff Gordon didn't make it out of the first round. “It just disappoints us,’’ Gordon said of his qualifying performance. “We know our car is much better than this. These are about as challenging conditions as you can have when you have <b>a</b> really hot <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> and the sun goes down and it’s a total guessing game. We guessed wrong. We just missed the setup. The car has plenty of speed in it, so I’m not concerned about the race.’’ The two drivers who failed to qualify were Dave Blaney and J. J. Yeley.|$|R
60|$|Leaving the Castle of St. Angelo, we drove, {{still on}} the same side of the Tiber, to the Villa Pamfili, which lies a short {{distance}} beyond the walls. As we passed through one of the gates (I think it was that of San Pancrazio) the abbe pointed out the spot where the Constable de Bourbon was killed while attempting to scale the walls. If we are to believe Benvenuto Cellini, it was he who shot the constable. The road to the villa is not very interesting, lying (as the roads in the vicinity of Rome often do) between very high walls, admitting not a glimpse of the surrounding country; the road itself white and dusty, with no verdant margin of grass or border of shrubbery. At the portal of the villa we found many carriages in waiting, for the Prince Doria throws open the grounds to all comers, and on <b>a</b> pleasant <b>day</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> they are probably sure to be thronged. We left our carriage just within the entrance, and rambled among these beautiful groves, admiring the live-oak trees, and the stone-pines, which latter are truly a majestic tree, with tall columnar stems, supporting a cloud-like density of boughs far aloft, and not a straggling branch between there and the ground. They stand in straight rows, but are now so ancient and venerable as to have lost the formal look of a plantation, and seem like a wood that might have arranged itself almost of its own will. Beneath them is a flower-strewn turf, quite free of underbrush. We found open fields and lawns, moreover, all abloom with anemones, white and rose-colored and purple and golden, and far larger than could be found out of Italy, except in hot-houses. Violets, too, were abundant and exceedingly fragrant. When we consider that all this floral exuberance occurs in the midst of March, there does not appear much ground for complaining of the Roman climate; and so long ago as the first week of February I found daisies among the grass, on the sunny side of the Basilica of St. John Lateran. At this very moment I suppose the country within twenty miles of Boston may be two feet deep with snow, and the streams solid with ice.|$|R
