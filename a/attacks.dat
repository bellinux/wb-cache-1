Network security situation of distributed <b>attack</b> can be determined by <b>attack</b> severity degree of hosts and congestion condition of network. The paper analyzes distributed <b>attack</b> spread and builds an <b>attack</b> graph. The <b>attack</b> graph is used to reflect <b>attacked</b> status of hosts and congestion degree of network.

Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up vulnerable machines. For example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server intentionally set up for that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot server, an intentionally vulnerable server designed to attract <b>attacks</b> in order to study them, had received numerous <b>attacks</b> originating from China. Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure server, these <b>attacks</b> were probably sweeping <b>attacks</b> affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Attacks</b> may {{be brought}} on by {{physical}} exertion, drinking alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt. This may explain why <b>attacks</b> are more common in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise.

5|$|Beat 'em ups often {{allow the}} player {{to choose between}} a {{selection}} of protagonists—each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and set of moves. <b>Attacks</b> can include rapid combinations of basic <b>attacks</b> (combos) as well as jumping and grappling <b>attacks.</b> Characters often have their own special <b>attacks,</b> which leads to different strategies depending on which character the player selects. The control system is usually simple to learn, comprising as little as two buttons. These buttons can be combined to pull off combos, as well as jumping and grappling <b>attacks.</b> Since the release of Double Dragon, many beat 'em ups have allowed two players {{to play the game}} cooperatively—a central aspect to the appeal of these games. Beat 'em ups are more likely to feature cooperative play than other game genres.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In 2008, Beck and Tews have {{proposed}} a practical <b>attack</b> on WPA. Their <b>attack</b> (called the Beck-Tews <b>attack)</b> can recover plaintext from an encrypted short packet, and can falsify it. The execution time of the Beck-Tews <b>attack</b> is about 12 - 15 minutes. However, the <b>attack</b> has the limitation, namely, the targets are only WPA implementations those support IEEE 802. 11 e QoS features. In this paper, we propose a practical message falsification <b>attack</b> on any WPA implementation. In order to ease targets of limitation of wireless LAN products, we apply the Beck-Tews <b>attack</b> to the man-in-the-middle <b>attack.</b> In the man-inthe-middle <b>attack,</b> the user’s communication is intercepted by an attacker until the <b>attack</b> ends. It means that the users may detect our <b>attack</b> when the execution time of the <b>attack</b> is large. Therefore, we give methods for reducing the execution time of the <b>attack.</b> As a result, the execution time of our <b>attack</b> becomes about one minute in the best case...|$|R
40|$|In the {{multimedia}} applications over the mobile ad hoc networks, the goodput and delay performance of UDP packets is {{very sensitive to}} the congestion targeted DDoS <b>attacking.</b> In this paper, we analyze this type of <b>attacking</b> in details {{for the first time}} to our knowledge. We figure out the principles of the <b>attacking</b> from the analysis of network capacity and classify the <b>attacking</b> into four categories: Pulsing <b>attacking,</b> Round Robin <b>attacking,</b> Self-whisper <b>attacking</b> and Flooding <b>attacking.</b> The defense schemes are also proposed, which includes the detection of RTS/CTS packets, signal interference frequency and retransmission time and response stage with ECN marking mechanism. Through the ns 2 simulation, the basic <b>attacking</b> scenario is discussed and the results show that the <b>attacking</b> leads to the great jitter of the goodput and delay in pulsing <b>attacking</b> mode. The delay increasing (up to 110 times in five <b>attacking</b> flows) and goodput decreasing (to 77. 42 % in 5 <b>attacking</b> flows) is obvious with the addition of <b>attacking</b> flows. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R

5|$|Combat in {{the game}} is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of {{missions}} beginning after an opening tutorial. The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial combat. In ground combat, the player controls multiple characters, switching between them via the pause menu {{in order to use}} their different weapons. The characters use physical <b>attacks</b> using character weapons for short-range battle, while magical <b>attacks</b> are used for long-range <b>attacks</b> and groups of enemies. The magical <b>attacks</b> vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap.|$|E

Players are able to use new abilities by visiting an in-game tattoo parlor. Tattoos, and the special abilities that they unlock, are character-specific. Players can also unlock new abilities, including additional combination <b>attacks,</b> group <b>attacks,</b> {{and the ability to}} use two weapons at once, by leveling up.|$|E

40|$|The APT <b>attack</b> on the Internet is {{becoming}} more serious, and most of intrusion detection systems can only generate alarms to some steps of APT <b>attack</b> and cannot identify {{the pattern of the}} APT <b>attack.</b> To detect APT <b>attack,</b> many researchers established <b>attack</b> models and then correlated IDS logs with the <b>attack</b> models. However, the accuracy of detection deeply relied on the integrity of models. In this paper, we propose a new method to construct APT <b>attack</b> scenarios by mining IDS security logs. These APT <b>attack</b> scenarios can be further used for the APT detection. First, we classify all the <b>attack</b> events by purpose of phase of the intrusion kill chain. Then we add the <b>attack</b> event dimension to fuzzy clustering, correlate IDS alarm logs with fuzzy clustering, and generate the <b>attack</b> sequence set. Next, we delete the bug <b>attack</b> sequences to clean the set. Finally, we use the nonaftereffect property of probability transfer matrix to construct <b>attack</b> scenarios by mining the <b>attack</b> sequence set. Experiments show that the proposed method can construct the APT <b>attack</b> scenarios by mining IDS alarm logs, and the constructed scenarios match the actual situation {{so that they can be}} used for APT <b>attack</b> detection...|$|R

5|$|In battle, {{players can}} perform {{multiple}} actions: walking or running along a fixed axis, freely {{running around the}} battlefield, jumping in any direction, guarding against <b>attacks,</b> and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack. Characters can launch various <b>attacks,</b> from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy <b>attacks.</b> The player character's <b>attacks</b> can be chained together to create combo <b>attacks,</b> which create a continual flow of <b>attacks</b> without giving the enemy a chance to attack. Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike, which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses. Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses {{at the end of}} the battle. During battle, landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an Over Limit meter. Once the meter is full, the player character can perform continual <b>attacks</b> and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit's duration. During battles, Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions. Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item. All characters can use Artes, special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard <b>attacks</b> to healing magic. Learned by leveling up a character, Artes can be both specifically directed and have a general area of effect. Four Artes can be assigned to each character, and each Arte can be assigned to a hot key. Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters. In addition to standard Artes, each character can access Mystic Arts, extra-powerful cinematic <b>attacks.</b>|$|E
40|$|Interpolation <b>attack</b> was {{presented}} by Jakobsen and Knudsen at FSE' 97. Interpolation <b>attack</b> is effective against ciphers {{that have a}} certain algebraic structure like the PURE cipher which is a prototype cipher, {{but it is difficult}} to apply the <b>attack</b> to real-world ciphers. This difficulty is due to the difficulty of deriving a low degree polynomial relation between ciphertexts and plaintexts.
