500|$|The {{original}} {{buildings at}} Watford Gap {{were designed by}} Harry W Weedon and Partners, already well known for their work for Odeon Cinemas. The restaurant opened in September 1960, but the Ministry were unhappy about the services' reputation as a truck-stop, dating back to Blue Boar's popularity with HGV drivers. They consequently redesigned the restaurant in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service, which they hoped would [...] "lose {{at least some of}} the stigma of having been started in 1959 as primarily a commercial driver's facility". Food was criticised for being expensive, though Tam Galbraith disputed this, noting he could buy steak and kidney pie with chips, buttered roll <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea at Watford Gap for 4s 2d (£ today).|$|E
500|$|Advertising for the company's product often {{emphasized}} its supposed convenience, modernity, and purity. It was {{claimed to}} be better for digestion, and even that the [...] "pure" [...] coffee {{did not have the}} wakefulness effect of coffee from ground beans (a direct effect of caffeine content, present in both forms). After World War I ended, the American military's use of the coffee became another selling point. A different avenue for promotion came when the company sponsored The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes radio series on NBC and its Blue Network from 1930 to 1935, which started with Dr. Watson welcoming listeners to his recollections told by [...] "a blazing fire <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> G Washington brewing." [...] Other radio sponsorships were for O'Henry Stories (1932, NBC Blue), Professor Quiz (1936, CBS), Uncle Jim's Question Bee (1936–39, NBC Blue), and Surprise Party (1946–47, CBS).|$|E
500|$|Captured, Pechersky soon {{contracted}} typhus, but {{survived the}} seven-month-long illness. In May 1942, he escaped along {{with four other}} prisoners of war, {{but they were all}} recaptured the same day. He was then sent to a penal camp at Borisov, Belarus, and from there to a prisoners of war (POW) camp located in the forest next to the city of Minsk. During a mandatory medical examination it was discovered that he was circumcised. Pechersky recalled a German medical officer asking him: [...] "Do you admit to being a Jew?" [...] He admitted it, since any denial would result in a whipping, and was thrown into a cellar called [...] "the Jewish grave" [...] along with other Jewish POWs (prisoners of war), where for 10 days he sat in complete darkness, being fed 100grams (3.5oz) of wheat <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> water every second day.|$|E

500|$|Director John Ford {{said that}} when he was a prop boy {{in the early days of}} silent pictures, Earp would visit pals on the sets he knew from his Tombstone days. [...] "I used to give him a chair <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee, and he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more. Among the best-known actors who have portrayed him are Randolph Scott, Guy Madison, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, Hugh O'Brian, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner.|$|E
500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be in the back seat of a hot car, sweating and fighting." ...|$|E

2500|$|St. Justin Martyr (died c. 167) {{spent part}} of his life at Rome and died there. It is {{possible}} that his First Apology was written in that city, and that the liturgy he describes in it (lxv-lxvi) was that which he frequented at Rome. From this we learn that the Christians first prayed for themselves and for all manner of persons. Then follows the kiss of peace, and [...] "he who presides over the brethren" [...] is given bread <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> wine and water, having received which he gives thanks to God, celebrates the Eucharist, and all the people answer [...] "Amen." [...] The deacons then give out Holy Communion (loc. cit.).|$|E

2500|$|The epithet Dapalis is on {{the other}} hand {{connected}} to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus. Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> wine to Jupiter : it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however Cato' s prayer of s one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as summus. The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does not say it. This interpretation finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of the epulum Iovis, from which the god derives the epithet of [...] Epulo [...] and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.|$|E
