40|$|Rebekah N Das, Karen A Grimmer-SomersSchool of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, City East Campus, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, AustraliaObjectives: Health {{professionals}} commonly advise {{patients with}} incontinence and other lower urinary tract symptoms about modifiable contributing {{factors such as}} drinking <b>and</b> <b>voiding</b> habits. Poor drinking <b>and</b> <b>voiding</b> habits may begin early in life, before symptoms emerge. However, {{little is known about}} the habits and knowledge young people have regarding healthy drinking <b>and</b> <b>voiding</b> behaviors. This research aimed to assess the habits and health knowledge of young people regarding fluid intake <b>and</b> <b>voiding.</b> Methods: A questionnaire was used to assess the drinking <b>and</b> <b>voiding</b> behaviors of first year university students and their knowledge about healthy fluid intake <b>and</b> <b>voiding.</b> Results: The average daily fluid intake was &gt; 2 L/day for both genders. Poor drinking <b>and</b> <b>voiding</b> habits (such as high consumption of caffeinated drinks and alcohol, or nocturia) were common. Widely reported myths about the benefits of a high fluid intake were commonly believed. Conclusion: More informed public education regarding healthy fluid intake, <b>and</b> drinking <b>and</b> <b>voiding</b> habits, is required as part of the effort to reduce the development of lower urinary tract symptoms, including incontinence.

It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.|$|E

5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E
5|$|Epstein accused Seltaeb of not {{accounting}} properly, and cancelled {{its power}} to grant licences, which started a counter-lawsuit by Byrne against Epstein's New York accountant, Walter Hofer, asking for $5,168,000 in damages. Epstein then instructed NEMS employees to deal directly with American companies, so Byrne instigated court proceedings, which took three years to settle, as it entailed 39 individual claims against NEMS. Byrne won the case, and Epstein paid the court costs and legal bills himself, although the judgement was later vacated; meaning to cancel it, or render it null <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Due to the legal battle, Woolworth's, J. C. Penney, and other companies refused to finalise any merchandising agreements, cancelling orders worth $78 million. The court case and its effect was estimated to have lost NEMS and The Beatles approximately $100,000,000.|$|E

5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties of attacks used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his weapon to extend from then retract into his hands, resulting in different visual cues than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some moves are unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder Topaz, an attack stance that allows {{the use of an}} altered set of attacks for a short time, <b>and</b> <b>Void</b> Cannon, which creates a small explosion on the ground at varying distances from Necrid.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Dover, Henry and Anne married in a secret ceremony on November 14, 1532. She soon became pregnant and, to legalise the first wedding considered to be unlawful at the time, {{there was a second}} wedding service, also private in accordance with The Royal Book, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. Events now began to move at a quick pace. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer (who had been hastened, with the Pope's assent, into the position of Archbishop of Canterbury recently vacated by the death of Warham) sat in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the King's marriage to Catherine of Aragon. He thereupon declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid.|$|E
5|$|The Punch-up in Piestany was {{a notable}} {{instance}} of fighting in international play.

5|$|The peasants laid siege on Bern and Lucerne, whereupon {{the cities}} {{negotiated}} {{a peace agreement}} with the peasant leader Niklaus Leuenberger, the so-called peace on the Murifeld. The peasant armies retreated. The Tagsatzung, the federal council of the Old Swiss Confederacy, then sent an army from Zürich to definitely end the rebellion, and after the Battle of Wohlenschwil, the Huttwil League was forcibly annulled in the peace of Mellingen. The last resistance in the Entlebuch valley was broken {{by the end of}} June. After their victory, the city authorities took drastic punitive measures. The Huttwil League and the peace of the Murifeld were declared null <b>and</b> <b>void</b> by the city council of Bern.

During his marriage to De Macias, Jagger had an affair with then-Playboy model Bebe Buell from 1974 to 1976. In late 1977, Jagger began dating American model Jerry Hall; they moved in together and had a total of four children. They attended an unofficial private marriage ceremony in Bali, Indonesia, on 21 November 1990, and lived at Downe House in Richmond, London.

40|$|P>Aim To {{compare the}} {{percentage}} of gutta-percha, sealer <b>and</b> <b>voids</b> <b>and</b> the influence of isthmuses in mesial root canals of mandibular molars filled with different techniques. Methodology Canals in 60 mesial roots of mandibular first molars were prepared with ProTaper instruments to size F 2 (size 25, 0. 08 taper) and filled using a single-cone, lateral compaction, System B or Thermafil techniques. An epoxy resin sealer was labelled with Rhodamine-B dye to allow analysis under a confocal microscope. The percentage of gutta-percha, sealer <b>and</b> area of <b>voids</b> was calculated at 2, 4 and 6 mm from the apex, using Image Tool 3. 0 software. Statistical analysis was performed using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (P < 0. 05). The influence of isthmuses on {{the presence or absence}} of voids was evaluated using the Fisher test. Results At the 2 mm level, {{the percentage of}} gutta-percha, sealer <b>and</b> <b>voids</b> was similar amongst the System B, lateral compaction and single-cone techniques. The single-cone technique revealed significantly less gutta-percha, more sealer <b>and</b> <b>voids</b> in comparison with the Thermafil technique at the 2 and 4 mm level (P < 0. 05). The analysis of all sections (2, 4 and 6 mm) revealed that more gutta-percha and less sealer <b>and</b> <b>voids</b> were found in root canals filled with Thermafil and System B techniques (P < 0. 05). The Fisher test revealed that the presence of isthmuses increased the occurence of voids in the lateral compaction group only (P < 0. 05). Conclusion Gutta-percha, sealer filled area <b>and</b> <b>voids</b> were dependent on the canal-filling technique. The presence of isthmuses may influence the quality of root filling.
