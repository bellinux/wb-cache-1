Banana chips were the first products ready for export at the beginning of the summer, with fresh banana production following shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The Spartan {{council of}} Elders, the gerousia, {{suggested}} that the Spartan women be sent to Crete for their protection. They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia, the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who convinced them that the women could assist in the city's defence. In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest, the women and the elderly began bolstering defences. Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him, the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance. Moreover, messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request <b>aid</b> <b>from</b> Antigonus, despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile. Pausanias, the Greek geographer, claims that Sparta received some <b>aid</b> <b>from</b> Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at Argos.|$|E

5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this campaign is very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this.

5|$|According to Stanley Karnow, the Pulitzer Prize-winning {{author of}} Vietnam: A History, the coup was ineffectively executed; {{although}} the rebels captured {{the headquarters of}} the Joint General Staff at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, they failed to follow the textbook tactics of blocking the roads leading into Saigon.

5|$|After {{the passage}} of the cyclone, the Iran chapter of the Red Cross and its volunteers worked in {{conjunction}} with the military to distribute relief supplies to villages using trucks and helicopters.

In total, 61,558families received <b>aid</b> <b>from</b> the Red Cross in Iran. The Iranian government provided monetary relief to the affected people. Officials worked to restore roads, bridges, and power systems in the affected areas, although repairs were more difficult in some locations; by a week after the storm, several villages remained surrounded by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, the Government of Queensland {{declared}} the Cairns {{area as a}} natural disaster area.

5|$|Although the Colorados had {{defected}} to the Flores insurgency, {{the national guard}} continued to support the fusionist government. Blanco partisans filled its depleted ranks. They also replaced army officers who had deserted to Flores. The Blancos received <b>aid</b> <b>from</b> several Argentine Federalists who joined their cause. As in Uruguay, Argentina had long been a battleground of rival parties, and Bartolomé Mitre's victory at Pavón in 1861 had signaled the triumph of his Unitarian Party over the Federal Party led by Justo José de Urquiza. Mitre denied any involvement in the Flores rebellion, even though his complicity was widely known and taken for granted.|$|E

40|$|The {{functional}} status of 114 hearing <b>aids</b> <b>from</b> 8 {{nursing homes and}} retirement centers located in mid-Michigan was evaluated via visual/listening inspections and electroacoustic analysis. Overall, 45 % of the hearing <b>aids</b> <b>from</b> both facili-ties failed 1 or more components. The hearing <b>aids</b> <b>from</b> the nursing homes had a much higher problem rate than those from the retirement centers. The results reinforce the continuing need for on-going hearing aid monitoring programs in extended care facilities to promote successful hearing aid use among elderly res-idents. Evidence has existed for over two decades documenting {{the high incidence of}} hearing loss among elderly persons residing in extended care facilities (Garahan, Waller, Houghton, Tisdale, & Runge, 1992; Hull, 1995; Schow & Nerbonne, 1980). Although the incidence of hearing loss is great and the potential need for audiologic rehabilitation in this focused population is high, a number of major is-sues have made the implementation of large-scale programs of audiologic reha-bilitation for these individuals challenging at best. The typical approach followed by the limited number of audiologists (1. 1 % of those certified) working in a nurs-ing home setting (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 1997) in-volves carefully selecting those individuals for whom audiologic rehabilitation may be feasible, based not only on audiometric status, but also on their physical...|$|R

On September11, the Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister announced that residents severely affected by the typhoon were eligible for up to ₩50million (US$44,000) in construction assistance.
