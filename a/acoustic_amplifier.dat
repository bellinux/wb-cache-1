2500|$|The megaphone, {{a simple}} cone made of paper or other {{flexible}} material, {{is the oldest}} and simplest acoustic horn, used prior to loudspeakers as a passive <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplifier</b> for mechanical phonographs and for the human voice; it is still used by cheerleaders and lifeguards. Because the conic section shape describes {{a portion of a}} perfect sphere of radiated sound, cones have no phase or amplitude distortion of the wavefront. [...] The small megaphones used in phonographs and as loudhailers were not long enough to reproduce the low frequencies in music; they had a high cutoff frequency which attenuated the bottom two octaves of the sound spectrum, giving the megaphone a characteristic tinny sound.|$|E

Thermoacoustically driven {{pulse tube}} cryocoolers are gaining {{significant}} {{interest in the}} recent time due to the key advantage of complete absence of moving components for the entire system.

The work further reports the effect of operating and geometrical parameters on the performance of the standing wave-type thermoacoustic prime mover. The system performance, mainly in terms of acoustic power and pressure ratio, is influenced significantly by the operating and geometrical parameters.

40|$|A remote-sensing {{acoustic}} {{method for}} implementing position control feedback in Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is presented. The capabilities of this feedback control {{using the new}} Whispering Gallery Acoustic Sensing (WGAS) method is demonstrated in a Shear-force Scanning Probe Microscope that uses a sharp probe attached to a piezoelectric Quartz Tuning Fork (QTF) firmly mounted on the microscope 2 ̆ 7 s frame. As the QTF is electrically driven its mechanical response reaches the SPM frame which then acts as a resonant cavity producing acoustic modes measured with an acoustic sensor strategically placed on the SPM head. The novelty of the WGAS resides in using an SPM frame with a perimeter closely matching the intervening acoustic wavelength {{to act as a}} resonant cavity. The whispering gallery cavity constitutes an <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplifier</b> for the mechanical motion of the QTF probe. The observed monotonic behavior of the whispering gallery acoustic signal {{as a function of the}} probe sample distance is exploited here for tip-sample distance control with nanometer sensitivity, thus allowing topographic characterization as the probe is scanned across the sample 2 ̆ 7 s surface. This thesis includes a description of a Labview based programming for the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) card used in the automated control of the WGAS feedback microscope, a solution for improving the effective resolution of the Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) and initial results towards theoretically modeling the WGAS working principle...|$|E
40|$|Whistling due to vortex {{shedding}} {{has been extensively}} studied {{in the case of}} cylinders in cross-flows, of flow separation above cavities and of shear layers with flow impingement feedback. Less attention has been given to pressure drop devices in piping systems, which are known to generate high noise levels due to single tones in gas systems, and even in water systems. Based on recent work of Auregan et Starobinski (1999), an experimental criterion is proposed to evaluate the whistling ability of a pressure drop device in the presence of plane waves acoustic feedback. The idea of the criterion can be summarized as follows: if for a given combination of incident pressure waves, the amount of acoustic power scattered is higher than the incident one, the pressure drop device behaves as an <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplifier,</b> so that whistling can occur if the adequate acoustic boundary conditions are met. The main advantage of this criterion is that it depends only on the acoustic scattering matrix of the device, rather than on the acoustics of the surrounding pipe. Results obtained in an air test rig with an inner diameter of 3 cm, a Mach number varying from 10 - 3 to 10 - 1 and a Reynolds number varying from 103 to 105 are reported for single hole orifices. Basing the Strouhal number on the thickness of the orifice and on the average velocity through the hole, thin single hole orifices with sharp angles appear to whistle at Strouhal numbers close to 0. 2. Furthermore, it is shown that a thin orifice with a downstream bevel is prone to whistling, whereas the same orifice with the bevel upstream cannot whistle...|$|E
40|$|By {{following}} {{the trend of}} research on the use of thermoacoustic devices for power generation on board space vehicles, the present paper addresses an accurate thermal modelization of the whole system; a system that is composed of a thermoacoustic engine itself and a paraboloid mirror which collects solar energy. The purpose of the study is to show a detailed temperature estimation in some critical components of the engine in order to simulate performances in a realistic manner. Tipically, the utmost important part of a steady state wave device is the <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplifier,</b> also called “stack”, across which a suitable temperature gradient must be established to trigger and sustain the acoustic wave. The heat exchangers at the opposite ends of the stack must then have a certain temperature. The hot exchanger is located at the focus of the paraboloid where the concentrated solar energy impinges on the external surface of the exchanger and it is partially re-emitted and partially transmitted by conduction towards the adjacent parts. The cold exchanger extracts heat from the stack and wastes it into the deep space. The radiative and conductive couplings of the exchangers with all of the other components of the system must therefore be accurately modelized for a reliable temperature prediction. The thermal analysis has been carried out for two different system layouts. The first one concerns a conventional paraboloid, formerly used as a meteorological antenna and later transformed in our lab into a solar collector by means of a highly reflective film applied on its surface. The second configuration has an ideal shape, optimized for a better input of the heat load onto the hot toroidal shaped exchanger. The solar collector has been taken as a surface of revolution of a double parabola with the axes shifted off the toroid diameter. Such bi-paraboloid has therefore an annular focus and the curvature is such that it is located very close to the vertex so that the cold part of the engine is placed outside the collector, on the opposite side with respect to the sun. Such design improves significantly the magnitude of the thermal gradient across the stack, thus making it possible to achieve the same order of performances within a smaller area of the collector...|$|E

40|$|Conventionally the Cherenkov {{sound is}} governed by orbital degrees of freedom and is excited by {{supersonic}} particles. Additionally, it usually has a forward nature with a conic geometry known as the Cherenkov cone whose axis is oriented along the supersonic particle motion. Here we predict Cherenkov sound of a unique nature entirely resulting from the electronic spin degree of freedom and demonstrate a fundamentally distinct Cherenkov effect originating from essentially subsonic electrons in two-dimensional gases with both Bychkov-Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. Specifically, we show that the axis of the conventional forward Cherenkov cone gets a nontrivial quarter-turn {{and at the same}} time the sound distribution strongly localizes around this rotated axis being now orthogonal to the subsonic particle motion. Apart from its fundamentally appealing nature, the orthogonal Cherenkov sound could have applications in planar semiconductor technology combining spin and acoustic phenomena to develop, e. g., <b>acoustic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> or sound sources with a flexible spin dependent orientation of the sound propagation.
