As such, Schafer <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>have</b> been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Garner {{became the}} editor in chief of Black's Law Dictionary, whose roots are {{traceable}} to 1891 and which is currently the most widely respected authority on Anglo-American legal lexicography. Since 1995, Garner has overhauled the book over the course of four unabridged editions (7th–10th). He created a panel of international legal experts to improve all the specialized vocabulary in the book, including Roman law, international law, and transactional terminology. With the help of these experts, Garner <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>have</b> rewritten the entire dictionary and added tens of thousands of new entries, amplifying many with dates of linguistic origin; supplementary usage, historical, or other lexicographic information; and exemplary quotations drawn from myriad sources in the literature on Anglo-American law—some as early as the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|Rehabilitation {{after surgery}} {{consists}} of three stages. First, the arm is immobilized so that the muscle can heal. Second, when appropriate, a therapist assists with passive exercises to regain range of motion. Third, the arm is gradually exercised actively, with a goal of regaining and enhancing strength. Yoshitsugu Takeda <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>have</b> recently studied rotator cuff injuries and rehab exercises that target the supraspinatus. As mentioned earlier, the supraspinatus muscle is the muscle and tendon within the rotator cuff that is most often injured. In order to rehab the supraspinatus and combat future injuries in the rotator cuff, Takeda’s team has concluded that the empty can and full can exercises are most effective at isolating and strengthening the supraspinatus.|$|E
25|$|The {{leading cause}} of death still remains lead {{poisoning}} however. M. H. Stevens <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>have</b> concluded that high levels of lead deep in the bone sampled from Beethoven's skull suggest repeated exposure {{over a long period of}} time rather than limited exposure prior to the time of death. Among other evidence, the finding of shrunken cochlear nerves at his autopsy is consistent with axonal degeneration due to heavy metals such as lead. Chronic low-level lead exposure causes a slowly progressive hearing loss with sensory and autonomic findings, rather than the classic wrist drop due to motor neuropathy from sub-acute poisoning. Beethoven's physicians thought that he had alcohol dependence. He particularly liked wine that happened to be tainted with lead, therefore Beethoven's chronic consumption of wine tainted with lead is a better explanation of his hearing loss than other causes.|$|E

500|$|WALL•E {{proves to}} this {{generation}} {{and beyond that}} the film medium's only true boundaries are the human imagination.

Not since Chaplin's [...] "Little Tramp" [...] has so much story—so much emotion—been conveyed without words.

500|$|At the 2014 San Diego Comic Con International, Marvel Comics {{announced}} an ongoing series titled S.H.I.E.L.D., {{to be set}} in the mainstream Marvel Universe and written by Mark Waid, beginning December 2014. Featuring art by a rotating group of artists including Carlos Pacheco, Alan Davis, and Chris Sprouse, the series is led by Agent Phil Coulson, and sees the canonical introduction of the characters Melinda May, Jemma Simmons, and Leo Fitz—who originated from the television series—to the Marvel comics universe, who Waid noted would be given [...] "the Marvel Universe spin." [...] Waid described the series as [...] "done-in-one. Coulson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>have</b> a mission, and if we need someone for a mission, everyone in the Marvel Universe is available as a potential Agent." [...] Waid added that though the comic does not share events with the television series, it will maintain the characters' relationships and personalities. Marc Guggenheim relaunched the comic as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for Marvel Comics' All-New, All-Different Marvel line, and introduced the television series' character Grant Ward to the Marvel comic universe in May 2016.|$|E

[...] When Randy Pitchford, CEO of Gearbox Software, tweeted about the existence of pornographic content based on Overwatchs competitor game Battleborn, he was immediately mocked and trolled by fans of the more popular game.

The officers had allegedly victimized citizens for years; however, [...] allegations of their misconduct was not investigated until 2004.

2500|$|A {{month before}} Don 2s release Nariman Films, {{producers}} of Don, sent a legal notice to Reliance and Excel Entertainment about the sequel.

[...] Khan added in an interview with Mumbai Mirror, [...] "While my producers are best qualified to give a fitting reply to the whole matter, I as a lead actor can say that as for the sequel, the Amitabh Bachchan Don never had a sequel. So where is the question of us copying anything. Farhan <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>have</b> worked on the script, I {{know for a fact that}} we haven't copied from anywhere and this is an original script." [...] On 19 December, a week before Don 2s release, the Bombay High Court refused to stay the film's release. The court's ruling considered the film's scheduled release on 21 December overseas and 23 December in India, for which many theatres had been booked.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Accelerate", Entity FX {{was able}} to create a visual effect of Clark superspeeding through the rain—something Gough and Millar had wanted to see since season one—that {{eventually}} won them a Visual Effects Society award. Gough and Millar had always wanted to see Clark superspeeding through a rain shower, but [...] "the opportunity, [...] money" [...] never presented itself, until now. Entity FX had {{an extended period of time}} to research the kinetics of the cemetery scene, where Clark would speed through rain drops, because there were limited effects done for the episodes [...] "Precipice" [...] and [...] "Witness". Using HoudiniTM, Mat Beck and his team began creating their digital raindrops: [...] "Each raindrop can be thought of as a lens, as a mirror, and an object in itself. The entire backdrop is refracted through it like a lens, and the area behind the camera is being reflected in it. By adjusting those parameters, we were able to give it a brilliant jewel-like magical quality." [...] When trying to decide on the shape of the raindrops, Beck explains: [...] "We figured that round drops weren't that interesting, and teardrop ones looked a little silly and over the top, so we settled on this round diamond shape." [...] Entity FX created [...] "collision events" [...] as Clark ran through the raindrops, breaking them up. Beck remembered watching the cars on the freeway, during a rainstorm, [...] "throwing up these loose trails of spray". Eli Jarra added a similar mist trail to Clark as he ran through the cemetery to give a more realistic effect, although Beck admits to taking a few liberties with the final look of the mist. Occasionally, Mat Beck <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>have</b> to stretch the limits of the realistic physics they try and create when illustrating Clark’s abilities. While creating the alley scene in [...] "Prodigal" [...] where Lucas Luthor is attacked by an assassin with an Uzi 9mm, Mat Beck had to [...] "cheat" [...] the realism on the special effects used. First, the length of the alley is exaggerated in order to create enough time to show Clark stopping the bullets from hitting Lucas. Based on the calculations of how fast an Uzi 9mm fires, and the muzzle velocity, they estimated that the bullets would be approximately twenty to thirty feet apart; four alleys would have been needed for Clark to catch up to all of the bullets in time. Second, the bullets themselves were enlarged so that audiences would be able to see them.|$|E
