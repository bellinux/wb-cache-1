You are a Priest; {{you have been}} a Friar; you are, it is undeniable, the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. You have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and a hypocrite. Not many years passed of your conventional life, and you were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as we learned from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. You have put the crown on your offences, by as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>could,</b> denying them all; you have professed to seek after truth, when you were ravening after sin.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Hutchins {{was with}} Hillenburg in Rocko's Modern Life working on {{animation}} sound. Hutchins {{was approached by}} Hillenburg to do music for the show. He was asked for [...] "20 things, like an ocean liner horn," [...] and Hutchins knew he had the music Hillenburg was looking for. Hutchins said [...] "I offered him options and, in some cases, multiple choices. We agreed to meet at the Warner Bros. gate near the water tower in 20 minutes." [...] He recorded the sound to a tape and met Hillenburg by the gate. Hutchins said [...] "He was about as happy <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> imagine, and off he went. Next thing you know, I am working on the show." [...] Hutchins became the regular series sound designer.|$|E

500|$|Den of Geek {{viewed the}} episode positively, observing that in {{contrast}} to the previous installment, [...] "Ability" [...] "progresses the main plot arc in a substantial way... I’m now really interested to see what happens next, whereas last week I wasn’t that bothered." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was a little more critical and rated the episode 7.8/10. He noted that though the ending with Walter [...] "was as good <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ask for" [...] and enjoyed David Robert Jones as a villain, the episode had a [...] "number of rough patches," [...] as the middle was [...] "paced slowly" [...] and lacking in suspense, Peter's [...] "handiness was again reduced to ...'that guy with connections'", and the audience was [...] "once again subjected to the torture that is Sanford Harris". After describing the Olivia-Peter scene near the end as [...] "tense and cleverly written," [...] Isler concluded his review by noting references to The X-Files and hoping Jones would appear again soon.|$|E
500|$|Louis Virtel from HitFix called [...] "Living for Love" [...] as Madonna's [...] "best video since 'Hung Up'". He found {{references}} to older Madonna videos, like [...] "Express Yourself" [...] in the [...] "unusual choreography {{with all of}} its masculine posturing and grappling", [...] "Take a Bow" [...] with its bullfighting theme and playing on a familiar imagery from her career, and [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] during the sequences where Madonna fends off the Minotaur dancers. Virtel also commended the choreography, costumes, Madonna's looks and the cinematography of the video. Along with the [...] "Take a Bow" [...] reference, Billboards Joe Lynch called the video as incredible and [...] "lush, arresting" [...] but criticized for the misspelling of Nietzsche at the end." [...] Rita Kokshanian from InStyle said that the video was [...] "just as good <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have expected... And while we were completely transfixed by her killer moves and insane physique, we were equally in awe of her outfits." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, in {{an attempt}} to {{maintain}} secrecy over the impending release of the fifth Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Rowling and her publishers sought and received a groundbreaking injunction against [...] "the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the Claimants". The ruling obtained, {{for the first time in}} British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. Lawyers Winterbothams noted that, [...] "The new Harry Potter style injunction could be used if you expected a demonstration or trespass to take place, but which had not yet begun, so long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> find a description for the people expected which the Court was satisfied identified 'those who are included and those who are not'". The [...] "Potter injunction" [...] was later used against a camp of Roma travellers. In 2006, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline employed the injunction against anonymous animal rights campaigners who had sent threatening letters to their investors.|$|E

500|$|... "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. It {{was identified}} by The Baltimore Sun {{as one of}} the ten best episodes of the series. Sun writers David Zurawik and Chris Kaltenbach particularly praised the creative pairing of Ned Beatty and Julianna Margulies, of whom they said, [...] "somehow it is as touching a love story <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> want". The Washington Post television reviewer Tom Shales strongly complimented the episode, especially for its serious and unflinching approach to disturbing and twisted events like the Forman murder: [...] "Homicide is more than a superb cop show; it's a helpful guide on dealing with the madness of the modern world. It's Attention Television [...] a program that grips one's attention and rewards it." [...] The Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer Drew Jubera said the episode [...] "shifts deftly between the underbelly of cop work and the surprising moments of light that leak into these detectives' lives". Greg Paeth of The Cincinnati Post called it [...] "another stunning installment of a cop drama that defines the genre", and particularly praised the [...] "perfect" [...] performance of Ned Beatty. Baltimore Sun writer David Bianculli called the episode superb and said Adrienne Shelly left a [...] "stunning impression in her performance. Bianculli said it left him [...] "hungry for the next episode," [...] adding, [...] "Personal plea to NBC: Please, please renew this series." ...|$|E
500|$|Pete Schulberg of The Oregonian wrote, [...] "Forget all {{the commotion}} about NYPD Blue. Homicide {{delivers}} without the lewd language and skin shots. It depicts violence {{in a most}} compelling way: You don't see it. You just feel it." [...] Bob Wisehart of The Sacramento Bee said, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} while NYPD Blue is a fine show [...] it was on my 10-best list for 1993 [...] Homicide is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is what it took to get you to watch NYPD Blue and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews echoed {{complaints}} about the similarity of Blue Shift to previous games. GameSpy's reviewer Jamie Madigan stated that [...] "what really pulls the game down is the 'more of the same' factor". Although writing that the game [...] "feels like {{just a few more}} levels for the original game", he noted that this is what Blue Shift was designed to be, given its origins as an add-on for a Dreamcast version of Half-Life. Madigan described the single-player campaign as [...] "decent" [...] and commented that the High Definition pack made the game [...] "worthy of consideration". Eurogamer echoed criticism on the game's length; reviewer Tom Bradwell commented that [...] "although I'm hard pressed to criticize what you get, the complete absence of everything we've learnt from the likes of Counter-Strike and everything since is frankly bizarre". Bradwell did, however, criticize the game's artificial intelligence and the occasional bug that caused a player to get stuck on a wall. PC Zones Mark Hill was more lenient in his comments, praising the game's artificial intelligence as [...] "intelligent <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hope an AI enemy to be". In addition, Hill praised the game for showing more activity in the base, noting that [...] "a whole world goes on around you, with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry. The complex is more alive than ever before". Hill also praised the focus [...] "on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than the two or three models that were cloned throughout the facility who kept repeating the same phrases", describing this as Blue Shifts [...] "greatest achievement". PC Zones review closed by commenting that [...] "as a Dreamcast extra it works perfectly, but as a standalone PC title there's not nearly enough to it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The baht rebounded in the {{following}} day as investors bet the coup would break a political deadlock that had stalled public works spending. The currency rose the most in more than eight months after army chief Sondhi Boonyarataklin took power without bloodshed and pledged to hold elections in October 2007. The baht rose 1 percent to 37.38 per dollar at 14:30 in Bangkok.

2500|$|Also {{in early}} 2009, the BBC {{broadcast}} an Attenborough one-hour special, Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life. In {{reference to the}} programme, Attenborough stated that [...] "People write to me that evolution is only a theory. Well, {{it is not a}} theory. Evolution is as solid a historical fact <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> conceive. Evidence from every quarter. What is a theory is whether natural selection is the mechanism and the only mechanism. That is a theory. But the historical reality that dinosaurs led to birds and mammals produced whales, that's not theory." [...] He strongly opposes creationism and its offshoot [...] "intelligent design", saying that a survey that found a quarter of science teachers in state schools believe that creationism should be taught alongside evolution in science lessons was [...] "really terrible".|$|E
2500|$|On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an {{encounter}} with Mark David Chapman, who would assassinate John Lennon just one day later.

And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John." [...] The next night, Taylor, who lived in the next building from Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: [...] "I heard him shot—five, just as quick <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> pull the trigger, about five explosions." ...|$|E
