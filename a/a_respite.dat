5|$|The Wolverines {{recorded}} 15 sides for Gennett Records between February and October 1924. The titles {{revealed a}} tough and well-formed cornet talent. His lip had toughened from earlier, more tentative years; on {{nine of the}} Wolverines' recorded titles he proceeds commandingly from lead to opening solo without any need for <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> from playing.|$|E
5|$|The British thus gained <b>a</b> <b>respite,</b> {{and peace}} lasted {{at least until}} the time Gildas was writing: that is, for perhaps forty or fifty years, from around the end of the 5th century until midway through the sixth. Shortly after Gildas's time the Anglo-Saxon advance was resumed, and by the late 6th century nearly all of {{southern}} England was {{under the control of the}} continental invaders.|$|E

5|$|Emanuele Filiberto {{served in}} the active {{squadron}} of the Italian navy for the first several years of her career. She {{was assigned to the}} 3rd Division during the Italo-Turkish War of 19111912. During the war, she was involved in the assaults on Tripoli in North Africa and on the island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. She was obsolescent by World War I and was slated to be broken up in 191415, but the need for warships granted Emanuele Filiberto <b>a</b> <b>respite.</b> She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice. She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|With {{the partial}} {{destruction}} of the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia, the U.S. headquarters in Saigon determined that the time was propitious for a similar campaign in Laos. If such an operation were to be carried out, the U.S. command believed, {{it would be best}} to do it quickly, while American military assets were still available in South Vietnam. Such an operation would create supply shortages that would be felt by PAVN/NLF forces 12–18 months later, as the last U.S. troops were leaving South Vietnam and thereby give the U.S. and its ally <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> from a possible communist offensive in the northern provinces for one year, possibly even two.|$|E
5|$|Ammiraglio di Saint Bon {{served in}} the active {{squadron}} of the Italian navy for the first several years of her career. She {{was assigned to the}} 3rd Division during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912. During the war, she was involved in the seizure of the island of Rhodes, where she provided gunfire support to Italian infantry. The ship was obsolescent by World War I and was slated to be broken up in 1914–15, but the need for warships granted Ammiraglio di Saint Bon <b>a</b> <b>respite.</b> She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice and, after April 1916, was used primarily as a floating anti-aircraft battery. She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Concerned {{that the}} German Army posed {{a threat to}} Petrograd, in March 1918 Sovnarkom {{relocated}} to Moscow, initially as a temporary measure. There, Lenin, Trotsky, and other Bolshevik leaders moved into the Kremlin, where Lenin lived {{with his wife and}} sister Maria in a first floor apartment adjacent to the room in which the Sovnarkom meetings were held. Lenin disliked Moscow, but rarely left the city centre during the rest of his life. It was in the city in August 1918 that he survived a second assassination attempt; he was shot following a public speech and injured badly. A Socialist Revolutionary, Fanny Kaplan, was arrested and executed. The attack was widely covered in the Russian press, generating much sympathy for him and boosting his popularity. As <b>a</b> <b>respite,</b> in September 1918 Lenin was driven to the Gorki estate, just outside Moscow, recently acquired for him by the government.|$|E
5|$|In the event, {{this was}} not the end of Morshead's wartime service, just <b>a</b> <b>respite.</b> In July 1944, Morshead was {{appointed}} as commander of I Corps on the Atherton Tableland. Although nominally a lesser command, it would be the spearhead of the Australian Army in subsequent operations. The staff was that of Morshead's former II Corps, as the I and II Corps headquarters had exchanged names. In February 1945, Morshead received word that his objective would be Borneo. General Douglas MacArthur placed I Corps under his direct command for the operation. Morshead had to make a series of landings at Tarakan, North Borneo and Balikpapan on the east and north west coasts of the island. These were carried out with great efficiency, achieving their objectives with low casualties.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army's pace was {{dictated}} by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, {{had the advantage of}} superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when it was almost cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard's army had <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> from attack because while it hugged the coast and had gone round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin's army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always within striking distance, and waiting for an opportunity to attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.|$|E

5|$|The Jardines de la Galera {{date back}} to the 10th century. They are nestled between the Torre de Espantaperros and the Chemin de ronde, within the Alcazaba. Many Alhambran ruins still exist within the gardens, and have been open to the public since 2007 after the site was {{restored}} after being closed for more than thirty years. The etymology of the gardens {{stems from the fact that}} the gardens provided <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> for prisoners sentenced to the gallows in Seville. Plant species extant in the gardens include cinnamomum camphora, dichondra repens, ceiba speciosa, and trees of the myrtle, laurel, orange, lemon, and pomegranate. Other parks and gardens include Castelar, which has a central pond and several monuments dedicated to the romanticist writer Carolina Coronado and to Luis Chamizo Trigueros, la Legión, Rivillas y Calamón, San Fernando, and La Viña.The city also has a water and leisure park, called the Lusiberia.|$|E
5|$|Alexander faced {{pressure}} from his brother, Duke Constantine, {{to make peace}} with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms–demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia. He then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of this kingdom. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the Treaties of Tilsit at last gave Napoleon <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.|$|E
25|$|King Henry V {{was still}} anxious {{to find a}} way of escape for his old comrade, and granted <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> of forty days. Before that time had expired, Oldcastle escaped from the Tower by the help of one William Fisher, a parchmentmaker of Smithfield.|$|E

The forest beings become nonplussed when Dawn tells them they aren't as scary as what has been chasing them.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} reasons for the history and {{continued}} prevalence of racial segregation in U.S. churches, including racism, denominational differences, and isolation. This segregation also has effects on individuals and the larger society, including increased racism and segregation even outside of the church. However, segregated Black churches also have been a positive place for community organizing for civil rights and other issues, as well as offering <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> for Black individuals from the racism they face in integrated society.|$|E
25|$|Romney’s term as {{governor}} fell during <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> between two nationwide economic recessions. When {{he took office}} in early 2003, {{the nation as a}} whole was still suffering the effects of the early 2000s recession. Massachusetts was losing manufacturing jobs, and, with an economy heavily dependent on the technology sector, had been badly shaken by the dot-com bubble collapse. When the national economy eventually began to improve, the state lagged behind the rest of the nation in job growth and employment.|$|E
25|$|An {{apostrophe}} {{is used in}} {{time and}} money references, among others, in constructions such as one hour’s respite, two weeks’ holiday, a dollar’s worth, five pounds’ worth, one mile’s drive from here. This is like an ordinary possessive use. For example, one hour’s respite means <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> of one hour (exactly as the cat’s whiskers means the whiskers of the cat). Exceptions are accounted for in the same way: three months pregnant (in modern usage, one says neither pregnant of three months, nor one month(’)s pregnant).|$|E

25|$|This {{friendship}} was advantageous for the Jewish {{community and}} gave them <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> from the oppressive laws enacted against them. Later kings reversed Shapur's policy of religious tolerance. Under pressure from Zoroastrian Magi and influenced by the high-priest Kartir, Bahram I killed Mani and persecuted his followers. Bahram II was, like his father, amenable to {{the wishes of the}} Zoroastrian priesthood. During his reign, the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon was sacked by the Romans under Emperor Carus, and most of Armenia, after half a century of Persian rule, was ceded to Diocletian.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} on 28 October 2012 that Savile's cottage in Glen Coe had been spray-painted with slogans {{and the door}} damaged.

Plans to sell the cottage early in 2012 were halted by Savile's charitable trust, which had planned {{to turn it into}} <b>a</b> <b>respite</b> centre for the disabled. These plans were in turn halted when the trust announced it would close. The cottage was sold at auction on 30 May 2013.|$|E
