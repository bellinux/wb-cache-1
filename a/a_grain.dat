5|$|Ant Island is {{a colony}} of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, {{they are forced to}} give food to a gang of marauding {{grasshoppers}} led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.|$|E

40|$|In the {{well-known}} Hall-Petch behavior, yield and flow stresses in polycrystalline metals increase with <b>a</b> decrease in <b>grain</b> size. <b>As</b> <b>grain</b> size continues to decrease, mechanical strength peaks. <b>As</b> <b>grain</b> size further decreases, mechanical strength begins to decrease. <b>As</b> <b>grain</b> size approaches zero, the total structure {{is composed of}} an increasingly high percentage of grain boundaries, which exhibit the properties of an amorphous structure. Molecular dynamics simulations, {{with the goal of}} exploring this behavior, were performed on nanocrystalline and amorphous microstructures using the embedded atom potential developed by Mishin et al. A 0. 2 shear strain was applied to each of the nanocrystalline and amorphous samples. From these simulations, we have observed the inverse Hall-Petch behavior of nanocrystalline structures. We have also shown that the amorphous structure as zero grain size is reasonable as the limiting case for the inverse Hall-Petch trends in nanocrystalline structures. by David R. Gandy. Thesis (S.

5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, remnant moisture from Rick enhanced a strong cold front over the Great Plains of the United States. Severe thunderstorms occurred over parts of the southern states, with at least three tornadoes touching down in Louisiana.

One of these tornadoes damaged more than 10structures, destroyed <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> silo, flipped a tractor trailer and left numerous residents without power.

5|$|Antioch was Diocletian's primary {{residence}} from 299 to 302, while Galerius swapped {{places with}} his Augustus on the Middle and Lower Danube. Diocletian visited Egypt once, {{over the winter}} of 301–2, and issued <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> dole in Alexandria. Following some public disputes with Manicheans, Diocletian ordered that the leading followers of Mani be burnt alive along with their scriptures. In a 31 March 302 rescript from Alexandria, he declared that low-status Manicheans must be executed by the blade, and high-status Manicheans must be sent {{to work in the}} quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island, Turkey) or the mines of Phaeno in southern Palestine. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury. Diocletian found much to be offended by in Manichean religion: its novelty, its alien origins, the way it corrupted the morals of the Roman race, and its inherent opposition to long-standing religious traditions. Manichaeanism was also supported by Persia at the time, compounding religious dissent with international politics. Excepting Persian support, the reasons he disliked Manichaenism were equally applicable, if not more so, to Christianity, his next target.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Devonian period (400 Mya) the sea was retreating from the Welsh Basin as the land was thrust up by the collision of land masses, forming a new range of mountains, the Welsh Caledonides. The strata were compressed and deformed, and in places, the clay minerals recrystallised, developing <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> that allowed parallel cleavage, making it easy to split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate. In the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 Mya), erosion of the mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones. A reinvasion of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone, and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of coal measures. Southwestern Wales, in particular, was affected by the Variscan orogeny, a period when continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata.|$|E
