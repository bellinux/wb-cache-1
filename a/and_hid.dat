In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government for the keeping of pieces such as Veronese's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection.|$|E

40|$|In this tutorial, {{we discuss}} {{self-excited}} <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> attractors for systems of differential equations. We considered {{the example of}} a Lorenz-like system derived from the well-known Glukhovsky [...] Dolghansky and Rabinovich systems, to demonstrate the analysis of self-excited <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> attractors <b>and</b> their characteristics. We applied the fishing principle to demonstrate the existence of a homoclinic orbit, proved the dissipativity and completeness of the system, and found absorbing and positively invariant sets. We have shown that this system has a self-excited attractor <b>and</b> a <b>hidden</b> attractor for certain parameters. The upper estimates of the Lyapunov dimension of self-excited <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> attractors were obtained analytically. Comment: submitted to EP...|$|R

5|$|Chappuis {{was rescued}} by an Italian partisan, Aldo Comucci, a 21-year-old {{who was in}} charge of one of the many {{underground}} groups operating in the area.

The partisans passed Chappuis and the two other Americans from house to house, and village to village, toward the Swiss frontier. Dressed in shawls — but still wearing G.I. shoes — they once walked undetected past a German sentry.|$|E

Ottorino Barassi, the Italian {{vice-president}} of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome <b>and</b> <b>hid</b> it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent Adolf Hitler and the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden {{marked the beginning of}} a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographer requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.|$|E
