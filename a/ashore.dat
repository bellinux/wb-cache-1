5|$|On October1, a {{day before}} the {{hurricane}} moved <b>ashore,</b> the U.S. Weather Bureau issued northeast storm signals from Key West, Florida to Norfolk, Virginia. Similar warnings were issued in the hours preceding the hurricane moving <b>ashore.</b> The advisories were credited with saving dozens of lives {{and millions of dollars}} in shipping cargo, due to advance warning for boats to remain <b>ashore.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{bypassing}} New England, Carol brushed western Nova Scotia {{before moving}} <b>ashore</b> near Saint John, New Brunswick as a minimal hurricane. As it moved <b>ashore,</b> it produced hurricane conditions in eastern Maine, {{one of only}} six Atlantic hurricanes to do so. In Nova Scotia, several boats were wrecked or washed <b>ashore,</b> with one drowning death reported. High seas caused coastal flooding, while strong winds downed large areas of trees. Heavy losses to the apple crop occurred in Annapolis Valley, totaling $1million (1950CAD, $ USD). Carol later dissipated southwest of Greenland on September9.|$|E

5|$|At 12:30 two {{companies}} of the Canterbury Battalion landed and {{were sent to}} support the Aucklands, who had now been ordered back to Plugge's Plateau, and were forming on {{the left of the}} 3rd Brigade. The Canterbury companies moved into the line on the Aucklands' left, waiting {{for the rest of their}} brigade to land. However, between 12:30 and 16:00 not one infantry or artillery formation came <b>ashore.</b> The ships carrying the New Zealanders were in the bay, but the steamers and rowing boats were being used to take the large numbers of wounded to the hospital ship. The transports with the 4th Australian Brigade on board were still well out at sea and not due to land until that evening. The landings recommenced around 16:30 when the Wellington Battalion came <b>ashore,</b> followed by the Otago Battalion around 17:00, who were put into the line beside the Aucklanders. Next to land were the two other Canterbury companies, who were sent north to Walker's Ridge to extend the corps left flank. Events <b>ashore</b> now forced a change in the disembarkation schedule, and at 17:50 orders were issued for the 4th Australian Brigade to start landing to boost the defence. It would take until the next day for the complete brigade to come <b>ashore.</b> The transports carrying both divisions' artillery batteries had been forced further out to sea by Turkish artillery fire, and were unable to land.|$|E

The wreck was still visible as late as 1963.|$|E
5|$|For {{that entire}} day the Comanches plundered and burned buildings, draping {{themselves}} grandly in top hats and stolen linens. They tied feather beds {{and bolts of}} cloth to their horses, and dragged them. They herded large numbers of cattle into pens and slaughtered them. One outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, grabbed a gun and waded <b>ashore</b> through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded <b>ashore</b> to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.|$|E
