5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. <b>A</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives {{to the front of}} the engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved {{to the front of the}} engine.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{community}} {{components in}} Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry, {{who began his}} career as a charismatic preacher in the Church of God of Prophecy but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded. Hollywood stars Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with the outrageous things he said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|Most European {{countries}} (except UK) did not conduct {{very complex}} and expensive {{studies on the}} effectiveness of respirators in the workplaces, or spent very little of such research. Therefore, it may be that some countries do not take full account of results of foreign researches (that showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of respirators in a laboratory environment; and in applying them in the workplaces). For example, after the study in 1990, the APF value of negative pressure full face masks was reduced from 900 to 40 (1997) in UK. But in other countries, similar research was not carried out; and a similar decrease did not occur.|$|E
25|$|Actual {{measurements}} on the 50kW Manzanares pilot {{solar updraft tower}} found a conversion efficiency of 0.53%, although SBP believe {{that this could be}} increased to 1.3% in a large and improved 100MW unit.

It is important to note <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> up-draft and down-draft proposals. The usage of water as a working-medium dramatically increases the potential for thermal energy capture, and electrical generation, due to its specific heat capacity. While the design may have its problems (see next section) and the stated efficiency claims has yet to be demonstrated, it would be an error to extrapolate performance {{from one to the other}} simply because of similarities in the name.|$|E

500|$|The horse {{skeleton}} averages 205 bones. <b>A</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> horse skeleton {{and that}} of a human {{is the lack of}} a collarbone—the horse's forelimbs are attached to the spinal column by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the shoulder blade to the torso. The horse's legs and hooves are also unique structures. Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. For example, the body part that is called a horse's [...] "knee" [...] is actually made up of the carpal bones that correspond to the human wrist. Similarly, the hock contains bones equivalent to those in the human ankle and heel. The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the fetlock (incorrectly called the [...] "ankle") is actually the proximal sesamoid bones between the cannon bones (a single equivalent to the human metacarpal or metatarsal bones) and the proximal phalanges, located where one finds the [...] "knuckles" [...] of a human. A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the hoof.|$|E
