5000|$|Neutral-beam {{injection}} {{involves the}} introduction of high energy (rapidly moving) atoms (molecules) into an ohmically heated, magnetically confined plasma within the tokamak. The high energy atoms (molecules) originate as ions in an <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> before being extracted through a high voltage grid set. The term [...] "ion source" [...] is used to generally mean the assembly consisting {{of a set of}} electron emitting filaments, an <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> volume, and a set of extraction grids. The extracted ions travel through a neutralizer section of the beamline where they gain enough electrons to become neutral atoms (molecules) but retain the high velocity imparted to them from the ion source. Once the neutral beam enters the tokamak, interactions with the main plasma ions occur which significantly heat the bulk plasma and bring it closer to fusion-relevant temperatures. Ion source extraction voltages are typically of the order 50-100 kV, and high voltage, negative ion sources (-1 MV) are being developed for ITER. The ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility in Padova will be the first ITER facility to start operation. While neutral beam injection is used primarily for plasma heating, it can also be used as a diagnostic tool and in feedback control by making a pulsed beam consisting of a string of brief 2-10 ms beam blips. Deuterium is a primary fuel for neutral beam heating systems and hydrogen and helium are sometimes used for selected experiments.|$|E

40|$|Performance {{comparisons}} of a DIII-D neutral beam ion source operated with two different schemes of supplying neutral gas to the <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> were performed. Superior performance was achieved when gas was puffed into both the <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> and the neutralizer with the gas flows optimized {{as compared to}} supplying gas through the neutralizer alone. To form a neutral beam, ions extracted from the <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> and accelerated are passed through a neutralizing cell of gas. Neutral gas is commonly puffed into the neutralizing cell to supplement the residual neutral gas from the <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> to obtain maximum neutralization efficiency. However, maximizing neutralization efficiency does not necessarily provide the maximum available neutral beam power, since high levels of neutral gas can increase beam loss through collisions and cause larger beam divergence. Excessive gas diffused from the neutralizer into the accelerator region also increases the number of energetic particles (ions and secondary electrons from the accelerator grid surfaces) deposited on the accelerator grids, increasing the possibility of overheating. We have operated an ion source with a constant optimal gas flow directly into the <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> while gas flow into the neutralizer was varied.

This pumping section is 5. 5 m long and consists of the beam chamber and an ante-chamber.

40|$|Investigations {{have been}} made into {{the effect of the}} Miniature Circuit Breaker {{configuration}} on the behaviour of short circuit arcs. A Flexible Test Apparatus was developed to recreate the operation of a MCB, igniting the arc between opening contacts. The short circuit fault was simulated using a capacitor discharge system, with a prospective peak current of 3. 5 kA. A high-speed digital Arc Imaging System was used to record the arc behaviour. Analysis techniques have been developed that plot the individual trajectories of the anode and cathode root from the digital data. The time that each arc root remains in the contact region can be deduced and is defined as the arc root contact time. It is shown that the traditional arc voltage to measure arc contact times is not accurate. In the Arc Contact Time Investigation the contact material, contact geometry, arc runner configuration were varied. At 3 m/s contact velocity silver graphite contacts and step geometry led to longer cathode root contact times. Cathode root motion was prevented by a corner on the arc runner. The polarity of connection affected the arc movement away from the contact region. Increasing the contact velocity reduced cathode root contact times, but did not guarantee arc movement away from the contact region. The Taguchi Method was applied to the Arc Behaviour Investigation. The contact material, contact geometry, <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> geometry, <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> material and <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> venting were varied. Tests were carried out at lOm/s contact velocity. The cathode root contact time, anode root contact times and let through energy were calculated. The arc voltage and current, arc root trajectory plots and selected arc images are presented. The cathode and anode root contact times were independent. Generally, the cathode root moved away from the contact region before the anode root. Lower let-though energies were recorded for open <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> vents. The arc failed to move from the contact region, when silver graphite contacts were used in combination with acrylic <b>arc</b> <b>chamber,</b> copper arc runners and choked <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> vents. The mobility of the arc is dominated by the cathode root, and can only run at high velocity if the electrode surface conditions promote oxide layer type emission. The arc is drawn between the contacts with metal vapour type emission dominating and is initially limited to low velocity. During the arc contact time the arc root interaction effects damage the oxide layer on the surrounding conductor surface. As the arc column length increases, deflection of the arc column by the self-blast magnetic field may cause a discontinuous jump, after which the arc may run at high velocity. Increasing the contact velocity and steel arc runner backing strips encourage a discontinuous jump away from the contact region. Deposition on the arc runner of silver and carbon discourages both discontinuous jumps and high velocity motion. Changes in geometry, restricting the <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> venting and the anode root commutation can reduce the cathode root velocity. When this occurs, the arc root interaction effects damage the oxide layer, and cause the arc to revert to metal vapour type emission. Additionally, the surface of the acrylic <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> is carbonised during prolonged arc contact times. The partial conducting path through the carbonised material further encourages the arc to remain in the contact region...|$|E

The arcs are investigated at both anode levels by means of spectroscopic diagnostics.

In the first <b>arc</b> <b>chamber,</b> the plasma is totally dissociated and ionized, and the measured electron density and temperature are close to those derived from a local-thermal-equilibrium calculation. The electron density and temperature are also measured within the second <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> and at the torch exit where the plasma flow is abruptly released. The results allow to examine {{the validity of the}} thermodynamic equilibrium criteria in nonstandard conditions as those encountered in the <b>arc</b> <b>chamber</b> plasma.

The temporal series exhibit two main characteristic frequencies: At low frequency, the electric generators yield very stable and reproducible 150 -Hz oscillations, whereas the firing of the second arc gives birth to a sharp 6. 7 -kHz peak which is ascribed to the generation of acoustic waves in the region of the first anode attachment.

Therefore, {{one of the most}} promising technologies, which enables to solve several problems, such as environmental pollution, efficient hazardous waste treatment and energy/fuel generation, could be plasma technology. The main goal of the thesis was to design water steam plasma torch for organic waste treatment and investigate thermo-hydro-dynamic processes inside its <b>arc</b> discharge <b>chamber</b> and generated plasma stream. In the thesis, the interaction between the steam, electric arc and electrodes of the plasma torch during the generation process of a low-temperature thermal plasma stream at atmospheric pressure was investigated; the mechanism of heat transfer in the arc discharge channel of the plasma torch was examined; the efficient organic waste treatment method using thermal plasma technology was implemented. The results obtained in the thesis are useful to design water steam plasma torches operating at atmospheric pressure with completely different unique physical properties as water steam is involved to form plasma. Furthermore, the results are of significant value regarding the engineering of plasma-chemical reactors for the organic waste treatment as well as for determining the main parameters of the treatment process, including calculations on process efficiency and energy expenditure...|$|R
