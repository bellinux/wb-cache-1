With {{the help of}} the Irrigation and Flood Control Department of the Delhi Government, the drain was de-silted to increase its storage capacity. Regulators at Kakraula and Dhansa retain the water. Presently the brackish water is improving with dilution. By retaining the water in the drain, the aquifers and groundwater table have been recharged <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> water now for irrigation, enabling farmers 6 kilometres away from the drain to grow crops. Tube wells in the area have been discharging water copiously and in two years the water table is up by a meter.|$|E

These items are {{arranged}} in a line vertically and are wrapped in silk to reduce dehydration. Caches are created and grow when prey is readily available <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> biomass available for consumption than is required by the spider. The purpose of caches is to have a backup food source when prey is scarce and occasionally to provide bait to attract more prey to the web. Nephila may also respond to food shortages by moving their webs, however this is a response to longer periods prey scarcity than cache creation. Web moving is seen as a result of environmental change whereas caches occur from environmental fluctuation.|$|E

Thorson also stated that he believed that Starr had submitted an inaccurate and misleading report on May's Article 32 hearing to the USAF commanding officers, including Dallager and Santarelli.

2500|$|The set of all {{functions}} from a set X {{to a set}} Y is {{denoted by}} X → Y, by , or by Y'X.

2500|$|Plato’s Problem was {{expressed}} generally by Bertrand Russell: [...] "How comes it that human beings, whose {{contacts with the}} world are brief and personal and limited, are nevertheless able to {{know as much as}} they do know?" [...] The problem arises in the domain of language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> to it than the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next. There is more to it than a reproduction of experience and, in maturity, our capacity goes well beyond what we have experienced.|$|E
2500|$|Private Eye has {{traditionally}} lagged behind other magazines in adopting new typesetting and printing technologies.

2500|$|The {{advantage}} of divisional structure {{is that it}} uses delegated authority so the performance can be directly measured with each group. This results in managers performing better and high employee morale. [...] Another {{advantage of}} using divisional structure {{is that it is}} more efficient in coordinating work between different divisions, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> flexibility to respond when there is a change in the market. Also, a company will have a simpler process if they need to change the size of the business by either adding or removing divisions. When divisional structure is utilized more specialization can occur within the groups. When divisional structure is organized by product, the customer has their own advantages especially when only a few services or products are offered which differ greatly. When using divisional structures that are organized by either markets or geographic areas they generally have similar function and are located in different regions or markets. This allows business decisions and activities coordinated locally.|$|E

[...] Her obituary from The Times said, [...] "She was very pretty; she was very graceful; there was something appealing about her which might almost be called childish. She had a queer and very attractive little croak in her voice, and an elementary, little-girlish way of saying things which made them peculiarly engaging, and caused her saying of them to stick in the memory with a permanence which their wit or point might by no means justify. Add to this the enchanting lissomeness and beauty of all such movements as she was mistress of, and a stage personality (as we call it) which was like no one else's, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> than justification for the glow which the remembrance of her performances kindles."
