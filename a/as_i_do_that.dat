25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E
500|$|After {{the high}} levels of {{criticism}} aimed at the Aliens Act, Churchill decided to strengthen the legislation, and proposed the Aliens (Prevention of Crime) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule. The MP Josiah C Wedgwood objected, and wrote to Churchill to ask him not to introduce the hard-line measures [...] "You know as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> human life does not matter a rap in comparison with the death of ideas and the betrayal of English traditions." [...] The bill did not become law.|$|E
500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would {{expect them to}} be a little upset. Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{somewhat}} dashed, blanked idiot,' emended the bank-manager's late partner. 'Thank goodness he lost <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>That's</b> {{some light}} consolation.' ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{beginning}} was so bold that I held my breath, {{knowing full well}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> she had chosen the very note.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm no murderer," [...] gasped Bradling; [...] "you saw <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> {{the fellow}} {{threatened}} to shoot me. Besides, {{he is not}} dead." ...|$|R
60|$|COMTESSE. What {{are you up}} to now, Miss Pin? You know as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} no such speech.|$|E
60|$|THE GOVERNOR. You {{know as well}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> if {{you were}} out in the shops you wouldn't be allowed to talk.|$|E
6000|$|But the jackal replied: 'Bring {{out your}} little ones, indeed! Why, {{you know as}} well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> you have eaten them all up.' ...|$|E
60|$|Joe felt, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> he {{had made}} a point there, and he pulled hard at his pipe to keep himself from {{weakening}} it by repetition.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Gus who did that," [...] Fred replied, glancing {{with a smile}} {{toward the}} discomfited prisoner. [...] "He thought <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> it was Tim." ...|$|R
60|$|He knew <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> it {{was just}} as likely, at that time of year, I was going down there whaling; but I felt complimented, too.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{know just}} as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> she pretended to love you. Oh, she's behaved shamefully. There can be no excuse for her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{know just}} as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> none of the natives has a revolver. Beside {{ourselves}} {{only one or two}} of the servants have them.' ...|$|E
60|$|You {{know just}} as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> none of our natives has a revolver. Besides {{ourselves}} {{only two or three}} of the servants have them.|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS. Yes; {{but then}} I learn {{so much more}} from my {{experiments}} than he does! And the victims learn <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>That's</b> where my moral superiority comes in.|$|R
60|$|My father readily {{complied}} with my desire of coming home; for besides <b>that</b> he thought, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> three years' {{time at the}} university was enough, he also most passionately loved me, and {{began to think of}} my settling near him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed. The {{thought of}} seeing you again was too--too {{overwhelming}} to be indulged in; knowing, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> {{if you were}} the same to me, it must be at this sad cost to you," [...] and her eyes filled with tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "His blood, {{or that of}} your brother. Surely at {{the present}} moment you must hope, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> the enigmatical Scarlet Pimpernel will start for Calais to-day--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Macallister laughed. [...] "Well," [...] he said drily, [...] "I'm {{thinking}} Miss Brown knows, as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> ye {{would not}} have gone of your own accord." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Valeria! Valeria! you are {{wasting time}} and words. You have tried the experiment; {{and you know}} as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> the thing is not to be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked as}} black <b>as</b> thunder when <b>I</b> {{mentioned}} her name. All he said was, [...] "No!" [...] But, oh, {{if you had}} heard his voice--and he so gentle and sweet-tempered at other times--you would have felt, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> he had Helena in his mind! ...|$|R
25|$|If {{you could}} have seen <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the passionate enthusiasm of the whole town of Irkutsk, the capital of Eastern Siberia, at the news of your triumphal march across the {{possession}} of the mad king of Naples, you would have said <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> {{there is no longer}} space or frontiers.|$|R
6000|$|His {{companion}} {{seemed a}} trifle astonished. [...] "Then I {{wonder if you}} felt <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> those shadowy woods and dark yew hedges shut out all that is real and strenuous in life. One could fancy <b>that</b> nobody <b>did</b> anything but sit still and dream there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{if you are}} honest," [...] said Sam. [...] "You know as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> Tad Sobber's uncle is a rascal {{and ought}} to be in prison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord {{is pleased}} to jest," [...] she said coolly, [...] "and knows as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> no patrician can boast of a single favour {{obtained}} from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Stevenson, this {{nonsense}} {{has got to}} end!" [...] cried Slogwell Brown. [...] "You know as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> you have no valid claim to this island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Saftly, saftly,' said Yusuf; 'nae doot ye trow <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> {{they are}} a' mere pagans and savage heathens, worshipping Baal and Ashtaroth, but I fand myself quite mista'en. They hae no idols, and girn at the blinded Papists as muckle as auld Deacon Shortcoats himsel'.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, how ignorant {{she must}} have been of my true {{thoughts}} and feelings! How strangely people seem to misunderstand their dearest friends! knowing, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could never love any man but Philip, could I be wicked enough to suppose that Philip would love any woman but me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may {{concern you}} very much indeed. A few days ago I should have told you, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> {{nothing in the world}} could stop the {{publication}} of that article. To-day I am not so sure. At any rate, I believe there is a chance. Would you care to see the chief?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The boy laughed. [...] "You can cheat yourself, dad, {{when you}} like, {{but you know}} as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> smuggling's dishonest, and that those who smuggle cheat the revenue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She knows, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> {{our friends}} {{are ready to}} quarrel over a husband for us," [...] thought Gwendolen, [...] "and she is {{determined}} not {{to enter into the}} quarrel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't {{talk like}} this, please," [...] she begged. [...] "You {{know as well}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> neither you nor I could turn our backs on England just now and be happy." ...|$|E
60|$|Never did {{a journey}} seem so long, or a way so strange, as that over which I walked like {{one in a}} dream in the darkness, {{surrounded}} on every hand by the enemy, and knowing <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> the king's officers set little value {{on the life of}} those whom they call rebels.|$|R
60|$|Thus I spoke, very loudly {{that all}} might hear, slowly also, pausing between each word because I wished to give {{time for the}} light to strengthen, seeing <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> the rays of the rising sun struck upon {{the face of the}} giant, whereas the eyes of Umslopogaas were less dazzled by it.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{one sense}} you were {{certainly}} right," [...] he said. [...] "We belong to different worlds, and I {{should never have}} spoken to you <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>That</b> is a thing you must try to forgive me, {{and you have no}} reason to blame yourself. As I told you at the time, you were free." ...|$|R
