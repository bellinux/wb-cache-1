50|$|The 1965 British West Indies Championships was {{the sixth}} and final edition of the track and field {{competition}} between British colony nations in the Caribbean. It was held in Bridgetown, Barbados. The dissolution of the West Indies Federation, and the broader sports co-operation it had engendered, left the competition without the support to continue. A total of 28 events were contested, eighteen by men and ten by women. The men's half marathon, pole vault and relay races were <b>all</b> revived <b>for</b> <b>this</b> final <b>edition,</b> although the 3000 metres steeplechase was dropped. Jamaica was the most successful nation, taking seventeen of the titles on offer - it was Jamaica's fourth win at the competition and the only time a host nation did not top the medal table.|$|R
