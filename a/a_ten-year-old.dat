5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as <b>a</b> <b>ten-year-old</b> boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

5000|$|Nevertheless, {{the word}} has become {{increasingly}} less vulgar and more publicly acceptable, {{an example of the}} [...] "dysphemism treadmill", wherein former vulgarities become inoffensive and commonplace.
