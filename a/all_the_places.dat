5|$|The clip starts showing Gaby Moreno {{playing a}} melody in a guitar while staying {{close to a}} window, {{watching}} the people walk on the street below. Meanwhile, scenes of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> featured on the video are interpolated. Just as the song begins, Arjona is shown leaving the Tikal ruins on an orange Jeep, as well as images of Moreno singing {{in front of a}} piano. Then, as Arjona abandons the Jeep and goes as a passenger on another vehicle, Moreno is shown singing inside a house, close to another Jeep similar to that of Arjona's. Finally, Arjona reaches the town on which Moreno has been waiting for him, just to find that she is gone to where he has been before, on the Tikal ruins. As of October 2017, the video has received over 520 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|He {{compiled}} an eight-volume Geographia covering {{what was}} known about the earth. The {{first part of the}} Geographia is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the solar system in the Almagest, Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned coordinates to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> and geographic features he knew, in a grid that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). Latitude was measured from the equator, as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than degrees of arc (the length of the midsummer day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the polar circle). He put the meridian of 0 longitude at the most western land he knew, the Canary Islands.|$|E
500|$|Production of {{the album}} began quickly with {{the writing of the}} track [...] "Politik", which was a song seen as a {{reflection}} of the world at the time, giving the band a renewed perspective on their lives and society. Many of the song lyrics on the album relate strongly to the theme of urgency. Martin has commented that previous songs were more relaxed since they were in a comfortable state of mind: [...] "Perhaps there's a bit more urgency on some of these songs. And that's born from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> we've been and the things we've experienced." [...] Martin has explained. In relation to the theme of urgency, Martin has also started that the album's title means [...] "doing something on impulse".|$|E

500|$|Finally, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) informs [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) and NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that {{he wishes}} {{to be part of}} the film Garfield 3: Feline Groovy. Dot Com and Kenneth tell Tracy that he should instead focus on his chances of getting an Oscar, as part of his EGOT quest. The two {{encourage}} him to audition for Hard To Watch, a story of an inner-city boy living in the ghetto, something that Tracy can directly relate to. Tracy decides to audition for Hard To Watch, but realizes that playing the role may bring up too many repressed memories. Dot Com and Kenneth, along with Tracy, visit <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> from Tracy's childhood in order to prepare him for the role, but this backfires when Tracy is brought to tears because of his past.|$|E
500|$|When {{crafting}} Smallvilles {{version of}} Lex Luthor, series developers Al Gough and Miles Millar {{decided that he}} would not be a precursor to the more comedic role performed by Gene Hackman in the Superman film series; the pair wanted him to be likeable and vulnerable. The role was difficult to cast, as no one involved in the casting could agree on who they liked for the role. Gough and Millar wanted to cast a comedian for the series, on the belief that comedians always want to [...] "please and be loved at the same time." [...] Michael Rosenbaum auditioned for Lex Luthor twice. Feeling he did not take his first audition seriously, Rosenbaum outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene, indicating <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> to be funny, charismatic, or menacing. His audition went so well that everyone agreed he was [...] "the guy".|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Gunn {{stated that}} the film had always been planned as a 3D film, and [...] "Unlike many directors, I've been {{actively}} involved with converting every shot to 3D, making sure it works perfectly for the story and the film, making sure it's spectacular and immersive without being silly, distracting, or overly showy." [...] Gunn also revealed that the IMAX 3D version would include shifting aspect ratios, to make the viewing experience [...] "even fuller and more encompassing. I've personally chosen <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> where the changes occur... The changing aspect ratios in this case are actually {{a part of the}} storytelling." [...] In July 2014, Gunn revealed that there were multiple scenes he had cut from the film, and he was investigating how to release them, either in an extended cut of the film, or as bonus features on the film's home media release.|$|E

500|$|Reverend Harris {{had several}} of his {{witnesses}} sent to London, where they were interviewed by Gascoyne. [...] In Newgate Prison on 9March, Gascoyne also interviewed Susannah Wells, who confirmed Hall's new version of events. [...] He then performed several interviews from 12–13March, including Fortune and Judith Natus, and a witness who could cast doubt on John Iniser's testimony. [...] Gascoyne also asked George and Lucy Squires about their travels early in 1753; George was unable to recall <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> they had visited, and so Gascoyne sent him to Dorset to help him remember. [...] Gascoyne then met with Elizabeth Long (Wells's daughter), who had been prevented by the mob from testifying for her mother, and on 23March three of Canning's former witnesses expressed to Gascoyne their doubts about the young maid's story. [...] Another witness, who swore that Squires had been in Abbotsbury in January, was interviewed two days later. [...] Gascoyne instructed him to visit Squires in Newgate, where the two recognised one another immediately.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} get the feel of an actual documentary, the {{producers}} hired cinematographer Randall Einhorn, who is known for directing episodes of Survivor, which allowed the show to have the feel of [...] "rough and jumpy" [...] like an actual documentary. According to producer Michael Schur, the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly. The producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format. For example, in the fourth-season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?," [...] a scene featured Michael going through a long process {{to go to the bathroom}} and not pass by Stanley. The producers debated whether that was possible and Einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> in time to shoot the whole scene. Despite the strict nature in the early years of the series, later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format, with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not, which also changed the writing and comedy-style of the series. This inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans.|$|E
500|$|Military {{operations}} resumed {{a fortnight}} after {{the surrender of}} Jerusalem with the final attack of this campaign. But preparations were complicated by the sodden state of the low and swampy ground on the southern banks of the Nahr el Auja where the attack would be launched. And the river was swollen by rain which had fallen on 19 and 20 December. From Mulebbis to the sea the river is between [...] wide and [...] deep except for the ford {{at the mouth of}} the river known as Sheik Muanis. To the north of the river two prominent spurs run down to the river from a series of sandy ridges. These overlooked the damaged stone bridge at Khurbet Hadrah to the east and the village of Sheik Muannis, near Jerisheh to the west where a mill dam bridged the stream. The Ottoman Eighth Army held strong commanding positions covering <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> used by the attackers in November. They held both spurs in addition to a post opposite the ford {{at the mouth of the}} Nahr el Auja. They also held a line extending east of Khurbet Hadrah which crossed to the south bank of the river to include Bald Hill and Mulebbis.|$|E

500|$|When {{the family}} arrives in Rio de Janeiro, they {{discover}} {{that they can get}} anywhere they want by joining a conga line. After dancing their way to the hotel, Bart turns on the television in their room and watches a children's show called Teleboobies which Marge criticizes because of its sexual undertones. The Simpsons then head out to search for Ronaldo. First, they travel to the slums in Rio de Janeiro. According to Lisa, [...] "The government just painted them bright colors so the tourists would not be offended." [...] In the slums, the family sees thousands of rats painted in various colors. They then reach Ronaldo's orphanage, but the nun working there has no idea where he has gone. Later that day, as the Simpsons are having dinner at a restaurant, Lisa shows a map on which she has marked <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> Ronaldo likes to visit. She splits the map in two, giving one piece to Homer and Bart and keeping one piece for her and Marge. Homer and Bart first search through Copacabana Beach and then a market, where they are robbed by children, while Marge and Lisa visit a samba school. However, both duos are unsuccessful in finding Ronaldo so far. To get to their last location, Homer and Bart take a taxi and are kidnapped at gunpoint by the taxi driver. However, Bart is able to get away and tell the rest of the family.|$|E
500|$|Gough and Millar {{had five}} months for casting, but their primary {{focus was on}} finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They {{received}} Kristin Kreuk's audition tape {{for the role of}} Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity {{to be part of the}} show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be [...] "Superman in high school", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script if he came in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was [...] "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was [...] "the guy".|$|E
