40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} distributed image sensing for network localization, dynamic routing, and load balancing in wireless sensor networks. In particular, the image sensors are first used to obtain <b>angular</b> <b>bearing</b> information between each network node {{and a set of}} other nodes, mobile agents, or targets. This data is used to construct the relative geographic topology of the network. The image sensors are then employed to make periodic measurements, which are reported to the destination via multihop routing. Nodes may also infrequently detect an event from which a set of image frames need to be reported. These high-bandwidth event reports may cause packet queues to develop at the routing nodes along paths to the destination. We propose a distributed routing scheme that employs a cost function based on location data, in-node queue sizes, and energy levels at neighboring nodes. Our scheme also implements a set of relative priority levels for the event-based and periodic data packets. Simulation results are presented and indicate improved network lifetime, lower end-to-end average and maximum delays, and significantly reduced buffer size requirements for the network nodes.

40|$|Abstract — We {{introduce}} novel localization {{techniques for}} wire-less image sensor networks. Based on visual observations between the image sensor nodes or simultaneous observations of a moving object by several nodes, the proposed schemes employ simple image processing functions to obtain <b>angular</b> <b>bearing</b> information between the nodes {{in a neighborhood}} and solve for the node positions. We will first propose a technique to localize nodes relative to a coordinate system defined by two reference nodes and propagate the topology information throughout the network. In a different scheme, we consider cases where simultaneous observations from a moving target are used by several image sensors to jointly estimate the coordinates of the nodes {{as well as those}} of the target. We will also propose a technique in which the assumption of a simple motion pattern for the target allwos for a collaborative scheme for finding relative location information between the nodes. In a fourth scheme, assistance from a moving beacon knowing its location information is used to localize a network of image sensors. The proposed algorithms are based on in-node processing and local collaboration between the nodes and hence are scalable to large networks. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed techniques. I...|$|E

40|$|Visual {{information}} a b s t r a c t In {{order to}} evaluate the role of edge lines in curve driving we examined steering behaviour {{in the face of}} unexpected gradual changes in road geometry. Experienced drivers (N = 13) operating a fixed-base driving simulator steered a car along a single-lane (3. 80 m or 7. 60 m wide) winding road. The experimental track consisted of eight 90 ! curves with radii of cur-vature varying between 75 m and 500 m, separated by 500 -m long straight line segments. The model-based nature of the simulator was used to create unexpected online changes in road geometry, implemented through a gradual displacement of one or both edge lines while drivers steered around the delineated bend. Although they regulated their speed as a function of road curvature, drivers were found to consistently cut {{into and out of the}} curves. When the edge lines did not move, drivers stabilized their lane position during the 20 !– 70 ! curve segments, adopting a position closer to the interior edge line for the nar-rower lane width and smaller radii of curvature. Motion of the interior edge line, whether inward or outward, gave rise to systematic changes in lane position, while motion of the exterior edge line did not affect driving behaviour. Overall, the results point to a visuo-motor strategy of steering based on zeroing-out changes in the rate of change of <b>angular</b> <b>bearing</b> of the tangent point. " 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The double row <b>angular</b> contact ball <b>bearing</b> supports combined axial and radial loads, provides high shaft stiffness and limits {{the movement of}} the pump impeller, shaft, and seal. Recent studies, tests, and analysis of double row ball bearings operating in various conditions have both confirmed and contradicted some long held opinions, regarding the application of these bearings in centrifugal pumps. The studies indicate the Conrad type (e. g., without filling slot) double row <b>angular</b> contact ball <b>bearings</b> operate at lower temperatures than the maximum capacity failing slot type double row bearings at 3, 600 rpm rotational speed. These lower operating temperatures result in longer bearing and lubricant life and greater pump reliability. The filling slot of the modern design maximum capacity double row bearing has been redesigned so that it seldom has direct influence n the bearing life and performance when correctly applied in the pump. Double row <b>angular</b> contact ball <b>bearings</b> having moderate to high contact angle and normal axial internal clearance operate at lower temperature and have better internal motion than bearings having lower contact angles and greater clearances in typical pump application conditions. The results and conclusions of the studies made with the double row <b>angular</b> contact ball <b>bearings</b> are discussed.

40|$|Abstract: A {{rotor system}} {{supported}} by an <b>angular</b> ball <b>bearing</b> displays very complicated non-linear behaviour due to non-linear Hertzian contact force. The non-linear force and moment {{caused by the}} ball bearing are calculated {{on the basis of}} the relationship between deflection, and five-degree-of-freedom dynamic equations of the rotor ball bearing system are established. The Newmark-β method and the Newton–Raphson method are used to solve the non-linear equations. The dynamic characteristics of <b>angular</b> ball <b>bearings</b> are computed, considering the non-linear vibration of the rotor system. Taking <b>angular</b> ball <b>bearing</b> QJS 208 ACQ 4 C 1 /HNP 4 as an example, the effects of the vibration of the rotor system on bearing dynamic characteristics are analysed. The results show that the spin-to-roll ratio of balls, the slide ratio of the cage, and stiffness of the bearing all vary obviously with the non-periodic vibration range of the rotor; initial contact angle and axial load of the ball bearing change the non-linear dynamic nature of the rotor system and dynamic characteristics of the bearing. The rotor ball bearing system can work stably by choosing the structural and operation parameters reasonably...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>angular</b> contact ball <b>bearing</b> uses axially {{asymmetric}} races. An {{axial load}} passes {{in a straight}} line through the bearing, whereas a radial load takes an oblique path that tends to want to separate the races axially. So the angle of contact on the inner race is the same as that on the outer race. <b>Angular</b> contact <b>bearings</b> better support [...] "combined loads" [...] (loading in both the radial and axial directions) and the contact angle of the bearing should be matched to the relative proportions of each. The larger the contact angle (typically in the range 10 to 45 degrees), the higher the axial load supported, but the lower the radial load. In high speed applications, such as turbines, jet engines, and dentistry equipment, the centrifugal forces generated by the balls changes the contact angle at the inner and outer race. Ceramics such as silicon nitride are now regularly used in such applications due to their low density (40% of steel). These materials significantly reduce centrifugal force and function well in high temperature environments. They also tend to wear in a similar way to bearing steel—rather than cracking or shattering like glass or porcelain.|$|R
