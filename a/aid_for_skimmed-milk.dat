We apply a multi-country {{computable general equilibrium}} model, to analyze if <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade offers the possibility that, instead of the developing and least developed countries’ being worse off—as so many were {{as the result of}} the last round of trade negotiations—they will actually be better off. Alternative <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade scenarios have been evaluated in terms of effectiveness and equity. Our findings show that <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade policies expand trade and alleviate inequalities.

40|$|Summary Although {{the concept}} of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade has quickly gained {{prominence}} among aid donors as well as aid recipients, relatively {{little is known about}} its impact on trade-related performance. We use data on a large subset of developing countries for recent years to examine the extent to which various types of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade have helped recipient countries' trade performance. We find that <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade facilitation reduces the costs of trading. Moreover <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade has an overall positive and significant impact on exports. This effect is entirely driven by aid to economic infrastructure, while the other main category of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade, <b>aid</b> to productive capacity, has no discernible effect on exports. Its strong positive association with exports at the sectoral level is due to an allocation skewed toward already well performing sectors. <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade <b>aid</b> effectiveness trade cost of trading exports...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade in promoting trade – both exports and imports – and conditions which tend to make it most effective. The review provides abundant {{evidence to suggest that}} <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade is indeed broadly correlated with increases in trade. <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> trade works best when it is focused on reducing the costs of trading through improvements in infrastructure, trade facilitation, trade-related public institutions (such as customs, standards administration, and export promotion), and polices (including eliminating policy barriers to competition). <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> trade – in varying forms – directed to low income countries is particularly helpful in promoting trade. Analysis in this chapter suggests that <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade destined to low and lower-middle income countries is likely to have a high pay-off. Typically, one dollar invested in <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade is associated with an increase of nearly USD 8 of exports from all developing countries – while one dollar of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade to International Development Association (IDA) -eligible poorest countries amounted to US 20 in new exports and to USD 9 for all low and lower-middle income countries...|$|R
40|$|System Staff Salary {{subsystem}} {{has been}} used to collect employee counts for the calculation of several school district allotments: additional state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> professional salaries, additional state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> staff salary increases, additional state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> school employee health benefits, and a salary allotment for professional staff. House Bill 3646, 81 st Legislature, 2009, repealed the TEC, § 42. 2512, related to additional state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> professional salaries; § 42. 2514, related to additional state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> school employee health benefits; and § 42. 2516 (b) (2), related to the salary allotment for professional staff. As a result, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) no longer uses the Staff Salary subsystem to collect the number of full‐time classroom teachers, full‐time counselors, full‐ time librarians, or full‐time registered nurses for these purposes. Funding related to the repealed provisions is now included in “revenue at the compressed tax rate ” (RACR), a component of the foundation funding formula known as Additional State <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> Tax Reduction (ASATR). The TEC, § 42. 2513, related to additional state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> staff salary increases, and the related provisions in the TEC, § 22. 107, remain in law, however, and provide <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> salaries of nonprofessional staff (the "staff salary allotment " 1).

It develops ten measures of trade performance and capacity (including trade-related infrastructure, institutions, and incentives) to assess potential demand, and then looks at country allocations of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade to see which are receiving below-average amounts in the supply of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade – relative to their potential demand. Countries, as they design national development strategies, may wish to consider giving greater attention to trade in country strategies and requesting that donors allocate to them more <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade. As part of the analysis, the paper provides a conceptual framework for selecting indicators of trade performance and its policy determinants that the WTO and its partners might monitor closely as part of the <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade initiative...|$|R

40|$|There are few {{empirical}} studies assessing {{the effectiveness of}} <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade as regards trade performance. Furthermore, existing work does not test which are the channels through which <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade {{has an impact on}} trade performance. We address this question using a two-step empirical analysis. Relying on an export performance model, we first test whether institutions and infrastructure, our two potential channels of transmission, are significant determinants of export performance. Second, we test the impact of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade sectoral flows on the previously detected determinants of export performance. We show, as part of the first step, that the infrastructure channel is a highly significant determinant of export performance, whereas the institutional channel turns out to have a limited positive impact on developing countries’ export performance. Furthermore, we show, from the second step, that <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> infrastructure, once instrumented, has a strong and positive impact on the infrastructure level. As a result, we find that a ten per cent increase in <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> infrastructure commitments per capita in developing countries leads to an average 2. 34 per cent increase in the exports over GDP ratio. It is also equivalent to a 2. 71 per cent reduction in tariff and nontariff barriers. These results highlight the high potential impact of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade on developing countries’ export performance throughout the infrastructure channel...|$|R
5000|$|The AIDS fundraiser, an {{elaborate}} drag show [...] "beauty" [...] pageant that features amateur performers as beauty contestants, {{evolved from a}} small event in a private apartment in 1989 to successively larger theaters to hold the growing audiences. In the 1990s, the Wilshire Ebell Theatre was used, followed by the historic Orpheum Theatre in downtown Los Angeles, which seats 1,800. A small group of friends in West Hollywood created the original show, Battle for the Tiara, a farcical beauty pageant aimed at raising funds for AIDS assistance through <b>Aid</b> <b>For</b> AIDS that was featured in an award-winning documentary in 1998, Battle For the Tiara. The original <b>Aid</b> <b>For</b> AIDS fundraiser ran for 11 years. Following the death of its founder, Alexis Pittman, the original group took two years off. During the interim years, {{a version of the}} fundraiser named Quest for the Crown was produced by non-profit <b>Aid</b> <b>For</b> AIDS, the beneficiary. The original group returned to helm the show <b>for</b> executive producer <b>Aid</b> <b>For</b> AIDS in 2003 with the currently-named production, Best In Drag Show.
