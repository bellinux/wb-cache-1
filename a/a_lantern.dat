5|$|One pendant, {{shaped like}} <b>a</b> <b>lantern</b> {{with a tiny}} Crucifixion inside, was made in 16th-century Mexico, and from {{comparison}} with other pieces may originally have included Mexican feather work, a Pre-Columbian art whose craftspeople the Spanish missionaries employed in workshops for export luxury objects.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{detailed}} wind tunnel tests Wilbur traveled to Chicago at Chanute's invitation {{to give a}} lecture to the Western Society of Engineers on September 18, 1901. He presented a thorough report about the 1900–01 glider experiments and complemented his talk with <b>a</b> <b>lantern</b> slide show of photographs. Wilbur's speech was the first public account of the brothers' experiments. A report {{was published in the}} Journal of the society, which was then separately published as an offprint titled Some Aeronautical Experiments in a 300 copy edition.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Jon's direwolf Ghost behaves strangely, {{prompting}} Jon {{to investigate}} Mormont's quarters. As Jon enters, he is attacked {{by one of}} the dead rangers, returned to life as a wight. The undead monster is immune to Jon's sword, continuing to attack even after being run through and losing an arm. As Mormont enters, Jon throws <b>a</b> <b>lantern</b> at the wight, setting the wight ablaze and finally destroying it. The next morning, Mormont and the Night's Watch burn the two bodies, and Sam tells them that he read that corpses touched by the White Walkers are reanimated and can only be killed by fire.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, Isaac Beeckman {{proposed}} {{an experiment in}} which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei {{proposed an}} experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering <b>a</b> <b>lantern</b> and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. In 1667, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about onemile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microseconds.|$|E

Jordan, as <b>a</b> Green <b>Lantern,</b> has exceptional willpower.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to a skylight is <b>a</b> roof <b>lantern.</b> <b>A</b> roof <b>lantern</b> is <b>a</b> daylighting cupola that sits above a roof, {{as opposed to a}} skylight which is fitted into a roof's construction. Roof lanterns serve as both an architectural feature and a method of introducing natural light into a space, and are typically wooden or metal structures with a number of glazed glass panels.|$|R
5|$|Unlike in {{previous}} games, magical abilities are learned with {{the acquisition of}} a new weapon, giving each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired: the Bow of Apollo, the Head of Helios, and the Boots of Hermes. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios can be used as <b>a</b> <b>lantern</b> in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after, Gaudí {{received}} an important new commission from Güell: {{the construction of}} his family house, in the Carrer Nou de la Rambla in Barcelona. The Palau Güell (1886–1888) continues the tradition of large Catalan urban mansions {{such as those in}} Carrer Montcada. Gaudí designed a monumental entrance with a magnificent parabolic arch above iron gates, decorated with the Catalan coat of arms and a helmet with a winged dragon, the work of Joan Oñós. A notable feature is the triple-height entrance hall; it is the core of the building, surrounded by the main rooms of the palace, and it is remarkable for its double dome, parabolic within and conical on the outside, a solution typical of Byzantine art. For the gallery on the street facade Gaudí used an original system of catenary arches and columns with hyperbolic capitals, a style he used only here. He designed the interior of the palace with a sumptuous Mudejar-style decoration, where the wood and iron coffered ceilings stand out. The chimneys on the roof are a remarkable feature, faced in vividly coloured ceramic tiles, as is the tall spire in the form of <b>a</b> <b>lantern</b> tower, which is the external termination of the dome within, and is also faced with ceramic tiles and topped with an iron weather vane.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with <b>a</b> <b>lantern.</b> She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|Latrobe {{originally}} planned a masonry dome with <b>a</b> <b>lantern</b> on top, but his friend Thomas Jefferson suggested a wooden double-shell dome (of a type pioneered by French master builder Philibert Delorme) with 24 half-visible skylights. For the inner dome Latrobe created a solid, classically detailed masonry hemisphere. Grids of plaster rosettes adorn its coffered ceiling.|$|E
