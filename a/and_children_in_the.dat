5|$|Al-Balawi, 32, was a Jordanian {{doctor who}} worked at a clinic for Palestinian refugee women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marka refugee camp near Amman, Jordan. He was an al-Qaeda sympathizer {{from the town of}} Zarqa, the {{hometown}} of Jordanian militant Islamist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He was married and had two daughters. Islamist websites, as well as some newspapers, characterized the attacker as a triple agent, someone who is believed to be a double agent by the intelligence organization he infiltrates.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{founding}} the congregation grew very slowly; by 1908 {{there were still}} only 37 members, and 16 children in the religious school. By 1918, membership had fallen to 24, <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> religious school to 10. That year the synagogue's total income was $800 (today $).|$|E
5|$|The War Brides Act of 1945, and {{subsequent}} Alien Fiancées and Fiancés Act of 1946, continued to apply {{until the end}} of 1953, allowing veterans of the Regiment, and other Filipino American veterans, to return to the Philippines to bring back fiancées, wives, <b>and</b> <b>children.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> years following the war, some sixteen thousand Filipinas entered the United States as war brides. These new Filipino American families formed a second generation of Filipino Americans, significantly expanding the Filipino American community.|$|E

5|$|Tibbets {{was awarded}} the Distinguished Service Cross by Spaatz {{immediately}} after landing on Tinian. He became a celebrity, with pictures and interviews of his wife <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major American newspapers. He {{was seen as a}} national hero who had ended the war with Japan. Tibbets later received an invitation from President Harry S. Truman to visit the White House. The 509th Composite Group was awarded an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Although {{instrumental}} in drafting the Treaty of Vereeniging, Reitz personally {{did not want}} to swear allegiance to the British government, and he chose to go into exile. On 4 July 1902 he left South Africa and joined his wife <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. To alleviate his financial troubles, Reitz set out on a lecture tour in the United States. Due to a waning interest in the Boer cause now that the war was over, the tour failed, forcing Reitz to return to the Netherlands. Here his health failed him again, leading to hospitalisation and an extensive period of convalescing. During this time he was supported by his friends W.J. Leyds and H.P.N. Muller and the Nederlandsch Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging (Dutch South-African Society).|$|E
5|$|Anne {{was buried}} beside her husband <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Henry VII Chapel on the South Aisle of Westminster Abbey on 24 August. The Electress Sophia had died on 28 May, {{two months before}} Anne, so the Electress's son, George, Elector of Hanover, {{inherited}} the British Crown pursuant to the Act of Settlement 1701. The possible Catholic claimants, including Anne's half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, were ignored. The Elector's accession was relatively stable: a Jacobite rising in 1715 failed. Marlborough was re-instated, and the Tory ministers were replaced by Whigs.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Jacques became a nurse in the VAD; she served in a mobile unit in London, attending bombed sites during the Blitz. After a reorganisation in the VAD, Jacques sought new work and, in the summer of 1943, she became a welder in a factory in north London, a job that lasted {{until the end of the}} year. Around this time she became romantically involved with an American soldier, Major Charles Kearney. Jacques later claimed that the pair had been engaged and that Kearney had been killed in action, although her biographer, Andy Merriman, discovered that Kearney had a wife <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States when he had proposed to Jacques, and had returned to them after the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 Muller {{travelled}} to the United States {{himself to}} mobilise support from President Theodore Roosevelt, especially {{on behalf of}} the women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British concentration camps. He also held public lectures all around the country. While visiting Mexico, news reached Muller about the Peace of Vereeniging, making him jobless. Muller took the opportunity to turn his American journey into an expedition. On his return to the Netherlands in 1903 he published a book about it. In the {{years after the end of}} the South African War Muller maintained his interest in South Africa and the Afrikaners, both personally and professionally. In 1904 he supported the Steyn family when they were in Europe for the President's recovery of a debilitating illness. Until his death Muller was active for the Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond and the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging.|$|E
5|$|Narseh sent an {{ambassador}} to Galerius to plead {{for the return}} of his wives <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of the war, but Galerius dismissed him. Serious peace negotiations began in the spring of 299. The magister memoriae (secretary) of Diocletian and Galerius, Sicorius Probus, was sent to Narseh to present terms. The conditions of the resulting Peace of Nisibis were heavy: Armenia returned to Roman domination, with the fort of Ziatha as its border; Caucasian Iberia would pay allegiance to Rome under a Roman appointee; Nisibis, now under Roman rule, would become the sole conduit for trade between Persia and Rome; and Rome would exercise control over the five satrapies between the Tigris and Armenia: Ingilene, Sophanene (Sophene), Arzanene (Aghdznik), Corduene (Carduene), and Zabdicene (near modern Hakkâri, Turkey). These regions included the passage of the Tigris through the Anti-Taurus range; the Bitlis pass, the quickest southerly route into Persian Armenia; and access to the Tur Abdin plateau.|$|E

5|$|Norgrove {{was removed}} from the scene via {{helicopter}} and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are in danger of being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Notable post-war artists {{included}} Robin Philipson (1916–92), who {{was influenced}} by the Colourists, but also Pop Art and neo-Romanticism. Robert MacBryde (1913–66), Robert Colquhoun (1914–64) and Joan Eardley (1921–63), were all graduates of the Glasgow School of Art. MacBryde and Colquhoun were influenced by neo-Romanticism and the Cubism of Adler. The English-born Eardley moved to Glasgow and explored the landscapes of Kincardineshire coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets. Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the St Ives School were Wilhelmina Barns-Graham (1912–2004) and Margaret Mellis (1914–2009).|$|E

25|$|The Thebans planned {{their defense}} in the {{following}} manner. They emancipated their slaves and faced them towards {{that part of the}} Macedonian force which drove towards the wall itself.

25|$|Unwilling to {{surrender}} themselves to military authority {{most of the}} tribal warriors refused the offer of protection, leaving only about 75 men, plus all the women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village. The men who remained were mostly too old or too young to hunt. Black Kettle flew an American flag, with a white flag tied beneath it, over his lodge, as the Fort Lyon commander had advised him.

25|$|The Zapatista story {{remained}} in headlines {{for a number}} of years.

This allowed many media outlets in Mexico to step up their criticisms of the government. However, the massacre was not carried out by the government but by civilians, demonstrating how the emergence of the Zapatista movement had divided indigenous groups.|$|E
