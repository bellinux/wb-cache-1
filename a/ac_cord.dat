While at McCune John first realized his idea of a fully integrated loudspeaker system. The system was built for Creedence Clearwater Revival's last tour. It was a fully integrated tri-amped, horn-loaded system with processing electronics. Three amps were built into a rack mountable enclosure that would drive two speakers. The enclosure also included preset cross-overs and equalization. The outside of the enclosure was simple: an <b>AC</b> <b>cord,</b> input connectors, and 4-pin connectors that plugged into the loudspeakers. The original model did not have level controls or a power switch.|$|E

Parameters of the gas that should be amended to allow the engine to be powered were listed. Also were shown ways of changing these parameters. Necessary engine modifications to be able to supply it with wood gas were presented. The article finishes with conclusions and ri sks resulting from t he use of t his technology and also possible impact on the environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} three decades Synchrotron {{radiation}} became an indispensable experimental tool for chemical and structural analysis of nano scaled properties in solid state physics, chemistry, materials science and life science thereby rendering the explanation of the macroscopic behavior of the materials and systems under investigation. Especially the techniques known as Anomalous Small Angle X ray Scattering provide deep insight into the materials structural architecture <b>ac</b> <b>cording</b> to the different chemical components on lengths scales starting just above the atomic scale amp; 8776; 1 nm up to sev eral 100 nm. The techniques sensitivity to the different chemical components makes use of the energy dependence of the atomic scattering factors, which are different for all chemical elements, thereby disentangling the nanostructure of the different chemical components by the signature of the elemental X ray absorption edges i. e. by employing synchro tron radiation. The paper wants to focus on the application of an algorithm from linear algebra in the field of synchro tron radiation. It provides a closer look to the algebraic prerequisites, which govern the system of linear equations es tablished by these experimental techniques and its solution by solving the eigenvector problem. The pair correlation functions of the so called basic scattering functions are expressed as a linear combination of eigenvector...|$|R
