5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, <b>and</b> <b>challenged</b> them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base.

Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle.

5|$|During {{the period}} 1868–1876, Sitting Bull {{developed}} {{into the most}} important of Native American political leaders. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brulé, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources <b>and</b> <b>challenged</b> Native American independence.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – To justify an {{increase}} in information technology (IT) spending and to understand utilization of limited organizational resources on IT, the correlation between IT and business performance has been {{of great interest to}} business managers. However, business managers face issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> in finding out how and to what extent IT is able to deliver the intended benefits. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine IT evaluation issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> faced by information systems (IS) researchers, IS specialists, and business managers. Design/methodology/approach – This paper begins by reviewing the disparate discussions in past literature on IT evaluation issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges.</b> It then provides a synthesis of the disparate discussions by identifying eight issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> in IT evaluation. Findings – The eight issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> identified are: evaluation scope, evaluation timing, unit of analysis, level of analysis, different perspectives, different dimensions, different measures, and underpinning theoretical frameworks. It concludes with some suggestions on ways to improve IT evaluation practices. Originality/value – This paper posits that before a pragmatic IT evaluation approach can be developed, it is necessary to first understand the issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> faced by IS researchers, IS specialists, and business managers in IT evaluation. Having identified the eight issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges,</b> this paper provides pointers on what needs to be considered when conducting IT evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Business Intelligence (BI) has {{embarked}} on decision-making setting. This has influenced many organizations from different industries that are located in diverse regions to implement BI. Critical Successful Factors (CSF) becomes the guideline for the implementer to adopt BI successfully. However, lack of BI knowledge and weak consideration of BI CSF led {{to the failure of}} BI implementation project. Several issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> have been identified during the BI implementation. In addition, other researchers rarely discussed this subject. Thus, the objective {{of this paper is to}} recognize the issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> on BI implementation. Through qualitative method, BI practices systematically described the purpose of BI execution on selected organizations, industries and regions. It has given the path towards the issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> of BI implementation. The identified issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> are defining the business goal, data management, limited funding, training and user acceptance as well as the lack of expertise issues. The findings categorized the issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> into three dimensions of CSF for BI implementation, which are Organization, Process and Technology dimension.

40|$|Abstract:-As cloud {{computing}} continues {{to gain more}} momentum in the IT industry, more issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> are being reported by academics and practitioners. In this paper, we aim to attain {{an understanding of the}} types of issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> that have been emerging over the past years and identify gaps between the focus of the literature and what practitioners deem important. Researchers have been mainly focusing on issues related to security and privacy, infrastructure, and data management. Despite the significant overlap between the topics being discussed in the literature and the issues raised by the practitioners, findings show that some issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> that practitioners consider important are understudied such as software related issues, <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> pertaining to learning fast-evolving technologies...|$|R
5|$|A year later, he {{was elected}} to the Netherlands' {{national}} parliament, but his first four years in parliament drew little attention. However, his appointment in 2002 as a public spokesman for the VVD led Wilders to become more well known for his outspoken criticism of Islamic extremism. Tensions immediately developed within the party, as Wilders found himself to be to the right of most members, <b>and</b> <b>challenged</b> the party line in his public statements. He was expelled from the VVD parliamentary party, and in September 2004, Wilders left the VVD, having been a member since 1989, to form his own political party, Groep Wilders, later renamed the Party for Freedom. The crunch issue with the VVD party line was about his refusal to endorse the party's position that European Union accession negotiations must be started with Turkey.|$|E
5|$|According to Jain texts, Bahubali {{was born}} to Rishabhanatha and Sunanda during the Ikshvaku dynasty in Ayodhya. He {{is said to have}} excelled in {{studying}} medicine, archery, floriculture, and the knowledge of precious gems. Bahubali had a son named Somakirti (also known as Mahabala). When Rishabhanatha decided to become a monk, he distributed his kingdom among his 100 sons. Bharata was gifted the kingdom of Vinita (Ayodhya) and Bahubali got the kingdom of Asmaka from South India, having Podanapur as its capital. After winning six divisions of earth in all directions (digvijaya), Bharata proceeded to his capital Ayodhyapuri with a huge army and divine chakra-ratna—spinning, disk-like super weapon with serrated edges. But the chakra-ratna stopped on its own at the entrance of Ayodhyapuri, signalling to the emperor that his 99 brothers have yet not submitted to his authority. Bharata's 98 brothers became Jain monks' and submitted their kingdoms to him. Bahubali was endowed with the final and superior body of extraordinary sturdiness and strength (vajra-ṛṣabhanārācasaṃhanana) like Bharata. He hurled open defiance at the chakravartin <b>and</b> <b>challenged</b> him to a fight.|$|E

5|$|Angered {{over his}} electoral loss, Randolph harangued anti-Harrison supporters, even {{challenging}} {{one to a}} duel. He was stabbed three times, but recovered <b>and</b> <b>challenged</b> Jennings in his bid for reelection in 1810. Harrison came out to personally stump on Randolph's behalf. Jennings focused on the slavery issue and tied Randolph to Harrison's continued attempts to legalize the institution. The congressional election coincided with the first popular election of delegates to the territorial legislature. In 1809, a year prior to the election, the territory's pro-slavery faction suffered a significant setback when Illinois was separated from the Indiana Territory, cutting Harrison off from his supporters in the western portion of the territory. Harrison suggested that Jennings further expanded his political base by stumping among the disaffected French residents of the territory. Jennings's defeat of Randolph in 1810 repudiated Harrison's pro-slavery policies. Following his triumph in the election, Jennings's and his anti-slavery allies were successful in enacting a legislative agenda that limited the territorial governor's authority and repealed an 1805 act regarding indentured service.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, <b>and</b> <b>challenged</b> them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship. In Tamil, the word Arunam means red or fire and Asalam means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the town. The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar.|$|E
