Jenna is regularly portrayed as manipulative, vain, amoral, catty and emotionally abusive to her friends and coworkers. In [...] "The Ones", Pete suspects that Jenna might be a sociopath, after she repeatedly poisons Kenneth with strawberries, to date an attractive emergency medical technician. This is backed up in the episode [...] "Stride of Pride", when she asks Jack [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>alright</b> Jack? <b>You</b> look like that flashcard that they told me means sadness." ...|$|R

I cannot sleep well for thinking of those dear children. The house was knocked to fragments and up to the 8th, 31 dead bodies were found. Hundreds of people have been to see where they stood. But the mill, which was built of large stone, turned the flood on one side and <b>is</b> still <b>alright.</b> <b>You</b> may conject what a flood, 25 feet deep, came rushing down and swept all away.
