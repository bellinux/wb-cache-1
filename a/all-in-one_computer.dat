2500|$|In 1998, Apple {{introduced}} its new iMac which, like the original 128K Mac, was an <b>all-in-one</b> <b>computer.</b> Its translucent plastic case, originally Bondi blue and later various additional colors, {{is considered an}} industrial design landmark of the late 1990s. The iMac did away with most of Apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as SCSI and ADB, in favor of two USB ports. It replaced a floppy disk drive with a CD-ROM drive for installing software, but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without external third-party hardware. The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 139 days. It made the company an annual profit of US$309million, Apple's first profitable year since Michael Spindler took over as CEO in 1995. This aesthetic {{was applied to the}} Power Macintosh and later the iBook, Apple's first consumer-level laptop computer, filling the missing quadrant of Apple's [...] "four-square product matrix" [...] (desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals).

40|$|Reverse {{transcription}} quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) {{is a key}} {{method for}} measurement of relative gene expression. Analysis of RT-qPCR data requires many iterative computations for data normalization and analytical optimization. Currently no computer program for RT-qPCR data analysis is suitable for analytical optimization and user-controllable customization based on data quality, experimental design as well as specific research aims. Here I introduce an <b>all-in-one</b> <b>computer</b> program, SASqPCR, for robust and rapid analysis of RT-qPCR data in SAS. This program has multiple macros for assessment of PCR efficiencies, validation of reference genes, optimization of data normalizers, normalization of confounding variations across samples, and statistical comparison of target gene expression in parallel samples. Users can simply change the macro variables to test various analytical strategies, optimize results and customize the analytical processes. In addition, it is highly automatic and functionally extendable. Thus users are the actual decision-makers controlling RT-qPCR data analyses.
