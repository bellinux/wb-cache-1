5|$|Some historians {{argue that}} the British government's {{decision}} reflected what James Gelvin, Professor of Middle Eastern History at UCLA, calls 'patrician anti-Semitism' in the overestimation of Jewish power in both the United States and Russia. American Zionism was still in its infancy; in 1914 the Zionist Federation had a small budget of about $5,000 and only 12,000 members, despite an <b>American</b> <b>Jewish</b> population of three million. But the Zionist organizations had recently succeeded, following {{a show of force}} within the <b>American</b> <b>Jewish</b> community, in arranging a Jewish congress to debate the Jewish problem as a whole. This impacted British and French government estimates of the balance of power within the <b>American</b> <b>Jewish</b> public.|$|E

40|$|<b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> {{assimilation}} in the United States {{is considered}} a finished, and successful, project. This narrative of successful assimilation {{is used as a}} foundational example of enculturation in the United States in numerous bodies of study, including whiteness studies, cultural studies, and Jewish studies. The usage of <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> male experience as the basis of this narrative creates the notion that <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> women achieved assimilation through their male counterparts. Though this metonymic usage of male experience for all <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> experience has largely gone uncontested in scholarship, a plethora of <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> women's writing has emerged contemporarily in which this centering of Jewish male experience is being questioned. In these texts [...] visual and written [...] ghostly and strange happenings suggest that for some <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> women assimilation may be an ongoing project and that new tools of understanding are necessary to understand their stories, so different from the already sedimented male narratives of the <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> assimilation story. In this project, memoir (Prozac Nation by Elizabeth Wurtzel), fiction (Empathy by Sarah Schulman), and television drama (The L Word by Ilene Chaiken) created by <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> women writers is examined in order to re-imagine narratives of <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> assimilation. With the use of theory from a variety of bodies of study as well as <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> women's fiction produced before and after World War II, <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> assimilation is illuminated as an ongoing project in which some <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> women inhabit the identity of strangers. The strangers encountered here illuminate not only the failings of assimilation, and its attendant narratives, but also resistances to assimilation and its violence's. Further, the encounter with strange characters in the process of assimilating created by <b>Jewish</b> <b>American</b> women imagined to be successfully "Americanized," provides insight into the necessary tools of discipline and normalization in the construction of citizenship and belonging in the United States...|$|R

5|$|Her first {{acknowledgement}} on {{the national}} level was her appointment in 1919 to honorary vice president of the <b>American</b> <b>Jewish</b> Congress (AJC). Traditionally, the AJC leadership were more focused on European Jews than worldwide outreach and were of the aristocratic, wealthy, Reform tradition. By 1919 the organization had become more diverse and while not necessarily embracing the more radical aspects of Zionism, leaders allowed Zionist views to be expressed. Silverman, as an honorary official, could use the status to her advantage: while not officially speaking for the organization, she tacitly had AJC endorsement and was able to parlay that into support from the masses for causes and monetary contributions from elites.|$|E

5|$|Most synagogues of Kraków were ruined during World War II by the Nazis who despoiled them of all {{ceremonial}} objects, {{and used}} them as storehouses for ammunition, firefighting equipment, as general storage facilities and stables.

Poland was the only Eastern Bloc country to allow free Jewish aliyah without visas or exit permits upon the conclusion of World War II. By contrast, Stalin forcibly kept Soviet Jews in the USSR, as agreed to in the Yalta Conference. In recent time, thanks to efforts of the local Jewish and Polish organisations including foreign financial aid from the <b>American</b> <b>Jewish</b> Joint Distribution Committee, many synagogues underwent major restorations and serve religious and tourist purposes.|$|E
