5|$|Cook County {{homeowners are}} {{eligible}} for a property-tax break on their primary residence, but a manager in Assessor's office was granted the homeowner's exemption on two homes. In 2012 Cook County Inspector General Blanchard subpoenaed the Assessor's office seeking documents related to the exemptions. Berrios ignored the subpoena, claiming that the County Inspector General has no authority over him. Blanchard filed suit against Berrios. Berrios is represented in the suit by Cook County State's Attorney Alvarez. On January, 15, 2014, a Cook County circuit court judge ruled that the County Inspector General {{had the authority to}} investigate the <b>Assessor</b> and all other independently elected County offices. On August 21, 2014, the judge ruled the <b>Assessor</b> must comply with the Inspector General's subpoena. On December 1, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Cook County Inspector General has the power to investigate the Cook County <b>Assessor,</b> affirming two lower court decisions.|$|E

40|$|Summary: This study {{intends to}} extend the {{applicability}} of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to software process assessments. Recently an AHP approach has been successfully applied to software process assessments especially with regard to boundary problems, ambiguities between two adjacent ratings. Boundary problems may cause a problem in the process of inter-rater agreement for a process attribute rating among <b>assessors.</b> However, the approach assumes that the <b>assessors</b> reach a consensus for priorities of the associated practices. When <b>assessors</b> cannot reach a priority consensus, a more systematic method is required to make a consensus among those <b>assessors</b> having different sets of priorities. In order to solve this problem, this study proposes a consolidating method among conflicting <b>assessors</b> using compatibility metric of the AHP, and shows its application steps...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Risk {{attitudes and}} {{personality}} traits are known predictors {{of decision making}} among laypersons, but very little is known of their influence among experts participating in organizational decision making. Methods: Seventy-five European medical <b>assessors</b> were assessed in a field study using the Domain Specific Risk Taking scale and the Big Five Inventory scale. <b>Assessors</b> rated {{the risks and benefits}} for a mock “clinical dossier” specific to their area of expertise, and ordinal regression models were used to assess the odds of risk attitude or personality traits in predicting either the benefit or the risk ratings. Results: An increase in the “conscientiousness” score predicted an increase in the perception of the drug’s benefit, and male <b>assessors</b> gave higher scores for the drug’s benefit ratings than did female <b>assessors.</b> Extraverted <b>assessors</b> saw fewer risks, and <b>assessors</b> with a perceived neutral-averse or averse risk profile saw greater risks. Conclusions: Medical <b>assessors</b> perceive the benefits and risks of medicines via a complex interplay of the medical situation, their personality traits and even their gender.

Sensory analysis. Methodology. Evaluation of food products by method using scales. To make sensory profile of dairy product (cheese). Material and methods: the study’s was done at Food Safety and Animal Hygiene department in LVA and at Sensory Analysis Laboratory in KTU Food Institute. There were analysed 4 cheeses sensory analyses, done each of cheese comparable analysis and made profile. The <b>assessors</b> group were made from 7 students of LVA. This group selected in 2004 at KTU Food Institute and trained, but they didn’t have sensory analysis skills. At <b>assessors</b> screening was using these methods: ageusia, matching and ranking tests. At first <b>assessors</b> group was rating general cheeses appearance, odour and taste, consistency in 5 scoring. Then <b>assessors</b> group analysed the cheeses by earlier chosen and discussed attributes, used scales those attributes intensity to rate. From receive information were made sensory profile. To know consumers’ opinion about cheeses was used acceptability test. Results: the sensory analyses methods review showed, that sensory analyses methods are widely usable for different food products group attributes and theirs difference characterize. To do sensory analyses without special documentation concrete test we must to have selected <b>assessors</b> group. The <b>assessors</b> done sensory profile of 4 cheeses, analysis showed, that by rating attributes cheeses were very different. Quantitatively most intensive odour and taste attribute had 4 and 3 cheeses, which were most acceptability for consumers in 100 mm scale rank their acceptability.

This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor, and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the job.
