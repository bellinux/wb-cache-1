40|$|Given {{the current}} state of technology, the {{existing}} resource supplies, and environmental constraints, we examine how much shale oil could be profitably produced in the Western United States, what processes would be used, and which constraints would be binding in long-run equilibrium. Using an activity analysis model, we show that production of over 15 million barrels of shale oil per day (five-sixths of present U. S. oil consumption) is a profitable <b>activity</b> <b>when</b> the <b>price</b> of oil is $ 18 per barrel (1975 dollars). In testing the sensitivity of our results, we find that, even under quite conservative assumptions, production of two million barrels per day is economically feasible in the long run <b>when</b> the selling <b>price</b> of oil exceeds $ 12 per barrel. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of house prices in UK {{business}} cycles since the mid- 1950 s. First a Markov-switching common factor model is constructed to capture business cycle co-movements and the inherently different regimes across expansion and recession phases. Then house-price variables are incorporated into the baseline model to evaluate their importance in fluctuations of real economic <b>activity.</b> <b>When</b> house <b>prices</b> are introduced into the model as direct determinants {{of the evolution of}} individual macroeconomic indicators, only their declines have nontrivial effects on the movements of the macro variables and consequently on business cycles. Alternatively, <b>when</b> house <b>prices</b> are incorporated as factors affecting transition probabilities, strong evidence is found that house prices significantly affect the transitions of the UK economy between periods of expansion and recession. It is confirmed again that declines in house prices are more significant than their increases in house-price growth rates as factors affecting the business cycles. Finally, the importance of house price decreases is found robust to the inclusion of financial variables in the model and to the use of a different house price index. clos...|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>prices</b> are falling, {{consumers}} {{have an incentive}} to delay purchases and consumption until prices fall further, which in turn reduces overall economic <b>activity.</b> <b>When</b> purchases are delayed, productive capacity is idled and investment falls, leading to further reductions in aggregate demand. This is the deflationary spiral. An answer to falling aggregate demand is economic stimulus to increase demand, either from the central bank, by expanding the money supply, or by the fiscal authority, by increasing public spending or decreasing or deferring taxes (see fiscal multiplier).|$|R

50|$|The use of Bollinger Bands {{varies widely}} among traders.

Moreover, the use of Bollinger Bands is not {{confined}} to stock traders; options traders, most notably implied volatility traders, often sell options when Bollinger Bands are historically far apart or buy options when the Bollinger Bands are historically close together, in both instances, expecting volatility to revert towards the average historical volatility level for the stock.|$|R

40|$|Politicians {{dealing with}} the "farm problem " {{sometimes}} lament that output increases <b>when</b> <b>prices</b> go up and <b>when</b> <b>prices</b> go down. This article presents three possible theoretical explanations. In the first, farmers deplete soil (over-farm) <b>when</b> <b>prices</b> are low and imperfect capital markets prevent borrowing. In the second, farmers in financial stress (low prices) allocate more family labor to farming to meet debt-repayment constraints. In the third, wealth held in farmland tends to decline as prices decline. With decreasing absolute risk aversion, this increases risk aversion which, in extreme cases, causes negative supply response.

40|$|Loyalty and {{fairness}} are major research topics in the marketing literature. However, research examining how customer loyalty {{and fairness}} perceptions affect {{each other is}} lacking. This study examines these two topics {{in the context of}} a retailer increasing its prices, develops hypotheses, and tests these hypotheses using an experimental design approach. Results indicate that loyalty has a positive effect on fairness perceptions <b>when</b> <b>price</b> increases are low, though no such effect is found <b>when</b> <b>price</b> increases are high. Also, justifiable reasons for price increases lead to increased fairness perceptions <b>when</b> <b>price</b> increases are low, but any reason offered <b>when</b> <b>price</b> increases are high increases fairness perceptions. Whether distributive or procedural fairness influences post customer loyalty in the presence of price increases is dependent on both the level of the price increase and the reason offered for the price increase. This research provides implications for retailers and directions for future research. Price perceptions Fairness Justice Customer loyalty...|$|R
40|$|Forests make up large {{ecosystems}} {{and by the}} uptake of carbon dioxide {{can play an important}} role in mitigating the greenhouse effect. In this study, mitigation of carbon emissions through carbon uptake and storage in forest biomass and the use of forest biofuel for fossil fuel substitution were considered. The analysis was performed for a 3. 2 million hectare region in northern Sweden. The objective was to maximize net present value for harvested timber, biofuel production and carbon sequestration. A carbon price for build-up of carbon storage and for emissions from harvested forest products was introduced to achieve an economic value for carbon sequestration. Forest development was simulated using an optimizing stand-level planning model, and the solution for the whole region was found using linear programming. A range of carbon prices was used to study the effect on harvest levels and carbon sequestration. At a zero carbon price, the mean annual harvest level was 5. 4 million m 3, the mean annual carbon sequestration in forest biomass was 1. 48 million tonnes and the mean annual replacement of carbon from fossil fuel with forest biofuel was 61 000 tonnes. Increasing the carbon price led to decreasing harvest levels of timber and decreasing harvest levels of forest biofuel. Also, thinning activities decreased more than clear-cut <b>activities</b> <b>when</b> the carbon <b>prices</b> increased. The level of carbon sequestration was governed by the harvest level and the site productivity. This led to varying results for different parts of the region...|$|R
