To do this, Kuros must rescue King James' three princesses who <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> somewhere in Piedup; each of them will grant Kuros a gem and agree to marry him when rescued. The final gem is obtained by defeating a dragon in the town's underworld.|$|E
5|$|Combinations also trigger special modes, {{including}} alternative camera angles, {{a sniper}} mode, and a snapshot mode, which unlocks more in-game secrets. Playable {{versions of the}} 1981 Donkey Kong and 1983 Jetpac <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> within the game. The player-character can also ride animals, such as a rhino and swordfish, who recur from earlier series games. Optional hardware support includes a widescreen mode and Rumble Pak compatibility.|$|E
5|$|Deir al-Balah {{remained}} in Egyptian hands until around 1150 BC when the Philistines conquered the southern coastal area of Canaan. The Philistine settlement {{is thought to}} have been situated southwest of the excavation site; its remains <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> under large sand dunes. Five pits dug into the Late Bronze Age layers and containing Philistine pottery are among the few findings from that period.|$|E

5|$|The {{sides of}} the {{original}} building <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> by the modern extensions up {{to the level of}} the first floor. The gables are weatherboarded above the plain wall with double casement windows opening into the attic. The rear has a prominent late 18th century extension covered by the catslide roof. The rest of the rear of the building is a series of flat-roofed extensions. The roof is steeply pitched, tiled and half-hipped with over-hanging eaves Kent peg tiles, and weatherboarded gables. Forged brackets support the guttering.|$|E
5|$|A world map is {{available}} and, at the beginning, the player is allocated {{one of the}} twenty regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each representing a level, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. The goals for each level are straightforward: they generally fall {{along the lines of}} eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers. The first few levels are tutorials, teaching the player the basics. Special items <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> throughout certain levels. Such items perform actions such as increasing the player's creatures' experience level, or revealing the map. They can reveal a hidden level, where the player must perform a specific task, and is rewarded upon completion.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by {{mammalian}} predators, {{such as the}} red fox (Vulpes vulpes) or the feral cat (Felis catus), and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) and reptiles such as goannas. Another threat to the birds is from humans; many nests are trampled on (even by the occasional bird watcher) during breeding season because the nests <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> {{close to the ground}} and therefore difficult for passers-by to spot.|$|E
50|$|In {{the weeks}} before his arrest, Hadžić {{disappeared}} {{from his home in}} Novi Sad, Serbia. In 2005, Serbian media reported he might <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> in a Serbian Orthodox monastery in Irig or in Bijela, Montenegro. Nenad Čanak, the leader of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, claimed in 2006 that Hadžić <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> in a monastery somewhere on Fruška mountain. At one point he was also rumoured to <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> in Belarus.|$|R

5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to enter, and see which attractions they have already completed. Bonus levels <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> throughout the zones and can also be triggered by finishing a zone with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free falling and can pick up power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if finishing a zone with 50 or more rings. In these, the player must collect blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer; players are rewarded with a Chaos Ring upon completion. Collecting all Chaos Rings rewards the player with the best possible ending, in which Sonic and Tails make cameo appearances.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, Brihannala {{asks the}} chariot to be {{directed}} to a shami tree (prosopis cineraria) where the Pandavas' divine weapons <b>are</b> <b>hidden.</b> The 13th year ends on that day and Brihannala regains his form of Arjuna. On realising who Brihannala is, Uttara Kumara is happy to serve him. Arjuna then uses the Sammohanastra weapon, which puts the Kaurava army to sleep. The cattle is rescued and the Pandavas declare that their 13 year exile has been successfully completed. Krishna visits Matsya and the marriage of Uttaraa with Abhimanyu is finalised.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a boss. In boss stages the player's craft {{does not move}} forward, but hovers {{in front of the}} boss. Each boss has a single {{vulnerability}} which flashes when hit. These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> and appear for only short periods. Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player's shots. At the end of each level, players receive bonuses for defeated enemies, lives remaining, and the energy level of the player's craft. An extra life is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds.|$|E

Seven members of the Weltz family <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> in the barn of Dorota and Antoni Szylar. Jakub Einhorn's family <b>was</b> <b>hidden</b> by Jan and Weronika Przybylak and Jakub Lorbenfeld and his family <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> by Michal Bar.

50|$|In Mongolia the owl is {{regarded}} as a benign omen. The great warlord Genghis Khan <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> from enemies in a small coppice. An owl roosted in the tree above him, which caused his pursuers to think no man could <b>be</b> <b>hidden</b> there.|$|R
5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E
5|$|In the Book of Kells, the Chi Rho {{monogram}} {{has grown}} to consume the entire page. The letter chi dominates the page with one arm swooping across {{the majority of the}} page. The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi. Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns. The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi. This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of a tradition that started with the Book of Durrow.|$|E

With all the {{soldiers}} engaged in war with Kauravas' allies, Virata's palace is almost empty. When Kauravas attack the remaining cattle, Uttara Kumara swears to fight against them. However, after watching their military troops, Uttara Kumara loses his confidence. Brihannala, who is his charioteer, volunteers to fight if Uttara Kumara handles the chariot, to which Uttara Kumara agrees.|$|E

5000|$|The {{book was}} written {{as a set}} of riddles that would lead the {{treasure}} hunters to the treasure hidden by Bladkompaniet AS, the publisher of the novel. Competitors searched for the treasure, which had <b>been</b> <b>hidden</b> somewhere in Norway. In the [...] "treasure", a telephone number <b>was</b> <b>hidden,</b> which the lucky winner called to claim the prize. The treasure was found 11 October 1999. Margit Sandemo said in a TV-interview that even she hadnt known where the treasure had <b>been</b> <b>hidden.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Legend of Zelda {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} action, adventure, and role-playing games. The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels in the overworld, a large outdoor map with varied environments. Link begins the game armed {{only with a}} small shield, but a sword becomes available to Link after he ventures into a cave that is accessible from the game's first map screen. Throughout the game, various characters aid Link by giving or selling equipment and clues. These people {{can be found in}} caves scattered throughout the overworld; some are readily accessible, while others <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> behind obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls.|$|E
5|$|The major {{religious}} activities (or pujas) performed every morning are mahabhishek (ablution), abhishek, gitapath and bhagavat puja, {{while in the}} evening the pujas include geet govinda and aarti. Recital in vedic scripts like Ashtotram and Sahasranama is practiced during all the rituals. After aarti, the decorations are removed from the image of Badrinath and sandalwood paste is applied to it. The paste from the image {{is given to the}} devotees the next day as prasad during the nirmalaya darshan. All the rituals are performed in front of the devotees, unlike those in some Hindu temples, where some practices <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> from them. Sugar balls and dry leaves are the common prasad provided to the devotees. From May 2006, the practise of offering Panchamrit Prasad, prepared locally and packed in local bamboo baskets, was started.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalent}} {{force of}} Alchemy in Weyard's ancient past enabled {{the development of}} great civilizations. However, this thriving period eventually {{gave way to a}} worldwide conflict that subsided only with the sealing away of Alchemy. The keys to unlocking Alchemy, the four Elemental Stars which hold the pure power of the four elements, <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> within the mountain shrine, Mt. Aleph, which in turn is guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain's base. In the game's prologue, Saturos and Menardi, with help from a raiding party, storm Mt. Aleph with the intention to seize the Elemental Stars for themselves. They fail to solve the riddles guarding the stars and are driven away by the mountain's trap, a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide.|$|E
50|$|The flags are {{generally}} {{placed in a}} visibly obvious location (but in some variations the flag <b>is</b> <b>hidden)</b> {{at the rear of}} a team's territory. In a more difficult version, the flag <b>is</b> <b>hidden</b> in a place where it can only be seen from one angle. It also might have some challenge involved. For example, the flag could <b>be</b> <b>hidden</b> in the leaves up in a tall tree, and the players have to see the flag, then knock it out and bring it to their base.|$|R
50|$|A terma {{tradition}} also {{exists in}} Bön. Most Bön termas <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> {{during the period}} of decline under King Trisong Deutsen, and rediscovered around the 11th century. Teachings <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> by masters such as Lishu Tagring and Drenpa Namkha, often inside Buddhist temples, as in Samye and Lhodrak.|$|R

5|$|The {{surface of}} the nucleus is {{generally}} dry, dusty or rocky, suggesting that the ices <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> beneath a surface crust several metres thick. In addition to the gases already mentioned, the nuclei contain a variety of organic compounds, which may include methanol, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, ethanol, and ethane and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain hydrocarbons and amino acids. In 2009, {{it was confirmed that}} the amino acid glycine had been found in the comet dust recovered by NASA's Stardust mission. In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies of meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets.|$|E
5|$|Timmy makes a wish {{to star in}} his own movie trilogy (In parodies of The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter).

When he gets there, Timmy's parents and school friends don't remember him, and an Eliminator appears after Timmy calls out his own name. In an alley, the Eliminator projects a space vortex through its mouth to inhale Timmy. Jorgen saves him, and the two arrive at Fairy World. Meanwhile, the fairies <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> as gumballs inside a truck stop bar by Jorgen. After being blown into a bubble from a kid's mouth, Cosmo takes Wanda and Poof {{with him as he}} floats away. The rest of the fairies use Cosmo's method as their escape plan.|$|E
5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> from the Pony Track.|$|E
