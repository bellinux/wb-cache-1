5|$|After {{graduation}} Tyler {{read the}} law with his father, a state judge at the time, and later with Edmund Randolph, former United States Attorney General.

In 1813 he purchased Woodburn plantation, and resided there until 1821.|$|E

5|$|As was {{usual in}} California at the time, both Nixon and Voorhis cross-filed {{in the other}} party's primary, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> Voorhis had long adopted.

Nixon gained momentum, however, when the newspapers pointed out that Voorhis's total percentage of the vote had decreased from 60% in 1944 to 53.5%.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> of chastity, {{with a focus}} on maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person.

5|$|Following the tour, Wright {{left the}} group {{to work on the}} {{upcoming}} Dio album Lock Up the Wolves, and was replaced by session veteran Chris Slade.

5|$|Following the war, White {{returned}} to Romney. Since {{his father had}} died, he became the family patriarch and resumed practicing law to support them.

White then expanded his law practice and it became the largest {{of its kind in}} the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. He continued his law practice until 1877, when he became Attorney General of West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|From Thunderball {{through to}} Die Another Day, the gun barrel {{sequence}} segues into the pre-title sequence {{by having the}} opening shot be sighted through the barrel.

5|$|In 1958, Khrushchev {{opened a}} Central Committee meeting to {{hundreds}} of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, {{the proceedings of the}} Committee were made public in book form, <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.|$|E
