40|$|Within {{the test}} program aging {{appearances}} were verified at laser-welded joints of unalloyed ferritic-pearlitic steel in the parent metal {{close to the}} heat-affected zone. The displacement of the impact transition temperature of S 235 JRLC, S 355 M and S 355 J 2 G 3 at aged test specimens (one month aging at room-temperature) in comparison with non-aged specimens is a characteristic property. Depending on the material the transition temperature increases by approx. + 20 C. The maximum hardness increase of HV 1, after one month of aging has been between 5 and 8 %, but after a longer duration (6 to 12 months) this value {{will go back to}} the basic value. Therefore the hardness test is a important measured variable to determine the sensitivity against <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>material,</b> since the maximum hardness increase is correlating with the displacement of the impact transition temperature. Besides the critical behavior of the aging zone at the notch bar impact test a strong tensile residual stress is weaken this material zone too. The elongation measured in tension tests of the investigated test specimen is partly smaller than in the heat-affected zone and the adjacent parent metal. A complete fail of the construction because of the shown aging effects is not impossible, but more improbable since there is expected a stabilizer effect of the adjacent parent metal around the small aged zone. For selection of a metal the thermomechanical structural steel should be preferred. The here investigated steel S 355 M shows due to its small carbon content a maximum hardness of less than 250 HV 1 and since it has a very low impact transition temperature and its least loss of toughness in the aged zone it still has reserves for aging.

40|$|Isotopic {{reference}} materials certified for the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> nuclear material (uranium, plutonium) {{are needed in}} the fields of nuclear forensics and environmental measurements. Therefore a feasibility study for the development of plutonium {{reference materials}} for age dating has been started recently at the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (EC-JRC-IRMM). The "age" of the material is defined as the time that has passed since the last chemical separation of the mother and daughter isotopes (e. g. 241 Pu and 241 Am). Assuming that the separation has been complete and all the daughter isotopes have been removed from the original material during this last separation, the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the material can be determined by measuring the ratio of daughter and mother radio-nuclides, e. g. 241 Am/ 241 Pu. At a given time after the last separation and depending on the half lives of the radio-nuclides involved, <b>a</b> certain amount <b>of</b> the daughter radionuclide(s) will be present. For the determination <b>of</b> the unknown <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>material</b> different "clocks" can be used; "clocks" are pairs of mother and daughter radio-nuclides, such as 241 Am/ 241 Pu, 238 Pu/ 234 U, 239 Pu/ 235 U, 240 Pu/ 236 U, and possibly 242 Pu/ 238 U. For the <b>age</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> real sample, such as material seized in nuclear forensics investigations or dust samples in environmental measurements, it is advisable to use more than one clock in order to ensure the reliability of the results and to exclude the possibility that the sample under question is <b>a</b> mixture <b>of</b> two or more <b>materials.</b> Consequently, <b>a</b> future reference <b>material</b> certified for separation date should ideally be certified for more than one "clock" or several reference materials for different "clocks" should be developed. The first step {{of this study is to}} verify the known separation dates of different plutonium materials <b>of</b> different <b>ages</b> and isotopic compositions by measuring the mother (238 Pu, 239 Pu, 240 Pu, 241 Pu, 242 Pu) and daughter (234 U, 235 U, 236 U, 238 U and 241 Am) isotope abundances and to estimate the achievable uncertainties <b>of</b> the calculated <b>ages.</b> Thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) is applied for the measurement of the plutonium and uranium isotope ratios after chemical separation of the plutonium and uranium fractions from the sample matrix, while 241 Am is measured by gamma-ray spectrometry.

40|$|Confidence in {{comparability}} {{and reliability}} of measurement results in nuclear material and environmental sample analysis are established via certified reference materials (CRMs), reference measurements, and inter-laboratory comparisons (ILCs). Increased needs for quality control tools in proliferation resistance, environmental sample analysis, development of measurement capabilities {{over the years and}} progress in modern analytical techniques are the main reasons for the development of new reference materials and reference methods for nuclear safeguards and security. The Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) {{is one of the leading}} institutes that supplies nuclear reference materials to fulfill the existing requirements for nuclear material and environmental sample analyses. IRMM’s activities range from the preparation and certification of large quantities of the so-called "large-sized dried” (LSD) spikes for accurate measurement of the uranium and plutonium amount content in dissolved nuclear fuels by isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), over certified synthetic uranium isotope mixtures, to the development of particle reference materials applied for the detection of nuclear signatures in environmental samples. IRMM is currently replacing some of its exhausted stocks of CRMs with new ones whose specifications are up-to-date and tailored for the demands of modern analytical techniques. Some of the existing materials will be re-measured to improve the uncertainties associated with their certified values, and to enable laboratories to reduce their combined measurement uncertainty. Furthermore, IRMM initiated and coordinated the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Modified Total Evaporation (MTE) technique for accurate measurements of minor isotope-amount ratios of uranium and plutonium in nuclear material and, in combination with a multi-dynamic measurement technique and filament carburization, in environmental samples. Currently IRMM is engaged in a study on the development of plutonium reference materials for “age dating”, i. e. determination of the time elapsed since the last separation of plutonium from its daughter nuclides.

40|$|Detailed {{knowledge}} of environmental conditions {{is required to}} understand faunal production in coastal seas with topographic and hydrographic complexity. We test the hypothesis that organic biomass and production of subtidal sediment invertebrates throughout the Strait of Georgia, west coast of Canada, can be predicted by depth, substrate type and organic flux modified to reflect lability and <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>material.</b> <b>A</b> basin-wide database <b>of</b> biological, geochemical and flux data was analysed using an empirical production/biomass (P/B) model to test this hypothesis. This analysis is unique in the spatial extent and detail of P/B and concurrent environmental measurements over a temperate coastal region. Modified organic flux {{was the most important}} predictor of organic biomass and production. Depth and substrate type were secondary modifiers. Between 69 - 74 % of variability in biomass and production could be explained by the combined environmental factors. Organisms < 1 mm were important contributors to biomass and production primarily in shallow, sandy sediments, where high P/B values were found despite low organic flux. Low biomass, production, and P/B values were found in the deep, northern basin and mainland fjords, which had silty sediments, low organic flux, low biomass of organisms < 1 mm, and dominance by large, slow-growing macrofauna. In the highest organic flux and biomass areas near the Fraser River discharge, production did not increase beyond moderate flux levels. Although highly productive, this area had low P/B. Clearly, food input is insufficient to explain the complex patterns in faunal production revealed here. Additional environmental factors (depth, substrate type and unmeasured factors) are important modifiers of these patterns. Potential reasons for the above patterns are explored, along with <b>a</b> discussion <b>of</b> unmeasured factors possibly responsible for unexplained (30 %) variance in biomass and production.

40|$|Thermal {{interface}} materials (TIMs) {{are widely}} used in the electronics industry to facilitate heat conduction away from the working components. As the development in this industry is heading towards higher performances along with smaller components, heat density increases exponentially. This has imposed a demand for better TIMs. The aim of this master thesis is to characterise two commercial thermal interface <b>materials,</b> <b>Material</b> <b>A</b> and <b>Material</b> B, and investigate their time dependent properties. To predict the thermal performance of the two materials during their service life, knowledge of their time-dependent properties is vital. <b>Material</b> <b>A</b> and <b>Material</b> B serve as heat flow enhancers in Ericsson´s base stations {{all over the world}} and this master thesis is performed in collaboration with Ericsson AB, Göteborg. Characterisation of the two materials was performed at Chalmers University of Technology and Swerea IVF, using <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> analysing methods. It was found that both <b>materials</b> have <b>an</b> organo-siloxane matrix which is bimodally filled with highly thermally conductive particles. In order to investigate the long-term properties of the two materials, comparisons between test results from un-aged and <b>aged</b> specimen <b>of</b> both materials was made. It may be concluded that the shear and peel strength <b>of</b> <b>Material</b> <b>A</b> improved during <b>ageing</b> and its hardness increased. These results are believed to be associated with an increase in the amount of cross-links in the material introduced during the ageing process. <b>Material</b> <b>A</b> is superior to Material B for all test conditions in the shear and peel experiments and, in contrast to <b>Material</b> <b>A,</b> <b>Material</b> B weakened during <b>ageing.</b> The inferiority <b>of</b> Material B is thought to be due to embrittlement and dry-out during ageing. Results from the creep tests performed revealed that the <b>aged</b> samples <b>of</b> <b>Material</b> <b>A</b> is more creep resistant and showed a more solid-like behaviour. The thermal conductivity tests showed that <b>Material</b> <b>A</b> has better thermal performance and the performance is maintained after the ageing process. <b>Material</b> B showed <b>an</b> all over poorer performance and suffers from deteriorated thermal performance upon ageing. This is believed to be associated with an increased bond line thickness (BLT) and contact resistances of Material B. The thermal performance of both materials was recognised to be pressure dependent.

40|$|Background/Aim. Considering {{available}} literature lipofuscin is <b>a</b> classical <b>age</b> pigment <b>of</b> postmitotic cells, and a consistently recognized {{phenomenon in}} humans and animals. Lipofuscin accumulation is characteristic for nerve {{cells that are}} postmitotic. This research was focused on lipofuscin accumulation in ganglionic cells (GC) (postganglionic sympathetic cell bodies) of superior cervical ganglion in humans during ageing. Methods. We analysed 30 ganglions from cadavers ranging from 20 to over 80 years <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> <b>As</b> <b>material</b> the tissue samples were used from the middle portion of the ganglion, which was separated from the surrounding tissue by the method of macrodissection. The tissue samples were routinely fixed in 10 % neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin for classical histological analysis, then three consecutive (successive) sections 5 μm thick were made and stained with hematoxylin and eosin method (HE), silver impregnation technique by Masson Fontana and trichrome stain by Florantin. Results. Immersion microscopy was used to analyse patterns of lipofuscin accumulation during ageing making possible to distinguish diffuse type (lipofuscin granules were irregularly distributed and non-confluent), unipolar type (lipofuscin granules were grouped {{at the end of}} the cell), bipolar type (lipofuscin granules were concentrated at the two opposite ends <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cell with the nucleus in between at the center <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cell), annular type (lipofuscin granules were in the shape <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complete or incomplete ring around the nucleus) and a cell completely filled with lipofuscin (two subtypes distinguishing, one with visible a nucleus, and the other with invisible one). Even at the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 20 there were cells with lipofuscin granules accumulated in diffuse way, but in smaller numbers; the GC without lipofuscin were dominant. Growing older, especially above 60 years, all of the above mentioned patterns of lipofuscin accumulation were present with the evident increase in cells completely filled with lipofuscin, but cells without lipofuscin were also present even in the oldest persons. Conclusion. Lipofuscin is present in all periods <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> with <b>a</b> different intensity <b>of</b> accumulation. GC without the pigment, diffusely distributed, as well as very rare cells with <b>a</b> unipolar type <b>of</b> lipofuscin distribution are characteristic for the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 20 - 60 years.
