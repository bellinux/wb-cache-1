500|$|On April 20, 1973, {{while waiting}} for his mother, 52-year-old Clarnell Elizabeth Strandberg, {{to come home from}} a party, Kemper fell asleep and was then awakened by her arrival. While his mother was sitting in bed reading a book, she noticed Kemper enter her room and said, [...] "I suppose you're going to want to sit up all night and talk now." [...] Kemper replied, [...] "No, good night!", before waiting for her to fall asleep and {{returning}} to bludgeon her with a claw hammer and slit her throat with a knife. He then decapitated her and engaged in irrumatio with her severed head before using it as a dart board; stating that he [...] "put [...] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour... threw darts at it," [...] and ultimately, [...] "smashed her face in." [...] He also cut out her tongue and larynx {{and put them in the}} garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. [...] "That seemed appropriate," [...] Kemper later said, [...] "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> so many years." [...] He then had sex with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink. Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor [...] "Sally" [...] Hallett, over to the house for dinner and a movie. When Hallett arrived, he strangled her to death, decapitated her and spent the night with her exanimate body. Kemper then stuffed her corpse in a closet, obscured any outward signs of a disturbance and left a note to the police reading: ...|$|E

60|$|She started, {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> keenly <b>over</b> her spectacles. I had evidently taken her by surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Does he, Macumazahn?" [...] said Umslopogaas, taking snuff from a {{spoon and}} looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> keenly <b>over</b> the spoon. [...] "You {{seem to know}} a great deal, Macumazahn; too much as some might think." ...|$|R
60|$|Laura, Lady Glyde, was {{standing}} by the inscription, and was looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> the grave.|$|E
60|$|Willersley did {{not answer}} for a moment. He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> {{the corner of his}} spectacles.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> the rim with an {{extraordinary}} expression. ‘I hope ye liked it?’ said she.|$|E
6000|$|A few Sundays later I {{was sitting}} in the little tea-arbor of Rutli's nursery, peacefully smoking with him. Presently he took his long china-bowled pipe from his mouth, and, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> blandly <b>over</b> his yellow mustache, said:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] she said, {{and glanced}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> as if <b>over</b> her spectacles. Her next {{question}} was even less manageable. [...] "Was the young fellow a gentleman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was not {{altogether}} {{on account of}} the broken piece of bric-a-brac," [...] went on Andrew Dilks. [...] "Gulligan has been angry <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for <b>over</b> two weeks--ever since I wouldn't pass off a counterfeit five-dollar bill he had taken in. I said the bill ought to be burned up, but he wouldn't hear of it." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stood and}} looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, his face crimson, and his brows black as a thundercloud.|$|E
60|$|He smiled, {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> his cigarette, and I laughed at his quiet {{exposure}} of my modest pretence.|$|E
60|$|My {{impressive}} ruffian drank {{what remained}} of his beer, while his black, sunken eyes looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> the rim.|$|E
6000|$|And {{the phrase}} about the [...] "position {{of trust and}} responsibility" [...] touched Charles to the quick, I suppose, in re the Slump in Cloetedorp Golcondas. Though, to be sure, it was a hit <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as well, <b>over</b> the ten per cent commission.|$|R
60|$|I {{perceived}} we {{must get}} our chains loose, and that before we could do this these Selenites had to be beaten off. I faced towards the group of the three goad-bearers. Instantly one threw his goad <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It swished <b>over</b> my head, and I suppose went flying into the abyss behind.|$|R
60|$|At {{half past}} seven {{precisely}} I strolled into Stephano's. I had scarcely taken my table before Mr. Parker and Eve entered. Contrary to his usual custom, Mr. Parker {{was wearing a}} dress coat, white waistcoat and white tie; and Eve looked exquisite in a low-necked gown of white silk. Mr. Parker, according to his promise, <b>at</b> once beckoned <b>me</b> <b>over.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Her {{tone was}} quiet and natural, and Mart was relieved. He {{answered}} with attempt at jocularity, [...] "Lucius is this minute winkin' <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> the soup-tureen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} want {{something}} handsome, Hugh," [...] he said, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> his cigarette, [...] "something commensurate with these fees I hear you are getting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By no means,' Saxon answered, {{grinning}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> the minister's head. 'I was but {{showing how}} closely the Evil One can imitate {{the workings of}} the Spirit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have they that power?' She fixed them on me, {{and made}} {{room on the}} couch on which she was sitting. Neither Matteo nor I were slow to take the hint, for I took my place and he his leave. 'I wonder you have not already fallen victim to Madonna Giulia,' said Claudia, looking languorously <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and glancing <b>over</b> to the other lady.|$|R
60|$|They {{dragged me}} out on to the poop and held a damned court-martial--on me, mind you; me, that had thrown over my pals in order to serve them. What were they to do with me? Some said this, some said that; but it ended by the captain {{deciding}} to send me ashore. The ship stopped, they lowered a boat, and I was hoisted in, the whole gang of them hooting <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from <b>over</b> the bulwarks, I saw the man I spoke of tying up his hand, though, and I felt that things might be worse.|$|R

6000|$|... "Drat that boy," [...] {{interposed}} my sister, frowning <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> her work, [...] "what a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you'll be told no lies." ...|$|E
6000|$|Aline smiled <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder, and I {{stared at}} him in amaze, saying, [...] "I never found it either {{particularly}} easy or peaceful. I don't quite understand you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I could {{remember}} you, and behold you, {{apart from that}} frightful visage which stares <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> your shoulder, that were a consolation, at least, if not a joy." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{winced at}} this, and let drive a pillow <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{so hard that}} it nearly knocked <b>me</b> <b>over</b> a chair.|$|R
60|$|Sir Robert laughed heartily <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{but gave}} <b>over</b> {{offering}} any more arguments, only {{told me he}} had pointed me out for some of the best merchants in London, but since I forbade him he would give me no disturbance of that kind. He applauded my way of managing my money, and told me I should soon be monstrous rich; but he neither knew or mistrusted that, with all this wealth, I was yet a whore, and was not averse to adding to my estate at the farther expense of my virtue.|$|R
60|$|And {{it was a}} fine day; {{a delicious}} day, with the horror of the Infinite veiled by the splendid tent of blue; a day {{innocent}}ly bright like a child with a washed face, fresh like an innocent young girl, suave in welcoming one's respects like--like a Roman prelate. I love such days. They are perfection for remaining indoors. And I enjoyed it temperamentally in a chair, my feet up on the sill of the open window, a book in my hands and the murmured harmonies of wind and sun in my heart making an accompaniment to the rhythms of my author. Then looking up from the page I saw outside a pair of grey eyes thatched by ragged yellowy-white eyebrows gazing <b>at</b> <b>me</b> solemnly <b>over</b> the toes of my slippers. There was a grave, furrowed brow surmounting that portentous gaze, a brown tweed cap set far back on the perspiring head.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Listen now!' said she. 'I {{walk down}} a road, a white sandy road near the sea. There are broken fences on either side, and Men come and look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> them.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never did}} in my days behold {{anything}} like Mowcher {{as she stood}} upon the dining table, intensely enjoying this refreshment, rubbing busily at Steerforth's head, and winking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|Young Stamford looked rather strangely <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>over</b> his wine-glass. [...] "You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet," [...] he said; [...] "perhaps {{you would}} not care {{for him as a}} {{constant}} companion." ...|$|E
60|$|The six {{young men}} stopped talking and stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> With one accord. Madame arose, and I {{followed}} {{her down the}} room towards them, and, {{had it not been}} for my indignation, I should have felt sufficiently ridiculous. Young Monsieur de Saint-Gre came forward with the good-natured, easy insolence to which he had been born, and looked <b>me</b> <b>over.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep them," [...] he said, and {{snatched}} at a yawn. He stood up, stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for a moment, and smiled. [...] "You {{have had two}} eventful days," [...] said he. [...] "I should advise some sleep. I'm glad it's all clear. Good-night." [...] He thought <b>me</b> <b>over</b> for a moment, then went out by the inner door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mackellar, Mackellar," [...] said he, [...] "you {{do not see}} the {{weakness}} of my ground. I can carry no such base thoughts to any one - to my father least of all; that would be to fall into the bottom of his scorn. The weakness of my ground," [...] he continued, [...] "lies in myself, that I am not one who engages love. I have their gratitude, they all tell me that; I have a rich estate of it! But I am not present in their minds; they are moved neither to think with me nor to think for me. There is my loss!" [...] He got to his feet, and trod down the fire. [...] "But some method must be found, Mackellar," [...] said he, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> suddenly <b>over</b> his shoulder; [...] "some way must be found. I am a man of a great deal of patience - far too much - far too much. I begin to despise myself. And yet, sure, never was a man involved in such a toil!" [...] He fell back to his brooding.|$|R
