40|$|Neutron {{transmission}} {{experiments were}} performed on samples of an advanced nickel-chromium-molybdenum-gadolinium (Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd) neutron <b>absorber</b> <b>alloy</b> and chromium-nickel (Cr-Ni) stainless steel, modified {{by the addition of}} boron. The primary purpose of the experiments was to demonstrate the thermal neutron absorbing capability of the materials at specific gadolinium and boron dopant levels. The Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd alloy is envisioned to be deployed for criticality control of highly enriched U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) -owned spent nuclear fuel (SNF). For these transmission experiments, test samples were fabricated with 0. 0, 1. 58 and 2. 1 wt% natural gadolinium dispersed in a Ni-Cr-Mo base alloy and 1. 16 wt% boron in stainless steel. The transmission experiments were successfully carried out at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). Measured data from the neutron transmission experiments were compared to calculated results derived from a simple exponential transmission formula using total neutron cross sections. Excellent agreement between the measured and calculated results demonstrated the expected strong thermal absorption capability of the gadolinium and boron elements and in addition, verified the measured elemental composition of the Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd alloy and borated stainless steel test samples. The good agreement also indirectly confirmed that the size and distribution of the gadolinium in both the hot-top (as-cast) and Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd converted to plate was not a discriminator related to neutron absorption. Moreover, the Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF VII) total neutron cross section data were accurate...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this paper}} is to present {{application}} and method of numerical modelling smart materials in vibration control systems. Two methods of vibration control was presented in this work. First one is based on shape memory <b>alloy</b> <b>absorber.</b> Second method use magnetorheological bearing which was placed in revolute join of manipulator mechanism. Design/methodology/approach: The numerical models of presented mechanical systems were created in APDL language, which is internal ANSYS language. Dynamic characteristics of shape memory <b>alloy</b> <b>absorber</b> were determined by using algorithm which automatically changes absorber’s length. The manipulator mechanism with magnetorheological bearing was modelled by using multibody dynamics method connected with finite element method in ANSYS environment. Findings: Through this study it was determined shape memory <b>alloy</b> <b>absorber’s</b> length which eliminated specified resonance due to natural frequencies of mechanical system. The dynamic characteristics of mechanical system with magnetorheological bearing were also obtained. Research limitations/implications: The main disadvantage of presented methods is the necessity to calculate parameters for each iteration step. In the case of shape memory <b>alloy</b> <b>absorber</b> this process significantly extends the calculation time. Practical implications: Presented methods allowed to determine dynamic characteristics of vibration control systems using smart materials and enabled implementation of the method to commercial finite element method environment.

Due to the large amount of zinc in the film, the sintered grains exhibit the zinc blende structure instead of the usual chalcopyrite structure of CuIn(S,Se) 2 films. The use of the selenide films as a p-type absorber layer has yielded solar cells with total area power conversion efficiencies as high as 6. 7 % (7. 4 % based on active area).

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} defect energies, band alignments, and charge carrier {{recombination}} in polycrystalline Cu(In 1 -xGax) (Se 1 -ySy) 2 chalcopyrite thin films and the interrelationship with the alloy composition. Photoluminescence spectroscopy of investigated Cu-poor Cu(In,Ga) (Se,S) 2 layers generally shows broad emission lines with the corresponding maxima shifting towards higher energies under decreasing temperature or under increasing excitation power. Admittance spectroscopy of Cu-poor ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga) (Se,S) 2 chalcopyrite devices {{shows that the}} activation energies of the dominant defect distributions involving donors at the CdS/absorber interface and deep acceptors in the chalcopyrite bulk, increase upon alloying CuInSe 2 with S. The band alignments within the Cu(In 1 -xGax) (Se 1 -ySy) 2 system are determined using the energy position of the bulk acceptor state as a reference. The band gap enlargement under Ga alloying is accommodated almost exclusively in the rise of the conduction band edge, whereas the increase of band gap upon alloying with S is shared between comparable valence and conduction band offsets. The extrapolated band discontinuities [delta]EV(CuInSe 2 /CuInS 2) = - 0. 23 eV, [delta]EC(CuInSe 2 /CuInS 2) = 0. 21 eV, [delta]EV(CuInSe 2 /CuGaSe 2) = 0. 036 eV, and [delta]EC(CuInSe 2 /CuGaSe 2) = 0. 7 eV are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Current-voltage analysis of Cu-poor ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga) (Se,S) 2 devices reveals recombination barriers which follow the band gap energy of the <b>absorber</b> irrespective of <b>alloy</b> composition, as expected for dominant recombination in the chalcopyrite bulk. In turn, the recombination at the active junction interface prevails in Cu-rich devices which display substantially smaller barriers when compared to the band gap energy of the absorber.

40|$|A mid-wavelength {{infrared}} (MWIR) barrier photodetector {{is capable}} of operating at higher temperature than the prevailing MWIR detectors based on InSb. The standard high-operating-temperature barrier infrared detector (HOT-BIRD) is made with an InAsSb infrared absorber that is lattice-matched to a GaSb substrate, and has a cutoff wavelength of approximately 4 microns. To increase the versatility and utility of the HOT-BIRD, it is implemented with IR absorber materials with customizable cutoff wavelengths. The HOT-BIRD can be built with the quaternary alloy GaInAsSb as the absorber, GaAlSbAs as the barrier, on a lattice-matching GaSb substrate. The cutoff wavelength of the GaInAsSb can be tailored by adjusting the alloy composition. To build a HOT-BIRD requires a matching pair of absorber and barrier materials with the following properties: (1) their valence band edges must be approximately the same to allow unimpeded hole flow, while their conduction band edges should have a large difference to form an electron barrier; and (2) the absorber and the barrier must be respectively lattice-matched and closely lattice-matched to the substrate to ensure high material quality and low defect density. To make a HOT-BIRD with cutoff wavelength shorter than 4 microns, a GaInAsSb quaternary alloy {{was used as the}} absorber, and a matching GaAlSbAs quaternary alloy as the barrier.

40|$|The paper summarises the {{fundamental}} {{aspects of the}} design of structure and structural parts in aluminium light alloys in cases when energy absorption performances are required. Particularly, the design of crashworthy helicopter structures {{and the development of}} leading edges, for wings or tail empennages, in bird impact conditions are considered. In both cases the structural performance turns out to be strongly influenced by the material properties beyond the elastic range, such as the ultimate strength, the overall toughness, the elongation at failure and file strain rate sensitivity of the plastic response. The design conditions of crashworthy helicopter structures are referred to potentially survivable crash scenarios where file absorption of the impact energy by means of absorbers located in the landing gears, in the subfloor and in the seats call significantly reduce the occupant injuries (Figure 1). The deceleration experienced by the occupants is actually influenced by file response of the whole structure of the helicopter, as it call be outlined by the experimental evidence in all helicopter crash test (Figure 2). As far as the subfloor and the landing gears are concerned, some design solutions developed to integrate energy absorbing elements in their structural lay-outs are presented (Figures 3, 4). The Working mechanism of light <b>alloy</b> <b>absorbers</b> is exemplified considering a light alloy crushing tube (Figure 5) and the role that call be played by numerical analyses in the design and verification of the absorbers integrated in the helicopter structure is outlined (Figure 6). Indeed, many helicopter structural parts contribute to transmit the loads thus allowing file absorbers to properly work and for thus parts, strength requirements have to be considered far more important than energy absorbing issues. To identify the A role played by the different parts and the consequent requirements, all hybrid multi-body/finite elements modelling technique is presented With all application to an helicopter subfloor (Figure 7). A general evaluation of the roles played by the strength level, the elongation at failure and the strain rate sensitivity in the design of light <b>alloy</b> <b>absorbers</b> is then carried out, basing oil analytical formulations for the prediction of the absorber performances that are correlated with a data base of experimental results (Figures 8, 9). Experiments performed with absorbers made of different light alloy are also discussed (Figures 10, 11). Attention is then focused oil the issues relevant to the bird impacts oil aircraft structures, after having pointing out that this occurrence turns out to be, basing oil the current civil aviation regulation, the dimensioning condition for many parts of fixed and rotary Wing aircraft structures. The force levels that call be exerted by a bird strike are evaluated (Figure 12) and file main design philosophies developed to design bird proof leading edges are presented (Figure 13). It is evidenced that, also in this case, the problem call not be reduced to design a structure and select a material for maximum energy absorbing capabilities. In fact, the risk of bird pocketing due to all excessive structural deformation suggests to take into considerations design solutions where the bird material is actually deflected. In such cases, the strength levels of the chosen light alloy may determine the development Of all adequate bird proof structure, These concepts are illustrated considering the bird impact oil a hybrid light alloy/carbon composite vertical stabilizer (Figure 14). A numercal model of the impact test is also presented discussing the key role performed, in the performed numerical analysis, by a damage law introduced to approximately model the tearing of the structural barrier (Figure 15). The completely different experimental outcomes obtained in two impact conditions are presented, indicating that the adopted simplified material characterisation call indeed evaluate the adequacy of the structural impact strength levels (Figures 76, 17). Globally, all the presented numerical cases highlight the potential role that can be played, in exploiting the full range of properties offered by aluminium alloys, by the execution of numerical analyses, when reliable and complete descriptions of file material behaviour beyond the elastic range are introduced in the models...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} are {{vital part of}} the future. As fossil fuel {{resources}} start to dwindle a new source must meet the worlds energy demand. Due to its abundance, solar energy is poised to be this new source. Currently, there are many technologies being investigated. Each of these though has their own draw backs, and none of them have been able to surpass fossil fuels in the current marketplace. Investigating new materials provides new opportunities for a better solar cell. These new materials could be the key to pushing renewable energy ahead of fossil fuels. ^ I have explored two different absorber materials, the first is an alloy of zinc selenide and copper indium selenide (CIZSe). This material represents a new class of materials based on alloying two different materials together. Earlier examples of alloying are replacing one or two elements in a material with other from the same group. This can be used to modify the band gap, but it does not change the crystal structure. CZISe does not have this limitation though. ^ As solar cell <b>absorber</b> materials, <b>alloys</b> of CuIn(S,Se) 2 and Zn(S,Se) provide an opportunity to reduce the usage of indium along with the ability to tune the band gap. I have developed a successful synthesis of alloyed (CuInS 2) 0. 5 (ZnS) 0. 5 nanocrystals by a method that solely uses oleylamine as the liquid medium for synthesis. These nanocrystals are used to make inks that are doctor bladed onto substrates. The reactive sintering of a thin film of these nanocrystals via selenization at 500 C results in a uniform composition alloy (CuIn(S,Se) 2) 0. 5 (Zn(S,Se)) 0. 5 layer with micron size grains. Due to the large amount of zinc in the film, the sintered grains exhibit the zinc blende (sphalerite) structure instead of the usual chalcopyrite structure of CuIn(S,Se) 2 films. The use of the selenide films as a p-type absorber layer has yielded solar cells with total area power conversion efficiencies as high as 6. 7 % (7. 4 % based on active area). These preliminary results are encouraging and indicate that with further optimization this class of materials has promise as the absorber layer in solar cells. ^ The second material is copper selenophosphate (Cu 3 PSe 4). This material uses earth abundant cations similar to copper zinc tin selenide. Exploring the group V elements for use in solar cells could prove to be a exiting and promising new area for solar absorber research. There has been some theoretical work done on some of these materials and they are predicted to be quality absorbers. The main issue facing this field has been the lack of good synthesis methods. My research into this area has about that. I have tried both molecular precursor routes as well as nanocrystal methods. These solution based routes provide a scalable synthesis option to the previous methods of making these materials. The nanocrystal route has shown significant progress. I can currently make Cu 3 PS 4 nanocrystals, via a simple thermal method. ^ I have expanded beyond just know a single reaction setup that will produce pure phase Cu 3 PS 4, to know exactly which conditions direct the synthesis products. The key factor is the state of the phosphorus precursor. The dissolved P 2 S 5 leads to the formation of Cu 6 PS 5 Cl, and the solid P 2 S 5 leads to the formation of Cu 3 PS 4. Using reaction conditions where the copper and phosphorus source are added together, the Cu 3 PS 4 nanocrystals can be formed faster than the dissolution can remove all of the P 2 S 5. If the P 2 S 5 is dissolved ahead of time, then the reaction will only produce Cu 6 PS 5 Cl. This leaves a very narrow window of conditions that will produce pure phase Cu 3 PS 4. ^ The final major development has been the selenization of Cu 3 PS 4. A method has been developed where the sulfide nanocrystals can be converted to the selenide phase and achieve significant grain growth. This is the first time this type of procedure has been done with this material. The issue that is holding it back from getting functional photovoltaic devices is the film morphology. The grains produced in this method, do not form a contiguous film. Instead they form isolated grains, that are often elongated. If this issue could be solved, then the first device could be made from this material. ...|$|R
