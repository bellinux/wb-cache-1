5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E

I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I <b>am</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E

[...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the Mexicans of tomorrow will remember these days as the moment when the country took the decision to defend itself, with all its force, against a voracious criminal phenomenon of translational dimensions," [...] Calderón said on 20 November 2012 at a ceremony for fallen soldiers. His successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, has pledged to continue the fight, but plans to adjust the strategy to reduce the level of violence.|$|E
500|$|Dvoretsky comments: Here, {{we should}} touch on one {{delicate}} question. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> this unique endgame position was discovered {{with the help}} of Thompson’s famous computer database. Is this a 'flaw,' diminishing the composer's achievement? [...] Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays. Out of it, no doubt, we could probably extract yet more unique positions – there are some chess composers who do so regularly. The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved. Thus: miracles, based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas, are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes.|$|E

It was Sidmons who first described this area around West Circle Drive as a [...] "sacred space" [...] and who reaffirmed {{the idea of}} as area of campus as a park {{to be protected from}} development. In a 1906 letter to the Board for Trustee's [...] "This area is, I <b>am</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> feature of the College which is most pleasantly and affectionately remembered by the students after they leave their Alma Mater, and I doubt if any instruction given has a greater effect upon their lives." ...|$|E

In August that year, Drynan decided to evict the sculpture, {{after three years}} at the {{entrance}} of the art gallery at the Brampton Library branch. In a letter to community services commissioner Donald M. Gordon, Drynan wrote: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the statue has artistic merit and needs to be preserved. However, it is quite inappropriate in its present location within the newly renovated gallery. Its presence dominates any other exhibits which are placed in the area. I hope we can find a solution without having yet another tempest in a teapot." ...|$|E

[...] Mottram has stated they would like to market a sequel based on the highly positive feedback they had received; however, with other Zoë Mode projects such as SingStar and Play taking precedence, he does not know when this could be.|$|E

Here the {{situation}} is serious. Should any misfortune befall me I count on you, my friend, to care for Abdullah". In Hergé's revised edition, he adopts a more florid prose style: [...] "This is to tell you, oh highly esteemed friend, that I entrust to you Abdullah, my adored son. Because here the situation is serious. Should misfortune descend on me like the hawk on an innocent gazelle (for the world is made of life and death) I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Abdullah will find you with warmth and affection, refuge and peace. And in doing this you will be performing a fragrant act before Allah." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics of}} Lukashenko, {{including}} the opposition group Zubr, {{use the term}} Lukashism {{to refer to the}} political and economic system Lukashenko has implemented in Belarus. The term is also used more broadly to refer to an authoritarian ideology based on a cult of his personality and nostalgia for Soviet times among certain groups in Belarus. [...] The US Congress sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko's government and provide financial and other support to the opposition. Lukashenko supporters argue that his rule spared Belarus the turmoil that beset many other former Soviet countries. Lukashenko commented on the criticism of him by saying: [...] "I've been hearing these accusations for over 10years and we have got used to it. We are not going to answer them. I want to come from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> it is the Belarusian people who are the masters in our state." ...|$|E
500|$|Tatlock {{struggled}} with her sexuality, {{at one point}} writing to a friend that [...] "there was a period when I thought I was homosexual. I still am, in a way, forced to believe it, but really, logically, I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I can't be because of my un-masculinity." [...] She began seeing Robert Oppenheimer in 1936, {{when she was a}} graduate student there and Oppenheimer was a professor of physics at Berkeley. They met through his landlady, Mary Ellen Washburn, who was {{also a member of the}} Communist party, when Washburn held a fund raiser for communist-backed Spanish Republicans. The couple started dating and had a passionate relationship; he proposed to her twice, but she refused. She is credited with introducing Oppenheimer to radical politics during the late 1930s, and to people involved with, or sympathetic to the Communist Party or related groups, such as Rudy Lambert and Thomas Addis. They continued seeing each other after he became involved with Kitty Harrison, whom he married on November 1, 1940. Oppenheimer and Tatlock [...] spent the New Year together in 1941, and once met at Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco.|$|E
