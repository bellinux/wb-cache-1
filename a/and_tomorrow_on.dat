In eleven European countries there appeared jointly over 13 billion banknotes and 76 billion coins. The introduction of a common currency in {{the countries of the}} European Union is the greatest financial operation in world history with such a huge scale and degree of complication. Before yesterdayŠis the road to currency integration, ended with the rise of the European Currency System with a common unit ECU. Yesterday - lasted from the declaration of Delors' report through the treaty of Maastricht to the III stage of the Economic and Currency Union. Today is the arising and introduction of the EURO. In this part the effects of the creation of the Economic and Currency Union were presented. Unification of the currency and more effective payment mechanisms within the ECU favour further European integration. The rise of the EURO signifies a uniform European financial market with an equal for all currencies of the euro zone referential, short period interest rate. A serious competitor for the euro is the dollar. Tomorrow concerns the perspective introduction of the euro in Poland. A danger for Poland will be certainly the loss of independence in the conducting of monetary policy. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} process within the electronics design chain is adjusting to requirements {{caused by the}} complexity of today’s <b>and</b> <b>tomorrow’s</b> System <b>on</b> Chip (SoC) designs. Design for re-use is becoming a standard practice, sets new requirements for next generation tools and is leading to organizational changes within companies. Since 1998, we have discussed design methodology and tool requirements that would allow designers to create IP-dominated (SOC) devices at the system level of abstraction. This paper will review lessons learned in applying the proposed techniques to real design problems {{in the context of}} platform-based design. Furthermore this paper will review different techniques for IP Authoring required for modern SoC design. Different models of computation have to be supported to cover simulation and implementation of control, data flow and continuous time processing. Furthermore this paper will outline different techniques for IP Integration, focusing on early interaction within the design chain, between IP Creators and Integrators. The paper will close with lessons learned from user experiences by analyzing and comparing different use models of IP authoring for re-use and IP integration at the system level. Besides the model requirements for representing the IP blocks themselves, different solutions for test bench authoring and re-usable verification environments will be shown as well. 1...|$|R
40|$|A major {{virtue of}} von Neumann-Morgenstern utilities, for example, in the the-ory of general {{financial}} equilibrium (GFE), {{is that they}} ensure intertemporal con-sistency: consumption-portfolio plans (for the future) are in fact executed (in the future) — assuming that there is perfect foresight about relevant endogenous vari-ables. This note proposes an alternative to expected utility, one which also delivers consistency between plan and execution — and more. In particular, {{it turns out that}} one special case is in fact simply discounted (subjective) expected utility. Moreover, this alternative formulation affords an extremely natural setting for introducing ex-trinsic uncertainty. The key idea behind my approach is to divorce the concept of filtration (of the state space) from any considerations involving probability (on the state space), and then concentrate attention on nested utilities of consumption looking forward from any date-event: utility today depends only on consumption today and prospective utility of consumption tomorrow, utility <b>tomorrow</b> depends only <b>on</b> consumption <b>tomorrow</b> <b>and</b> prospective utility of consumption the day after <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>and</b> so <b>on.</b> JEL classification: D 61, D 81, D 9...|$|R

40|$|This article proposes both {{an agent}} {{representation}} and an agent communication model {{based on a}} social approach. By modelling Grid services with agents we are confident {{to be able to}} realise the interactive, dynamic generation of services that is necessary in order to have learning effects on interlocutors. The approach consists of integrating features from agent communication, language interpretation and e-learning/human-learning into a unique, original and simple view that privileges interactions, yet including control. The model is based on STROBE and proposes to enrich the languages of agents (Environment + Interpreter) by allowing agents to dynamically modify them – at run time – not only at the Data or Control level, but also at the Interpreter level (meta-level). The model is inscribed within a global approach, defending a shift from the classical algorithmic (control based) view to problem solving in computing to an interaction-based view of Social Informatics, where artificial as well as human agents operate by communicating as well as by computing. The paper shows how the model may not only account for the classical communication agent approaches, but also represent a fundamental advance in modelling societies of agents in particular in dynamic service generation scenarios such as those necessary today on the Web <b>and</b> proposed <b>tomorrow</b> <b>on</b> the Grid. Preliminary concrete experimentations illustrate the potential of the model; they are significant examples for a very wide class of computational and learning situations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The size of {{supercomputers}} {{in numbers}} of processors is growing exponentially. Today’s largest supercomputers have upwards {{of a hundred}} thousand processors <b>and</b> <b>tomorrow’s</b> may have <b>on</b> the order one million. The applications that run on these systems commonly coordinate their parallel activities via MPI; a trace of these MPI communication events is an important input for tools that visualize, simulate, or enable tuning of parallel applications. We introduce an efficient, accurate and flexible trace-driven performance modeling and prediction tool, PMaC's Open Source Interconnect and Network Simulator (PSINS), for MPI applications. A principal feature of PSINS is its usability for applications that scale up to large processor counts. PSINS generates compact and tractable event traces for fast and efficient simulations while producing accurate performance predictions. It also allows researchers to easily plug in different event trace formats and communication models, allowing it to interface gracefully with other tools. This provides a flexible framework for collaboratively exploring the implications of constantly growing supercomputers on application scaling, {{in the context of}} network architectures and topologies of state-of-the-art and future planned large-scale systems...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} The purpose {{of this paper}} is to explore the role and {{potential}} of packaging in order to obtain more sustainable goods flows. Design/methodology/approach An explorative research approach based on case survey methodology in which description, exploration and analysis of 34 reported cases are made. The empirical focus is goods flows in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) supply chains. Findings The insights presented highlights and provides guidance on the pros and cons packaging provides for sustainable goods flows in the FMCG industry. Research limitations/implications (if applicable) Based on knowledge and insights about the flows of goods <b>and</b> <b>tomorrows</b> requirements <b>on</b> sustainable societies, this paper reports on insights for making the goods flows in the FMCG industry sustainable based on a packaging perspective. The research has focused on FMCG goods flows, starting with the inbound flow of packaging at the product filler and ending at the retail outlet. Practical implications (if applicable) The insights can guide organisations to consider and reflect on how and when packaging enables or hinder sustainability aspects of goods flows. Extra effort should be on designing packaging system solutions that mitigate the negative effects of non-consumed products. What is original/value of paper While several studies have reported on the sustainability impact of logistics, transportation or supply chain structures, the perspective of packaging is rarely treated, neither in theory nor in practise. With a packaging perspective, the assessment of goods flows in supply chains is integrative, since packaging is naturally built on the intersection of logistics, marketing, sales, ergonomics and environmental considerations...|$|R
40|$|It is very {{important}} to recognize that the future of e-government cannot be thought through in isolation, it cannot be assessed as a series of administrative tasks or a wider set of measures aimed at making the state more efficient. The administration of today <b>and</b> <b>tomorrow</b> essentially depends <b>on</b> the changes of the economy, society and culture as well. Local governments and public administration serve the interests of citizens and businesses alike, therefore public administration significantly depends on the knowledge, consciousness and mentality of individuals and enterprises, too. However, it is still an open question whether enterprises in Austria and Hungary actually have the IT infrastructure enabling them to adopt the devices of e-governance at a faster pace. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the differences and similarities in the usage of information systems in different size categories in Austria and Hungary. More precisely, it examines how frequently information systems are used in four of the pre-defined size categories (microenterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises and corporations) in both countries. Microenterprises in Hungary hardly used any information systems. When comparing the two countries, the smallest difference could be observed in the use of information systems by corporations...|$|R
