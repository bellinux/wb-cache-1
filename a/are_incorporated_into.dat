5|$|However, in dinoflagellates, {{the nuclear}} {{envelope}} remains intact, the centrosomes {{are located in}} the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.|$|E

5|$|Stable {{isotopes}} of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur {{can establish}} avian migratory connectivity between wintering sites and breeding grounds. Stable isotopic methods to establish migratory linkage rely on spatial isotopic differences in bird diet that <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> inert tissues like feathers, or into growing tissues such as claws and muscle or blood.|$|E
5|$|The main {{position}} on Spirit baptism among the Reformed churches, dispensationalists, and many Baptists {{is that the}} baptism with the Holy Spirit occurs simultaneously with regeneration, when those who have faith in Jesus Christ receive the Holy Spirit and <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the body of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E

Although the game was released in 2011, the score was not officially released until October 30, 2013 on iTunes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} range, {{parts of the}} medieval {{buildings}} survive and <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> staircase ten — the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, {{can be seen to}} have been built neatly on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E

5|$|The Fate/stay night anime {{is based}} on the visual novel Fate/stay night by Type-Moon. The episodes are {{directed}} by Yuji Yamaguchi, animated by Studio Deen and produced by the Fate Project, which included Geneon Entertainment, TBS, CREi, Type-Moon and Frontier Works Inc. The plot of the episodes is primarily based on the Fate storyline in the Fate/stay night visual novel, although certain elements of the other two storylines, Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel, <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the plot.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> eruption columns as {{they are}} ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At {{a point where the}} bulk density of the column {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E
5|$|The game's on-disc soundtrack {{contains}} 94 mixes, most {{made from}} two songs; over 100 individual songs <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> these mixes. Some mixes feature {{only a single}} song mixed with itself. Ten songs on disc include a guitar track that can be played using a Guitar Hero or other compatible controller alongside the DJ mixing player in the game's DJ vs Guitar mode. The game supports additional content through downloadable tracks from the game consoles' respective online stores. While most on-disc mixes were created by FreeStyleGames, several DJs have contributed mixes to the game, including Grandmaster Flash, DJ Shadow, DJ AM, DJ Z-Trip, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and the Scratch Perverts; other DJ artists provided future downloadable content.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-two {{amino acids}} are {{naturally}} incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids. Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code. The remaining 2, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a SECIS element, which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine {{instead of a}} stop codon. Pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a stop codon in other organisms. This UAG codon {{is followed by a}} PYLIS downstream sequence.|$|E
5|$|In Angry Birds, {{the player}} {{controls}} {{a flock of}} multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen {{by a group of}} hungry green pigs. In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs. The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs.|$|E
5|$|The {{infectious}} isoform of PrP, {{known as}} PrPSc, {{is able to}} convert normal PrPC proteins into the infectious isoform by changing their conformation, or shape; this, in turn, alters the way the proteins interconnect. PrPSc always causes prion disease. Although the exact 3D structure of PrPSc is not known, it has {{a higher proportion of}} β-sheet structure in place of the normal α-helix structure. Aggregations of these abnormal isoforms form highly structured amyloid fibers, which accumulate to form plaques. It is unclear as to whether these aggregates are the cause of cell damage or are simply a side-effect of the underlying disease process. The end of each fiber acts as a template onto which free protein molecules may attach, allowing the fiber to grow. Under most circumstances, only PrP molecules with an identical amino acid sequence to the infectious PrPSc <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the growing fiber. However, rare cross-species transmission is also possible.|$|E

5|$|The story depicts how {{suffering}} {{is essential to}} completing one's destiny. Southey's purpose in Thalaba, however, is to describe {{as many of the}} various myths and superstitions that he can, and this interferes with the resolving of moral problems within the story. Instead, the moral lessons are formulaic and the events focus on awards given to those who are obedient. Southey's emphasis on the actual mythic incidents over the moral events are backed up with more than 80 pages of his own notes that describe the various references to traditional myths or mythic creatures that <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the story. In terms of structure, the unilateral plot keeps Thalaba does not allow for an easy flow into various mythic incidents. Instances of the plot being supplanted by the myths can be found during the descriptions of the story of Irem, Haruth and Maruth, or others.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{development}} of Red and Green, all Pokémon {{were designed by}} Ken Sugimori, a long-time friend of Tajiri, {{and a team of}} fewer than ten people, including Atsuko Nishida who is credited as the designer of Pikachu. By 2013 a team of 20artists worked together to create new species designs. A committee of five people determine which designs <b>are</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the games, with Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida finalizing the look of each creature. Furthermore, Sugimori is responsible for the boxart legendary Pokémon and all of the official artwork for the games. According to Yoshida, the number of rejected Pokémon designs is five to ten times more than the number that are finalized in each game. In rare cases, rejected designs are brought back and released in a later generation. Shigeru Ohmori, director of Sun and Moon, admitted that creating new Pokémon has become a difficult task with the sheer number of creatures designed over the franchise's 20-year history. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.|$|E
