5000|$|By design, it is {{physically}} impossible to mount EF-S lenses on EF-only cameras. This {{is because the}} increased proximity of the lens to the sensor means that on full-frame sensor or 35mm film EF cameras the lens itself would obstruct the mirror's movement and cause damage to the lens and/or camera. While {{it is possible to}} modify the lens such that the physical obstruction is removed, allowing for mounting to EF mount cameras, the rear of the lens would still obstruct the mirror. An additional reason is that the lenses produce a smaller image circle of even illumination (circle of no vignetting). An EF-S lens <b>alignment</b> <b>mark</b> is indicated by a small white rectangle, whereas the EF employs a small red dot. The lens will insert into the body when the alignment marks on each are matched, and the lens can then be rotated and locked into the operating position. EF-S camera bodies have both EF-S and EF alignment marks, while EF bodies have only EF marks. Some have reported success attaching EF-S lenses to full-frame bodies with the use of an extension tube; however, this does not eliminate the vignetting problem, and also removes the lens's ability to achieve infinity focus. Also, attachment of EF-S lenses on EF bodies can often be accomplished by removing the small plastic ring seen in the photo above. Although vignetting is still an issue, photos can be taken, and infinity focus achieved. This modification comes with caveats, one being that on some lenses, like the EF-S 10-22mm, at the 10mm setting, the element protrudes too far back toward EF mount camera bodies.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} crucial {{challenges}} in lithography is achieving rapid and accurate alignment under {{a wide variety of}} conditions brought about by different processing steps.

40|$|As the {{dimensions}} of semiconductor devices continue to shrink, mask alignment becomes increasingly important and difficult. The required accuracy of alignment {{is only a few}} percent of the used wavelengths. In optical projection lithography, the position of a wafer with respect to a mask is determined by the analysis of the light that is diffracted from an <b>alignment</b> <b>mark</b> on the wafer. The profile shape, depth, and asymmetry of the <b>alignment</b> <b>mark</b> significantly affect the observed alignment signal. In order to predict the influence of these factors, the simulation of the alignment system becomes necessary. We compare rigorous methods for the simulation of light diffraction from the <b>alignment</b> <b>mark,</b> such as the finite-difference time-domain method, rigorous coupled wave analysis, and the waveguide method (WG) to the Fresnel method that has been used in the past. It is shown that the three rigorous methods used in this study demonstrate a good convergence. For the specific geometry and material parameters of the <b>alignment</b> <b>mark</b> used in our investigations, WG is most appropriate for fast work. The difference between Fresnel and rigorous methods becomes important when the height of the <b>alignment</b> <b>mark</b> exceeds 30 % of the wavelength of the alignment system...|$|E

Throughout the process, polyimide {{was used as the}} substrate, coated by Epoclad as claddings, then AP 2210 B and WPR 5100 were used to fabricate waveguides and 45 degree mirror couplers, respectively. In addition, precisely aligned mirror couplers to waveguides are fabricated by using polymer-based, non-metallic, and transparent <b>alignment</b> <b>marks.</b> Conventional and metallic <b>alignment</b> <b>marks</b> are easy to be detected by camera, when a layer of high reflective material, generally Cr metal, is patterned. However, transparent polymer material is used in this process, as <b>alignment</b> <b>marks</b> made of it which are actually buried phase structures. Therefore, it is hardly to be observed by conventional microscopy system.

30|$|Once a {{suitable}} piece of graphene has been deposited and identified using the procedure described above, {{the next step}} is to electrically contact the graphene with metal electrodes using e-beam lithography. We begin by spinning on a layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) e-beam resist and baking on a hotplate at 180 °C for 2 minutes. Then we use e-beam lithography to write a 2 mm by 2 mm grid of alignment marks at roughly the location of the graphene, and develop in a solution of methyl isobutyl ketone:isopropal alcohol (MIBK:IPA) 1 : 3 for 5 – 10 seconds. This quick development leaves <b>alignment</b> <b>mark</b> “holes” in the PMMA, which we use for alignment in the following e-beam lithography step, eliminating the need for metal <b>alignment</b> <b>mark</b> deposition or another PMMA spin step.

40|$|The Laser Step Alignment (LSA) is a through- the-lens, field-by-field {{alignment}} system {{developed for}} an optical step- and- repeat {{system with a}} reduction projection lens (wafer stepper) intended for one micron or submicron lithography. The laser beam used for LSA is focused on a wafer through the projection lens. The alignment marks on the wafer are {{in the shape of}} diffraction gratings. The mark detection is performed by moving the wafer stage so that the <b>alignment</b> <b>mark</b> travels across the laser beam.

The LSA system achieves overlay accuracy (2 aa) less than 0. 15 um for processed wafers.

The alignment time is about 0 - 6 seconds per shot in field-by-field mode.

This micro-fabrication process combines both bulk and surface micromachining, which include the isotropic wet etching, a novel mask design, the thick photo resist coating and exposure, and high-aspect-ratio curved sacrificial technique. In isotropic wet etching of a hemispherical cavity, the optimal concentration of etchant is experimentally determined along with adequate ultrasonic vibration during wet etching to produce the circle-like of hemispherical cavity.

The thick photo resist, AZ 4620, is found to be able to overcome this problem and be successfully exposed all through its bottom surface. Furthermore, the deposited sacrificial layer materials (PSG) on this cavity will usually result in thinner layer near the corner. In addition, the curved gap of PSG layer has the feature with high-aspect-ratio. These make the PSG etching difficult. Therefore, two steps etching process with two different hydrofluoric concentrations are used to release the PSG with 2 µm thickness and 150 µm arc length...|$|E
40|$|Alignment is a {{very basic}} and {{important}} process in manufacturing. An alignment process can affect a level of manufacturing precision and accuracy that in turn affects a product in terms of quality, yield and cost. This thesis is aimed at investigating an ultra-high resolution alignment system. As the atomic resolution of Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is well established, {{we are interested in}} investigating the possibility of utilizing SPM as a part of an ultra high-resolution alignment system. Even though SPM itself has a high resolution, there are other issues that have to be resolved before the high-resolution potential of SPM can be realized. One of the problems is caused by the edge roughness of mark line. Even in a good system, the edge roughness varies from around 6 nm to 30 nm (3 σ). Therefore, there is no absolute center for an <b>alignment</b> <b>mark</b> {{and it is difficult to}} position the mark without a not well-defined mark center. Also, in the existing SPM systems, raster scanning is commonly used to obtain a picture of the area scanned. However, this method if applied to alignment systems, becomes very time consuming and not efficient in locating an <b>alignment</b> <b>mark.</b> A Close Loop Scanning SPM Alignment System is proposed in this thesis. It is aimed at overcoming some of the above-mentioned problems. In order to conduct the investigation, a simulation approach has to be used due to the complexity of the uncertainties. A theoretical method for random mark edge generation with parameters determination based on real experimental measurements has been used. A simulation program has been written to examine the manner in which the roughness of the mark edge can affect alignment precision and accuracy. Different alignment methods based on the Close Loop Scanning are presented in this research. The simulation program helps to demonstrate that when the roughness of a line edge is around 6 nm the accuracy of our system achieved by using "Multi-Radius Scanning Method" could be under 0. 25 nm and repeatability (3 σ) of our system achieved by "Fixed-Radius Scanning Method" could be under 0. 45 nm.
