5|$|In {{respect to}} the Greek {{language}} question, it becomes obvious that {{from the very beginning}} Hermes o Logios adhered to Korais’ views. Korais claimed that the <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> for the Greek nation should be a vernacular (Demotic) language without foreign words and accepted some views by conservative scholars to retain a tincure of archaism. On the other hand, some of Korais' opponents, both conservatives and vernacularists, published their own magazines in which they attacked his linguistic views.|$|E

By taking the treaties with Aboriginal peoples at face value and extending the benefit of doubt to the people subject to the treaties, Allmand extended the rule of law to Aboriginal witnesses in a largely unprecedented manner.|$|E

500|$|Ico uses minimal dialog in {{a fictional}} {{language}} {{to provide the}} story throughout the game. [...] Voice actors included Kazuhiro Shindō as Ico, Rieko Takahashi as Yorda, and Misa Watanabe as the Queen. [...] Ico and the Queen's words are presented in either English or Japanese subtitles depending on the release region, but Yorda's speech is presented in a symbolic language. [...] Ueda opted not to provide the translation for Yorda's words {{as it would have}} overcome the language barrier between Ico and Yorda, and detracted from the [...] "holding hands" [...] concept of the game. [...] In the non-North American releases, playing through the game again after completing the game replaces the symbolic text with <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> subtitles.|$|E
500|$|The episode employs what {{literary}} theorist Mikhail Bakhtin {{calls the}} carnivalesque. As Ethan Thompson explains in his article, [...] "Good Demo, Bad Taste: South Park as Carnivalesque Satire", the style {{consists of four}} crucial elements: humor, bodily excess, linguistic games that challenge official discourse, and the inversion of social structures. Cartman's body—his obesity and his inability to control his farting—is supposed to exemplify the grotesque. The boys swear throughout the episode, using words and phrases such as [...] "fat ass" [...] and [...] "dildo", challenging the boundaries of <b>appropriate</b> <b>language.</b> Finally, the social structure of the town is inverted, as the episode focuses on {{the knowledge that the}} four boys have of the aliens as opposed to the ignorant and incompetent adults. Moreover, the aliens perceive the cows as more intelligent than the humans, inverting the species order.|$|E
500|$|The writing {{style was}} {{positively}} received as being vivid and well-written, sometimes grim, but with <b>appropriate</b> <b>language.</b> Even an overall negative review by Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post remarked the writing was [...] "always lucid, sometimes elegant". In The New York Times Book Review Jennifer Schuessler said Weisman has a [...] "flirtation with religious language, his occasionally portentous impassivity {{giving way to}} the familiar rhetoric of eco-hellfire". Janet Maslin of The New York Times found the writing had [...] "an arid, plain, what-if style" [...] while being [...] "strangely uniform in tone". On the reporting techniques, Kamiya wrote that [...] " [...] science reporting, at once lucid and full of wonder ... is {{the heart and soul}} of this book" [...] and that it is [...] "written as if by a compassionate and curious observer on another planet". The Plain Dealer book editor Karen Long said Weisman [...] "uses the precise, unhurried language of a good science writer and shows a knack for unearthing unexpected sources and provocative facts".|$|E
40|$|This study {{intended}} {{to answer the}} following research questions: (1) What is Mr. Ali Mahakam's linguistic repertoire? In other words, what languages does Mr. Ali Mahakam have? (2) What factors influenced Mr. Ali Mahakam to choose <b>appropriate</b> <b>languages?</b> Using the following instruments, the writer then collected the data, which were later analyzed using the two sets of parameters. (1) The researcher's background knowledge, the dictionaries, the consultants were used to identify Mr. Ali Mahakam's linguistic repertoire. (2) Setting, participants, topic and function were used to identify the factors that influenced Mr. Ali Mahakam to choose <b>appropriate</b> <b>languages</b> for communicating with people around him. The analysis brought the following results as the answer to each research problem and hence fulfill each objectives. (1) Mr. Ali Mahakam's linguistic repertoire is Indonesian, Javanese, Chinese, English. (2) The factors that influenced Mr. Ali Mahakam to choose <b>appropriate</b> <b>languages</b> were setting, participants, topic, function. In any setting and situation, Mr. Ali Mahakam used Indonesian and Javanese. Whomever he talked to, he always used Indonesian and Javanese, too. In any topics and functions, he chose Indonesian and Javanese. Those two languages were mostly used because they were daily languages so all the participants understood these languages well. While, Chinese and English were not frequently used as these languages were not understood by all participants. This study, the writer believes, is far from perfect. So, it is suggested that following researchers take subjects who are not bound into one family and have more linguistic repertoire. What's more, future researchers make use of formal situations such as business meetings or meeting government officers...|$|R

2500|$|Hymes {{formulated}} {{a response}} to Noam Chomsky's influential distinction between competence (knowledge of grammatical rules necessary to decoding and producing language) and performance (actual language use in context). Hymes objected to the marginalization of performance {{from the center of}} linguistic inquiry and proposed the notion of communicative competence, or knowledge necessary to use language in social context, as an object of linguistic inquiry. Since <b>appropriate</b> <b>language</b> use is conventionally defined, and varies across different communities, much of Hymes early work frames a project for ethnographic investigation into contrasting patterns of language use across speech communities. Hymes termed this approach [...] "the ethnography of speaking." [...] The SPEAKING acronym, described below, was presented as a lighthearted heuristic to aid fieldworkers in their attempt to document and analyze instances of language in use, which he termed [...] "speech events." [...] Embedded in the acronym is an application and extension of Jakobson's arguments concerning the multifunctionality of language. He articulated other, more technical, often typologically oriented approaches to variation in patterns of language use across speech communities in a series of articles.|$|E
