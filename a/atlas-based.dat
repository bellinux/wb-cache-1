40|$|A novel <b>atlas-based</b> {{segmentation}} approach {{based on}} the combination of multiple registrations is presented. Multiple atlases are registered to a target image.

Furthermore, an atlas selection procedure is proposed that is equivalent to sequential forward selection from statistical pattern recognition theory. The proposed method is compared to three existing <b>atlas-based</b> segmentation approaches, namely 1) single <b>atlas-based</b> segmentation, 2) average-shape <b>atlas-based</b> segmentation, and 3) multi-atlas-based segmentation with averaging as decision fusion.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the FA values derived with the {{streamline}} tractography analysis {{were significantly higher}} than those from the <b>atlas-based</b> analysis, despite moderate correlation between these two measures.

Alternatively, these lower FA values may be due to partial volume effects. In the case of ABI, it is difficult to separate between these two effects (of degeneration and partial volume), as degeneration of the tract would be expected to cause a loss of white matter volume and a reduction in the “number of tracts” in the region previously occupied by the tract prior to the injury.

We compared the performance of an individual-based method for corpus callosum (CC) fiber tracking in MS with those of two <b>atlas-based</b> methods. METHODS: Brain DT MRI scans were acquired from 35 patients with MS and 18 age-matched healthy volunteers (HV). DT-derived metrics from the CC-the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) -were calculated using an individual-based and two <b>atlas-based</b> methods with different types of subject registration (linear and nonlinear) to a CC atlas. Customized termination criteria were applied to stop the tracking algorithm when using the individual-based method. RESULTS: All the methods were able to distinguish between MS patients and HV. Using the individual-based method, stronger relationships were found between CC DT-derived metrics and the subjects' clinical condition. CONCLUSION: CC DT tractography using an individual-based method is more sensitive than the <b>atlas-based</b> ones to tract-specific alterations related to MS disability.

40|$|It is {{well known}} in the pattern {{recognition}} community that the accuracy of classifications obtained by combining decisions made by independent classifiers can be substantially higher than the accuracy of the individual classifiers. We have previously shown this to be true for <b>atlas-based</b> segmentation of biomedical images. The conventional method for combining individual classifiers weights each classifier equally (vote or sum rule fusion). In this paper, we propose two methods that estimate the performances of the individual classifiers and combine the individual classifiers by weighting them according to their estimated performance. The two methods are multiclass extensions of an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for ground truth estimation of binary classification based on decisions of multiple experts (Warfield et al., 2004). The first method performs parameter estimation independently for each class with a subsequent integration step. The second method considers all classes simultaneously. We demonstrate the efficacy of these performance-based fusion methods by applying them to <b>atlas-based</b> segmentations of three-dimensional confocal microscopy images of bee brains. In <b>atlas-based</b> image segmentation, multiple classifiers arise naturally by applying different registration methods to the same atlas, or the same registration method to different atlases, or both. We perform a validation study designed to quantify the success of classifier combination methods in <b>atlas-based</b> segmentation.

40|$|<b>Atlas-based</b> {{segmentation}} is {{an increasingly}} popular method of automatically computing a segmentation. In the past, results of <b>atlas-based</b> segmentation {{have been evaluated}} using a volume overlap measure such as the Dice or Jaccard coefficients. However, {{in the first part}} of this paper we will argue and show that volume overlap measures are insensitive to local deviations. As a result, a segmentation that is judged to be of good quality when using such a measure may have large local deviations that may be problematic in clinical practice. In this paper, two versions of the surface distance are proposed as an alternative measure to evaluate the results of <b>atlas-based</b> segmentation, as they give more local information and therefore allow the detection of large local deviations. In most current <b>atlas-based</b> segmentation methods, the results of multiple atlases are combined to a single segmentation in a process called 'label fusion'. In a label fusion process it is important that segmentations with a high quality can be distinguished from those with a low quality. In the second part of the paper we will use the surface distance as a similarity measure during label fusion. We will present a modified version of the previously proposed SIMPLE algorithm, which selects propagated atlas segmentations based on their similarity with a preliminary estimate of the ground truth segmentation.

This method is time-consuming, not {{well suited for}} large series of samples and can be discordant to measurements of CN- 1 protein concentrations. To overcome these limitations, we developed sandwich ELISA assays using different anti-CN- 1 antibodies, i. e., ATLAS (polyclonal IgG) and RYSK 173 (monoclonal IgG 1). With the <b>ATLAS-based</b> assay, similar amounts of CN- 1 were detected in serum and both EDTA and heparin plasma. The RYSKS 173 -based assay detected CN- 1 in serum in all individuals at significantly lower concentrations compared to the <b>ATLAS-based</b> assay (range: 0. 1 - 1. 8 vs. 1 - 50 mu g/ml, RYSK- vs. <b>ATLAS-based,</b> P < 0. 01). CN- 1 detection with the RYSK-based assay was increased in EDTA plasma, albeit at significantly lower concentrations compared to ATLAS. In heparin plasma, CN- 1 was also poorly detected with the RYSK-based assay. Addition of DTT to serum increased the detection of CN- 1 in the RYSK-based assay almost to the levels found in the <b>ATLAS-based</b> assay. Both ELISA assays were highly reproducible (R: 0. 99, P < 0. 01 and R: 0. 93, P < 0. 01, for the RYSK- and <b>ATLAS-based</b> assays, respectively). Results of the <b>ATLAS-based</b> assay showed a positive correlation with CN- 1 activity (R: 0. 62, P < 0. 01), while {{this was not the}} case for the RYSK-based assay. However, there was a negative correlation between CN- 1 activity and the proportion of CN- 1 detected in the RYSK-based assay, i. e., CN- 1 detected with the RYSK-based assay/CN- 1 detected with the <b>ATLAS-based</b> assay x 100 % (Spearman-Rang correlation coefficient: - 0. 6, P < 0. 01), suggesting that the RYSK-based assay most likely detects a CN- 1 conformation with low CN- 1 activity. RYSK 173 and ATLAS antibodies reacted similarly in Western blot, irrespective of PNGase treatment. Binding of RYSK 173 in serum was not due to differential N-glycosylation as demonstrated by mutant CN- 1 cDNA constructs. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a good correlation between enzyme activity and CN- 1 protein concentration in ELISA and suggests the presence of different CN- 1 conformations in serum. The relevance of these different conformations is still elusive and needs to be addressed in further studies...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE Objective {{determination}} of the orbital volume {{is important in the}} diagnostic process and in evaluating the efficacy of medical and/or surgical treatment of orbital diseases. Tools designed to measure orbital volume with computed tomography (CT) often cannot be used with cone beam CT (CBCT) because of inferior tissue representation, although CBCT has the benefit of greater availability and lower patient radiation exposure. Therefore, a model-based segmentation technique is presented as a new method for measuring orbital volume and compared to alternative techniques. METHODS Both eyes from thirty subjects with no known orbital pathology who had undergone CBCT as a part of routine care were evaluated ([Formula: see text] eyes). Orbital volume was measured with manual, <b>atlas-based,</b> and model-based segmentation methods. Volume measurements, volume determination time, and usability were compared between the three methods. Differences in means were tested for statistical significance using two-tailed Student's t tests. RESULTS Neither <b>atlas-based</b> [Formula: see text] nor model-based [Formula: see text] measurements were significantly different from manual volume measurements [Formula: see text]. However, the time required to determine orbital volume was significantly longer for manual measurements ([Formula: see text] min) than for <b>atlas-based</b> ([Formula: see text] min, [Formula: see text]) or model-based ([Formula: see text] min, [Formula: see text]) measurements. CONCLUSION All three orbital volume measurement methods examined can accurately measure orbital volume, although <b>atlas-based</b> and model-based methods seem to be more user-friendly and less time-consuming. The new model-based technique achieves fully automated segmentation results, whereas all <b>atlas-based</b> segmentations at least required manipulations to the anterior closing. Additionally, model-based segmentation can provide reliable orbital volume measurements when CT image quality is poor...|$|E

With these applications in mind, we describe how a realistic, patient-specific, pseudo-CT of the head {{can be derived from}} anatomical MR images.

We use a deformable registration algorithm known as the Morphon and augment it with a certainty mask that allows a tailoring of the influence certain regions are allowed to have on the registration. Moreover, we propose a novel method of fusion, wherein the collection of deformed CTs is iteratively registered to their joint mean and find that the resulting mean CT becomes more similar to the target CT. However, the voxelwise median provided even better results; at least as good as earlier work that required special MR imaging techniques.

30|$|One {{advantage}} of both streamline tractography and probabilistic tractography methods over <b>atlas-based</b> approaches {{is that they}} can be applied in native space, without registration to a template. While image registration and normalisation methods have demonstrated high reliability and accuracy in healthy brains [16], registration methods can provide inappropriate solutions when applied to images from patients with stroke or other brain injuries, where lesioned brains are matched to a template with no brain lesions [17, 18]. However, while <b>atlas-based</b> analyses can be automated to a large extent, streamline tractography results are dependent on manual delineations of the seed and target regions, so the results are arguably more operator-dependent than those from <b>atlas-based</b> analyses. In addition, streamline tractography methods are less accurate in cases where the raw DTI images were collected with a non-isotropic voxel resolution. Clinical DTI protocols like those utilised in the present study with a slice thickness (3  mm) considerably greater than the reconstructed in-plane resolution (0.94 × 0.94  mm) may, therefore, be less suited to streamline tractography analyses than protocols with an isotropic voxel resolution [19].|$|E
