The teacher lived in our home where we were taught discipline <b>along</b> <b>with</b> our <b>education.</b> <b>My</b> family was settled in Hyderabad Deccan, which was then a paramount cultural center in undivided India. Although {{there were a few}} prominent schools e.g. Saint Josephs School, although my grandfather could afford the fee (which was Rs. 20), he still preferred to educate us at home. These schools were primarily attended by pampered girls from the elite families of nawabs and jagirdars. From the beginning we were taught self-sufficiency, although we employed 60 to 70 servants, we were not allowed to ask anyone of them for water. There was a huge difference between girls of the elite families and us. My grandfather felt that if we attended such schools, we would suffer from an inferiority complex, but since proper upbringing is not possible without coaching, he decided to carry out our education at home. Nevertheless, we were taught all the subjects that were taught in the formal Hyderabad schools with separate teachers for every subject e.g. calligraphy and math." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea for}} my project derives from <b>my</b> {{personal}} experiences <b>with</b> lectures in NCI, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> experiences <b>with</b> <b>education</b> in general. While communication with majority of lectures are great, {{there are others}} where lack of communication has been {{the difference between an}} honours and a pass for myself and fellow classmates. Even though we are in third level education, I feel as though people still take somewhat of an embarrassment if they don’t understand something their fellow peers do. I know that on multiple occasions there have been times where at the end of lectures, lecturers will give an opportunity for students to ask questions or ask if they want to go over anything again. The majority of the time students will not ask questions or interact in anyway, {{and at the same time}} these students are asking for extra classes at the end of semesters and complaining that the lecturer wasn’t good enough or offering enough help, when this is not necessarily the case. “LectComm” will allow students and lecturers to interact with each other at a more optimal level, by using a timestamped messaging service that allows the lecturer to view messages at his/her own leisure. This will also lead to less interruptions being taken away from valuable class time. I believe that this applications concept is easy to use and when completed will have a very user friendly interface and provide a beneficial service to all users...|$|R
