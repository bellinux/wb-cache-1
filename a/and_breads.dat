When used as a topping, it is typically added just before the dish is served. It has also been served melted atop dishes, whereby it is placed atop foods {{during the last few}} minutes of cooking. It may be used in the place of a sauce, and a small amount can significantly add to a dish's overall flavor.|$|E

Azuki beans are generally eaten as patbap, which is a bowl of rice mixed with the beans, or as a filling and covering for tteok (rice cake) <b>and</b> <b>breads.</b> A porridge made with azuki beans, called patjuk, is commonly eaten during the winter season. On Dongjinal, a Korean traditional holiday which falls on December 22, Korean people eat donji patjuk, which contains saealsim (새알심), a ball made from glutinous rice flour. In old Korean tradition, patjuk is believed to have the power to drive evil spirits away.|$|E
25|$|The town of Pinal de Amoles, {{was founded}} as Real de San José de Amoles, {{in the early}} 17th century as a mining camp. Today, much of that mining has disappeared, but the town remains. It is located 153km north of the state capital, {{straddling}} Federal Highway 120, which connects it to San Juan del Río {{in the south and}} the state of San Luis Potosí in the north. The town located at an altitude of 2,320 meters above sea level, on small flat spaces on a mountain with a population of 1,582 (2005). For this reason, it has narrow winding streets and many inclines. Most of the streets are of cobblestone and many houses are painted red, ochre or yellow, with colorful balconies. There is no municipal market but the traditional tianguis is held on Sundays. This features basic products, especially locally produced fruits and vegetables in season. It also features locally produced coffee <b>and</b> <b>breads</b> such as pan de pulque (pulque bread).|$|E

40|$|Between 1759 and 1820, 46 or more {{community}} flour <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> societies {{were established}} in England and Scotland. They were self-help retail organisations set up in response to rising <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> flour prices and to the perceived malpractices of intermediaries in the corn market. Unadulternated 'pure' flour <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> were sold to members at 'prime cost'. The societies were a rudimentary form of 'co-operative' business organisation and were either owned directly by consumers or were operated indirectly through a friendly society. There were four main categories of flour <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> company, small flour clubs, shipwright societies (in naval dockyards), friendly society corn mills, and joint stock flour <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> companies. The large societies such as the Hull Anti Mill, the Sheffield Club Mill, and the Birmingham Flour <b>and</b> <b>Bread</b> Company were vertically integrated consumer organisations operating with transferable stock in breach of the 1720 Bubble Act. The means used to manage the societies were a combination of friendly society and company approaches. These institutions received actual or tacit support from the authorities and successfully fought the prosecution of the three largest societies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{retention}} and speciation of selenium in flour <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> was determined following experimental applications of selenium fertilisers to a high-yielding UK wheat crop. Flour <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> were produced using standard commercial practices. Total selenium {{was measured using}} inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the profile of selenium species in the flour <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ICP-MS. The selenium concentration of flour ranged from 30 ng/g in white flour and 35 ng/g in wholemeal flour from untreated plots up to > 1800 ng/g in white and > 2200 ng/g in wholemeal flour processed from grain treated with selenium (as selenate) at the highest application rate of 100 g/ha. The relationship {{between the amount of}} selenium applied to the crop and the amount of selenium in flour <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> was approximately linear, indicating minimal loss of Se during grain processing <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> production. On average, application of selenium at 10 g/ha increased total selenium in white <b>and</b> wholemeal <b>bread</b> by 155 <b>and</b> 185 ng/g, respectively, equivalent to 6. 4 and 7. 1 μg selenium per average slice of white <b>and</b> wholemeal <b>bread,</b> respectively. Selenomethionine accounted for 65 - 87 % of total extractable selenium species in Se-enriched flour and bread; selenocysteine, Se-methylselenocysteine selenite and selenate were also detected. Controlled agronomic biofortification of wheat crops for flour <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> production could provide an appropriate strategy to increase the intake of bioavailable selenium...|$|R

The author notes that bacon is not as bad nutritionally as had previously been thought. He compares the nutritional characteristics of two slices of cooked bacon to one pork hot dog, noting that the bacon contains approximately [...] "73 calories, 202 milligrams of sodium, 6 grams of fat and 11 milligrams of cholesterol", while the hot dog has [...] "182 calories, 638 milligrams of sodium, 17 grams of fat and 29 milligrams of cholesterol". [...] "If health concerns sometimes make you feel guilty about loving bacon ... relax ...yes, it’s high in sodium and fat, but if eaten in moderation or used as a flavoring agent ... it is a guilt free indulgence," [...] writes Villas. Breakfast dishes include French Cheese and Bacon souffle, and Bacon Scrapple. A recipe for BLT sandwich is included in the section on sandwiches, but the majority of Villas's other sandwich recipes are more extreme, and include ingredients such as Jamaican smoked fish. Dishes that contain vegetables include Lima Bean and Bacon Casserole; and Spanish Chicken, Bacon, Meatball and Chickpea Stew. For dessert, Villas includes six recipes such as bacon-wrapped figs, and Bacon and Peanut Butter Chocolate Truffles, and Portuguese Egg and Bacon Pudding.|$|E
