40|$|In this paper, a low cost, high {{performance}} and full PC-based sensor {{system for the}} pulsed {{gas metal arc welding}} (PGMAW) is described. It allows the visual online observation of all states of the welding process, including the material transition, and all welding situations without an <b>additional</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>unit.</b> Additionally, the synchronized measurement of the welding current and welding voltage signals during image recording and the extraction of characteristic parameters of the signals (average values, etc.) is possible. Furthermore, the system allows the visual analysis of the material transition images. The system can be used for the optimization and the analysis of the welding process using visual information of the material transition and electrical welding parameters...|$|E

The use and care of the <b>light</b> <b>units</b> included in the study were found to be very variable.

40|$|The new {{generation}} LED curing <b>light</b> <b>units</b> have significantly improved curing performance compared to first generation lights, {{and even some}} second generation LED curing <b>light</b> <b>units.</b> This study compared the curing performance of 10 {{new generation}} LED <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> (FLASH-lite 1401, LE Demetron 1, Coltolux, Ultra-Lume 5, Mini LED, bluephase, Elipar FreeLight 2, Radii, Smartlite IQ and Allegro) for depth of cure against a high-powered halogen curing <b>light</b> <b>unit</b> (Optilux 501). Depth of cure measurements were utilized per the ANSI/ADA No 27 standard to detect differences between the lights at three time intervals (10, 20 and 40 seconds). A total of 660 samples were prepared (n= 10 /group). A full factorial ANOVA and Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s HSD test showed FLASH-lite 1401 performed significantly {{better than the other}} lights at 10 - and 20 -second time intervals (p 3 ̆c 0. 01).

40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigated}} the effect of infection control barrier thickness on power density, wave-length, and light diffusion of <b>light</b> curing <b>units.</b> Materials and Methods: Infection control barrier (Cleanwrap) in one-fold, two-fold, four-fold, and eight-fold, and a halogen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> (Optilux 360) and a light emitting diode (LED) <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> (Elipar FreeLight 2) were used in this study. Power density of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> with infection control barriers covering the fiberoptic bundle was measured with a hand held dental radiometer (Cure Rite). Wavelength of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> fixed on a custom made optical breadboard was measured with a portable spectroradiometer (CS- 1000). Light diffusion of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> was photographed with DSLR (Nikon D 70 s) as above. Results: Power density decreased significantly as the layer thickness of the infection control barrier increased, except the one-fold and two-fold in halogen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit.</b> Especially, when the barrier was four-fold and more in the halogen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit,</b> the decrease of power density was more prominent. The wavelength of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> was not affected by the barriers and almost no change was detected in the peak wavelength. Light diffusion of LED <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> was not affected by barriers, however, halo-gen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> showed decrease in light diffusion angle when the barrier was four-fold and statisti...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare {{efficiency}} of broad spectrum LEDs (VALO�, Ultradent, USA) with conventional LED curing lights (EliparTM Freelight 2, 3 M ESPE, USA) using a microhardness test. The <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> used were VALO � in three different modes and EliparTM Freelight 2. The exposure time was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cured resin specimens were stored in physiological saline at 37 ℃ for 24 hours, microhardness was measured using Vickers microhardness tester. The microhard-ness of upper and lower sides of the specimens were analyzed separately by the ANOVA method (Analysis of Variance) with a significance level set at 5 %. At upper side of resin specimens, an increased microhardness was observed in the broad spectrum LED curing <b>light</b> <b>unit</b> with a high power mode for 4 seconds and plasma emulation mode for 20 seconds (p < 0. 05). However, at the lower side of resin specimens, there were no significant differences in microhardness between broad spectrum LED curing <b>light</b> <b>unit</b> and conventional LED curing <b>light</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R
