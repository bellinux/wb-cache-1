30|$|The {{assessment}} of this {{wide range of}} imaging modalities presented here begins by using surrogate papyrus âphantomsâ which provide a test platform that is more controlled and well characterised than original cartonnage. The use of well controlled test samples to characterise a system is standard practice in chemistry and the analytical sciences, {{and the use of}} digital and physical test phantoms for image characterisation is widespread in medical imaging [12, 13]. While both have been used in heritage science [14, 15], the method is not widespread, perhaps because of the approach that all heritage objects should be seen as individual and unique. However, {{the same is true of}} patients in medical imaging. The purpose of a phantom is not to reproduce all aspects of the object being examined, but to provide a simplified, reproducible and well understood object of low value whose characteristics are known and so can be used to compare and validate results objectively and safely. In this case, a simplified test object also allows the fundamental characteristics which are common to all cartonnage of interestâpapyrus and inkâto be extracted from the complexities of <b>adhesives,</b> <b>plaster,</b> paint, and changes which occur over time, thereby allowing contributions from different variables to be assessed individually. Moreover, modern phantoms can be imaged and handled repeatedly without risk of damage, and can be shipped internationally without needing to deal with import restrictions. Such restrictions on shipping ancient artefacts, especially those closely associated with human remains, are complex, vary between jurisdictions and change over time. These advantages of using phantoms, it transpired, were critical to the success of the project.|$|R

Eight different imaging approaches were used, taken from optical imaging, X-ray imaging and terahertz imaging.|$|R

30|$|No current single imaging {{technique}} can identify both iron and carbon-based inks at depths within cartonnage. In order {{to detect and}} ultimately read text within cartonnage a multimodal imaging approach is required, but this will, necessarily, be limited by cost, access to imaging systems, and the portability of both the system and the cartonnage. The additional challenges of imaging writing within ancient cartonnage compared to the test phantoms include a more complex geometry, overlying structures such as <b>plaster,</b> <b>adhesives</b> and paint, {{and the presence of}} mixtures of inks. It will, therefore, be important to begin by imaging the internal structure with XMT, which will assist with the interpretation of other imaging methods. Ideally, a combination of multispectral {{imaging technique}}s would then be employed for surface inks or paints, and X-ray fluorescence imaging for deeper iron-based inks (which would not necessarily require a synchrotron).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{describe}} {{a new computer}} reconstruction to obtain complete anatomical information of the ecto- and endocranium from the imperfectly preserved skull of the Neanderthal Amud 1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from computed tomography scans of the fossil cranium. <b>Adhesive</b> and <b>plaster</b> were then virtually removed from the original specimen, and the fragments comprising the fossil cranium were separated. These fragments were then mathematically reassembled based on the smoothness of the joints. Both sides of the cranium were reassembled separately, and then aligned based on bilateral symmetry and {{the distance between the}} mandibular fossae obtained from the associated mandible. The position of the isolated maxilla was determined based on the position of the mandible that was anatomically articulated to the mandibular fossae. To restore missing basicranial and damaged endocranial regions, the cranium of Forbes' Quarry 1 was warped onto that of La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1, and the resulting composite Neanderthal cranium was then warped onto the reconstructed Amud 1 by an iterative thin-plate spline deformation. RESULTS: Comparison of the computer reconstruction with the original indicated that the newly reconstructed Amud 1 cranium was slightly shorter and wider in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions, respectively, suggesting that it was relatively more brachycephalic. The endocranial volume was estimated to be 1, 736 cm 3, which was quite similar to the original estimated value of 1, 740 cm 3.

Attempts to suck out the glochidia are likely to result in their attachment to the tongue. Popular methods of removing glochidia have included spreading <b>adhesive</b> <b>plaster</b> over the area and ripping it off quickly or using melted wax (hot wax sometimes employed for removing hair). Martinez et al. studied various methods of removing glochidia from rabbit skin. They evaluated tweezers, glue, facial mask, adhesive tape, package-sealing tape, and tweezing followed by glue. The most effective single method was tweezing, which removed 76% of the spines. The method using a thin layer of household glue (Elmer's Glue-All, Borden Inc) covered with gauze, allowed to dry (about 30 minutes) and then peeled off resulted in removal of 63% of the spines. Facial mask and adhesive tapes removed about 40% and 30% of the spines, respectively, and produced more retention and inflammation three days after removal than no treatment. Repeated applications of adhesive tape did not improve the results. According to Martinez, the most effective method is to first use tweezers to remove clumps of spines followed by the application and removal of household glue, resulting in removal of 95% of the spines.|$|E

50|$|Lacking {{suitable}} beasts {{of burden}} and inhabiting domains often too mountainous or boggy for wheeled transport, the ancient civilizations of the Americas did not develop wheeled transport or the mechanics associated with animal power. Nevertheless, they produced advanced engineering including above ground and underground acqeducts, quake-proof masonry, artificial lakes, dykes, 'fountains,' pressurized water, road ways and complex terracing.

40|$|Volatile organic compounds, VOCs, are {{released}} from a multitude of different polymer-based building materials. They can cause adverse health effects such as irritation of eyes, nose and throat, headache, fatigue, dizziness, sinus congestion, allergic reactions, and respiratory infections. This study concentrates {{on the influence of}} moisture and substrate on the emissions of VOCs from common wall structures. The structures are made up of primers and paints or adhesives applied onto either gypsum board or a combination of filler and plaster (or a single layer of plaster) which is applied onto calcium silicate bricks. An inert substrate, glass, is used as a reference substrate for single layers of paints, <b>adhesives</b> or <b>plasters,</b> and combinations of primer and paint and filler and plaster. The experimental section of this study is preceded by a literature review where the different factors affecting the emission process is dealt with. The literature review also includes the elaboration of a mathematical model describing the emission process. Small environmental chambers were developed for the experiments. The relative humidity of the air introduced into the chambers, the air exchange rate, and the air flow velocity over the sample surfaces could be easily controlled. Samples were exposed to different moisture conditions by adjusting the relative humidity of the air introduced into the chambers and by the use of different substrates. The emitted compounds were collected both from the chamber air and {{from the surface of the}} samples by using a Field and Laboratory Emission Cell into stainless steel tubes containing Tenax TA adsorbent. Other tests performed in this study included infrared spectroscopy, mercury intrusion porosimetry, microscopy, and the determination of pH. These tests were mainly performed to derive additional information on the chemical and physical characteristics of the materials studied. The experimental results demonstrated that the emission of VOCs from a surface layer is affected especially by the substrate, primer included, and by the drying process of both the substrate and the surface layer. The use of gypsum board as a substrate for either combinations of primer and paint or adhesives resulted in the lowest emission rates, while the use of a combination of filler and plaster or a single layer of plaster applied onto calcium silicate brick as a substrate resulted either in higher or lower emission rates compared with the glass (reference substrate) depending on the emission characteristics of the combination of filler and plaster. The experimental results indicated also that a high relative humidity prolongs the drying process, thus affecting the emissions because of interactions of water molecules with other emitting compounds. The consequence of this is that different compounds are emitted at different points of time. There was a statistically significant difference after the samples had reached moisture equilibrium only in the emission rate of aldehydes at RH 20 Â % and RH 80 Â % target relative humidities for samples collected from the test chambers. The emission rate was higher for the higher humidity environment. This result applied only when different combinations of primer and paint were spread onto glass plates. The experimental results additionally confirmed that TVOC, the total amount of VOCs being released, is not a good estimate of the behaviour of the emission of single compounds, since their behaviour, as regards relative humidity, can not always be determined based on TVOC-values. Nevertheless, it has been proven that it is possible to reach low emission rates, i. e. TVOC-values < 30 Â Âµg/m 2 Â·h, in less than two weeks with an appropriate choice of materials and by ensuring good drying conditions. reviewe...|$|R
