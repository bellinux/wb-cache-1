5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. The Celluloid Couch does not include any credits and only <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>summary</b> of the film in its filmography listing. It is also listed in Psychotherapists on Film without further detailing onto the cast or credits. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying the actors of Deering and his daughter.|$|E

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{researchers}} have developed various eye-movement simulation models {{in order to}} support, explain, and guide empirical research (the studies that collect data from experiments on human reading behaviours). Computational models can help test existing hypothesis, and also generate further predictions for empirical research to investigate. Building a reading model based on empirical data allows researchers to inspect and manipulate various assumptions of cognitive processes within the model, {{and see how the}} interactions between these elements influence the simulated reading behaviours, and hence informs further empirical studies. On the other hand, empirical research in eye-movements using eye-tracking {{is one of the most}} delicate measurement of human behaviours, which serves as a productive test bed for computer models of cognition.
