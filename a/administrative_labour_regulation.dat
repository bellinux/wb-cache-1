En dichos pronunciamientos el TJUE estima contraria al Derecho de la Unión la utilización de nombramientos de duración determinada sucesivos para atender necesidades permanentes en el sector de los servicios de salud. Asimismo, señala que la normativa española debe establecer medidas efectivas para evitar los abusos en lo referente a las relaciones de servicio de duración determinada al margen de su regulación a través del Derecho laboral o administrativo. Finalmente, se analiza la cuestión de si determinados contratos de duración determinada deben recibir a su finalización una indemnización equivalente a la que {{actualmente}} perciben los trabajadores fijos.

40|$|Abstract: The World Bank’s Doing Business survey {{seeks to}} measure and compare the costs to {{business}} of various types of <b>regulation,</b> including <b>labour</b> <b>regulation.</b> As such {{it is an important}} driver of labour market ‘reform’ globally and in South Africa. It may also be encouraging a tendency of different systems of regulation to converge. Focussing on <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> the study considers the validity of endeavours to measure <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> and identifies a number of methodological problems that constrain any such endeavour. It then focuses specifically on the methodology utilised in the Doing Business survey, and its results for South Africa. It presents evidence that certain scores arrived at in the case of South Africa are incorrect, materially affecting South Africa’s ranking in terms of the survey. These errors can be attributed to shortcoming in the survey’s methodology as well as the simplistic conceptions of law reflected in the surveys. This finding does not imply endeavours to measure the costs of regulation are without value. Instead the study advocates developing different indicators to measure the impact of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> and drawing on existing data and research to arrive at more objective results.

40|$|Even {{though the}} South African economy is {{formally}} categorised as an upper-middle income country, {{it has one}} of the highest unemployment rates in the world. The economy’s unemployment rate stands officially at 26. 7 per cent and 38. 8 per cent. This characteristic, more than any other, has placed market regulation high on the agenda of pertinent policy issues in South Africa. This paper, then, in trying to mature the debate on <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> and worker protection, has two key objectives. Firstly, we attempt to provide more nuanced and empirically-based measures of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> and worker protection for South Africa, within an international comparative context. Secondly, we attempt a legal overview of some of the key legislative and institutional challenges that exist within the South African labour market. We also attempt an overview of the evidence relating to the degree of actual and perceived rigidity within the South African labour market. The evidence utilised will hopefully add value to the debates thus far on the extent and nature of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> in South Africa.

40|$|This chapter has {{two main}} aims. First, {{it seeks to}} {{describe}} the changing pattern of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> in Australia {{at the national level}} over the past 15 years or so, specifically from 1990 to 2005. This is important in two ways. On the one hand, as Chapter 1 showed, the national level of regulation {{is likely to be a}} central factor in explaining the pattern of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> in different industries, especially the changes over time in the pattern of regulation. Knowing the national changes helps to explain industry changes. On the other hand, because the national system of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> is likely to be important in every industry reported in the subsequent chapters of this book, it is more efficient to describe these national changes in one place at the beginning of the book- this information is common to all chapters and its presentation here reduces repetition. The second aim of this chapter is to demonstrate the importance of industry as a unit of analysis in the study of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation.</b> Aggregated analysis at the national level, as important as it is, obscures profound differences between industries in the practice of employment relations. At the same time, more 'micro' studies of enterprises and workplaces, which have clearly become essential in recent times, neglect both key industry-level forms of regulation and vital trends that are common across individual enterprises. Industry-level studies, like those presented in this book, offer significant theoretical, policy and pedagogic opportunities. Before presenting the industry-level studies in the subsequent chapters, these opportunities will be surveyed in more detail...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Labour market {{constraints}} constitute prominent {{obstacles to}} firm development {{and economic growth}} of countries located in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the implications of firm characteristics, national locations, and sectoral associations for the perceptions of firms concerning two basic labour market constraints: <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> and <b>labour</b> skill shortages. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical analysis is carried out using firm-level data set sourced from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys database. A bivariate probit estimator is used to account for potential correlations between the errors in the two labour market constraints’ equations. The authors implement overall estimations and comparative cross-country and cross-sector analyses, and use alternative estimation models. Findings – The empirical results reveal some important implications of firm characteristics (e. g. firm size, labour compositions) for firm perceptions of <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> and <b>labour</b> skill shortages. They also delineate important cross-country and cross-sector variations. The authors also find significant heterogeneity in the factors’ implications for the perceptions of firms belonging to different sectors and located in different MENA countries. Originality/value – Reforms in <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> and investment in human capital are important governmental policy interventions for promoting firm development and economic growth in the MENA region. This paper contributes to the empirical literature by analysing the factors influencing the perceptions of firms located in the MENA region concerning <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> and <b>labour</b> skill shortages. It provides policy-makers with information needed in the design of labour policies that attenuate the impacts of labour market constraints and enhance the performance of firms and the long-run economic growth.

40|$|At {{a time of}} intensifying uncertainty, {{managerial}} {{flexibility to}} adapt {{to changes in the}} economic environment is increasingly important. Different business loca-tions, it is frequently argued, offer this flexibility to differing degrees, and <b>labour</b> market <b>regulations</b> are held to be one essential factor in determining the resulting attractiveness of a country as a business location.

40|$|Australia and New Zealand share {{a common}} {{experience}} of casual work. In both countries a category of &# 039;casual&# 039; has long been permitted under <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> and in both countries this {{has been associated with}} concerns about precariousness in employment. At least up until the recent period, <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> in both countries sought to limit casual employment in similar ways through quantitative restrictions and through prescription of a &# 039;casual loading&# 039; on the hourly rate of pay. Yet, in spite of these strong parallels, casual employment seems less significant in New Zealand as a proportion of the total workforce and it seems to lack the same pace of growth as in Australia. This article asks why there should be this difference. It sketches out an answer that focuses on employer calculations and choices (within the framework of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> including custom and practice). We suggest that the relative advantages of casual employment to employers are narrower and less imposing in New Zealand. We warn that this cannot be taken as a source of comfort about the better quality of work in New Zealand. The compression of relative advantages is partly because of the greater access of casual employees to standard rights or benefits but it is also partly because of the poorer conditions of permanent workers...|$|R
