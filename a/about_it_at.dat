5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not open <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> school in Wales. The students would imitate her accent, and apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning, after everyone else had packed up their tents and left without her.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done <b>about</b> <b>it</b> (<b>at</b> Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E

25|$|Saša is in {{a three-year}} {{relationship}} with bookish medical doctor Branka, but his job prospects are bleak. It's {{been a year}} since he graduated law school with average grades and he still hasn't been able to land a job. Numerous rejections are starting to affect his self-confidence and he's beginning to feel inadequate in front of Branka who graduated medicine with top marks the same year he did, but, unlike him, right away found a job that she's now excelling at. Furthermore, Branka's parents, especially mother, rarely miss an opportunity to tell him <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> the unemployment bureau counter, he meets a flirty and mouthy clerk Koka who chats him up. For his part, he seems very receptive to her relaxed, direct, slightly low-brow, and provocative approach as she seems a polar opposite of his straight-laced girlfriend Branka. While out with Branka {{one day at a}} bar, Koka bumps into two of them, saying a flirty hello to Saša followed by a testy chat with Branka who is completely rattled by this encounter.|$|E
500|$|From 1995 he {{also spent}} three years at Talk Radio UK, {{presenting}} Starkey on Saturday, later Starkey on Sunday. [...] An interview with Denis Healey proved {{to be one of}} his most embarrassing moments: [...] "I mistakenly thought that he had become an amiable old buffer who would engage in amusing conversation, and he tore me limb from limb. I laugh about it now, but I didn't feel like laughing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt was {{so deeply}} {{affected}} by this tragedy that he begins the chapter with a regret {{that he had to}} write <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> all. [...] "To attempt to give a description of the play itself or its effect upon the mind, is mere impertinence". Yet what he did write {{turned out to be a}} major piece of literary criticism that contributed to his general concepts about tragedy and poetry, and made a powerful impression on the poet John Keats.|$|E

500|$|When Lennon went to Hamburg {{again in}} April 1962, {{she found a}} bedsit in a terraced house at 93 Garmoyle Road, Liverpool. Shortly after having failed her art teacher's diploma exam, in August 1962, she found she was {{pregnant}} with Lennon's child. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had never talked about it, and didn't think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the time.

He just said he needed to generate some cash." ...|$|E

At Rap-Up, editors favored Rihanna's looks, writing that in the pictures, she was [...] "at the height of her beauty and ferocity".

500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to avoid {{answering}} questions regarding R. Kelly following the professional split. During an interview with Christopher John Farley, she was asked if {{she was still in}} contact with him and if she would ever work with him again. Farley said Aaliyah responded with a [...] "firm, frosty" [...] 'No' to both of the questions. Vibe magazine said Aaliyah changed the subject anytime [...] "you bring up the marriage with her". A spokeswoman for Aaliyah told the Chicago Sun-Times in 2000 that when [...] "R. Kelly comes up, she doesn't even speak his name, and nobody's allowed to ask <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> all". Kelly later commented that Aaliyah had opportunities to address the pair's relationship after they separated professionally but chose not to.|$|E
500|$|The fortuitous {{timing of}} the opera's premiere, {{not long after the}} July Revolution, and its sensational and novel effects, meant that it was widely {{identified}} with the new, liberal, ideas of the July Monarchy. As Berlioz commented, Meyerbeer had [...] "not only the luck to be talented, but the talent to be lucky." [...] Honoré de Balzac (in his novella Gambara) and Heinrich Heine (in his poem Angélique) are just two of the contemporary writers to express their fascination with the opera. Alexandre Dumas set a chapter of The Count of Monte Cristo between two acts of Robert; and George Sand wrote <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> length in her Lettres d'un voyageur. It is the only nineteenth-century opera to have a rose named after it.|$|E
500|$|Mwng is a [...] "lo-fi", raw, and {{understated}} {{record of}} rock songs, [...] "stripped of the bleeps and squelches" [...] that {{appear on the}} Super Furry Animals' other releases.

Instead, the record {{is a tribute to}} the band's obsession with [...] "Anglo-American pop culture of the 60s, 70s and 80s", and is an album that [...] "can be understood on a musical level anywhere in the Westernised world" [...] {{regardless of whether or not}} the listener can understand the lyrics.|$|E

500|$|Four {{years after}} the Abbey Road sessions, Harrison {{revisited}} [...] "You" [...] while completing his final album for Apple Records, the soul-influenced Extra Texture (Read All <b>About</b> <b>It),</b> <b>at</b> A Studios in Los Angeles. His standing with music critics had recently plummeted following a North American tour with Ravi Shankar in November–December 1974 and his accompanying album, Dark Horse. These two projects had been marred by Harrison's laryngitis-ravaged singing voice; in addition, a number of concert reviewers had condemned Harrison for refusing to indulge the public's nostalgia for the Beatles, and for his on-stage spiritual pronouncements. Looking to rehabilitate himself with critics and his audience in early 1975, Harrison had what author Robert Rodriguez describes as [...] "at least one ace in the commercial hole... the Motown-esque 'You'".|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{returned}} to the track in April 1975 when recording his album Extra Texture (Read All <b>About</b> <b>It)</b> <b>at</b> A Studios in Los Angeles. The sessions coincided with a period that author Gary Tillery describes as a [...] "spiritual funk" [...] for Harrison, in reaction to scathing reviews for his 1974 tour and the Dark Horse album. Harrison's despondency was alleviated by his new relationship with Olivia Arias, and a friendship begun with Monty Python star Eric Idle immediately after the Los Angeles premiere of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Idle has spoken of them sharing [...] "a dialogue that went on for about 48 hours" [...] following the premiere, which led to Harrison producing a re-recording of [...] "The Lumberjack Song" [...] in London, in October 1975, for release as a UK single. The pair then wrote a comical sea shanty called [...] "The Pirate Song" [...] for a sketch in Rutland Weekend Television, Idle's TV show with Neil Innes, Smith's former bandmate.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} substantial criticism for its strong violence and language. One scene that viewers found particularly unnerving was the ear-cutting scene; Madsen himself reportedly had great difficulty finishing it, especially after Kirk Baltz ad-libbed the desperate plea [...] "I've {{got a little}} kid at home." [...] Many people walked out during the film. During a screening at Sitges Film Festival, fifteen people walked out, including horror film director Wes Craven and special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Tarantino to take the walkout as a [...] "compliment" [...] and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism. Tarantino commented <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the time: [...] "It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can't climb. That's OK. It's not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing." ...|$|E

500|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{received}} favorable {{reviews and}} was ranked the 5th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure {{of all time}} by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game. Judge Bill Slavicsek felt the adventure was a [...] "classic clash of genres". It was not something he felt should be done often, but it made a [...] "memorable diversion". Judge Mike Mearls described how he felt {{the first time he}} read Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. [...] "I had this terrible, terrible conflict within myself to immediately tell my friends <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> war with a maniacal, desperate drive to keep it hidden at all costs." [...] Judge Keith Baker was most impressed with the adventure's art. He liked that it came with a separate book of art; in particular the before and after illustrations of the carnivorous plant with a [...] "built-in bunny lure". This was later featured in a Wizards.com [...] "Ask Wizards" [...] segment. According to the Dungeon editors, the adventure's defining moment was its froghemoth creature, and its full page color illustration.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monaco was first prototyped when Andy Schatz {{was working for}} TKO Software, a video game {{development}} company based in Santa Cruz, California. The game was originally inspired by the top-down minimap in the Hitman series and was described by Schatz as being similar to Jason Rohrer's 2014 video game The Castle Doctrine during its early stages of development. His original plans were to release Monaco as an Xbox Live Indie Games title, made within six weeks. He {{said that when he}} was talking to people <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> this stage, he described it as [...] "The Sims meets Diablo meets Hitman". The development at TKO was done in three weeks while the company solicited paying work. Before TKO shut down in 2005, Schatz left and founded his own independent company, Pocketwatch Games. After Pocketwatch Games experimented with simulation games, such as 2006 Independent Games Festival finalist [...] and Wildlife Tycoon: Venture Dinosauria, Schatz prototyped an early version of Monaco using Microsoft XNA as to see if it worked on the Xbox 360.|$|E

That relationship continues for The Avengers. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, as you may also know, our CEO has said publicly that we are studying {{the development of a new}} sportscar, but we can't say any more <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> this time." [...] In December 2011, Acura announced that a new NSX styled along the lines of the concept built for The Avengers would be unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. A series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs, based on the Acura MDX with modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also made for the film.|$|E
