2500|$|Ukrainian {{officials}} said that Russia had allowed tanks to cross the Russo-Ukrainian border into Donetsk Oblast on 11 June. Internal Affairs Minister Arsen Avakov said [...] "we have observed columns passing with armoured personnel carriers, other armoured vehicles and artillery pieces, and tanks which, according to our information, came across the border <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> were in Snizhne". He continued by saying Ukrainian forces had destroyed part of the column, and that fighting was still under way. Reuters correspondents confirmed the presence of three tanks in Donetsk city, and the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research also said that Russia had indeed sent tanks, along with other heavy weapons, to the separatists in Ukraine. The weapons sent are said to include: a column of three T-64 tanks, several BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers, and other military vehicles. [...] "Russia will claim these tanks were taken from Ukrainian forces, but no Ukrainian tank units have been operating in that area," [...] the State Department said in a statement. [...] "We are confident that these tanks came from Russia." [...] The newly elected Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, {{said that it was}} [...] "unacceptable" [...] for tanks to be crossing into Ukraine. Russia called the reports [...] "another fake piece of information." [...] Nevertheless, the three tanks were later spotted moving through Makiivka and Torez, flying the flag of the Russian Federation. Insurgents confirmed that they had obtained three tanks, but leaders refused to elaborate on how they acquired them; one militant told reporters that they originated [...] "from a military warehouse." [...] The president of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, stated that the three tanks would be stationed in Donetsk city, and that they gave his forces [...] "at least some hope of defending [...] because heavy weapons are already being used against us." [...] Konstantin Mashovets, a former Ukrainian Defence Ministry official, said the tanks had likely been seized by Russian forces in Crimea before making their way into mainland Ukraine. Anton Heraschenko, an advisor to Arsen Avakov, confirmed at a briefing in Kiev that the tanks were once in the possession of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Crimea, and that they had been transferred by sea to Russia before crossing the border into Ukraine.|$|E
