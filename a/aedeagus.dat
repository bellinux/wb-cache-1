5|$|The abdomen has ten segments, {{each with}} a pair of spiracles for respiration. Segment ten bears a pair of cerci, a pair of anal styles, the anus and the {{external}} genitalia. Males have an <b>aedeagus</b> through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca is laid.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the <b>aedeagus)</b> which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the <b>aedeagus.</b> The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E

25|$|Even more {{difficult}} to distinguish between species are the males. There are very few distinctions between the male Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica. Almost undetectable by naked eye, the only confident identification of Vespula vulgaris males would be to investigate their genitalia. They have distinct <b>aedeagus</b> tip shapes and lateral processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{adult males}} look {{very similar to}} the females. They have about the same body length, and the main {{differences}} include their antennae being completely dark brown, and having hair on the broad yellow plate (clypeus) at the front of their heads. They have more hair in other places as well. Also, their upper hind limbs (femoras) on their median legs are brown with a thin, long, yellow stripe. Lastly, the <b>aedeagus</b> (reproductive organ which is used to secrete sperm) is flattened and inflated at the apex.|$|E
25|$|It has {{recently}} been discovered {{that members of the}} plant bug genus Coridromius (Miridae) also practice traumatic insemination. In these bugs, the male intromittent organ is formed by the coupling of the <b>aedeagus</b> with the left paramere, as in bed bugs. Females also exhibit paragenital modifications at the site of intromission, which include grooves and invaginated copulatory tubes to guide the male paramere. The evolution of traumatic insemination in Coridromius represents a third independent emergence of this form of mating within the true bugs.|$|E

25|$|The male’s main {{reproductive}} {{function is}} to produce and store spermatozoa and provide transport to the reproductive tract of the female. Sperm development is usually completed {{by the time the}} insect reaches adulthood. The male has two testes, which contain follicles in which the spermatozoa are produced. These open separately into the sperm duct or vas deferens and this stores the sperm. The vas deferentia then unite posteriorally to form a central ejaculatory duct, this opens to the outside on an <b>aedeagus</b> or a penis. Accessory glands secrete fluids that comprise the spermatophore. This becomes a package that surrounds and carries the spermatozoa, forming a sperm-containing capsule.|$|E
25|$|V. mandarinia is {{a species}} in the genus Vespa, which {{comprises}} all true hornets. Along with seven other species, V. mandarinia {{is a part of}} the V. tropica species group, defined by the single notch located on the apical margin of the seventh gastral sternum of the male. The most closely related species within the species group is V. soror. The triangular shape of the apical margin of the clypeus of the female is diagnostic, the vertex of both species is enlarged, and the shape of the apex of the <b>aedeagus</b> is distinct and similar. Division of the genus into subgenera has been attempted in the past,) but has been abandoned, due to the anatomical similarity amongst species and because behavioural similarity is not associated with phylogeny.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{component}} of the male reproductive system is the testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. The more primitive apterygote insects have a single testis, and in some lepidopterans the two maturing testes are secondarily fused into one structure during the later stages of larval development, although the ducts leading from them remain separate. However, most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac.
