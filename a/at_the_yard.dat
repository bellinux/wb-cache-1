5|$|Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) {{is now the}} {{location}} of a wood yard, used since the 1930s to prepare local willow for the production of cricket bats. The trees are grown at Harbour Hill Copse, where 70 trees are felled annually for this purpose. There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time. The workers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|Philippine Sea {{commissioned}} on 11 May 1946, when Rear Admiral Morton Deyo {{placed the}} ship {{under the command}} of Captain Delbert Strother Cornwell at the Boston Navy Yard in South Boston, Massachusetts. The ship remained drydocked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> for two weeks before sailing for Naval Air Station Quonset Point on 13 June. However, a shortage of men following the post-World War II demobilization forced her to remain at reduced operational status until 23 September when she embarked for sea trials.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} boats were built beside the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. Richard Dunston {{set up a}} boatyard at Thorne, on the north bank just below the lock, in 1858, after selling his {{previous}} boatyard at Torksey. He initially constructed clinker-built sailing barges, capable of carrying up to 80 tons. The boatyard was fairly self-contained, using timber which was grown locally and was sawn by hand <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> It included a ropewalk, which made ropes for many industries in the locality, {{as well as for}} rigging of the boats, and supplied sails, masts and chandlery to much of the Humber region. Gradually, carvel-built barges with their smoother hulls replaced clinker-built ones, and boat sizes became more standard, with Sheffield-sized keels and larger sloops. Shortly after Richard's grandson took over the yard in 1910, it was remodelled to build iron and steel ships, and only one wooden boat was built subsequently.|$|E

25|$|The Russo-Japanese War further {{benefited the}} yard, as the Imperial Japanese Navy {{contracted}} five Type 1 submarines <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> Little {{is known of}} the first submarines built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> although they were promptly disassembled and shipped to the West Coast, from which they were shipped to Japan in 1904. The war brought expanded submarine development to the yard, as the Holland Torpedo Boat Company was purchased by the Electric Boat Company. Since Electric Boat had no yard of its own, it subcontracted to Fore River in order to complete orders. The first American submarine built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> was , launched in 1906. This arrangement lasted for the next twenty years, until Electric Boat built its own yard in 1924. Fore River would remain the primary builder of Electric Boat-designed submarines through the S-class of 1922, completing a total of 69 submarines for the US Navy during this period.|$|E

25|$|The first {{steamship}} built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> was 1834 ordered Furst Menschikoff, {{which was}} launched in June 1836. The shipowner company was led by Erik Julin, who became a co-owner of the yard in 1838.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{buildings}} and engineering installations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> were constructed between 1880 and 1890 {{under the direction of}} John Ward Girdlestone. Many of them have been designated by English Heritage as listed buildings.|$|E
25|$|Closure of the {{division}} initially led to dormancy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> Some equipment was sold off while {{other parts of the}} yard were used for staging areas of the Boston Harbor cleanup project. Various plans were then offered at the time for use of the shipyard.|$|E

25|$|Admiral Bowen {{described}} the situation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> {{in detail in}} his 1954 memoir, Ships, Machinery and Mossbacks. According to Bowen, the seizure saved the government over $13 million. For example, , built in San Pedro, cost $24.8 million, but sister ship , constructed in Camden, cost only $12.8 million. It also took nearly a year longer to construct Ajax.|$|E
25|$|During this time, {{the yard}} built {{civilian}} ships, including Sankaty, {{which was built}} for the New Bedford, Martha's Vineyard & Nantucket Steamboat Company. Furthermore, the company created the Fore River Apprentice School, {{in order to ensure}} that an adequately-trained workforce would be able to work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> in the coming years. Over time, over 2,000 people were graduated from its program.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, {{the yard}} gained a {{contract}} to build the Brown-Curtis steam turbine engine, which {{was considered to be}} too fast to be economical at the time. That same year, the Navy awarded {{a contract to}} build the Chester-class cruisers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> two of which were supposed to be equipped with the Brown-Curtis turbine, but which later received new turbines.|$|E

25|$|Manchuria {{was laid}} down by the New York Shipbuilding Company of Camden, New Jersey, for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company on 3 September 1902, among the first ships built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> as {{contract}} number six. An attempt to launch the ship on 31 October 1903 failed when the ship stuck on the ways. The ship was successfully launched on 2 November having been sponsored by Miss Laura Wick.|$|E
25|$|The {{facilities}} of {{the shipyard}} itself were also expanded in this period. In 1881, Roach added {{a number of}} hydraulic and pneumatic riveting machines to the yard—amongst the first such machines in the country. In the same year, he installed a private telegraph network to accelerate communications between his various plants, and he also installed an Edison electric lighting system <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> which allowed longer working hours in winter and a second shift when required.|$|E
