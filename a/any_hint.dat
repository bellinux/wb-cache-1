5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} {{was not a}} single line, but an entire texture, often of a popular song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of a cantus firmus. Parody technique was to become the most usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the Coronation {{class was}} {{represented}} at the 1948 British Railways locomotive exchange trials, designed {{to compare the}} performances of similar locomotives from {{all four of the}} pre-nationalised companies, the representative engine performed disastrously. Gone was <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of the power that could be unleashed by these engines; instead, uncharacteristically low coal consumption was the target. If the trials were forgettable, other achievements of the class are certainly memorable. Firstly, No. 6220 Coronation held the British steam speed record between 1937 and 1939. Secondly, No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn holds the record to this day for the greatest British power output to be officially recorded on an attached dynamometer car, achieved in 1939. Unfortunately the most memorable event {{in the history of the}} class was the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash precipitated by 46242 City of Glasgow. This was the second worst rail crash in British history, the death toll being 112.|$|E
25|$|Mott's {{redesigned}} {{the label}} soon thereafter, removing <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> {{of that to}} which René had drawn attention (pictured), and avoiding any presupposed corporate embarrassment.|$|E
50|$|In France Napoleon III {{established}} a dictatorship over official French Freemasonry, appointing first Prince Lucien Murat and later Marshal Magnan to closely supervise Freemasonry and suppress <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> {{of opposition to}} the regime.|$|R
50|$|Level 4 “Duel”: the {{participants}} orally answer 12 questions without <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> and variants. During given time {{the one who}} presses the button first can answer the question. The participant with maximum score within 4 levels gets into the final.|$|R

25|$|There is {{historical}} evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of a bosom. Early English Puritans used a tight bodice to flatten breasts completely, while 17th century Spaniards put lead plates across the chests {{of young girls}} to prevent their bosoms from developing.|$|E
25|$|Presently, from {{satellite}} tracking data, stratospheric smoke aerosols dissipate {{in a time}} span under approximately two months. The existence of <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of a tipping point into a new stratospheric condition where the aerosols would not be removed within this time frame remains to be determined.|$|E
25|$|Recently, a new crown {{has been}} made for the Lord Lyon, {{modelled}} on the Scottish royal crown among the Honours of Scotland. This crown has removable arches (like one of the late Queen Mother's crowns) which will be removed at coronations to avoid <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of lèse majesté.|$|E
60|$|Let {{the glory}} be yours, most gracious sovereign! to {{suppress}} this growing evil; and if <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> from your most faithful subject {{can be of}} the least use, I live but to serve, to admire, and pray for your majesty.|$|R
50|$|Catholics do {{not believe}} that <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> or {{evidence}} of the predestined status of individuals is available to humans, and predestination generally plays little or no part in Catholic teaching to the faithful, being a topic addressed in a professional theological context only.|$|R
60|$|THE COUNT. Before they come, Mr Savoyard, {{could you}} give me <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> about them that would help {{me to make a}} little {{conversation}} with them? I am, as you said, rather out of it in England; and I might unwittingly say something tactless.|$|R
25|$|I {{was told}} he was handing out a few theatre tickets and I didn't suspect {{anything}} because he always looked after the boys. He was close {{to a number of}} players, obviously a lot closer than I understood at the time. I didn't have <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> that it wasn't him just organising something for the boys to go to that night.|$|E
25|$|Fulfilling Garvey's wishes, VanDerZee's job was {{to project}} a {{positive}} image of the Association, especially to emphasize the strength and social standing of its membership, the so-called Garveyites. Nowhere in VanDerZee's visual record was there <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of the controversy surrounding Garvey in the early 1920s: a period when the leader was subject to public interrogation, quarrels with the writer and philosopher W.E.B. DuBois, and legal proceedings against him on charges of mail fraud.|$|E
25|$|The Stratocruiser {{had been}} {{carrying}} uncut diamonds in registered mail, then valued at over £1million, {{though it would}} be several days after the accident that investigators had <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of the cargo being carried. An extensive search {{was carried out in}} the area surrounding the crash for several weeks, resulting in over 90% of the diamonds being recovered. The KLM Constellation that crashed near Prestwick six years earlier had also been carrying diamonds, then valued at over £5,000.|$|E

6000|$|Hearing all this, Babbalanja thus spoke:--"Doubtless, my lord Media, besides these {{petitions}} we hear, {{there are}} ten thousand contradictory prayers ascending to these idols.

25|$|The first {{mention of}} Elrond's daughter, named Finduilas, {{was made in}} {{reference}} to the banner she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not give <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> whether she had any further part to play. The references to her marriage with Aragorn came later, but it was explicitly stated only near the completion of the book. Only in his work on the appendices for The Lord of the Rings did Tolkien record the full tale of Aragorn and Arwen.|$|E
25|$|It {{is notable}} that some sources {{indicate}} that Axouch was much attached to Isaac and, at least {{early in his}} reign, Manuel was suspicious of <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of collusion between his brother and Axouch. Once in power, however, Manuel confirmed Axouch's position as megas domestikos. Axouch was also the one responsible for the introduction of an oath of allegiance to the new emperor in the coronation ceremony, a practice which lasted {{until the end of}} the Empire.|$|E
25|$|In particular, Japan's largest male talent agency, Johnny & Associates Entertainment Company, specializes only in {{producing}} male Tarento idols. Accepted into Johnny & Associates {{in their early}} teens, these boys, collectively known as 'Johnnys', are trained and promoted {{to become the next}} leading singing-acting-commercially successful hit sensations. Almost all can be classified as bishōnen, exhibiting the same physically feminine features combined with a sometimes deliberately ambivalent sexuality or at the very least, a lack of <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of a relationship to maintain their popular availability.|$|E
5000|$|Time Out New York says it [...] "subscribes to {{conventions}} {{as old as}} {{the hills}} and twice as rocky, burying <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> of feminist awareness beneath the routines of macho courtship.

25|$|When the {{hurricane}} hit North Carolina, it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 {{million gallons of}} manure into the rivers, which contaminated the water supply and reduced water quality. Ronnie Kennedy, Duplin County director for environmental health, said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times the average across eastern North Carolina, had faecal coliform bacteria. Normally, tests showing <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of faeces in drinking water, an indication {{that it can be}} carrying disease-causing pathogens, are cause for immediate action.|$|E
25|$|Foreign aid to {{the region}} is a {{difficult}} proposition, according to Craig Cohen, {{an analyst at the}} Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. Since security is difficult, local nongovernmental organizations are required to distribute aid, but {{there is a lack of}} trust amongst NGOs and other powers that hampers distribution. Pakistani NGOs are often targets of violent attacks by Islamist militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Due to the extensive hostility to <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of foreign influence, the American branch of Save the Children was distributing funding anonymously in the region as of July 2007.|$|E
25|$|Christian and Manichaean missionaries {{considered}} this doctrine to be exemplary of the Zoroastrian faith {{and it was}} these and similar texts that first reached the west. Corroborated by Anquetil-Duperron’s “erroneous rendering” of Vendidad 19.9, these led to the late 18thcentury conclusion that Infinite Time was the first Principle of Zoroastrianism and Ohrmuzd was therefore only “the derivative and secondary character”. Ironically, {{the fact that no}} Zoroastrian texts contained <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of the born-of-Zurvan doctrine was considered to be evidence of a latter-day corruption of the original principles. The opinion that Zoroastrianism was so severely dualistic that it was, in fact, ditheistic or even tritheistic would be widely held until the late 19thcentury (Dhalla, 1932:490-492; cf. Boyce, 2002:687).|$|E
5000|$|Cultural diversity: To the changeling, {{all human}} {{behavior}} needs studying; to the chameleon, {{any group of}} humans can be found to need destroying.

Haldeman describes Samoa affectionately, spending paragraphs on its views, beauty, and variety of foods.|$|R

50|$|Shizuru {{wants to}} buy her best friend, Mizuki, a {{birthday}} present. She asks Mizuki's friend for some ideas. Mizuki refuses to give <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> and invites Shizuru to her house. There, Mizuki reveals {{that he is a}} boy. He explains that his crossdressing was due to Shizuru's claim that she hates all boys. It is later revealed that his father and his brother are also crossdressers and gave that idea to Mizuki.|$|R
25|$|In December as Emma's first {{pregnancy}} progressed, Charles {{fell ill}} and accomplished little {{during the following}} year. He did accept {{a position on the}} Council of the Geographical Society in May 1840. In 1841 he became able to work for short periods a couple of days a week, and produced a paper on stones and debris being carried by ice floes, but his condition did not improve. Having consulted his father he began looking for a house in the countryside to escape a city suffering from economic depression and civil unrest. Owen {{was one of the few}} scientific friends to visit Darwin at this time, but Owen's opposition to <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of Transmutation made Darwin keep quiet about his theories.|$|E
25|$|Although {{direct and}} open {{confrontation}} ceased, the Communist party continued {{to control and}} manipulate {{the art of the}} bandurist through a variety of indirect means. Bandura players now had to censor their repertoire and stop any cultural aspects that were deemed to be anti-Soviet. This included songs with religious texts or melodies, Christmas carols, historic songs about the cossack past, and songs with <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of a nationalistic sub-text. Some bandurists rose in the ranks of the Communist Party to become high-level administrators. (e.g. Professor Serhiy Bashtan was the first secretary of the Communist Party at the Kiev conservatory for over 30 years and, in that position, restricted the development of many aspects of Ukrainian culture in the premier music establishment in Ukraine).|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Mutual filed a {{complaint}} with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding its difficulties in establishing new stations, in a radio market that was already being saturated by NBC and CBS. In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks and published its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs in 1940. The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue. At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, according to the FCC, RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> of competition. Having no power over the networks themselves, the FCC established a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest.|$|E

2500|$|While {{planning}} the story, Mashima considered multiple identities and {{names for the}} character introduced in Chapter 200, who would later be revealed as the previously unseen character Zeref. He intentionally avoided providing <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> to his identity beforehand, wanting {{it to be a}} [...] "complete surprise" [...] to the readers. Mashima stated that Zeref [...] "has really become a popular character" [...] after the reveal; he also noted that the character is [...] "really dark [...] He'd never make a silly face." ...|$|R
