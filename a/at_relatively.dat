5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material. Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method {{is characterized by a}} stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished <b>at</b> <b>relatively</b> low speeds.|$|E
5|$|However, further {{investigations}} {{have led to}} the conclusion that the arsenic content in the groundwater did not differ from that of the local drinking supply, and that the illness reported was likely caused by the vaporization of troilite, a sulfur-bearing compound present within the meteorite in large amounts, which would have melted <b>at</b> <b>relatively</b> low temperatures and high pressures created by such an impact.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the few}} {{groups that}} were never thought to be piscivores are the anurognathids; these were instead thought to be nocturnal, aerial insectivores, a view still {{maintained}} today.

5|$|Although railroads {{have lost}} much of the general-freight-carrying {{business}} to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of containerization has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise <b>at</b> <b>relatively</b> high speeds. In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set <b>at</b> <b>relatively</b> high rates on a sliding scale, ranging from a penny for pedestrians to 2s6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.|$|E
5|$|In the Permian period, the Zion and Kolob {{area was}} a {{relatively}} flat basin near sea level on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea.

5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past. One study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1749, Benning Wentworth, New Hampshire's governor, was selling land grants {{in the area}} west of the Connecticut River, to which New Hampshire had always laid {{somewhat}} dubious claim. Many of these grants were sold <b>at</b> <b>relatively</b> low prices to land speculators, with some land kicked back to Wentworth. In 1764, King George issued an order resolving the competing claims of New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York. New York, which had also issued land grants that overlapped some of those sold by Wentworth, insisted that holders of the Wentworth grants pay a fee to New York to have their grants validated. As this fee approached the original purchase price, {{and many of the}} holders were land-rich and cash-poor, {{there was a great deal}} of resistance to this demand. By 1769 the situation in the Grants had deteriorated to the point where surveyors and other figures of New York authority were being physically threatened and driven from the area.|$|E
5|$|Following Ohayō, Kon {{began work}} on his next film, Dreaming Machine. In May 2010, Kon was {{diagnosed}} with terminal pancreatic cancer. Given half a year to live, Kon chose to spend {{the remainder of his}} life in his home. Shortly before his death Kon composed a final message, which was uploaded to his blog by his family upon his death. As Kon explained in the message, he chose not to make news of his rapidly advancing illness public, in part out of embarrassment at how drastically emaciated and ravaged his body had become. The result was that the announcement of his death was met with widespread shock and surprise, particularly given that Kon had shown no signs of illness <b>at</b> <b>relatively</b> recent public events, as the cancer progressed to a terminal state {{in a matter of months}} after being diagnosed. Kon died on August 24, 2010 at the age of 46. After his death, Kon was mentioned among the Fond Farewells in TIME's people of the year 2010. Darren Aronofsky wrote a eulogy to him, which was printed in , a Japanese retrospective book of his animation career.|$|E
5|$|In essence {{this type}} of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on {{psychological}} shock for effect. Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not {{get close enough to}} the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive. Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was <b>at</b> <b>relatively</b> long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. Captain Mercer, who commanded 'G' Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, thought the Brunswick troops {{on either side of him}} so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.|$|E

5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} in several ways. It {{is larger than the}} lesser yellow-headed vulture, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the turkey vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only <b>at</b> <b>relatively</b> close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|E
5|$|The ages of {{individual}} aetosaurs {{can be determined}} by examining their osteoderms. Some isolated osteoderms have been claimed to belong to juvenile aetosaurs based on their size and shape but these hypotheses have often been questioned. For example, juvenile osteoderms of Calyptosuchus were later identified {{as those of the}} small-bodied pseudosuchian Revueltosaurus (which is not an aetosaur), and juvenile osteoderms of Desmatosuchus have been reinterpreted as those of aetosaur Acaenasuchus, which had a relatively small body size at maturity. Studies of the bone structure of paramedian osteoderms indicate that new bone was deposited along the edges of each plate over the course of an aetosaur's lifetime. This means that lines of arrested growth on the undersides of paramedian osteoderms can be used to determine an individual's age. Comparing the ages {{of individual}} specimens with their total body lengths indicates that aetosaurs increased in length <b>at</b> <b>relatively</b> constant rates, but increased in body mass at different rates depending on whether they had wide bodies like Typothorax or narrow bodies like Aetobarbakinoides. Aetosaurs also seem to have grown more slowly than modern crocodilians. Analysis of the limb bones of aetosaurs indicates that they grew quickly when young and more slowly when adults. This pattern of growth is seen in most other pseudosuchians.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} the drawbacks of the inclined belt, it sloped {{outward from the}} keel, then back in towards the armored deck. This meant that shells fired <b>at</b> <b>relatively</b> close range would hit the upper portion of the belt at an angle, which maximized armor protection. However, {{the effectiveness of the}} upper portion of the belt was degraded at longer ranges, because plunging shells would strike it at an angle closer to the perpendicular, increasing their ability to penetrate the armor. It did reduce the area that needed to be covered by the armored deck, which saved additional weight. This enabled the upper belt to be thicker, which to an extent ameliorated the vulnerability to plunging fire. Because the belt was internal, it provided the opportunity to extend it to the inner portion of the double bottom, which gave the ship better underwater protection than the North Carolinas. Ultimately, the complex double incline belt armor was abandoned when it became apparent that a single slanted belt could provide similar protection, and save several hundred tons of weight.|$|E
