6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Seaforth, smiling. [...] "Still, you see you can't, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out mining with feather-brained companions {{must take}} the consequences." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Must we {{part in this}} way, St. John? <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to India, {{will you}} leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'"We {{will see}} what the doctor says," [...] I answered. [...] "You must stop work now, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> downstairs just say that I wish to see Brunton." ...|$|E
60|$|Many {{years have}} gone by since then, and now you are old, my father. It is many years even since I was a boy, <b>and</b> {{followed}} <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> up among the Boers and took their country for the Queen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I couldn’t {{hear what}} you were saying, <b>and</b> then <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> outside <b>and</b> I asked you whether you were going home you said ’yes,’ didn’t you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{just take}} it easy for awhile," [...] was Mr. Rover's advice, on leaving. [...] "Rest up all <b>you</b> can, <b>and</b> then, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> back to the school, you'll feel as bright as a dollar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must get}} {{over to the house}} without seeming to be running away. You start first, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> through the gate, call out that mother wants to see me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] says Caligula, [...] "I reckon in New York {{you get to}} be a conniseer; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{around with}} the demi-tasse you are {{naturally}} bound to buy 'em stylish grub." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are joyous,' said Venetia, 'because you are excited. It is {{the novelty}} of return that animates you. It will wear off; you will grow weary, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to the {{university}} you will think yourself happy again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the kind}} of boyishness I mean," [...] said Wallace, [...] "getting fun for {{yourself}} at other people's expense; and so making them dislike <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> feel sorry <b>when</b> they see <b>you</b> coming, <b>and</b> glad <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away." ...|$|R
6000|$|Edna laughed. [...] "All {{you have}} to do," [...] she said, [...] "is to be patient and wait awhile, <b>and</b> then, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> back like a queen to Plainton, you will have had your {{mountains}} and your palaces besides." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What could man {{wish for}} more? Is there a Squire in England {{who would not}} serve {{under the banner of}} Chandos! Whither do <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> fair sir? <b>And</b> <b>when</b> do <b>you</b> <b>go?</b> Is it to Scotland? Is it to Ireland? Is it to France? But alas, alas!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Margaret nodded. [...] "We {{know your}} sort. You are not, like our tourists, merchants and manufacturers. You have {{no use for}} business. All you think about is sport, and your sport's extravagant. You stop at our big hotels, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> off to hunt and fish you hire a gang of packers to carry your camp truck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, honey," [...] {{said the}} Colonel. [...] "Your Uncle Daniel sent it, as he promised. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> upstairs, if Easter has done as I told her, {{you will see}} a {{primrose}} dress with blue coin-flowers on your bed. Daniel thought you might like that, too, for a keepsake. Dorothy Manners wore it in London, when she was a girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sam and I {{can go down}} part of the {{way with}} you, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> in, we can hang around outside, one at the upper and one at the lower street corner. Perhaps by doing that, we'll catch another sight of Crabtree, {{although}} I think, for the present, he'll keep away from Wall street and meet those brokers somewhere else, or telephone to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll have to {{put your}} shoes <b>and</b> {{stockings}} on <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to the magic lantern show to-night," [...] said Felicity {{in a tone of}} satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, it is {{for your}} own sake <b>and</b> for his. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away from here it may be so {{difficult}} for him to see you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what I told her. She is {{sure you}} are going to become one of our leaders, that you are very gifted for {{treating}} great questions and acting on masses of people, that you will become quite enthusiastic about our uprising, <b>and</b> that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> up to the top as one of our champions it will all have been through me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. In {{your own}} art, bow your head over {{technique}}. Think of technique when you rise <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to bed. Forget purposes in the meanwhile; get to love technical processes; to glory in technical successes; {{get to see}} the world entirely through technical spectacles, to see it entirely in terms of what you can do. Then when you have anything to say, the language will be apt and copious.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, you {{see what}} useful things I have got here for you; but I cannot give them to you for nothing. They cost us much, and give us much trouble to bring them here. But I will give them for skins and furs and oil, and the tusks of the walrus; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to your friends on the sea-coast, you can tell them to bring skins {{with them when they}} come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{heard that}} puzzle before!" [...] cried Lambert. [...] "And I'll {{tell you the}} explanation. When a ship goes round the world from east to west, {{we know that it}} loses a day in its reckoning: so that when it gets home, and calls its day Wednesday, it finds people here calling it Thursday, because we've had one more midnight than the ship has had. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> the other way round you gain a day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kick? Kirk? You {{should see}} him! He {{just sits there}} waiting for <b>you</b> to <b>go,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do <b>go,</b> shuts the door on you so quick you have to jump {{to keep from getting}} your coat caught in it. I tell you, those two are about all the company either of them needs. They've got the Newly-weds licked to a whisper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{nine o'clock}} every night, Greenwich time," [...] said Wemmick, [...] "the gun fires. There he is, <b>you</b> see! <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> hear him <b>go,</b> I think you'll say he's a Stinger." ...|$|R
5000|$|Feminist scholar bell hooks spoke {{extensively}} {{about the film}} in Cultural Criticism and Transformation. [...] "Kids fascinated me as a film precisely because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> heard about it, {{it seemed like the}} perfect embodiment of the kind of postmodern, notions of journeying and dislocation and fragmentation <b>and</b> yet <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to see it, it has simply such a conservative take on gender, on race, on the politics of HIV." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you suppose}} I think of that, too, mother? <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> round the room, or {{out in the}} yard, I just keep {{following}} you as if I was magnetized, and I can see you with my eyes shut as well as I can with them open; and I know how I shall feel when that's all I've got of you! But I'll soon be back! Why I'll be here in June again! And it's no use, now. I've got to go." ...|$|E
60|$|They are {{for ever}} and ever moving the furniture. When {{you come in}} in the night you can {{calculate}} on finding the bureau where the wardrobe was in the morning. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out in the morning, if you leave the slop-bucket by the door and rocking-chair by the window, {{when you come in}} at midnight or thereabout, you will fall over that rocking-chair, and you will proceed toward the window and sit down in that slop-tub. This will disgust you. They like that.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't {{want to be}} rich," [...] she said. [...] "Let them hunt {{their white}} sparrows in the Sacramento islands and the {{irrigation}} valleys. When we get up early in {{the valley of the}} moon, it will be to hear the birds sing and sing with them. And if we work hard at times, it will be only so that we'll have more time to play. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> swimming I 'm going with you. And we'll play so hard that we'll be glad to work for relaxation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a bit}} {{difficult}} for you, I daresay," [...] he remarked. [...] "You stop indoors so much, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do <b>go</b> out <b>you</b> mope off into the country by yourself. You want to knock about the restaurants and places to get ideas. That's what Gorman always does. You see you get all your characters from life in them, and they seem so much more natural." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I’m sure I hope so; I hope so,” {{said the}} Major moodily. “I must break this {{sequence}} of blank days. One hears {{so often that}} a fox has settled down as a tenant for life in certain covers, <b>and</b> then <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to turn him out there isn’t a trace of him. I’m certain a fox was shot or trapped in Lady Widden’s woods the very day before we drew them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sleep softly, my friend," [...] said Nod, [...] "and weary me {{not with}} talking. There's better rams {{in the forest}} than ever were flayed. Your {{blankets}} will creep back, never fear. Even to a Mullabruk his own fleas! But, there! I'll make magic even this very moment, <b>and</b> to-morrow, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{down to the river}} to fetch up the fish, there shall your blankets be, folded and civeted, on the stones by the water." ...|$|R
6000|$|Take {{home with}} you, then, this thought, on this Christmas day, {{among all the}} rest which Christmas ought to put into your minds. Respect your own children. Look on them as the {{likeness}} of Christ, {{and the image of}} God; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> home this day, believe that Christ is in them, the hope of glory to them hereafter. Draw them round you, and say to them-- each in your own fashion--'My children, God was made like to you this day, that you might be made like God. Children, this is your day, for on this day God became a child; that God gives you leave to {{think of him as a}} child, that you may be sure he loves children, sure he understands children, sure that a little child is as near and as dear to God as kings, nobles, scholars, and divines.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are so {{used here}} to our Shetland hospitality," [...] he says, [...] "that we {{are slow to}} {{understand}} the hesitation which a stranger feels in taking advantage of it. Your guide is in no respect to blame, gentlemen. Every house in these islands which {{is large enough to}} contain a spare room has its Guests' Chamber, always kept ready for occupation. When you travel my way, you come here as a matter of course; you stay here as long as you like; <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away, I only do my duty as a good Shetlander in accompanying you on the first stage of your journey to bid you godspeed. The customs of centuries past elsewhere are modern customs here. I beg of you to give my servant all the directions which are necessary to your comfort, just as freely as you could give them in your own house." ...|$|E
6000|$|A new {{race has}} sprung up, a street people. They pass their lives {{at work and}} in the streets. They have dens and lairs into which to crawl for {{sleeping}} purposes, and that is all. One cannot travesty the word by calling such dens and lairs [...] "homes." [...] The traditional silent and reserved Englishman has passed away. The pavement folk are noisy, voluble, high- strung, excitable--when they are yet young. As they grow older they become steeped and stupefied in beer. When they have nothing else to do, they ruminate as a cow ruminates. They are to be met with everywhere, standing on curbs and corners, and staring into vacancy. Watch one of them. He will stand there, motionless, for hours, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away you will leave him still staring into vacancy. It is most absorbing. He has no money for beer, and his lair is only for sleeping purposes, so what else remains for him to do? He has already solved the mysteries of girl's love, and wife's love, and child's love, and found them delusions and shams, vain and fleeting as dew-drops, quick-vanishing before the ferocious facts of life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well then," [...] he replied, [...] "that's settled. Miss Ottway {{will explain}} things to you, {{and tell you}} about my peculiarities. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> she <b>goes</b> <b>you</b> can take her desk, by the window nearest my door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never can}} <b>go</b> back; <b>you</b> have saved me, Christie, for you love me, you {{have faith in}} me, and that will keep me strong <b>and</b> safe <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are <b>gone.</b> Oh, my dear, my dear, God bless you for ever and for ever!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] says Mr. Crewe, [...] "but I do know I've done {{something}} for this town, and I hope you'll take it into consideration. Come <b>and</b> see me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to the village. I'll {{give you a}} good cigar, and that pamphlet, and we'll talk matters over." ...|$|R
