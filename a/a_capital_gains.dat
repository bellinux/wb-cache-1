The poor showing by Republicans in the 1998 Congressional elections, a {{reprimand}} from the House for Gingrich's ethics violation, and pressure from Republican colleagues, resulted in Gingrich's resignation from the speakership on November 6, 1998. He resigned altogether from the House on January 3, 1999.|$|E

FDI accounted for 2.1% of India's GDP in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Keating was {{appointed}} Treasurer by newly elected Prime Minister Hawke in 1983. Although lacking any formal education in economics, Keating {{went on to}} become arguably one of the most reforming Treasurers in Australian history. During his time as Treasurer, the Australian dollar was floated, the financial sector deregulated, certain state sector industries were privatised, <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax was introduced, and a Prices and Incomes Accord was struck. In 1990 he was elected Deputy Leader of the Labor Party and made Deputy Prime Minister.|$|E

From the shareholder's perspective, <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> distribution is not a net gain in assets, but it is <b>a</b> realized <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> (coupled with <b>an</b> equivalent decrease in unrealized <b>capital</b> <b>gain).</b>|$|R

500|$|Labour Party {{president}} Moira Coatsworth {{stated that}} the leadership contest would be a [...] "robust contest of ideas", and suggested to the party's caucus that {{a series of meetings}} with party members be held around New Zealand. These were held from 6 to 11 December in six major cities—Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Auckland. The party membership was then encouraged to give feedback to the party caucus, who would vote in the election. On 30 November Cunliffe, Parker and Shearer were interviewed by Mark Sainsbury on the current affairs programme Close Up. The television show held a text message poll in which viewers voted for their preferred leader of the party. Over 7,500 people took part; Shearer received 50% of the support, Cunliffe 31% and Parker 19%. The following day, Parker pulled out of the leadership race and put his support behind Shearer. Shearer and Cunliffe were interviewed by Guyon Espiner on political talkshow Q+A on 4 December. During the interview, both candidates indicated their support for the introduction of <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax, which was a key part of Labour's tax policy during the 2011 general election campaign. Both also disagreed with the 2008 Employment Relations Amendment Act (90-day workplace trial), and wanted New Zealand to invest further in research and development; Shearer mentioned striving for a more green economy. On 9 December, Horizon Research released a demographically-weighted survey which found that 35.4% of adult New Zealanders supported Shearer's bid for the leadership, and 19.9% backed Cunliffe.|$|E
500|$|True Finns {{have said}} that Finland should not financially support the European Financial Stability Facility that led to bailouts for Ireland and Greece. Timo Soini asked: [...] "How come they (the European Union) can't see the euro doesn't work?" [...] The party {{manifesto}} {{said that they would}} support <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax increase from 28% to 30% and an increased tax on alcohol. The party also opposed mention of Finland's EU membership in the constitution and want to cut social welfare for immigrants. Soini also suggested Finland should unilaterally withdraw from the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and some other international commitments and that giving up the euro was an option. While speculating about a possible ministerial portfolio he later backed down on commitments when journalists asked him if the issues would be True Finns' demands in any possible government formation talks, citing the proposals as his personal opinion and not necessarily incorporated into a prospective government policy programme. He continued to maintain that the EU membership issue in the constitution would be a threshold for their participation in government formation talks. Helsingin Sanomat suggested that these demands could prove detrimental to a chance for True Finns to join a governing coalition. The True Finns also support the continuation of social welfare benefits. The party's support for the benefits along with its stance on the EU bailouts was also seen as one reason for its growth in popularity {{at a time when the}} country was facing welfare cuts by the government. The True Finns' vice-chairman Vesa-Matti Saarakkala said that [...] "the True Finns will not participate in a coalition government with any party ready to give further loan guarantees". This stance on the EU's bailout was read by The Wall Street Journal as detrimental to the euro zone's attempt to reassure bond investors that it would not face debt problems. It also said that a good showing for the True Finns could threaten Portugal's EU-sponsored bailout.|$|E

Dietrich agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan {{on the condition that}} Hughes agreed to <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> arrangement he had long promised Dietrich. When Hughes balked, Dietrich resigned immediately. [...] "Noah", Dietrich quoted Hughes as replying, [...] "I cannot exist without you!" [...] Dietrich stood firm and eventually had to sue to retrieve personal possessions from his office after Hughes ordered it locked.|$|E

2500|$|Among other reforms, the Hawke Government {{dismantled}} the tariff system, privatised {{state sector}} industries, ended the subsidisation of loss-making industries, and sold off the state-owned Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Optus, Qantas and CSL Limited. The tax system was reformed, {{with the introduction}} of a fringe benefits tax and <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax, reforms strongly opposed by the Liberal Party at the time, but not ones that they reversed when they eventually returned to office. Partially offsetting these imposts upon the business community – the [...] "main loser" [...] from the 1985 Tax Summit according to Paul Kelly – was the introduction of full dividend imputation, a reform insisted upon by Keating. Funding for schools was also considerably increased, while financial assistance was provided for students to enable them to stay at school longer. Considerable progress was also made in directing assistance [...] "to the most disadvantaged recipients over the whole range of welfare benefits." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Keating argued {{within the}} Cabinet for the {{introduction}} of a broad-based consumption tax, similar in nature to the goods and services tax that was later introduced by the Howard government. In the build-up to the 1984 election, Hawke had promised a policy paper on taxation reform to be discussed with all stakeholders at a tax summit. Three options– A, B and C– were presented in the Draft White Paper, with Keating and his Treasury colleagues fiercely advocating for C, which included a consumption tax of 15% on goods and services along with reductions in personal and company income tax, a fringe benefits tax and <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax. Although Keating was able to win the support of a reluctant Cabinet, Hawke believed that the opposition from the public, the ACTU, and the business community would be too great. He therefore decided to abandon any plans for a consumption tax, although the remainder of the reforms were adopted in the tax reform package. The loss of the consumption tax was seen a bitter defeat for Keating; he later joked about it at a press conference, saying, [...] "It's a bit like Ben Hur. We've crossed the line with one wheel off, but we have crossed the line." ...|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a dividend. Generally, <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> occurs where <b>a</b> <b>capital</b> asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay <b>a</b> tax on <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> (often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.|$|R
