Lactarius subvelutinus is also similar to L.volemus, but lacks the fishy odour, has a dull yellow-orange to bright golden orange cap, narrow gills, and a white latex that does not change colour.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{writing system}} (often called hieroglyphs from <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> {{resemblance}} to the Ancient Egyptian writing) is a logosyllabic writing system, combining a syllabary of phonetic signs representing syllables with logogram representing entire words. Among the writing systems of the Pre-Columbian New World, Maya script most closely represents the spoken language. At any one time, no more than around 500 glyphs were in use, some 200 of which (including variations) were phonetic.|$|E

5|$|Armenian {{geographic}} {{names were}} first changed under {{the reign of}} Sultan Abdulhamit II. In 1880, the word Armenia was banned from use in the press, schoolbooks, and governmental establishments, to be replaced with words like Anatolia or Kurdistan. Armenian name changing continued under the early Republican era up until the 21st century. It included the Turkification of last names, change of animal names, change {{of the names of}} Armenian historical figures (i.e. the name of the prominent Balyan family was concealed under the identity of <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> Italian family called Baliani), and the change and distortion of Armenian historical events.|$|E
5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> wound.|$|E

Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E
5|$|In her legend, Haumea's many {{children}} came from {{different parts of}} her body. The dwarf planet Haumea appears to be almost entirely made of rock, with only <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> layer of ice; most of the original icy mantle is thought to have been blasted off by the impact that spun Haumea into its current high speed of rotation, where the material formed into the small Kuiper belt objects in Haumea's collisional family. There could therefore be additional outer moons, smaller than Namaka, that have not yet been detected. However, HST observations have confirmed that no other moons brighter than 0.25% of the brightness of Haumea exist within the closest tenth of the distance (0.1% of the volume) where they could be held by Haumea's gravitational influence (its Hill sphere). This makes it unlikely that any more exist.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki's biggest {{addition}} to {{the plot of the}} book was the use of the war as {{a large part of the}} plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war. Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> and cowardly person. In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.|$|E

5|$|The cotyledons of Banksia paludosa, B.marginata and B.integrifolia {{are very}} similar in appearance. The foliages of larger shrubs of both Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} resemble those of Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata, but the latter has a wider inflorescence, and the buds are more crowded in appearance on the inflorescence before anthesis. Banksia paludosa also bears <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> resemblance to B.oblongifolia, but the latter has a prominent midrib on the leaf underside, the new growth is covered in rusty fur, and the old spikes are bare of flowers. The latter grows on dryer rocky soils while the former grows in wetter sandy soils.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} of Tricholoma pardinum is an {{imposing}} mushroom with a pale grey cap up to 15cm (6in) in diameter that {{is covered with}} dark brownish to greyish scales. The gills are whitish, and are not attached to the stout white to pale grey-brown stalk. The spore print is white. One of the more toxic members of the genus Tricholoma, the species has been implicated {{in a number of}} episodes of mushroom poisoning, probably because it is a large, attractive mushroom with a pleasant smell and taste, and it bears <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> resemblance to several edible species, like Tricholoma terreum. Ingesting T.pardinum—even in small quantities—results in a severe, persistent gastroenteritis caused by an unknown mycotoxin.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem reticulation. B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on the stem. B.auripes bears <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the upper half of the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks an olive tinge on the tubes.|$|E

5|$|Gilliat {{served with}} the Rifle Corps in Northern Ireland and Palestine prior to the {{outbreak}} of World War II, and was captured during the Battle of Dunkirk {{as part of the}} British Expeditionary Force. He made several attempts to escape, with one attempt lasting several days, but was transferred to the prisoner-of-war camp Oflag IV-C (Colditz Castle) in 1940 where he remained {{until the end of the}} war. He was mentioned in dispatches and later rewarded with an MBE. After the war Gilliat served as Deputy Military Secretary to Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma during his brief term as the last Viceroy of India in 194748, and as Comptroller to Malcolm Macdonald, the High Commissioner for South-East Asia. In September 1947, while in Mountbatten's service, Gilliat and the author Alan Campbell-Johnson were driving through the Paharganj district of Delhi when they were fired upon. The driver of their car was killed in the incident, and Gilliat suffered a substantial loss of blood, and <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> head wound.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian {{historians have}} held {{strongly}} differing views on Haakon's reign. In the 19th century, historian P. A. Munch portrayed Haakon as a mighty, almost flawless ruler, {{which in turn}} influenced Henrik Ibsen in his 1863 play The Pretenders. In the early 20th century, poet Hans E. Kinck countered and viewed Haakon as an insignificant king subordinated to forces outside of his control, a view which influenced historians such as Halvdan Koht and Edvard Bull, Sr.. Haakon has often been compared with Skule Bårdsson, and historians have taken sides in the old conflict. While Munch saw Skule as a traitor to the rightful Norwegian king, Koht viewed Skule as a heroic figure. On more sketchy grounds, Kinck praised Skule as representing the original and dying Norse culture, and Haakon as <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> emulator of foreign culture. Since the 1960s, historians including Narve Bjørgo, Per Sveaas Andersen, Knut Helle, Svein Haga and Kåre Lunden have in turn professed a reaction against Koht's view. According to Sverre Bagge, modern historians tend to follow Koht {{when it comes to}} see Skule's rebellion as a last desperate attempt to stop Haakon from enroaching his power, but lean closer to Munch's overall evaluation of the two men.|$|E
5|$|While some, like Spencer, used analogy {{from natural}} {{selection}} as an argument against government {{intervention in the}} economy to benefit the poor, others, including Alfred Russel Wallace, argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities {{to level the playing}} field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in anthropology to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non white races and justify European imperialism. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only <b>a</b> <b>superficial</b> understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.|$|E
