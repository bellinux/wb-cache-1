40|$|Systematic {{creation}} of polymeric semiconductors from novel building blocks {{is critical for}} improving charge transport properties in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). A series of ultralow-bandgap polymers containing thienoisoindigo (TIIG) as a thiophene analogue of isoindigo (IIG) is synthesized. The UV-Vis absorptions of the TIIG-based polymers (PTIIG-T, PTIIG-Se, and PTIIG-DT) exhibit broad bands covering the visible to near-infrared range of up to 1600 nm. All the polymers exhibit unipolar p-channel operations with regard to gold contacts. PTIIG-DT with centrosymmetric donor exhibits a maximum mobility of 0. 20 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 under gold contacts, which is {{higher than those of}} the other polymers containing axisymmetric donors. Intriguingly, OFETs fabricated with aluminum electrodes show ambipolar charge transport with hole and electron mobilities of up to 0. 28 (PTIIG-DT) and 0. 03 (PTIIG-T) cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, respectively. This is a record value for the hitherto reported TIIG-based OFETs. The finding demonstrates that TIIG-based polymers can potentially function as either unipolar or ambipolar semiconductors without reliance on the degree of electron affinity of the co-monomers. A series of ultralow-bandgap polymers made by copolymerizing various electron-rich units with a newly conceived thienoisoindigo (TIIG) moiety is presented for organic field-effect transistors.

A band gap is also introduced in the channels to improve the switching ratio of the graphene transistors. For the first time, complementary-like NOR and NAND logic gates were demonstrated.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the fabrication process, charge injection, dielectric preparation and downscaling of organic field-effect transistors via inkjet printing. To provide a general guideline of fabricating inkjet-printed short channel transistors, this thesis starts with an improved self-aligned printing (SAP) technique implemented with gold nanoparticle inks which defines a nanometer scale channel between source and drain electrodes. Electron and hole injection and transport in the channel is studied using <b>ambipolar</b> <b>semiconductor</b> F 8 BT. Contact resistance effects are found to be significantly more pronounced in these short channel devices and the current is limited by insufficient charge injection. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are effectively employed to reduce the contact resistance in the SAP. Next, the systematic control of electron and hole charge injection in top-gate F 8 BT ambipolar transistor via SAM modification is investigated. Gold electrodes are modified with PFDT and 1 DT to reduce contact resistance and improve charge injection. Furthermore, a crosslinked fluoropolymer Cytop (C-Cytop) is adopted as an ultrathin gate dielectric, which is necessary for proper gate control of the accumulation layer in short channel devices. The C-Cytop can be spin-coated in air with uniform thin films, low gate leakage and high dielectric breakdown strength. The yield and stability of C-Cytop devices are remarkable compared to other non-fluorinated polymer dielectrics and less dependent on the underlying semiconductor roughness. In particular high performance in-type transistors are demonstrated using C-Cytop and small-molecule ActivInk N 1400 as the semiconductor. Finally, downscaled inkjet-printed nano-channel n-type transistors are demonstrated by printing silver nanoparticle inks with N 1400 and C-Cytop in the SAP structure. The printed silver nanoparticles serves as source contact combining with thin C-Cytop layer as gate dielectric. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
30|$|Rectification {{behaviors}} of metal-semiconductor contacts, where the current {{varies with the}} direction of the applied voltage, are widely used in Schottky barrier diode, field effect transistor (FET), and metal-oxide-semiconductor FET. Schottky explained the behavior by depletion layers on the semiconductor side of such interfaces [1]. Differences of electron work function between metal and semiconductor lead to the rectification behavior named Schottky effect [2]. The contact between metal and two-dimensional (2 D) semiconductor materials is a Schottky contact when the metal has a higher electron work function than an n-type 2 D semiconductor materials or lower electron work function than a p-type 2 D semiconductor. The Schottky effect of metal/ 2 D materials has great applications in micro-photo detectors, micro-FETs, gas sensors, and phototransistors [3]. Among 2 D materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted much attention because they have a sizable bandgap [3] and the bandgap transits from indirect to direct as the thickness is reduced to monolayer [4]. The bandgap ensures that TMDs can be used for many applications, i.e., FETs and solar cells [3]. TMDs can be also used in thermoelectric field [5], which has drawn wide attention [6 – 9]. Many experiments have been done to explore properties and applications of TMDs such as MoS 2, MoSe 2, WSe 2, and WS 2. Lopez-Sanchez et al. [10] made ultrasensitive monolayer phototransistors with MoS 2. Britnell et al. [11] made a WS 2 /graphene heterostructure and demonstrated its application in photovoltaic device. WSe 2, as an <b>ambipolar</b> <b>semiconductor,</b> was controlled with double electrostatic gates to fabricate a light-emitting diode [12, 13]. Among TMDs, ReSe 2 is different from other group VI TMDs because ReSe 2 belongs to group VII TMDs with an extra electron in d orbitals, which leads to strong in-plane anisotropy [14]. A few studies have explored the electrical properties of ReSe 2 due to its special band structure. Current rectification is explored with a ReSe 2 /WS 2 p-n heterojunction [15] and ReSe 2 /MoS 2 p-n heterojunction [16]. FET is made to investigate the electrical properties of metal/semiconductor contacts like ReSe 2 /metal or ReS 2 /metal [17 – 19].|$|E

All of the complexes formed by nonmesogenic components gave rise to hexagonal columnar (Col) liquid crystal phases, which are stable at room temperature.

40|$|Detection of {{nitrogen}} dioxide, NO 2, {{is required to}} monitor the air-quality for human health and safety. Commercial sensors are typically chemiresistors, however field-effect transistors are being investigated. Although numerous investigations have been reported, the NO 2 sensing mechanism is not clear. Here, the detection mechanism using ZnO field-effect transistors is investigated. The current gradually decreases upon NO 2 exposure and application of a positive gate bias. The current decrease originates from the trapping of electrons, yielding a shift of the threshold voltage towards the applied gate bias. The shift is observed for extremely low NO 2 concentrations down to 10 ppb and can phenomenologically be described by a stretched-exponential time relaxation.

40|$|In {{the last}} years we have devoted some effort to the search of new high-mobility <b>semiconductors</b> with <b>ambipolar</b> performances, good {{processability}} and environmental stability. Our approach, {{which is one of}} the most widely used, consists in the combination of donor and acceptor moieties in the conjugated skeleton, which allows fine tuning of the frontier molecular orbitals. For OTFT applications, low-lying HOMOs are essential to resist air oxidation and thus increase device stability. However, if the HOMO energy is too low, the resulting barrier to hole injection may compromise the transistor performance. Thus, a delicate balance between these two effects is needed. In particular, we have combined naphthaleneimide-derived moieties as electron accepting groups with electron-rich oligothiophene fragments. In these materials, we have found that the presence of ambipolar transport in these planar molecules can be understood on the basis of three interrelated properties: (i) the absence of skeletal distortions allows closer intermolecular pi-pi stacking and enhanced intramolecular pi-conjugation, (ii) increased pi-conjugation raises the HOMO energy, which approaches the Fermi level of common used electrodes; and (iii) more planar structures translate into lower Marcus reorganization energies. However, one of the limitations of these types of semiconductors is the presence of a molecular dipole moment, which forces the molecules to pack with pairwise intermolecular interactions orienting the naphthaleneimide cores in opposite directions, decreasing in some cases molecular orbitals overlapping.

40|$|Organic-based {{electronic}} devices have received considerable attention {{because of their}} presumable advantages over traditional inorganic-based electronics, such as low cost, flexibility, and applicability for large area production. Because of the possible commercialization of electronic products based on organic conducting materials, {{it is important to}} develop a variety of organic semiconductors (OSCs) that are categorized as hole transporting (p-type), electron-transporting (n-type) or ambipolar transporting (both hole and electron). P-type OSCs have been the most thoroughly studied. N-type semiconductors are much less common and the charge carrier mobilities have lagged considerably behind their p-type counterparts. Fullerene-based materials are currently the most widely used n-type semiconductors in OPVs. The cage-like structure associated with buckminsterfullerene is made of fused six- and five-member rings. Acenaphthylene is a basic fragment of C 60 and has shown potential as a valuable building block for n-type OSCs. To utilize this promising structure, the acenaphthylene unit has been incorporated into a variety of molecular structures to produce both small molecule and polymeric materials. We started with the study of fully unsaturated tetraquinane derivatives, which contain four linearly fused five-membered rings. The desired diacenaphthylpentalenes were synthesized via a palladium-catalyzed dimerization of 1 -iodo- 2 -arylethynyl-acenaphthylenes. The compounds are benchtop and solution stable and behave as hole-transporting or <b>ambipolar</b> <b>semiconductors</b> in organic field effect transistors. The X-ray crystal structure demonstrates the importance the fused naphthalene units as they stabilize the pentalene core with an extended π-framework. The tetraquinane derivatives possess high optical gap materials owing to a forbidden HOMO to LUMO transition, yet have narrow electrochemical gaps and are reduced at small negative potentials giving lowest unoccupied molecular energy levels of - 3. 57 to - 3. 74 eV. In addition to the unsaturated tetraquinane derivatives, this thesis also includes work on the creation of macrocycles containing acenaphthylene or cyclopenta[cd]perylene units. The stabilized annulenes, with rigid and π-conjugated structures, have potential application as discotic liquid crystals and porous organic solid. 1 H NMR and low resolution mass spectra gave solid proof that a target macrocycle was synthesized; however, the tedious work up and limited purification techniques did not enable large scale synthesis. The investigation of new donor-acceptor copolymers incorporating acenaphthylene or cyclopenta[cd]perylene units was also explored. Since the molecular scaffolds of the desired polymers have structural resemblance and electron affinities compared to bis-imide rylene dyes (NDI and PDI), the resulting materials have relavence for a varety of OSC based devicse.

Several material parameters and properties come into play in these devices, including energy of the frontier molecular orbitals, thin film morphology, and charge transport. These properties can be controlled by the chemistry of organic materials, and through processing conditions. In particular, this dissertation focuses on the isoindigo unit as an electron deficient unit to tune polymer light absorption, charge separation, charge transport {{in the first part of}} this dissertation, and morphology control in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices in a subsequent section. The first part of this dissertation introduces the synthesis and properties of isoindigo-containing polymers as n-type, p-type, or <b>ambipolar</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> and their application in all-polymer or polymer:fullerene blends OPV active layers. It is found that polymers with phenyl linkages along the backbone tend to have broader light absorption than polymers with alternating phenyl-thiophene rings; however, steric hindrance in the former leads to low charge mobilities, and poor device performance. In addition, this section highlights the importance of controlling phase separation in OPV devices by focusing on all-polymer blends, which show large phase separation, and polymer:fullerene blends, where the morphology can be controlled through processing additives generating a two-fold increase in device efficiency. Looking at poly(oligothiophene-isoindigo) polymers as model systems, emphasis is placed on photovoltage losses in these devices due to a decrease in effective energy gap between the polymers and fullerene as the oligothiophene donating strength is increased, as well as explanation of the device parameters through description of morphology as solubility is varied. The second portion of this dissertation focuses on solution properties of polymers and their correlation to thin film morphology. A first study investigates the influence of alkyl side chains on solubility, molecular packing, and phase separation in blends of poly(terthiophene-alt-isoindigo) with fullerenes. Specifically, as side chains are lengthened, solubility is increased, but with limited impact on the blends morphology. On the other hand increased backbone torsion leads to variations in energy levels, polymer packing and large phase separation in blends with fullerenes. These thermodynamic parameters are to put in perspective with the kinetic control of film formation during the coating process. This is discussed in a second study, which looks at the mechanism of thin film formation when processing additives are used. In particular, this study highlights the interactions that provide a driving force for polymer crystallite formation, depending on the mechanism followed when aliphatic and aromatic additives are used. These observations are then used to predict the morphology in spin-coated thin films. Ph. D...|$|R

It is shown that electrode absorption losses within the device can be eliminated and that the lasing threshold for optical pumping of the LEFET structure with all electrodes (4. 5 μJ cm- 2) is as low as that of reference devices without electrodes. These results enable quantitative judgement of the prospects for realizing an electrically pumped organic laser based on ambipolar LEFETs. The proposed device provides a powerful, lowloss architecture for integrating high-performance <b>ambipolar</b> organic <b>semiconductor</b> materials into electrically pumped lasing structures. close 493...|$|R
40|$|Herein, we {{calculated}} reorganization energies, vertical ionization energies, electron affinities, and HOMOLUMO gaps of fused thiophenes and their derivatives, and analyzed {{the influence of}} different substituents on their electronic properties. Furthermore, we simulated the angular resolution anisotropic mobility for both electron- and hole-transport, based on quantum-chemical calculations combined with the MarcusHush electron-transfer theory. We showed that: 1) styrene-group substitution can effectively elevate the HOMO energy level and lower the LUMO energy level, and therefore lower both the hole- and electron-injection barriers; and 2) chemical oxidation of the thiophene ring can significantly improve the semiconductor properties of the fused oligothiophenes through a decrease of the injection barrier {{and an increase in}} the charge-transfer mobility for electrons but without lowering their hole-transfer mobilities, which suggests that it may be a promising way to convert p-type <b>semiconductors</b> into <b>ambipolar</b> or n-type <b>semiconductor</b> materials...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we have {{theoretically}} {{studied the}} electronic properties {{of a large}} series of 1, 4 -bis(phenylethynyl) benzene derivatives, with the chemical formula Y–C≡C–X–C≡C–Y, with X and Y being aromatic rings and chosen to act as donor and acceptor moieties. Employing state-of-the-art DFT calculations, we analyzed a set of relevant electronic properties related to the optoelectronic and semiconductor character of these systems, namely, molecular and energy levels, electron affinity, ionization potential, reorganization energy, and electronic coupling between neighboring molecules forming dimers, obtained after evaluation of binding energy landscapes. The latter energy magnitude is needed to disclose first the favored intermolecular interactions (i. e., the lowest binding energy) to concomitantly estimate next the charge transport rates.

40|$|In recent years, the electron-accepting diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moiety {{has been}} {{receiving}} considerable attention for constructing donor-acceptor (D-A) type organic semiconductors {{for a variety}} of applications, particularly for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Through association of the DPP unit with appropriate electron donating building blocks, the resulting D-A molecules interact strongly in the solid state through intermolecular D-A and π-π interactions, leading to highly ordered structures at the molecular and microscopic levels. The closely packed molecules and crystalline domains are beneficial for intermolecular and interdomain (or intergranular) charge transport. Furthermore, the energy levels can be readily adjusted, affording p-type, n-type, or <b>ambipolar</b> organic <b>semiconductors</b> with highly efficient charge transport properties in OTFTs. In the past few years, a number of DPP-based small molecular and polymeric semiconductors have been reported to show mobility close to or greater than 1 cm 2 V - 1 s- 1. DPP-based polymer semiconductors have achieved record high mobility values for p-type (hole mobility: 10. 5 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1), n-type (electron mobility: 3 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1), and ambipolar (hole/electron mobilities: 1. 18 / 1. 86 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1) OTFTs among the known polymer semiconductors. Many DPP-based organic semiconductors have favourable energy levels and band gaps along with high hole mobility, which enable them as promising donor materials for OPVs. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 6. 05 % were achieved for OPVs using DPP-based polymers, demonstrating their potential usefulness for the organic solar cell technology. This article provides an overview of the recent exciting progress made in DPP-containing polymers and small molecules that have shown high charge carrier mobility, around 0. 1 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 or greater. It focuses on the structural design, optoelectronic properties, molecular organization, morphology, as well as performances in OTFTs and OPVs of these high mobility DPP-based materials...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{addresses}} {{several issues}} {{in the field of}} organic and transparent electronics. One of them is the prevailing high power consumption in state-of-the-art organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). A possible solution could be the implementation of complementary, rather than unipolar logic, but this development is currently inhibited by a distinct lack of high performance electron transporting (n-channel) OFETs. Here, the issue is addressed by investigating a series of solution processable n-channel fullerene molecules in combination with optimized transistor architectures. Furthermore, the trend towards complementary circuit design could be facilitated by employing <b>ambipolar</b> organic <b>semiconductors,</b> such as squaraine molecules or polymer/fullerene blends. These materials can fill the role of p- or n-channel semiconductors and enable the facile implementation of power saving complementary-like logic, eliminating the cost-intensive patterned deposition of discrete p-and n-channel transistors. Alternatively, a patterning method for organic materials adapted from standard photolithography is discussed. Furthermore, ambipolar FETs are found to be capable of light sensing at wavelength of 400 - 1000 nm. Hence their use in low-cost, organic based optical sensor arrays can be envisioned. Another strategy to reduce the power consumption and operating voltages of OFETs is the use of ultra-thin, self-assembled molecular gate dielectrics, such as alkyl-phosphonic acid molecules. Based on this approach solution processed n- and p-channel OFETs and a complementary organic inverter circuit are demonstrated, which operate at less than 2 Volts. Finally, transparent oxide semiconductors are investigated for use in thin-film transistors. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) films are deposited by means of a low-cost large area compatible spray pyrolysis technique. ZnO transistors exhibit high electron mobility of the order of 10 cm 2 /Vs and stable operation in air at less than 2 Volts. These results are considered significant steps towards the development of organic and transparent large-area optoelectronics.
