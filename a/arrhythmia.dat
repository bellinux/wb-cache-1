5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac <b>arrhythmia,</b> wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an <b>arrhythmia,</b> and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} study design {{was used to}} describe the relationship between the degree of acute rejection and the presence of cardiac <b>arrhythmias</b> in cardiac transplant patients. The frequencies and types of cardiac <b>arrhythmias</b> were observed in relationship to the results of endomyocardial biopsy and the serum T cell levels. A retrospective primary review of records was conducted utilizing 42 cardiac transplant recipients with a total of 128 endomyocardial biopsy procedures, the unit of analysis. In general, more cardiac <b>arrhythmias</b> were recorded after endomyocarial biopsy than before and the majority were atrial type <b>arrhythmias,</b> followed by ventricular and junctional <b>arrhythmias.</b> The significant relationships occurred between conduction <b>arrhythmias,</b> both frequency and type, and acute rejection. However, very small numbers of conduction <b>arrhythmias</b> were reported. Previous relationships between cardiac <b>arrhythmias</b> in general and acute rejection were not supported, possibly due to the effects of cyclosporine (Sandimmune) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{development}} of <b>arrhythmias</b> during placement of a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is common. Aims: This {{study was designed}} to examine factors influencing {{development of}} ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> in adult patients undergoing cardiovascular operations during the catheter placement. Settings and Designs: Prospective, observational, cohort study. Methods: We prospectively studied 174 patients undergoing cardiovascular operations. A PAC was inserted through the right internal jugular vein by staff anesthesiologists. Electrocardiography tracings were recorded as the catheter was advanced from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery. <b>Arrhythmias</b> were classified as absent, single, or multiple (two or more consecutive) ventricular <b>arrhythmias.</b> We examined risk factors to produce ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> during the placement. Statistical Analysis: The data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis to assess factors for the occurrence of ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> after univariate analyses. Results: Ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> (single and multiple) occurred in 149 patients (85. 6 %) and multiple <b>arrhythmias</b> were observed in 78 patients (44. 8 %). There were no factors to facilitate the ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> (single and multiple), whereas it showed that valvular diseases (P = 0. 049) and the placement time (P < 0. 001) are significant factors to produce multiple <b>arrhythmias.</b> Conclusion: Both valvular diseases and long placement time were significant risk factors to produce multiple ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> during placement of a PAC...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} therapy with {{atenolol}} and tocainide, separately or in combination, was studied in 20 patients with hypertension and concomitant ventricular <b>arrhythmias.</b> Patients were given 400 mg tocainide, three times daily, 100 mg atenolol, once daily (plus 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 2. 5 mg amiloride diuretics if required) and {{a combination of}} these treatments. Tocainide alone significantly reduced the incidence of ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> without affecting atrial <b>arrhythmias.</b> It also controlled exercise-induced <b>arrhythmias</b> in 7 / 13 (54 %) patients. Atenolol significantly reduced atrial <b>arrhythmias</b> and had a good effect on exercise-induced <b>arrhythmias</b> (reduced in 75 % of patients), but it did not {{have a significant effect on}} ventricular <b>arrhythmias.</b> In 13 patients, despite normalization of blood pressure by atenolol, it was necessary to combine antihypertensive therapy (atenolol) with anti-arrhythmic therapy (tocainide) in order to reduce ventricular <b>arrhythmias.</b> All drugs were well tolerated. It is concluded that, in certain patients, specific anti-arrhythmic treatment may be necessary to control ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> in hypertensive patients despite normalization of blood pressure by beta-blockers...|$|R
5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela.

40|$|<b>Arrhythmias</b> {{and sudden}} cardiac death have a {{circadian}} pattern of occurrence in humans. We hypothesized that a circadian pattern of <b>arrhythmias</b> is also present in transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, which develop a dilated cardiomyopathy, <b>arrhythmias</b> and heart failure. To test this hypothesis, telemetry monitors were implanted and 24 hr, ambulatory ECG was recorded 5 days later. Animals were maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle. The incidence of ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> increased between 3 pm and 12 am, whereas atrial <b>arrhythmias</b> surged between 4 am and 12 pm. This circadian pattern of <b>arrhythmias</b> is in excellent agreement with human data (taking into account a 12 -hour shift between activity periods in diurnal humans and nocturnal rodents). The molecular mechanisms underlying such circadian patterns of <b>arrhythmias</b> were examined using gene expression analysis and mathematical modeling. 1...|$|R
5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac <b>arrhythmia</b> (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of cardiac <b>arrhythmias</b> and {{the elevation of}} lysophosphatidylcholine level in the ischemic myocardium have been well-documented {{in a number of}} studies. However, the relationship between the production <b>arrhythmias</b> and the elevation of tissue lysophosphatidylcholine level was not reported. In this study, the lysophosphatidylcholine level and the occurrence of cardiac <b>arrhythmias</b> in the ischemic canine heart were monitored. A temporal relationship between the accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine and the occurrence of <b>arrhythmias</b> was established after five hr of ischemia. A significant elevation of lysophosphatidylcholine was detected at three hr of ischemia without the occurrence of <b>arrhythmias.</b> The results indicate that cardiac <b>arrhythmias</b> did not cause the elevation of lysophosphatidylcholine and if lysophospholipids are causally related to the <b>arrhythmias</b> that a critical level of the lysophospholipid must accumulate in order to elicit electrophysiological alterations. © 1988 American Oil Chemists' Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>arrhythmias</b> during isometric sustained handgrip exercise and during dynamic graded bicycle exercise was compared {{in a group}} of 45 patients with various forms of heart disease on no antiarrhythmic therapy.

5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians.
