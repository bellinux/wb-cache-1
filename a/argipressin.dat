2500|$|Vasopressin, {{also named}} {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), [...] arginine vasopressin (AVP) or <b>argipressin,</b> is a hormone synthesized as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus, and {{is converted to}} AVP. It then travels down the axon of that cell, which terminates in the posterior pituitary, and is released from vesicles into the circulation in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality). AVP has two primary functions. First, it increases the amount of solute-free water reabsorbed back into the circulation from the filtrate in the kidney tubules of the nephrons. Second, AVP constricts arterioles, which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises arterial blood pressure.|$|E

50|$|Vasopressin, {{also known}} as {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), is a neurohypophysial hormone found in most mammals which is also used as a medication. In most species it contains arginine and is thus also called arginine vasopressin (AVP) or <b>argipressin.</b> Its two primary functions are to retain water {{in the body and}} to constrict blood vessels. Vasopressin regulates the body's retention of water by acting to increase water reabsorption in the kidney's collecting ducts, the tubules which receive the very dilute urine produced by the functional unit of the kidney, the nephrons.|$|E

40|$|Impairment of {{fibrinolysis}} {{is supposed}} to contribute to CVD. In 38 hyperlipoproteinemic patients, known {{to be at risk}} for early CVD, fibrinolytic activity was measured before and after stimulation with DDAVP. A negative correlation was found between serum triglyceride levels and fibrinolytic activity, both before and after DDAVP. A subnormal activity was invariably found when serum triglyceride concentration was above 8 mmol/L. The defect can be attributed to low levels of extrinsic plasminogen activator. High cholesterol levels were not associated with impairment of fibrinolyis. Fibrinolytic activity and response to DDAVP were lowest in those patients with hypertriglyceridemia who also had a tendency to develop hyperchylomicronemia (type V/IV). The low fibrinolytic activity in this type of hyperlipoproteinemia cannot be explained by obesity. Factor VIII was higher than normal in most patients with hyperlipoproteinemia; the level increased after stimulation with DDAVP in every patient. This imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis might increase the risk of CVD.
