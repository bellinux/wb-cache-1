500|$|Cruttwell's {{relations}} with his colleagues and {{students have been}} the subject of contradictory reports. [...] Waugh's biographer, Selena Hastings, describes him as of [...] "unprepossessing" [...] appearance, [...] "good-hearted but difficult", inclined to misogyny, brusque and sometimes offensive towards his male colleagues. Waugh's description is of someone [...] "tall, almost loutish, with the face of a petulant baby", of indistinct speech, who [...] "smoked a pipe which was attached to his blubber-lips by <b>a</b> <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> slime". Stannard records that Waugh's student contemporary Christopher Hollis, found nothing particularly remarkable about Cruttwell. [...] "Like Waugh", says Stannard, [...] "Cruttwell played up his eccentricities and had an uncharitable sense of humour". Ellis's 2004 biographical sketch suggests that much of Cruttwell's rebarbative manner, may have been the result of simple shyness.|$|E
500|$|Polynesian peoples {{often did}} not {{recognize}} Canis Minor as a constellation, but they saw Procyon as significant and often named it; in the Tuamotu Archipelago it was known as Hiro, meaning [...] "twist as <b>a</b> <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> coconut fiber", and Kopu-nui-o-Hiro ("great paunch of Hiro"), which was either {{a name for the}} modern figure of Canis Minor or an alternative name for Procyon. Other names included Vena (after a goddess), on Mangaia and Puanga-hori (false Puanga, the name for Rigel), in New Zealand. In the Society Islands, Procyon was called Ana-tahua-vahine-o-toa-te-manava, literally [...] "Aster the priestess of brave heart", figuratively the [...] "pillar for elocution". The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia gave Procyon and Gomeisa the names Magum and Gurumana, describing them as humans who were transformed into gum trees in the dreamtime. Although their skin had turned to bark, they were able to speak with a human voice by rustling their leaves.|$|E

The work purpose - {{development of a}} technique of definition of torques and forces <b>of</b> cutting at <b>a</b> <b>threading</b> <b>of</b> external <b>threads</b> by thread-cutting heads. It is shown that the total torque at <b>a</b> <b>threading</b> grooves consists <b>of</b> the moment of cutting and the moment of a friction of teeths on a calibrating part of combs. According to it the technique of determination of forces of cutting depending on a step of a cut carving, lengths of an intaking cone of combs, quantities of cutting and calibrating teeths is offered. Results of pilot studies are carried out at <b>a</b> <b>threading</b> grooves in <b>a</b> range of diameters of 20 - 30 mm with a step of 1, 5 - 3 mm, and also the share of forces of a friction in the general balance <b>of</b> forces <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threading</b> grooves is experimentally established. The technique and algorithm of determination of total length of cutting edges of combs is given. High stability of a ratio of making forces <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threading</b> grooves and their value for standard combs is shown. Results of researches can be used at tool design, determination of used capacity of the equipment and other calculations. ????????? ?????????? ????????????? ? ????????????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ? ??? ??????? ??? ????????? ???????? ????? ?????????, ?????????? ???????? ??? ??????????? ????????? ????? ??????? ??????, ??????????? ??????????? ????? ?????? ??????? ? ?????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ???? ????????, ??????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ? ???????, ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??? ???????...|$|R

2500|$|If mana is a {{distinct}} power, it may be treated distinctly. Marett distinguishes spells, which treat mana quasi-objectively, and prayers (which address the anima). An anima may have departed, leaving mana {{in the form of}} a spell which can be addressed by magic. Although Marett postulates an earlier pre-animistic phase, a [...] "rudimentary religion" [...] or [...] "magico-religious" [...] phase in which the mana figures without animae, [...] "no island of pure 'pre-animism' is to be found."

2500|$|The {{many aspects}} of Aderca's work, critics suggest, are held {{together}} by <b>a</b> <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> experimental literature. In reference to such aspects, Constantin Cubleșan defined Aderca as [...] "a permanent literary rebel, ever ready to contest anything and become enthusiastic, in equal measure, over anything, in fact searching for himself." [...] Writing in 2005, Ștefan Borbély noted that much of this literature was commercial in nature, driven by the wish to assimilate fashionable themes. In contrast, Henri Zalis, who cites an earlier statement made by Vianu, finds Aderca to be a storyteller in the Romantic tradition. Zalis also notes that such difficulties in assessing Aderca's stylistic category {{have to do with}} the single motivation of his protagonists, often an erotic one, which [...] "circumscribes" [...] their whole existence. Zalis sees Aderca's work as superficially indebted to the more naturalistic modernist school, through its vitalism, but ultimately [...] "bookish" [...] in character.|$|E
