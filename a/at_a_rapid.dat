During this period, the band Good Riddance found their new drummer, and sent Rise Against the audition tape of their number two choice, Brandon Barnes. A mutual friend gave Barnes' phone number to Principe, and after listening to Transistor Revolt, Barnes accepted the band's invitation.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} of poor {{attendance}} at ACC championship games in Tampa, Florida, organizers hoped moving the game to Charlotte, closer to the geographic center of the conference, would result in improved ticket sales. That hypothesis was borne out as early public sales approached 28,000 tickets before the participating teams were officially announced. After the announcement, each school sold its allotment of 10,000 tickets, and the more than 50,000 publicly available tickets were purchased <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> pace. ACC officials and Charlotte boosters each said they {{were satisfied with the}} pace and quantity of ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the stands of Bur Oak trees. The University of Michigan moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> rate {{in the early to}} mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a {{reputation}} as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as various student movements.|$|E

5|$|The {{functionality}} of calculator ICs increased <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> {{pace and}} Roberts was designing and producing new models. The MITS 7400 scientific and engineering calculator {{was introduced in}} December 1972. It featured trigonometric functions, polar to rectangular conversion, two memories, and up to a seven-level stack. A kit with a three-level stack was $299.95 and an assembled unit with a seven-level stack was $419.95. The next month the Series 1200 four-function pocket calculators were announced. The six-digit model was $59.95 and the twelve-digit model was $99.95.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, {{the embankment}} was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E

5|$|Deterioration of whale {{carcasses}} happens {{though a}} series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge the soft tissues <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> rate over a period of months, and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, MacLaren led Lancashire {{to victory}} in the County Championship, their only such success under his captaincy. Unusually for a Championship-winning team, the club relied heavily on batting rather than bowling. MacLaren played several big innings, scoring <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> pace, as his team began {{the season with a}} string of victories. Their form faded later in the season, but they {{remained}} unbeaten. In all first-class cricket, MacLaren scored 1,191 runs at 31.34. At some point during the season, he was asked by Ranjitsinhji, a close friend, to become his private secretary, and both men travelled to India during the winter of 1904–05. Ranjitsinhji at the time was pursuing his claim to the throne of Nawanagar, and he remained in India when MacLaren returned to England for the 1905 cricket season.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, a {{group of}} Bahraini merchants demanded {{restrictions}} on the British influence in the country. The group's leaders were subsequently arrested and exiled to India. In 1923, the British introduced administrative reforms and replaced Sheikh Issa bin Ali with his son. Some clerical opponents and families such as al Dossari left or were exiled to Saudi Arabia and Iran. Three years later the British placed the country under the de facto rule of Charles Belgrave who operated {{as an adviser to}} the ruler until 1957. Belgrave brought a number of reforms such as establishment of the country's first modern school in 1919, the Persian Gulf's first girls' school in 1928 and the abolition of slavery in 1937. At the same time, the pearl diving industry developed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> pace.|$|E

5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E
5|$|Palpatine's {{ultimate}} fate {{is further}} chronicled in the Dark Empire II and Empire's End series of comics. The Dark Empire II series, published from 1994 to 1995, details how the Emperor {{is once again}} reborn on Byss into a clone body. Palpatine tries to rebuild the Empire as the Rebel Alliance grows weak. In Empire's End (1995), a traitorous Imperial guard bribes Palpatine's cloning supervisor to tamper with the Emperor's stored DNA samples. This causes the clones to deteriorate <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> rate. Palpatine tries to possess the body of Anakin Solo, the infant son of Leia Organa and Han Solo, before the clone body dies, but is thwarted once again by Luke Skywalker. Palpatine is killed by a blaster shot fired by Han, but his spirit is captured by the mortally-wounded Jedi Empatojayos Brand. When Brand dies, he takes Palpatine's spirit with him, destroying the Sith Lord once and for all.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota is {{relatively}} notable for {{its lack of}} large urban centers. Sioux Falls, the largest city in the state, only ranks as the 152nd largest in the country, and the state's third-largest city, Aberdeen, {{has a population of}} less than 25,000. However, because the population in many rural areas has decreased over the last 50 years, and many cities in the state have grown <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> pace; the population has become more concentrated and less rural than it once was. According to 2007 census estimates, the three most populous counties in the state, Minnehaha, Pennington, and Lincoln, were home to 38.8% of South Dakotans, while in 1910, those counties held only 9.3% of the population.|$|E

5|$|Upon death, whale {{carcasses}} fall to {{the deep}} ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots, such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents. Deterioration of whale carcasses happens though {{a series of three}} stages. Initially, moving organisms, such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge soft tissue <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> rate over a period of months to as long as two years.

5|$|A church {{building}} had existed {{on the site}} since 1280. During this time, a small chapel stood on the site to serve the local townships of Oldham, Chadderton, Royton and Crompton. This was later replaced by an Early English Gothic church in the 15th century. With {{the coming of the}} Industrial Revolution, the population of Oldham increased <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> rate (from under 2,000 in 1714, to over 32,000 by 1831). The rapid growth of the local population warranted that the building be rebuilt into the current structure. Though the budget was originally agreed at £5,000, the final cost of building was £30,000, one third of which was spent on the crypt structure. Alternative designs by Sir Charles Barry, the designer of the Palace of Westminster, although now regarded by some as superior, were rejected. The Church, of the Anglican denomination, is in active use for worship, and forms part of the Diocese of Manchester. There are Roman Catholic churches in Oldham. These include Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St Patrick Church. It was built in 1870, was founded by priests from St Mary's Church in Oldham, and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets. However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, {{each with its own}} symbol, in addition to the eight major planets (Neptune had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol ④. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number–name designation, ④ Vesta, as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, (4) Vesta, which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as 4) Vesta and 4, Vesta, was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949. Today, either Vesta, or, more commonly, 4 Vesta, is used.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of November 7, the eye began to {{reappear}} and the storm turned towards the northwest and the foreword motion began to rapidly increase. Later that morning, Florence had developed a large, 35 to 40mi (55 to 65km/h) wide eye and the foreword motion continued to increase. The intensification continued and by the afternoon hours, Florence was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h). A strong extratropical cyclone located {{to the north of}} Florence was causing the storm to move towards the northwest <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>rapid</b> pace of 30mph (48km/h). Operationally, Florence was reported to have peaked at that intensity, but post season analysis determined that the storm reached its peak intensity just short of major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higherstatus late on November 7. By {{the morning of}} November 8, Florence weakened slightly to Category 1 status. The large system to the north continued to cause Florence to move at 58mph (93km/h). Since the storm was very close to a cold front, Florence was expected to rapidly transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later that morning, Florence was absorbed into the extratropical cyclone while still maintaining hurricane-force winds.|$|E
