500|$|In two papers {{outlining}} his [...] "theory of <b>atomicity</b> of the elements" [...] (1857–58), Friedrich August Kekulé was {{the first}} to offer a theory of how every atom in an organic molecule was bonded to every other atom.

2500|$|In ancient India, the Hindu {{schools of}} Samkhya and Vaisheshika, {{from around the}} early centuries AD {{developed}} theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light {{is one of the}} five fundamental [...] "subtle" [...] elements (tanmatra) out of which emerge the gross elements. The <b>atomicity</b> of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be continuous.|$|E
2500|$|Jet {{supports}} {{transaction processing}} for database {{systems that have}} this capability. (ODBC systems have one-level transaction processing, while several ISAM systems like Paradox do not support transaction processing.) A transaction {{is a series of}} operations performed on a database that must be done together [...] this is known as <b>atomicity</b> {{and is one of the}} ACID (<b>Atomicity,</b> Consistency, Isolation, and Durability), concepts considered to be the key transaction processing features of a database management system. For transaction processing to work (until Jet 3.0), the programmer needed to begin the transaction manually, perform the operations needed to be performed in the transaction, and then commit (save) the transaction. Until the transaction is committed, changes are made only in memory and not actually written to disk. Transactions have a number of advantages over independent database updates. One of the main advantages is that transactions can be abandoned if a problem occurs during the transaction. This is called rolling back the transaction, or just rollback, and it restores the state of the database records to precisely the state before the transaction began. Transactions also permit the state of the database to remain consistent if a system failure occurs in the middle of a sequence of updates required to be atomic. There is no chance that only some of the updates will end up written to the database; either all will succeed, or the changes will be discarded when the database system restarts. With ODBC's in-memory policy, transactions also allow for many updates to a record to occur entirely within memory, with only one expensive disk write at the end.|$|E
2500|$|LMDB makes unusual (novel) use of {{well-known}} computer science {{techniques such as}} copy-on-write semantics and B+ trees to provide <b>atomicity</b> and reliability guarantees as well as performance that {{can be hard to}} accept, given the library's relative simplicity and that no other similar key-value store database offers the same guarantees or overall performance, even though the authors explicitly state in presentations that LMDB is read-optimised not write-optimised. [...] Additionally, as LMDB was primarily developed for use in OpenLDAP its developers are focussed mainly on development and maintenance of OpenLDAP, not on LMDB per se. [...] The developers limited time spent presenting the first benchmark results was therefore criticized as not stating limitations, and for giving a [...] "silver bullet impression" [...] not adequate to address an engineers attitude (it has to be pointed out that the concerns raised however were later adequately addressed to the reviewer's satisfaction by the key developer behind LMDB.) ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Atomicity</b> {{does not}} behave {{completely}} orthogonally {{with regard to}} the other ACID properties of the transactions. For example, isolation relies on <b>atomicity</b> to roll back changes in the event of isolation failures such as deadlock; consistency also relies on rollback {{in the event of a}} consistency-violation by an illegal transaction. Finally, <b>atomicity</b> itself relies on durability to ensure the <b>atomicity</b> of transactions even in the face of external failures.|$|E
50|$|The reader should bear in {{mind that}} the <b>atomicity</b> of the actual {{entities}} is of a simply logical or philosophical kind, thoroughly different in concept from the natural kind of <b>atomicity</b> that describes the atoms of physics and chemistry.|$|E
5000|$|In {{database}} systems, <b>atomicity</b> (or atomicness; from Greek a-tomos, undividable) {{is one of}} the ACID transaction properties. A {{series of}} database operations in an atomic transaction will either all occur, or none will occur. The series of operations cannot be separated with only some of them being executed, which makes the series of operations [...] "indivisible". A guarantee of <b>atomicity</b> prevents updates to the database occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright. In other words, <b>atomicity</b> means indivisibility and irreducibility.|$|E

5000|$|Relaxation: One way to {{categorize}} the relaxed consistency is to define which sequential consistency requirements are relaxed. We can have less strict models by relaxing either program order or write <b>atomicity</b> requirements defined by Adve and Gharachorloo, 1996. Program order guarantees that each process issues a memory request ordered by its program and write <b>atomicity</b> defines that memory requests are serviced {{based on the}} order of a single FIFO queue. In relaxing program order, any or all the ordering of operation pairs, write-after-write, read-after-write, or read/write-after-read, can be relaxed. In the relaxed write <b>atomicity</b> model, a process can view its own writes before any other processors.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, Andreas Reuter and Theo Härder {{coined the}} acronym ACID as {{shorthand}} for <b>Atomicity,</b> Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, building on earlier work by Jim Gray who enumerated <b>Atomicity,</b> Consistency, and Durability but left out Isolation when characterizing the transaction concept. These four properties describe the major guarantees {{of the transaction}} paradigm, which has influenced many aspects of development in database systems.|$|E

50|$|A {{distributed}} transaction is a database transaction {{in which two}} or more network hosts are involved. Usually, hosts provide transactional resources, while the transaction manager is responsible for creating and managing a global transaction that encompasses all operations against such resources. Distributed transactions, as any other transactions, must have all four ACID (<b>atomicity,</b> consistency, isolation, durability) properties, where <b>atomicity</b> guarantees all-or-nothing outcomes for the unit of work (operations bundle).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Atomicity</b> {{requires}} that each transaction be [...] "all or nothing": if {{one part of}} the transaction fails, then the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee <b>atomicity</b> in each and every situation, including power failures, errors and crashes. To the outside world, a committed transaction appears (by its effects on the database) to be indivisible ("atomic"), and an aborted transaction does not happen.|$|E
5000|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{main memory}} databases store data on volatile memory devices. These devices lose all stored information when the device loses power or is reset. In this case, IMDBs {{can be said}} to lack support for the [...] "durability" [...] portion of the ACID (<b>atomicity,</b> consistency, isolation, durability) properties. Volatile memory-based IMDBs can, and often do, support the other three ACID properties of <b>atomicity,</b> consistency and isolation.|$|E

5000|$|Reentrancy of a {{subroutine}} {{that operates}} on operating-system resources or non-local data {{depends on the}} <b>atomicity</b> of the respective operations. For example, if the subroutine modifies a 64-bit global variable on a 32-bit machine, the operation may be split into two 32-bit operations, and thus, if the subroutine is interrupted while executing, and called again from the interrupt handler, the global variable {{may be in a}} state where only 32 bit have been updated. The programming language might provide <b>atomicity</b> guarantees for interruption caused by an internal action such as a jump or call. Then the function f in an expression like (global:=1)+(f (...) [...] ), where the order of evaluation of the subexpressions might be arbitrary in a programming language, would see the global variable either set to 1 or to its previous value, but not in an intermediate state where only part as been updated. (The latter can happen in C, because the expression has no sequence point). The operating system might provide <b>atomicity</b> guarantees for signals, such as a system call interrupted by a signal not having a partial effect. The processor hardware might provide <b>atomicity</b> guarantees for interrupts, such as interrupted processor instructions not having partial effects.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} science, write-ahead logging (WAL) is {{a family}} of techniques for providing <b>atomicity</b> and durability (two of the ACID properties) in database systems.|$|E
5000|$|Simplicity: This {{is one of}} {{the points}} where bus-system is superior. Since the bus {{structure}} itself can serve as an organizer for all the traffic that goes through the system, and ensure the <b>atomicity</b> of all the signals passed through. Thus, there will be no need to put more effort in insuring <b>atomicity</b> and ordering between signals as the case in directory based systems, which leads to several overhead faced in the later system design when dealing with issues like consistency.|$|E
