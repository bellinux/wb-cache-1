"Blood Ties" [...] {{featured}} the first appearances of Peter Gerety, Jon Seda and Callie Thorne as regular cast members on [...] Thorne portrayed Laura Ballard, a former Seattle homicide unit detective, marking the character's {{first appearance in}} the series. Gerety and Seda each previously played their respective characters in guest appearances on the show; Seda's character Paul Falsone {{first appeared in the}} two-part [...] finale. Stuart Gharty, Gerety's character, is described as a transplant from the department's internal affairs department. Executive producer Tom Fontana said he thought the new cast additions would create drama and tension between the characters: [...] "It's stimulating to add new people, because you're not feeling like you're writing or acting the same scene for the thousandth time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> three of them are very different than any other characters we've had on the show." ...|$|E

In response to questions by The Times about his 1973 statement, Huhne responded: [...] "To be honest I don't have any memory of it", saying that he was entitled to a private life before politics. In an interview published on the Kent News website on 10 November 2007, Huhne said: [...] "I clearly regret the views and I don't agree with those views at all. I was a teenager and I'm now 53 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> of us do tend to move on in life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Portal told Vanderkloot to [...] "stay handy to the telephone". The {{next day}} Vanderkloot {{was taken to}} Winston Churchill's {{residence}} at No.10 Downing Street. Churchill, clad in robe and slippers, offered him a drink, beginning a relationship that had Vanderkloot flying the Prime Minister on sensitive diplomatic trips across war-torn Europe, Russia, North Africa and the Middle-East. [...] "He took calculated risks," [...] said his son, William III. There {{was a lot more}} risk in flying back then. It was a frontier, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> the old pilots will say it, secretly to themselves, that they enjoyed being on their own. It was the wild blue yonder." [...] As Churchill's pilot, Vanderkloot flew Lord Mountbatten to England in June 1942, conveyed the Prime Minister and Chief of the Imperial General Staff Alan Brooke to Egypt in August 1942 to replace Claude Auchinleck commander of the British army in North Africa with Bernard Montgomery and also took Churchill to high-level talks in Moscow with Joseph Stalin, to Turkey to determine that country's wartime intentions, and to the Casablanca Conference in 1943.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Sir Gervaise, she's like a {{piece of}} broken crockery, just now, and one can't tell all her merits. She's not a bad goer, <b>and</b> weatherly, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>all</b> will call her. But she's thundering French, inside." ...|$|R

I firmly believe that in marrying me you will be SAFE. As I said just now," [...] he went on with a smile, [...] "I have no bad ways. I can DO so much for you. And if you are afraid that I am not what you have been accustomed to, not refined and delicate and punctilious, you may easily carry that too far. I AM delicate! You shall see!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' says he, 'but {{let me do}} some {{justice to}} the woman too; whoever she is, I do assure you she {{prompted}} me to nothing, she rather declined me. It was my own folly and madness that brought me into it all, ay, and brought her into it too; I must give her her due so far. As to what she took from me, I could expect no less from her in the condition I was in, and to this hour I know not whether she robbed me or the coachman; if she did it, I forgive her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> gentlemen that do so {{should be used in}} the same manner; but I am more concerned for some other things that I am for all that she took from me.' ...|$|E
60|$|Rulledge looked {{round on}} the rest of us, with an air of {{acquiring}} merit from the Bostonian's poetry, but Minver's gravity was proof against the chance of mocking Rulledge, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we <b>all</b> felt alike. Wanhope seemed especially interested, though he said nothing.|$|R

"Ralph Harcourt <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>all</b> your comrades in the Santa Barbara, {{except the}} three who fell by your side {{when you were}} captured, are well, and at present on the Island, as, {{for the last two}} years, none have been allowed to depart. As to other matters, they go not so well as one could wish. The commanderies have not responded to our call for aid as they should have done. For this, however, they are not {{altogether}} to blame, for we have been so often threatened with attack, and have so frequently applied for aid in money or men, that they must have begun to doubt whether the danger was really imminent. In other respects we are well prepared. We have obtained large stores of provisions from Egypt, and shall have no ground for uneasiness on that score. The defences have been greatly strengthened, and no one fears that we shall not be able to beat off an attack. We have destroyed the principal buildings outside the walls, though {{it would have been better}} could we have gone much further in this direction. And now let us have your adventures and escape." ...|$|E

Todd, in a pre-recorded interview, said: With political correctness which is a new concept of a way of life in this country <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> over the world it didn't exist when we made the original film so Nigger was Nigger, but nowadays you can't say that sort of thing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{band was}} never entirely {{convinced}} that Arden had paid them everything he owed them. Kenney Jones has mixed {{memories of the}} band's stormy relationship with Arden: [...] Without Don, the Small Faces may not have existed, without his sort of vision at that time, be it short-lived or what. The fact is we became known {{and we got a}} break through Don. So if you think of it like that <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> of us are prepared to swallow what went on, leave it, fine, it's history. We all learned from each other, he gave us our first break, fine, fair enough, you know, leave it. I've got good and bad memories but mainly I think of Don with affection, surprisingly enough.|$|E

5000|$|On 21 November 2007, it was alleged Jackson had [...] "espoused anti-Zionism" [...] {{during her}} tenure in the NUS.

The incident attracted significant media coverage because of Jackson's role as a staffer for candidate George Newhouse whose electorate of Wentworth has the highest Jewish population of any in Australia. The Australian Jewish News said Jackson's comments [...] "attacked the heart and soul of every Jewish voter". Jackson said she had not understood the definition of Zionism at the time she wrote the email, saying [...] "I support Israel." ...|$|E

5000|$|Vertov {{wrote in}} {{response}} to the criticism his film received upon its release. On page 114 of Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov, the director expressed his frustration with those critics who wanted to critique the film’s sound or the film’s footage individually and separately from each other. Instead, he believed that critics should view both the film’s sound and images and the way they worked together. In the same section of his writing, he urged for a holistic, contextualized critique of the film: “Those who worked on Enthusiasm <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>all</b> those in newsreel film, are interested in a many-sided (and not a one-sided) analysis of this film.” To Vertov, the role and place of his film in the course of cinema, Soviet cinema, and documentary film were all necessary components of critically appraising Enthusiasms success and significance.|$|E

When ambitions are all geared towards {{material goods}} and money, I think it displays a poverty of ambition ... The world is big ... and everybody here could be doing so much in whatever field is interesting to you. If you're into medicine, your dream should be how to cure AIDS or cancer; if you're interested in the law, you should aim for the Supreme Court; if you're into music, you should want to have hit #1 on the Billboard charts or write a symphony. The world offers so many opportunities, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> of {{you have so much}} potential and so much talent; it's just a matter of digging deep.
