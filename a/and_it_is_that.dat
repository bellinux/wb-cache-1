5|$|The Smallville {{incarnation}} of the character is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, who walks {{a fine line between}} good and evil. Lex is an inquisitive person, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses—it will ultimately lead him to being Clark's greatest enemy. Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a Saturn Award and a Teen Choice Award for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on Smallville. After seven seasons as a series regular, Michael Rosenbaum left the show, but reprised the role for the two-hour series finale.|$|E

From April to June 1865, he and his family resided in Richmond at the Stewart-Lee House. He accepted an offer to serve as the president of Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia, and served from October 1865 until his death. The Trustees used his famous name in large-scale fund-raising appeals and Lee transformed Washington College into a leading Southern college expanding its offerings significantly and added programs in commerce, journalism, and integrated the Lexington Law School. Lee was well liked by the students, which enabled him to announce an [...] "honor system" [...] like West Point's, explaining [...] "We have but one rule here, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> every student be a gentleman."

2500|$|Bernhardt's first American tour {{carried her}} to 157 {{performances}} in 51 cities. She traveled {{on a special}} train with her own luxurious palace car, which carried her two maids, two cooks, a waiter, her maitre d'hôtel, and her personal assistant, Madame Guérard. It also carried an actor named Édouard Angelo whom she had selected to serve as her leading man, and, according to most accounts, her lover during the tour. From New York, she made a side trip to Menlo Park, where she met Thomas Edison, who made a brief recording of her reciting a verse from Phèdre [...] She crisscrossed the United States and Canada from Montreal and Toronto to Saint Louis and New Orleans, usually performing each evening, and departing immediately after the performance. She gave countless press interviews and in Boston posed for photos {{on the back of}} a dead whale. She was condemned as immoral by the Bishop of Montreal and by the Methodist press, which only increased ticket sales. She performed Phedre six times and La Dame Aux Camilias (which Jarrett had renamed [...] "Camille" [...] to make it easier for Americans to pronounce) 65 times. On 3 May 1881, she gave her final performance of Camelias in New York. Throughout her life, she always insisted on being paid in cash. When Bernhardt returned to France, she brought with her a chest filled with $194,000 in gold coins [...] She described the result of her trip to her friends: [...] "I crossed the oceans, carrying my dream of art in myself, and the genius of my nation triumphed. I planted the French verb in the heart of a foreign literature, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of which I am most proud." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} quatrain, the beloved becomes [...] "now the world's fresh {{ornament}}". [...] "Fresh" [...] meaning new, young, beautiful, and vital and [...] "now" [...] perhaps {{meaning that the}} world did have another ornament before the youth but that those are gone and perhaps soon so will the youth. The next line, [...] "and only herald to the gaudy spring", means that the beloved is promised for life and growth just like each spring is. But [...] "within thine own bud buriest thy content", the youth only keeps his beauty and life to himself, instead of letting the world see in bloom. The word [...] "buriest" [...] suggests the youth digging his own grave and the end to his beauty. According to Philip J.T. Martin, in this line [...] "content" [...] means [...] "'all that he contains', which of course includes the power to beget children, {{and at the same}} time it means his 'contentment', now and more especially in the future, and the contentment which he could give to others". In the next line, [...] "and, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding", the speaker uses the paradox of the tender churl that makes waste in niggarding as the beginning of the turning point for the sonnet. He is setting up the couplet by saying that the youth is a worthless fellow by sinning and not procreating but that the speaker still loves him for his tenderness. The main theme of this quatrain ends with this line <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the youth may be a [...] "bud" [...] but can be the flower to the world and to not bloom is to make waste in that potential through one's own self-indulgence. To some scholars today, such as Helen Vendler, quatrain three is used a [...] "delay in wonder and admiration" [...] of the youth by the speaker. Philip Martin describes the third quatrain as a [...] "tone of self-love, as the poet sees it in the youth" [...] and it is [...] "not praise alone, nor blame alone; not one and then the other; but both at once".|$|E
