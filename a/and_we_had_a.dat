5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, John Fithian, {{president}} of the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO), criticized the dump months (among several other studio practices) at CinemaCon, the annual gathering of film exhibitors hosted by NATO.

He faulted the studios for their insufficiently diverse offerings in 2013 as compared to {{the first quarter of the}} year before, which he connected to the dump-months phenomenon.

[...] "The shot {{was a lot of fun}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great time working out how to do it," [...] Joel said.

[...] To achieve the explosion at Luke's Bar, Weeks said, [...] "We {{could not take}} out the windows , which are [...] multiple small colored glass and metal frames. We didn’t know frankly when we picked that location {{that we would have}} that explosion... What we did was build a fireproof box in the entrance <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire. And then we did a lighting effect on the inside and then the rest of the explosion was handled by visual effects." [...] For the scenes on the PATH train and station, location manager Jason Farrar noted that production had exclusive use of the tracks and platform during the day when ridership was low to get their shots.|$|E

[...] Lombardo's favorite song is [...] "At Dawn They Sleep", [...] "because {{it was kind of}} slow and grungy, but then it had that double-bass part at the end." [...] While recording the track, neither guitarists King or Jeff Hanneman who wrote the lyrics were in the studio—only Araya and Slagel. On reading the lyrics, which featured a misspelled word, Araya sang it as it was spelled, although it's not a real word. The song [...] "Hardening of the Arteries" [...] on the album ends with the a very similar section that makes up the beginning of the song [...] "Hell Awaits" [...] and {{is also one of the}} only Slayer songs to fade out on a continuous riff.|$|E

Outhwaite, like some of the other performers, expressed her enjoyment of the fancy dress aspect of the episode, and she loved her [...] "selfish, sad and manipulative" [...] character, Connie. The filming process was, for her, extremely enjoyable and memorable. Pemberton said that Hadland and Outhwaite [...] "brought a bubbly energy which injected into the hysteria of that room", naming the episode's production his favourite filming experience from the series. Shearsmith pointed to the scene in which [...] "a hen party invades the karaoke room and they start singing.

According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the hell out of the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E
500|$|Walt Disney first {{attempted}} to adapt [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into an animated film {{soon after the}} studio released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, but the project was ultimately abandoned when the story {{turned out to be}} [...] "a really hard nut to crack". According to Keane, this was mainly {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the fairy tale takes place within a tower. To overcome this, Tangleds writers were forced to develop a way of [...] "bringing Rapunzel out of the tower". Originally, the film was conceived under the title Rapunzel Unbraided, which Keane described as [...] "a Shrek-like version of the film" [...] that revolved around an entirely different concept. Keane said of the original plot, [...] "It was a fun, wonderful, witty version <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> couple of great writers. But in my heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine to get out of the story, so we set it aside and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writers were}} new to screenwriting, so their film {{treatment}} ran to 110-pages; the average was 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, {{an executive at}} Universal Studios. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the [...] "Seven Fires" [...] film treatment as Tanen's assistant, while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, [...] "We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit... We didn't back off anything". As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay (nine in total), the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, [...] "They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we’ll {{make a couple of}} bucks if we're lucky—let them do whatever they want.' ...|$|E

500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E
