40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to examine {{critically}} the correlations between ionization potential or <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> and the catalytic behavior of binary and ternary oxides containing lanthanides (Ln) in alkene oxidation. Five lanthanide oxides (La 2 O 3, Sm 2 O 3, Pr 6 O 11, Tb 4 O 7, and CeO 2) and three praseodymium molybdates (Pr- 2 -Mo 3 O 12, Pr 6 MoO 12, and Pr 2 MoO 6, were used as pure phases or in mixtures with MoO 3 in the partial and total oxidation of isobutene. The catalytic performances of their mixtures with MoO 3 are described {{in the context of}} the "remote control mechanism", according to which the lanthanide-based oxides are identified as donors of spillover oxygen. Their donor ability is evaluated through the synergetic effects on methacrolein selectivity and correlated with the physical properties mentioned above. In the case of ternary oxides such as praseodymium molybdates, the concepts of average ionization energy and average <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> are proposed to take into account the fact that the electron density and therefore the reactivity of mobile surface oxygen species are influenced by the presence of both metals in the lattice.

The Young’s moduli of seven tissue-mimicking materials (in vitro; Young’s modulus range, 20 – 80 kPa; increments of 10 kPa) and the human medial gastrocnemius muscle (in vivo) were quantified using ultrasound elastography. On the basis of the strain/Young’s modulus ratio of two reference materials, one hard and one soft (Young’s moduli of 7 and 30 kPa, respectively), the Young’s moduli of the tissue-mimicking materials and medial gastrocnemius muscle were calculated.

Other metals of this unique quality do not – as the temperature rises, the hardness decreases. Only manganese with a tetragonal lattice exhibits a hardness maximum at 650 - 750 °C; a maximum hardness is observed near the α D β transformation of manganese. The <b>absolute</b> maximum of <b>hardness</b> at 440 °C for iron allows (by analogy) to assume a transformation in iron at this temperature.

40|$|The {{relatively}} low lying first electronic excited states of peroxyl radicals are suggested {{to play a}} direct {{role in determining the}} rate of their addition to alkenes, with there being, {{in the vicinity of the}} transition state, an unavoided crossing of Cs symmetry of the ground and first excited states. If there is no charge transfer between radical and alkene during the formation of the adduct, then the barrier height is approximately equal to the energy required to excite an isolated peroxyl radical to its first excited state; with charge transfer, the activation energy for the addition is lowered in proportion to the energy released by the charge transfer. It is also suggested that for the specific case of hydroperoxyl radical addition to ethene, this description is compatible with the generally accepted mechanism for the reaction of ethyl radicals with molecular oxygen whereby the resulting ethylperoxyl radical can decompose to ethene and a hydroperoxyl radical via a cyclic 2 A transition state.

40|$|International audienceThe atomic {{electrostatic}} potentials {{calculated by}} the CHELPG method {{have been shown}} to be sensitive indicators of the gas phase and solution properties of the statins. Solvation free energies in water, n-octanol and n-octane have been determined using the SMD solvent model. The percentage hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (or lipophilicity) of the statins in solution have been determined using (a) the differences in solvation free energies between n-octanol and n-octane as a measure of hydrophilicity, and the solvation energy in octane as a measure of hydrophobicity (b) the sum of the atomic electrostatic charges on the hydrogen bonding and polar bonding nuclei of the common pharmacophore combined with a solvent measure of hydrophobicity, and (c) using the buried surface areas after statin binding to HMGCR to calculate the hydrophobicity of the bound statins. The data suggests that clinical definitions of statins as either "hydrophilic" or "lipophilic" based on experimental partition coefficients are misleading. An estimate of the binding energy between rosuvastatin and HMGCR has been made using: (a) a coulombic electrostatic interaction model, (b) the calculated desolvation and resolvation of the statin in water, and (c) the first shell transfer solvation energy as a proxy for the restructuring of the water molecules immediately adjacent to the active binding site of HMGCR prior to binding. De-solvation and re-solvation of the statins before and after binding to HMGCR are major determinants of the energetics of the binding process. An analysis of the amphiphilic nature of lovastatin anion, acid and lactone and fluvastatin anion and their abilities to cross the blood brain barrier has indicated that this process may be dominated by desolvation and resolvation effects, rather than the statin molecular size or statin-lipid interactions within the bilayer. The ionization energy and electron affinity of the statins are sensitive physical indicators of the ease that the various statins can undergo endogenous oxidative metabolism.

40|$|Introduction. The {{widespread}} use of drugs with antimicrobial action {{has led to the}} formation of microorganism resistance against wide range of antibiotics. One of the approaches to dissolving this problem is the substances modification by inorganic bioactive ions in oder to initiate a controlled reaction in the bone tissues and provision of antimicrobial activity. It is known that ZnO-based materials have a pronounced biocompatibility, they are characterized by high limit strength, <b>absolute</b> mechanical <b>hardness,</b> as well as the ability to withstand the harsh operating conditions. The aim of this work is the study of structural and biocidal properties of composite material based on zinc oxide and zinc sulfide (ZnS-ZnO) and its complex with an organic substance - sodium alginate (ZnS-ZnO-Alg) for use in biomedical purpose. Materials and methods. For the synthesis of ZnS-ZnO composite 50 ml 0. 2 M solution zinc nitrate was added to the 50 ml 0. 2 M thiourea CS (NH ₂) ₂ solution and stirred in a shaker for 60 minutes. The formation of the compound took place when added to a mixture of 25 mas. % solution of ammonia with the subsequent heating at 80 oC for 30 minutes. Synthesis of the metalorganic complex of ZnS-ZnO-Alg was performed by above mentioned procedure, but to the thiourea solution was previously added 1 ml of 3 mas. % solution of sodium alginate under ultrasonic mixing [...] For the next research composites were dried or lyophilized. Study of antibacterial activity of the ZnS-ZnO and ZnS-ZnO-Alg particles was carried out with the use of nutrient mediums: Muller Hinton, meat-pepton nutrient (MPN). As the reference cultures were used E. coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATSS 29213, S. aureus ATSS- 6538, C albicans ATCC 885 - 653. Determination of the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was carried out by a modified serial diluted method in liquid nutrient broth followed plating on solid Muller Hinton nutrient medium. In addition, the study of the sensitivity of the above listed microorganisms to the experimental samples was carried out by the method of diffusion in Agar in the modification of the wells. The crystallinity and structure of precipitates were examined using an X-ray diffractometer DRON 3. The elemental composition of synthesized samples was studied by an X ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis using ElvaX Light SDD spectrometer. Results and discussion. X-ray structural analysis indicate that in the composite material, synthesized both in the presence of sodium alginate (ZnS-ZnO-Alg) and without sodium alginate adding (ZnS-ZnO) exist two phases: ZnS and ZnO. Based on RFA calculations show that ZnS-ZnO sample contains up to 50 wt. % zinc oxide. Zinc oxide content in the ZnS-ZnO-Alg is about 25 wt. %. The MBC was determined by above described method placing the liquid from each tube with a sample on a Mueller-Hinton solid culture medium. MBC of ZnS- ZnO-Alg samples against all studied microorganism strains was 1, 25 mg/ml. MBC of ZnS- ZnO samples ranged from 5 mg/ml for C. albicans to 12. 5 mg/ml for E. coli. It is possible that due to small sample solubility in experimental conditions and small ion diffusion of the active substance there was no full contact with the whole bacterial cell volume. As ZnS-ZnO-Alg samples differe from ZnS- ZnO samples by smaller crystallite size and greater solubility, they exhibit a marked antimicrobial effect. At the same time in direct contact of the entire surface of the sample with bacterial cells under condition of the modifying method of diffusion into agar, both types of samples showed high antimicrobial activity. Obtained data can be explained by two major mechanisms of the antimicrobial action ZnO and ZnS: a) toxic effects of zinc ions in the cell membrane of bacteria; b) toxicity ROS (reactive oxygen spices), formed with the participation of ZnO and ZnS, on components of the bacterial cell. Antibacterial activity is the result of the formation such ROS, as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), peroxide anion (O 2 -), hydroxyl radicals (OH-). These particles damage cellular components such as DNA, lipids and proteins. Conclusion. The composites ZnS- ZnO and ZnS-ZnO-Alg have been obtained by the applied method of synthesis. X-ray structural analysis of samples proved the presence of ZnO and ZnS phase with defined structure: ZnS has a cubic crystal structure type sphalerite (JCPDS 5 - 566) with average crystallite size of 23 nm and ZnO - hexagonal structure (JCPDS 80 - 75) with an average size of about 35 nm. The introduction of sodium alginate to the reaction mixture during synthesis reduces the size of ZnS and ZnO crystallites to 10 nm and 12 nm, respectively. In the ZnS-ZnO-Alg samples, synthesized in presence of sodium alginate, the ZnS phase content increased for 25 wt. % compared with the ZnO phase, which was confirmed by XRF. Microbiological studies have shown the presence of antimicrobial activity of samples against Gram-positive S. aureus, Gram-negative E. coli and fungi C. albicans. The estimated values for the integral antimicrobial activity, calculated by the vector theory, are for ZnS-ZnO and ZnS-ZnO-Alg 1, 57 and 1, 9 respectively. It means that both types of samples have average antimicrobial activity...|$|R
40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, April 2013. Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) was applied to investigate the geometric and electronic properties of cobalamin (Cbl) models. Model compounds of the type, [B–(Co(III) (L) 4 –X) –Y]n+ were used, where B and Y were comprised of the alpha (α) and β axial ligands, (L) 4 represented the equatorial ligand(s) and X was either hydrogen or a substituent of electron donating or withdrawing character, quantified by the Hammett constant (σp), at C 10 of the corrin. All calculations were conducted in the gas phase or implicit solvent medium at the BP 86 / 6 - 31 +G(d,p) level of theory. High-resolution crystal structures of B 12, extracted from the Cambridge Crystal Structural Database (CCSD), were used {{as the source of}} initial coordinates. DFT was used to explore the trans influence of the lower (α) axial ligand, the cis influence of various equatorial ligands and the cis influence of a substituted corrin ring at the C 10 position on the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the Co(III) –Cβ bond. Other geometric parameters such as ring distortion, axial bond lengths, equatorial bond lengths and partial charges on the Co metal centre, donor atom of the upper and lower axial ligands as well as the N-donor atoms of the macrocyclic ring are documented and discussed. The use of a broad range of alpha (α) ligands in the cobalamin models from charged and neutral N-donor ligands (NH 3, NH 2 –, NH 2 –, NH 2 F, NHF–, NF 2 –, NH 2 CH 3, NHCH 3, NH(CH 3) 2, N(CH 3) 3), to naturally occurring amino acids or realistic models of their metal-coordinating side chains (methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, cysteine, methanethiolate, glycine, p-aminopyridine, imidazole, histidine, acetate, 2 -propanol, serine and tyrosine), provided significant information on the trans influence of these ligands on the BDE of the Co(III) –C bond (upper axial ligand). The ligands NH 3, NH 2 –, NH 2 –, NH 2 F, NHF–, NF 2 –, NH 2 CH 3, NHCH 3, were used to explore electronic effects while NH 3, NH 2 CH 3, NH(CH 3) 2, and N(CH 3) 3 were used to investigate steric effects. The naturally occurring amino acids or their models focused primarily on exploring why nature chooses an N-donor ligand such as histidine or imidazole instead of an S-donor or O-donor ligand that is also readily available from protein side chains. As the basicity of the α ligand increased in the series NH 2 F < NH 3 < CH 3 NH 2 < (CH 3) 2 NH < (CH 3) 3 N < NHF– < NHCH 3 – < NH 2 – < NF 2 – < NH 2 –(as assessed by the proton affinities) a normal trans influence was observed between the axial ligands. While the Co(III) –C bond was observed to increase in length, the Co(III) –Nα bond length decreased. The weakening of the Co(III) –C bond was paralleled by the decrease in the Co(III) –C BDE. On the other hand, as the steric bulk of the α ligand (NH 3, NH 2 CH 3, NH(CH 3) 2, and N(CH 3) 3) increased (assessed by the molar volume and Tolman cone angle), an inverse trans influence (in other words, simultaneous lengthening or shortening) between the upper and lower axial bonds was observed. The Co(III) –C bond showed a marginal increase in length while the Co(III) –Nα bond length steadily increased as the molar volume of the α ligand increased. Interestingly, the large difference in the Co–Nα bond length from the 5 -coordinate to the 6 -coordinate complex (later referred to as ΔCo–Nα(5 c- 6 c)), paralleled the decrease of the Co(III) –C BDEs. It also became evident from calculations with the amino acids posing as α ligands that the nature of the α ligand (assessed by the <b>absolute</b> chemical <b>hardness</b> (η) of the ligand, with the greater the η value the harder the ligand) {{plays a major role in}} the labilisation of the organometallic bond. As the η of the α ligand increased, the Co(III) –C BDE increased. The trans influence of the α ligands resulted in the strengthening (hard ligand) and weakening (soft ligand) of the Co(III) –C bond, as was affirmed by the electron density at the bond critical point (bcp) of the Co(III) –C bond. The N-donor ligands (described as having an intermediate character as the η- values were between the hard and soft ligands) were found to be catalytically suitable (31. 89 – 32. 45 kcal mol - 1), rather than the soft and hard donor ligands. The trans influence of the latter two ligands on the upper axial bond revealed a weakly and strongly bound alkyl group to the Co metal centre, giving Co(III) –C BDEs values of 29. 39 – 32. 27 kcal mol- 1 and 32. 54 – 34. 96 kcal mol- 1, respectively. In addition to the corrin macrocycle, other equatorial ligands like cobaloxime, corrole, porphyrin, methylcobalt(III) pentaamine, [14 -ane]N 4, [15 -ane]N 4 and [16 -ane]N 4 were used in calculations to explore the cis influence on the labilisation of the Co(III) –C bond. These ligands included saturated and unsaturated cyclic rings. The results showed that the flexibility of the ring increased as the size of the equatorial ligand increased and thus affected the displacement of the Co(III) metal centre from the defined mean plane. This subsequently affected the strength of the organometallic bond, which paralleled the BDEs. The hydrogen atom at C 10 of the corrin ring was substituted by electron donating (CH 3, OH and NH 2) or –withdrawing groups (NO, NO 2, CN, COOH and Br) and the cis influence of these groups on the organometallic bond was investigated. A normal trans influence between the axial ligands was observed. As the electron density from the substitutents increased towards the ring, the Co(III) –C bond strengthened and the Co(III) –Nα bond weakened. The increased electron density from the C 10 substituents influenced the contraction of the Co–Nα bond length. The greater difference in contraction of the Co–Nα bond length from the 5 -coordinate to the 6 -coordinate complex (ΔCo–Nα(5 c- 6 c)) resulted in lower Co(III) –C BDEs. The TD-DFT method was used to generate both the absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectra where the vertical electronic excited states of Co(III) cobalamin species that differ with respect to their upper axial ligand, including FCbl, ClCbl, BrCbl,SeCNCbl and CH 3 Cbl were calculated. The cis influence for each of the species was analysed within the framework of TD-DFT to assign the major spectral features, in other words, the α/β, D/E and γ bands in the predicted UV-visible spectra. These studies reveal that the “typical” and “atypical” absorption exhibit a high degree of σ-donation from the β-ligand to the Co(III) metal centre and the subsequent destabilisation of the corresponding d-orbitals of Co. Furthermore, as the donor ability of the β ligand increased, the contributions from the antibonding d z 2 orbital to the HOMO increased, leading to a strong Co(III) –Nα σ-antibonding interaction, which is consistent with the observed lengthening of the same bond from FCbl, ClCbl, BrCbl, SeCNCbl to CH 3 Cbl...|$|R

We determined {{for the first time}} the most-stable chemical structures from their reported structures, using the semiempirical molecular—orbital method (CONFLEX/PM 5), and then delineated the relationship between their cytotoxicity (evaluated by 50 % cytotoxic concentration, CC 50) and a total of twelve parameters. The parameters used are the molecular weight and eleven chemical descriptors: the heat of formation (COSMO, non-COSMO), stability of hydration (=COSMO – nonCOSMO (ΔH)), dipole moment (D), hydrophobicity (log P), highest occupied molecular orbital energy (EHOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (ELUMO), <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> [η=(ELUMO–EHOMO) / 2], absolute electron negativity [χ=–(ELUMO+EHOMO) / 2], reactivity index (ω=χ 2 / 2 η) and surface area (Å 2), and volume of the molecule (Å 3). There was good correlation between the CC 50 value and all descriptors except for <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> in HL- 60 cells. There was also a good correlation between the CC 50 value and EHOMO, χ, ω, surface area, volume and molecular weight in HSC- 2, HSC- 3 and HSC- 4 cells. The descriptors determined by the present method are useful in evaluating the biological activity of trihaloacetylazulenes. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) represents the quantitative relationship between the structure and biological (pharmaceutical or toxicological) activity of chemical substances. The purpose of QSAR is to predict the pharmacological potency of structurally-related compounds by this mathematical relationship between the two.

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis was performed to derive QSAR models using the descriptors, molecular weight (MW), conformation minimum energy (ɛ), HOMO energy (HOMO), shape index, basic kappa second order (k 2), <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> (h), electronegativity (c), electrophilicity index (ω), molar volume (MV), molar refractivity (MR), LogP (LP), parachor (Pc) and solvent accessibility surface area (SASA). The QSAR models equations of anti-amoebic agents have been developed by using maximum of seven descriptors, in which conformation minimum energy, shape index, molar volume and parchor were present have good predictive powers of correlation coefficients. These models can successfully predict the anti-amoebic activity of any newly discovered pyrazoline and dioxazole derivatives which can later be tested in laboratory...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} the relationship between structure and activity of neurotransmitters in the human brain is of vital importance for the design targeted drugs. Using density functional theory and hybrid exchange correlation energy functionals we have studied the structure-activity-relationships of some important neurotransmitters and selected drugs by calculating their <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> (η) and absolute electronegativity (χ). A plot of the η- χ diagram allowed us to assign them into three distinct groups, namely, (i) Acetylcholine analogs (positively charged structure), (ii) GABA analogs (zwitterionic structures) and (iii) monoamines. The results suggest that brain stem is chemically soft because of distribution of monoaminergic nerve pathways. Prefrontal cortex is also chemically soft due to secretion of dopamine from mesocortical dopaminergic nerve A 10, whereas neocortex is chemically hard due to presence of zwitterionic neurotransmitters. Target drugs (agonists/antagonists) can also be predicted by comparing the η- χ diagram of neurotransmitters with those of the drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of dopamine and 3, 4 -dihydroxymethamphetamine (HHMA) {{has been studied}} {{in the presence of}} GSH and cysteine as a nucleophile. In order to determine the optimized geometries, energies, dipole moments, atomic charges, thermochemical analysis and other properties, we performed quantum chemical ab initio and density functional calculations at B 3 LYP level with 6 - 31 G* basis set. The structural and vibrational properties of 5 -S-glutathionyldopamine, 5 -S-cysteinyldopamine and 5 -S-N-acetylcysteinyldopamine are studied. The chemical shifts of anisotropy and Δδ are calculated. The gauge-invariant atomic orbital (GIAO) method was employed to calculate isotropic atomic shielding of compounds. These calculations yield molecular geometries in good agreement with available experimental data. The bond lengths, bond angles, dipole moment, electron affinity, ionization potential, electronegativy, <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness,</b> highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the studied compounds were calculated in gas phase and water.

40|$|A semiempirical molecular-orbital method (CAChe) {{was applied}} to {{delineate}} {{the relationship between the}} cytotoxicity (evaluated by 50 % cytotoxic concentration, CC 50) of fifteen phenoxazine derivatives and eleven physical parameters (descriptors). Most of the phenoxazine derivatives had extended and planar structure. The cytotoxic activity of phenoxazines against the human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC- 2 and HSC- 4 cells correlated to electron affinity, <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> (eta), absolute electron negativity (chi) and octanol-water distribution coefficient (log-P). However, only log-P was correlated to CC 50 in the HSC- 3 cells, whereas only heat of formation and log-P were correlated to CC 50 in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL- 60 cells. The cytotoxic activity of the phenoxazine derivatives became maximum at the log-P= 5. 9. Their cytotoxicity strongly depended on the chi value, but not on the eta value. Compounds with relatively higher cytotoxicity showed higher chi value (chi > 5. 28), whereas compounds with relatively lower cytotoxicity showed lower chi value (chi < 4. 27). These data suggest that appropriate chemical descriptors should be selected to estimate the cytotoxicity of phenoxazines, depending on the target cells...|$|E
40|$|The solid {{solution}} series Ba(In,Ce) O 3 -ä {{has been investigated}} with respect to structure, formation, and mobility of protonic defects. Compared to the limited solubility of Y 2 O 3 in BaCeO 3 and BaZrO 3, the complete solubility of In 2 O 3 is suggested to reflect a relation between <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> of the dopant and the ease of insertion into the hosting lattices. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) was used to probe the local environment of In 3 + in barium cerate: in the surroundings of the dopant, the orthorhombic structure is strongly modified, resulting in an increase of local symmetry. The InO 6 octahedra are very regular, {{and there is no}} indication for any defect clustering. This is suggested to be the main reason for the low entropy of formation of protonic defects by water dissolution. The mobility of such defects is slightly lower than in Y-doped BaCeO 3, but at high dopant levels the high local symmetry allows for formation of very high concentrations of protonic defects. This leads to high proton conductivities, which render In 3 + an attractive dopant for BaCeO 3 -based proton conductors...|$|E
40|$|Quantum {{chemical}} descriptors such as heat of formation, {{energy of}} HOMO, total energy, <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> and chemical potential in different combinations {{have been used}} to develop QSAR models of inhibitors of enzyme ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, RDR. The inhibitors are mainly derivatives of 1 -formylisoquinoline thiosemicarbazone and 2 -formylpyridine thiosemicarbazone. The values of various descriptors have been evaluated with the help of Win MOPAC 7. 21 software using DFT method. Multiple linear regression analysis has been made with the help of above mentioned descriptors using the same software. Regression equations {{have been found to be}} successful models as indicated by the regression coefficient r 2 having the value as high as 0. 96 and cross validation coefficient rCV 2 having the value approaching 0. 95. The value of these two coefficients is indicative of high order of reliability for the proposed prediction. The results obtained are also validated on account of the closeness of observed and predicted inhibitory activities. The best combination of descriptors is heat of formation, total energy and energy of HOMO. Thus the prediction of suitability of inhibitors of the enzyme RDR can be made with the help of the best regression equation...|$|E
40|$|Mobile mining {{equipment}} often operates in harsh environments characterised by remote locations and highly variable rock and operating conditions. This research explores {{the hypothesis that}} the failure behaviour of {{mining equipment}} is influenced by the physical properties of the ore and waste. We describe a method of examining this relationship via data mining on maintenance records and apply it to the hydraulic cylinders of two classes of earthmoving mobile equipment. Failure data for the analysis are drawn from maintenance work orders from 14 sites mining for haematite iron, nickel sulphide, and coking and thermal coal. The results show that the distributions of the estimated life parameters for hydraulic cylinders on earthmoving equipment are distinctly different for haematite iron, coal, and nickel sulphide sites. Analysis of the relationship between selected physical properties identified the influence of rock impact hardness number, abrasion index, and <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> of the ore as significant factors for these hydraulic cylinders. Their effects are significant when parameters are considered in combination, for example, rock impact hardness number and abrasion index, and vary according to the cylinder type and asset class. The engineering implications of these results are considered with respect to known failure modes of the cylinders...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Recent {{studies have}} shown that hardness, a complex property, can be {{calculated}} using very sim ple approaches or even analytical formulae. These form the basis for evaluating controversial experimental results (as we illustrate for TiO 2 cotunnite) and enable a systematic search for novel hard materials, for instance, using global optimization algorithms (as we show on the example of SiO 2 polymorphs). DOI: 10. 3103 /S 1063457610030019 Key words: evolutionary prediction of crystal structure, TiO 2 cotunnite, SiO 2 polymorphs, computational design of superhard materials. We all know that diamond is very hard, while graphite and talc are soft. Hardness, as a property of materials, determines many of their technological applications, but remains a poorly understood property. The aim of this Special Issue is to review {{some of the most important}} recent developments in the understanding of hard ness. Mohs’s relative scale of hardness appeared in the XIX century and is still widely used by mineralogists; in this scale talc has hardness 1, and diamond has hardness 10. There are several absolute definitions of hard ness—the most popular ones being the Knoop and Vickers tests of hardness, which involve indentation (rather than scratching, as in Mohs’s hardness). The <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> is measured in GPa, the same units as pressur...|$|E
40|$|Fully {{optimized}} {{structures of}} three- and four-coordinated Ni (0), Cu(I) and Zn(II) complexes with varied combination of hard (H_ 2 O or H_ 3 N) and soft (H_ 2 S, H_ 3 P) ligands were computed using density functional theory (DFT). Frequency calculations {{were carried out}} to ascertain that the structures were true minima. In the case of Cu(I) and Zn(II), the heat of formation (HOF) values are smaller with larger number of soft ligands. The increase in the HOF on replacing a soft ligand with a hard ligand is less for Cu(I) than for Zn(II). The corresponding HOF is negative for Ni(0) which is not stable with a complement of four hard ligands. The calculated chemical hardness parameters based on vertical ionization potentials clearly indicate the preference of four hard ligands for Zn(II) and four soft ligands for Ni(0). Significantly, the maximum chemical hardness was computed for Cu(I) complex [Cu(PH_ 3) _ 3 (NH_ 3) ]^+, a combination of three soft and one hard ligand. The conclusions derived from <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> data computed for the complexes closely parallel the experimentally observed stability of Cu(I) with an optimum number of hard and soft ligands in its coordination sphere in solution...|$|E

In addition quality of pH {{is one of the}} most important properties that forms suitable medium for activity of enzymes complexes that have crucial influence on character of produced wort. Moreover enzymes influence the yield of production process and quality of final product as well. Quality of boiling water and especially its hardness have crucial task in terms of keeping optimal qualitative parameters. Water hardness is given by amount of salts, mainly calcium and magnesium salts. It is expressed as <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> which is given by sum of temporary (carbonate) and permanent (noncarbonate) hardness. In our work we solved the effect of total water hardness on final pH of various intermediate products. We used different water samples and we prepared variants of total hardness by stirring of unpurified water with distilled water thus we achieved various values of hardness. For comparison we prepared several brews with regard to combinations of unpurified water and distilled water. Higher pH of boiling water was caused due to higher water alkalinity that negatively affected enzyme complex present in used malt. Presence of hydrogenphosphates in used malt had high buffering ability and pH lowering ability. Such unfavorable result could be adjust by use of various additions of acidulates that would have in great extent influence on beer final price therefore boiling water adjustment seems to be the most acceptable approach...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{with the aim of}} evaluating the relative tribological behaviour at high temperature of (Ti 1 -xAlx) N coatings commercially deposited on WC inserts. The (Ti 1 -xAlx) N multilayered, nanostructured and single-layer coatings, which contained different Ti/Al atomic ratios varying from 7 / 3 to 2 / 3 respectively, were deposited by employing a commercial PVD cathodic arc process. The <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> value for each coating is also reported and has been calculated from the Vickers microhardness measurements by using one of the models published in the literature. Standard ball-on-disc testing was conducted in order to determine friction coefficients and wear rates for these systems against a 6 mm alumina ball. These tests have been carried out in conditions that are not common in industrial use, e. g. metal cutting tools inasmuch as alumina is not a representative workpiece material. The sliding tests were performed out at 25, 500 and 700 °C with 5 N normal loads. At 25 °C, a wear volume, V, of approximately 10 - 2 mm 3 was obtained for all the tested coatings. When the test temperature increased to 500 °C, the single-layered coatings showed a wear volume of the same order of magnitude as those tested at room temperature. The multilayered coated samples decreased their wear volume by one order of magnitude, whereas the nanostructured samples showed almost no wear. At 700 °C, the wear volume values reported for all samples were similar and of the same order of magnitude as those tested at room temperature. The wear mechanism is discussed together with the morphological and compositional characteristics, determined by SEM coupled with EDX analysis...|$|E
40|$|Many doped perovskites show high proton {{conductivity}} at intermediate to {{high temperatures}} (500 - 900 °C), which has opened possibilities for many prospected applications in energy conversion (fuel cells), and electrochemical devices. In a doped perovskite, e. g. BaCe 1 -xYxO 3 -y, oxygen vacancies {{are created by}} charge compensation, and can eventually react with air moisture to form structural protonic defects. The sluggish nature of the proton, which is practically invisible to most structural analyses, and poses enormous problems to quantum chemistry, has surely contributed {{to slow down the}} progress in the understanding of these materials: in fact, the conduction dynamics and its interplay with structure are still matter of debate. The kind of trivalent dopant and its size, and the doping level, have all been found to critically influence the conductivity: to date, however, no comprehensive model was developed, and no clear explanations exist between the chemical and dynamical properties. Here we present results collected in several EXAFS experiments on doped BaCeO 3 and BaZrO 3 spanning three years, on the Ba site, Ce site, and the dopant (yttrium, gadolinium, indium: the ionic sizes of these are respectively equal, larger and smaller than Ce 4 +) site. The local structures up to about 6 Å around each site are solved with state-of-the-art techniques employing both the GNXAS and FEFF approaches, revealing unique features and demonstrating that in this case the conventional diffraction techniques are not suited to unravel the complexity of doped crystals. In particular, the attention will be drawn on the local deviations from Vegard’s law, the local expansion/contraction as a function of hydration degree, the interplay between dopant and defects, and the chemical compatibility (Pearson <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness)</b> instead of ionic size matching. The EXAFS results are correlated with complementary information about the dynamics of protons and other defects (IR and neutron vibrational spectroscopy, QENS, ionic and electronic conductivity measurements) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out in order to study the fatigue and corrosion–fatigue behavior of a 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloy coated with an electroless Ni–P (EN) deposit, in the as-plated condition, of approximately 38 – 40 μm in thickness and a high P content, of approximately 18 wt%. The results obtained, show that the EN coating can give rise to a significant improvement in the fatigue and corrosion–fatigue performance of the substrate, depending on the testing conditions. When the coated system is tested in air, it is observed that the increase in fatigue properties decreases as the alternating stress applied to the material increases. At stresses of the order of 0. 4 σ 0. 2 % the increase in fatigue life is more than about 100 %. However, as the stress increases to values in the range of 0. 7 σ 0. 2 %, no improvement in the fatigue performance of the system is observed and the behavior {{is similar to that of}} the uncoated substrate. Under corrosion–fatigue conditions, the fatigue life is observed to increase between approximately 60 % and 70 %, depending on the stress applied. It is shown that fatigue cracks are associated with nodular-like defects present on the surface of the coated samples. The deleterious effect of such defects seems to be more pronounced as the alternating stress applied to the material increases. A crude estimate of the yield strength of the EN coating from tensile measurements indicates that such a parameter is in the range of 3. 8 GPa, in agreement with the computation of the <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness</b> of the deposit, of about 4 GPa, by means of Meyer's law. It is also shown that the EN deposit has a very good adhesion to the substrate even when the system is subjected to tensile stresses greater than the yield strength. Such characteristics as well as the higher mechanical properties of the EN coating in comparison with the aluminum alloy substrate and the preservation of its integrity during fatigue testing contribute to the better fatigue performance of the coated system...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{products}} (NPs), or synthetic products {{inspired by}} NPs, {{have been the}} single most productive source of leads for drug development. In fact, {{more than half of}} the approved drugs from 1981 to 2010 were based on NPs. 1 At the turn of the 21 st century, a new branch of NPs chemistry was fully established – Marine Natural Products (MNPs). The future seems very promising for this new NP subfield, since MNPs chemists have already elucidated the chemical structure of over 22, 000 novel compounds. 2 Moreover, from these, 7 are already approved drugs, (four anticancer, one antiviral, one pain control, and one hypertriglyceridemia). 3 The success rate of drug discovery from the marine world is 1 drug per 3, 140 natural products described. This rate is approximately 1. 7 - to 3. 3 -fold better than the industry average (1 in 5, 000 – 10, 000 tested compounds). 4 Nowadays, there are facilities for high-throughput screening available both in academic labs or in pharmaceutical companies, but the cost of random screening for collections with a high number of compounds can nevertheless be prohibitive, making chemoinformatics approaches for virtual screening of the most probable active compounds valuable tools. The present study focuses on the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to explore lead-like molecules en route to antitumor and antibiotic drugs from 418 MNPs and microbial natural products (MbNPs) extracted from the AntiMarin database. The AntiMarin database contains approximately 50, 000 compounds from marine macroorganisms and both marine and terrestrial microorganisms. 5 Our models were developed using 1746 active and non-active compounds from the PubChem database. State-of-the-art ML algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (Rfs) and Classification Tree (CTs), were compared to predict the two classes (i. e., active and non-active compounds) in the following classification task: (1) the overall biological activity; (2) antitumor activity; and (3) antibiotic activities. For each task two models were built, one using 8 semi-empirical quantum-chemical descriptors calculated by the PM 6 method (energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital, εHOMO; energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, εLUMO; hardness, η = (εLUMO - εHOMO); chemical potential, μ = -(εHOMO + εLUMO) / 2; Mulliken electronegativity, χ = - μ; Parr & Pople <b>absolute</b> <b>hardness,</b> (εHOMO - εLUMO) / 2; Schuurmann MO shift alpha, (εHOMO + εLUMO) / 2; electrophilicity index, ω = μ 2 /(2 η)) and the other using simultaneously CDK descriptors and PM 6 descriptors. The results obtained with these two approaches were compared with our recently published work using CDK descriptors, 6 Table 1. The best classification models for antibiotic and antitumor activities were used to screen a data set of marine and microbial natural products from the AntiMarin database. The screen originates 25 and 4 possible lead-like compounds for antibiotic and antitumor drug design, Figure 1 and 2, respectively. From those 25 lead-like antibiotic MNP and MbNP, seven (IDs 484, 735, 742, 861, 959, 739, and 741) have been already predicted as active in the overall biological model. All compounds suggested by our approach are classified as non-antibiotic and non-antitumor compounds in the AntiMarin database. Recently several of the lead-like compounds proposed by us were reported as being active in the literature. Figure 1. The unreported 15 lead antibiotic MNPs and MbNPs from AntiMarin database, using the best Rfs antibiotic model with a probability of being antibiotic greater than or equal to 0. 8. Figure 2. The selected 4 lead antitumor MNPs and MbNPs from the AntiMarin database, using the best Rfs antitumor model with a probability of being antitumor greater than or equal to 0. 8. The present work corroborates by one side the results of our previous work 6 and enables the presentation of a new set of possible lead like bioactive compounds. Additionally, it is shown the usefulness of quantum-chemical descriptors in the discrimination of biological active and inactive compounds. The use of the εHOMO quantum-chemical descriptor in the discrimination of large scale data sets of lead-like or drug-like compounds has never been reported. This approach results in the reduction, in great extent, of the number of compounds used in real screens, and it reinforces the results of our previous work. Furthermore, besides the virtual screening, the computational methods can be very useful to build appropriate databases, allowing for effective shortcuts of NP extracts dereplication procedures, which will certainly result in increasing the efficiency of drug discovery...|$|E
