5|$|Much of Galveston's {{success as}} a tourist {{destination}} {{was the result of}} E.

Legitimate amusements such as an amusement park that included a Ferris wheel and <b>a</b> <b>roller</b> coaster (the Mountain Speedway), in addition to the beaches and up-scale shopping districts (notably the Strand) drew visitors, including those less interested in the city's illegal attractions. One of the most spectacular efforts by the Chamber, though not one of the city's greatest successes, was the Pleasure Pier (originally known as the Brantly Harris Recreational Pier).
