500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Pissarro's son, Lucien, {{his father}} painted {{regularly}} with Cézanne beginning in 1872. He recalls that Cézanne walked {{a few miles}} to join Pissarro at various settings in Pontoise. While they shared ideas during their work, the younger Cézanne wanted to study the countryside through Pissarro's eyes, as he admired Pissarro's landscapes from the 1860s. Cézanne, although only nine years younger than Pissarro, said that [...] "he was a father for me. A man to consult and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> good Lord." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emmaus (Emmaüs in French) {{was started}} in 1949. Its name is a {{reference}} to a village in Israel appearing in the Gospel of Luke, where two disciples extended hospitality to Jesus just after his resurrection without recognizing him. In that way, Emmaus's mission is to help poor and homeless people. It is a secular organization. In 1950 the first community of Emmaus companions was created in Neuilly-Plaisance close to Paris in France. The Emmaus community raises funds for the construction of housing by selling used goods. [...] "Emmaus, it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> wheelbarrow, the shovels and the pickaxes coming before the banners. A sort of social fuel derived from salvaging defeating men." ...|$|E
5000|$|... ==Facts== Dracula orchids {{smell and}} look <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> {{mushrooms}} (<b>the</b> tongue looks <b>like</b> a mushroom). This helps trick fruit flies that pollinate mushrooms into pollinating them as well.|$|R
5000|$|The {{organization}} aims {{that millions}} of Ukrainians will become members. According to co-head of the organization Arseniy Yatsenyuk, [...] "it will be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Solidarity movement in Poland".|$|R
60|$|FANNY. Oh, {{of course}} it would be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> Bernard Shaw. <b>The</b> Fabian touch, you know.|$|R
2500|$|In 1873 {{he helped}} {{establish}} a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the [...] "pivotal" [...] figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Art historian John Rewald called Pissarro the [...] "dean of the Impressionist painters", {{not only because}} he was the oldest of the group, but also [...] "by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced, kind, and warmhearted personality". Cézanne said [...] "he was a father for me. A man to consult and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> good Lord," [...] and he was also one of Gauguin's masters. Renoir referred to his work as [...] "revolutionary", through his artistic portrayals of the [...] "common man", as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without [...] "artifice or grandeur".|$|E
2500|$|Gans {{described}} {{the concept of}} the town's connection to the child Alessa and the cult: [...] "It's a town of people trapped in dark dreams, and she inflicts onto the town what those people did to her body. That is, to me, the meaning of the darkness. The appearance of the town is corrupted in the way that her own flesh was wounded." [...] He furthers expands on Alessa's connection to the alternate reality seen in the film, saying that the alternate reality is [...] "in [...] head". [...] "It's interesting because the town itself mirrors this fractured psychology—different dimensions, different doubles of the same person." [...] In speaking about the creatures in Silent Hill, Gans said that [...] "these monsters are , with the poetic direction of the term: they are <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Japanese phantoms, i.e. residues of forgotten feelings as strong as hatred or [...]" [...] "The monsters in the game are not really monsters, but rather a mockery of human beings. The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When I approached the film, I knew {{that it was impossible to}} represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. French!--Well, he's perhaps <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> princess {{who felt}} the pea through three feather-beds. But {{he can be}} quite witty, and an {{excellent}} conversationalist, too. Oh yes, I like him quite well." ...|$|E
50|$|Wafer {{cleaning}} and surface preparation work <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>like</b> <b>the</b> machines in a bowling alley: first they remove all unwanted bits and pieces, {{and then they}} reconstruct the desired pattern so that the game can go on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Doesn't {{that sound}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> {{refining}} upon <b>the</b> facts? Recollect: I've never seen her, and I don't say you're wrong." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2013 Stephen Moore, {{a member}} of the {{editorial}} forward of the Wall Street Journal said, [...] "Quoting the most-revered champion of free-market economics since Adam Smith has become <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> quoting <b>the</b> Bible." [...] He adds, [...] "There are sometimes multiple and conflicting interpretations." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{object was}} nothing more than a part of a fallen tree, the trunk resting half in and half out of the water and several {{branches}} sticking out in as many directions. At a distance it looked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rowboat but the resemblance faded completely as he got closer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] {{she said}} to John, [...] "there is {{something}} which I can only describe as biblical about your brother, something <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> prophets of the Old Testament, {{in the way he}} sees only one issue and clings to it. Are you, too, of his way of thinking?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hope," [...] said Leland gravely, [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> germ in the wheat. It lies dormant; but, {{while its}} husk lasts, {{it will not}} die. I think," [...] and he {{glanced back at the}} vast sweep of {{sprouting}} green, [...] "I was like that dusty ploughing, waiting for the rain." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Basque rosary is {{a simple}} piece of jewelry, gold or silver, 1 to 4 cm diameter. Worn with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> chain around the neck. The central opening is then often {{replaced}} by <b>a</b> <b>little</b> figure <b>like</b> <b>the</b> [...] Basque cross Lauburu.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you <b>like</b> <b>the</b> voyages long? I {{begin to}} see, sir. Just as they're getting near {{to where the}} {{treasure}} ain't, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> accident <b>like</b> <b>the</b> loss of their water-supply sends them into port and out again to start hunting all over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--if {{you will}} put it brutally!--it was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> that--that and <b>the</b> scandal together--and your concealing from {{me what you}} ought to have told me before!" ...|$|R
60|$|Argument seemed child's babble indeed {{under the}} smile of Night. And {{the face of the}} woman, left alone at her window, was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> face of this warm, sweet night. It was sensitive, harmonious; and its harmony was not, as in some faces, cold--but seemed to tremble and glow and flutter, {{as though it were a}} spirit which had found its place of resting.|$|E
60|$|Rio {{is a small}} Mediterranean; {{and what}} was fabled of the {{entrance}} to that sea, in Rio is partly made true; for here, at the mouth, stands one of Hercules' Pillars, the Sugar-Loaf Mountain, one thousand feet high, inclining over <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Leaning Tower of Pisa. At its base crouch, like mastiffs, the batteries of Jose and Theodosia; while opposite, you are menaced by a rock-founded fort.|$|E
6000|$|... "If it weren't that Nora is so {{entirely a}} disciple of our cause, Tallente," [...] he said, [...] "I think I should feel <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{man in the}} 'Pilgrim's Progress,' who stopped to pick flowers by the way. She is such a help, though. It was she who pointed out the flaw in that second {{amendment}} of Saunderson's, which I had very nearly passed. Did you read her article in the National, too?" ...|$|E
60|$|As for Cynthia, {{she was no}} less {{astonished}} than Mrs. Duncan by {{the fact}} that these rich and powerful gentlemen were so excited over <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thing <b>like</b> <b>the</b> postmastership of Brampton. But Mr. Sutton laughed; it was not hearty, but still it might have passed muster for a laugh.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{scratched}} his sandy {{head and looked}} at his comrade, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gnarled fellow, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> bleached root of a tree. He seemed all legs.|$|R

60|$|I {{arrived in}} Seville on the Eve of the Immaculate Conception. All day {{people had been}} {{preparing}} to celebrate the feast, decorating their houses with great banners of blue and white; and at night the silent, narrow streets had a strange appearance, for in every window were lighted candles, throwing around them a white, unusual glare; they looked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> souls of infants dead. All day the bells of a hundred churches had been ringing, half drowned by the rolling peals of the Giralda.|$|E
60|$|Yeovil sat {{and listened}} to story after story {{of the men and}} women and horses of the neighbourhood; even the foxes seemed to have a {{personal}}ity, some of them, and a personal history. It was a little like Hans Andersen, he decided, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Reminiscences of an Irish R.M., and perhaps just a little like some of the more probable adventures of Baron Munchausen. The newer stories were evidently true to the smallest detail, the earlier ones had altered somewhat in repetition, as plants and animals vary under domestication.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the first}} time they had met since the engagement; and Shelton began to nerve himself to express some sentiment, however bald, about it. He squared his shoulders, cleared his throat, and looked askance at Mr. Dennant. That gentleman was walking stiffly, his cord {{breeches}} faintly squeaking. He switched a yellow, jointed cane against his leggings, and after each blow looked at his legs satirically. He himself was rather like that yellow cane-pale, and slim, and jointed, with features arching just <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> arching of its handle.|$|E
5000|$|Reasons for win: Ian Ziering {{managed to}} secure a {{helicopter}} from which the team got aerial photographs of New York City, and inserted the King's Hawaiian products into famous landmarks of the city; the executives loved the resulting imagery, and despite feeling that {{it needed to be}} tweaked <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> also <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> accompanying Twitter campaign.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well. I {{suppose he}} was {{inclined}} for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sight-seeing <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rest of us." [...] Cartlett's interest in Jude whatever {{it might have}} been when Arabella was new to him, had plainly flagged since her charms and her idiosyncrasies, her supernumerary hair-coils, and her optional dimples, were becoming as a tale that is told.|$|R
6000|$|... "Has he any {{occupation}} {{beyond this}} hobby {{of which you}} spoke?" [...] he asked. [...] "He rides and shoots <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> I suppose, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rest of your country gentlemen." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he led the}} slowly {{stepping}} horse {{along the}} quiet road, Mac could not help thinking that they looked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Flight into Egypt, {{but he did not}} say so, being a reverent youth only glanced back now and then at the figure above him, for Rose had taken off her hat to keep the light from baby's eyes and sat with the sunshine turning her uncovered hair to gold as {{she looked down at the}} little creature resting on the saddle before her with the sweet thoughtfulness one sees in some of Correggio's young Madonnas.|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancied so, indeed, when we {{discovered}} it two days ago. It is Donatello's prize. We were sitting here together, planning {{an interview with}} you, when his keen eyes detected the fallen goddess, almost entirely buried under that heap of earth, which the clumsy excavators showered down upon her, I suppose. We congratulated ourselves, chiefly for your sake. The eyes of us three {{are the only ones}} to which she has yet revealed herself. Does it not frighten you <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> apparition of a lovely woman that livid of old, and has long lain in the grave?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop," [...] said Mr. Henry. [...] "Let {{me think}} of this." [...] And as he thought, there came that grim smile upon his face that was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Master's. [...] "Give me paper," [...] said he. And he sat without another word and wrote to a gentleman of his {{acquaintance}} - I will name no unnecessary names, but he was one in a high place. This letter I despatched by the only hand I could depend upon {{in such a case}} - Macconochie's; and the old man rode hard, for he was back with the reply before even my eagerness had ventured to expect him. Again, as he read it, Mr. Henry had the same grim smile.|$|E
5000|$|It {{turns out}} that Norman {{was trying to find}} a way to make his [...] "peaches and cream" [...] daughter, Marilyn, look <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rest of the clan, but somehow the {{experiment}} backfired and Norman Hyde became Brent Jekyll. This is a take on The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson.|$|R
6000|$|A French {{breed of}} large size, barely capable of flight, with short black legs, head crested, comb {{produced}} into two points or horns, sometimes <b>a</b> <b>little</b> branched <b>like</b> <b>the</b> horns of a stag; both beard and wattles present. Eggs large. Disposition quiet. (7/3. A good description, with figures, is given of this sub-breed in the 'Journal of Horticulture' June 10, 1862 page 206.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Robert Lloyd, TV {{critic for}} the Los Angeles Times, said that Schama [...] "has {{produced}} a series {{that is at once}} informative, entertaining, thought-provoking, heart-wrenching and, in its final episode, in which he confronts the paradoxes of modern Israel, more than <b>a</b> <b>little</b> maddening. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> religion and the culture that surrounds it, each of which loves an argument, it is inconclusive and open to discussion".|$|R
