5|$|Stefani called Muller, who had {{directed}} several videos for Stefani <b>and</b> <b>No</b> <b>Doubt,</b> {{to direct the}} music video. Muller did not understand Stefani's vision for the video, so Stefani became involved in developing ideas for the video.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{with safety}} when using {{electrical}} appliances, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> drawing {{on her own}} experience in receiving an accidental electric shock that knocked her out for an hour, McKenzie delivered at least one talk on resuscitation, advising that conventional resuscitation should proceed for up to thee-quarters of an hour following electrocution. She knew of one case where recovery took 4 hours.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of his letters <b>and,</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> {{personal}} conversations, Huxley and Haeckel were convinced that, at the time he wrote Principles, he believed new species had arisen by natural methods. Sedgwick wrote worried letters to him about this.|$|E

25|$|On {{returning}} home from there they naturally wished to play the sport they'd grown up with <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> exerted some influence on their less affluent peers as to such. Coincidentally, the press at the time reported there was a growing dissatisfaction with rugby as a spectacle.|$|E
25|$|Ward, ever {{hungry for}} glory <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> seeking redress for his facial injury, welcomed the conflict, and was {{absolutely}} confident in his troops' ability {{to defend his}} Songjiang headquarters, while simultaneously operating as “flying columns” to be directed to strategic areas and Taiping vulnerabilities. He soon had several opportunities to test this confidence.|$|E
25|$|Colonel McAlester was {{a member}} of the Turnpike Trust <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> exerted {{considerable}} influence over the route of the turnpike and other matters. John Loudon McAdam was very actively involved with Scottish Turnpikes, living at Sauchrie near Ayr until he moved to Bristol to become Surveyor to the local Turnpike Trust in 1826.|$|E
60|$|Ralph {{declared}} that he liked everything that was good, <b>and</b> had <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that rolled omelets were delicious.|$|R

25|$|This site at NY 316 660 is {{recorded}} {{as having been}} used by smugglers. The title of Viscount Stormont is a title in the Peerage of Scotland created in 1621 by James VI for Sir David Murray. It is a subsidiary title of the Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield. The family held land in this area <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> some connection exists between the title and the area.|$|E
25|$|Logically speaking, {{the prior}} {{question}} was whether evolution had taken place at all. It is to this question that much of Darwin's On the Origin of Species was devoted. Its publication in 1859 completely convinced Huxley of evolution {{and it was this}} <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> his admiration of Darwin's way of amassing and using evidence that formed the basis of his support for Darwin in the debates that followed the book's publication.|$|E
25|$|Martin Sieff, United Press International (December 25, 2001) — The great veteran actor Maury Chaykin {{was born}} to play Nero. And Timothy Hutton is equally perfect as his leg-man and always squabbling employee/amanuensis/Dr. Watson/Captain Hastings sidekick, Archie Goodwin. … Hutton, an Oscar winner, and Chaykin {{are at the heart}} of it all. They have done many prestigious things in their careers <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> will do many more. But it is clear they know they will never have more fun than doing this.|$|E

5000|$|At the Grammy Awards of 2003, Springsteen {{performed}} The Clash's [...] "London Calling" [...] {{along with}} Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt <b>and</b> <b>No</b> <b>Doubt's</b> bassist, Tony Kanal, {{in tribute to}} Joe Strummer; Springsteen and the Clash had once been considered multiple-album-dueling rivals {{at the time of}} the double The River and the triple Sandinista!.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fan base}} Quinn {{built up in}} the first {{programme}} stayed with her during the whole series, and allowed her to reach the final. During this time she sang a range of songs from Macy Gray's [...] "I Try" [...] and Garth Brook's [...] "If Tomorrow Never Comes" [...] to [...] "(I Can't Get <b>No)</b> Satisfaction" [...] <b>and</b> <b>No</b> <b>Doubt's</b> [...] "Don't Speak".|$|R
25|$|To enlarge {{his guitar}} {{repertory}} <b>and,</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> {{to make use}} of his considerable knowledge of keyboard music, he soon began transcribing piano works of Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn and others. Tárrega and his wife moved to Madrid, gaining their living by teaching privately and playing concerts, but after the death of an infant daughter during the winter, Maria Josefa de los Angeles Tárrega Rizo, they settled permanently in Barcelona in 1885. Among his friends in Barcelona were Isaac Albéniz, Enrique Granados, Joaquín Turina and Pablo Casals.|$|E
25|$|Taking applause as a criterion, {{the success}} of Almina was triumphant. After the first act, the {{principal}} singers were recalled, and then Signor Campana was compelled to appear, {{when he was not}} merely received with tumultuous acclamations, but fêted with bouquets and laurel-wreaths. At the fall of the curtain, too, he was summoned to the foot-lights twice, when the demonstrations were renewed, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> the composer left the theatre perfectly satisfied that his opera had achieved a great and legitimate triumph. First nights, however, are not always precedents—the Barbiere of Rossini to witness.|$|E
25|$|This {{frontier}} {{remained for}} about 100 years, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> in that long period much {{was done to}} it to which precise dates are difficult to fix. It cannot even be absolutely certain when the frontier laid out by Pius was equipped with the manpitts and other special fortifications. But {{we know that the}} pressure of the barbarians began to be felt seriously in the later part of the 2nd century, and after long struggles the whole or almost the whole district east of the Rhine and north of the Danube was lost, seemingly all within one short period, about 250.|$|E
5000|$|The Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association {{was founded}} in London in the year George Bills was born <b>and</b> was <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> his inspiration.|$|R

25|$|Like his {{predecessors}} Alexios I Komnenos and Michael VIII, John V now {{turned to the}} Pope and offered {{the promise of a}} Union of the two Churches in the hopes of receiving military assistance. As a guarantee of compliance, John V offered his son, Manuel. In the past, Byzantium's cry for assistance were answered with mixed results — pillaging Crusaders would sack both friend and foe but the First Crusade had been largely beneficial <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> John V envisioned a repeat of such a Crusade. This time, however, the Papacy was unmoved by the calamity facing the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
25|$|St Chad's Well near Battle Bridge on {{the river}} Fleet in London was a celebrated {{medicinal}} well and had a new pump house built in 1832. It was destroyed by the Midland Railway company, and is remembered in the street name of St Chad's Place. There is no independent evidence of Chad's visiting the site, but it clearly is named after him, and he certainly did travel in southern England. His association with wells seems ancient, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> stems from the St Chad's Well at Lichfield, visited by pilgrims and probably the water supply of his monastery. This {{is the most likely}} explanation of the name.|$|E
25|$|Kelis {{has been}} {{recognised}} at the Brit Awards, Q Awards, NME Awards, and Grammy Awards ceremonies. Her musical output, {{both as a}} lead and featured artist, encompasses various genres—she has collaborated with R and hip hop acts including Busta Rhymes and Clipse, electronic and dance producers such as Calvin Harris, Timo Maas, and Richard X, pop and rock acts Enrique Iglesias <b>and</b> <b>No</b> <b>Doubt,</b> and indie and alternative musicians including Björk and Dave Sitek. She has sold six million records worldwide and has had particular success in the United Kingdom, where ten of her singles have peaked within the top ten of the UK Singles Chart.|$|E

25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith <b>and</b> <b>No</b> <b>Doubt.</b> I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E
25|$|From, {{the monastic}} {{revival of the}} second half of the tenth century only a few {{documented}} buildings survive or have been excavated, for example: the abbeys of Glastonbury; Old Minster, Winchester; Romsey; Cholsey; and Peterborough Cathedral. The majority of churches that have been described as Anglo-Saxon fall into the period between the late 10th century and the early 12th. During this period many settlements were first provided with stone churches, but timber also continued to be used; the best wooden survival is Greensted Church in Essex, no earlier than the 9th century, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> typical of many parish churches. On the Continent during the eleventh century was developed a group of interrelated Romanesque styles, associated with the rebuilding of many churches on a grand scale, made possible by a general advance in architectural technology and mason-craft.|$|E
25|$|The Capitol View Historic District is {{contained}} within Section 4, Township 1 North, and Range 12 West of Little Rock, Arkansas. Its most distinctive features include a river {{view from a}} bluff high above the Arkansas River as well as, appropriately, {{a view of the}} Arkansas State Capitol from numerous vantage points both north and south of Markham Street, which bisects the district and divides it into two unequal parts. Its varied topography, characterized by substantial variation in elevation enhances the possibilities of scenic overlooks <b>and,</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> was a principal attraction for developers {{in the late nineteenth and}} first quarter of the twentieth century. The district has remained almost exclusively residential in character throughout its history. A handful of duplexes, three apartment buildings and a pair of grocery stores are the only exceptions among the 501 buildings included in the Capitol View historic district.|$|E
60|$|Any further {{cylinders}} that fell, it was hoped, {{could be}} destroyed at once by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured <b>and</b> distributed. <b>No</b> <b>doubt,</b> ran the report, {{the situation was}} of the strangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to avoid <b>and</b> discourage panic. <b>No</b> <b>doubt</b> the Martians were strange and terrible in the extreme, but at the outside there {{could not be more}} than twenty of them against our millions.|$|R
