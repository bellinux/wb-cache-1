50|$|Field {{cultivators}} {{are used}} to complete tillage operations in many types of <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> fields. The main function of the field cultivator is to prepare a proper seedbed for the crop to be planted into, to bury crop residue in the soil (helping to warm the soil before planting), to control weeds, and to mix and incorporate the soil to ensure the growing crop has enough water and nutrients to grow well during the growing season. The implement has many shanks mounted {{on the underside of}} a metal frame, and small narrow rods {{at the rear of the}} machine that smooth out the soil surface for easier travel later when planting. In most field cultivators, one-to-many hydraulic cylinders raise and lower the implement and control its depth.|$|E
50|$|Only about 0.7% {{of total}} land area is <b>arable.</b> <b>Crop</b> {{production}} is hampered by traditional farming methods, recurrent drought, erosion, and disease. Most {{of the land}} under cultivation is in the eastern region. The principal crops for domestic use are sorghum, corn, and millet. Sorghum and corn production in 2004 were 32,000 tons and 10,000 tons, respectively. The sorghum and corn harvests comprise less than 10% of the annual requirement of 250,000 tons. In 2004, Botswana’s agricultural imports (primarily cereals) exceeded agricultural exports by $102.5 million. Grainis often imported from South Africa. Smaller quantities of cowpeas, beans, and other pulses are also grown. The 2004 output of all these crops was about 20,000 tons; in addition, 16,000 tons of vegetables and 10,000 tons of fruit were grown.|$|E

50|$|The {{objective}} of the arable crops component {{is to increase the}} quality and volume of selected organic arable crops produced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for export.The project is supporting the development of certified organic <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> value chains, by involving 2-3 strong key actors (leaders) to act as market openers. The project will prioritise a few, promising, organic arable crops. The approach will foster close partnerships between international traders and Ukrainian partners in order to develop reliable trade relationships.The project aims to strengthen the capacity and level of collaboration among actors involved in the value chains for the selected certified organic arable crops. It is working with the leaders’ agronomists and consultants and other value chain actors to stimulate overall business development. Knowledge transfer from leaders to other actors is done through field visits, field days, workshops, study tours and specific training sessions.|$|E
5000|$|Most land is privately owned, {{a crucial}} factor behind the sector's success. Of Syria's 196,000 km² (72,000 square miles), about 28 {{percent of it}} is cultivated, and 21 percent of that total is {{irrigated}}. Most irrigated land is designated [...] "strategic", meaning that it encounters significant state intervention in terms of pricing, subsidies, and marketing controls. [...] "Strategic" [...] products such as wheat, barley, and sugar beets, must be sold to state marketing boards at fixed prices, often above world prices {{in order to support}} farmers, but at a significant cost to the state budget. The most widely grown <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> is wheat, but the most important cash crop is cotton; cotton was the largest single export before the development of the oil sector. Nevertheless, the total area planted with cotton has declined because of an increasing problem of water shortage coupled with old and inefficient irrigation techniques. The output of grains like wheat is often underutilized because of poor storage facilities.|$|E
50|$|In {{their first}} Canadian winter Naumann’s and Hinsche’s living {{conditions}} were dramatic. They suffered from hunger and severe frost (frostbite). Boat trips on the unpredictable Athabasca River nearly ended in disaster. Once Max Hinsche {{was suffering from}} a dangerous gunshot wound when Naumann together with Indians of Plains Cree (Paskwa Wi Iniwak) was able to save his companion’s life. After the first winter they parted from each other for economic reasons. Naumann started his own way of life near Athabasca River 10 km downstream. In the summer months he lived on fishing, hunting and growing of <b>arable</b> <b>crop,</b> in winter on being a trapper and selling skins. He ran a trap line of up to a hundred kilometers.Naumann’s Canadian citizenship was documented in 1938. Naumann was not married. He had 15 children in several intimate relations with Indians, who were descended from the French family line Cardinal. After the separation from the women he brought up five of his children as a single father in his log cabin in Pelican Portage: George (Dick), Hazel, Garry, Rose Mary and Jerry Naumann. Naumann died on June 6, 1978, {{at the age of}} 76 years in Athabasca, Canada - without ever returning to Germany. He was buried in a forest cemetery in Upper Wells near Athabasca.|$|E

30|$|Two out of {{the three}} {{coefficients}} associated with variables on farm size, LNCLAND and LNANU representing size of land devoted to <b>arable</b> <b>crops</b> production and stock of livestock raised by the farm households respectively, were positive and significant at p[*]<[*] 0.01. This shows that increase in size of <b>arable</b> <b>crops</b> and livestock farms raised by the farm households are associated with significant increases in their income. One per cent increase in farmland devoted to <b>arable</b> <b>crops</b> production is associated with about 0.71 % increase in farm household income. Similar increase in stock of livestock {{was found to be}} associated with about 0.08 % increase in farm household income. The fact that coefficient of LNTLAND (size of farmland devoted to tree crops production) is negative and not significant suggests that further increase in size of tree crop farm being cultivated by an average farm household in the sample, ceteris paribus, may not results in improvement in her income.|$|R
