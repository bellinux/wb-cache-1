5|$|In 1772, the French {{scientist}} Antoine Lavoisier used a lens {{to concentrate}} {{the rays of}} the sun on a diamond in <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> oxygen, and showed that the only product of the combustion was carbon dioxide, proving that diamond is composed of carbon. Later in 1797, the English chemist Smithson Tennant repeated and expanded that experiment. By demonstrating that burning diamond and graphite releases the same amount of gas, he established the chemical equivalence of these substances.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Germanicus in dubious {{circumstances}} greatly affected Tiberius' popularity in Rome, {{leading to the}} creation of a climate of fear in Rome itself. Also suspected of connivance in his death was Tiberius' chief advisor, Sejanus, who would, in the 20s, create <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> fear in Roman noble and administrative circles by the use of treason trials and the role of delatores, or informers.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} power vacuums in {{the weeks}} following the Japanese surrender, created <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, but also one of opportunity for the Republicans. Many pemuda joined pro-Republic struggle groups (badan perjuangan). The most disciplined were soldiers from the Japanese-formed but disbanded Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups. Many groups were undisciplined, due to both the circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary spirit. In the first weeks, Japanese troops often withdrew from urban areas to avoid confrontations.|$|E

5|$|Mars (1.5AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is smaller than}} Earth and Venus (0.107 Earth masses). It has <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> mostly carbon dioxide with a surface {{pressure}} of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth). Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be captured asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's famous String Quintet {{was written}} in September 1828, {{together}} with the final versions of the sonatas. The slow movements of the quintet and the B-flat Sonata bear striking similarities in their main sections: both employ the same unique textural layout, in which two-three voices sing long notes in the middle register, accompanied by the contrasted, short pizzicato notes of the other voices, in the lower and upper registers; in both movements, the long notes over the relentless ostinato rhythm, convey <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> complete stillness, of arrest of all motion and time. String quintet textures also appear elsewhere, throughout the sonata trilogy.|$|E
5|$|Some {{terrestrial}} beetles that exploit shoreline and floodplain habitats have physiological adaptations for surviving floods. In {{the event}} of flooding, adult beetles may be mobile enough {{to move away from}} flooding, but larvae and pupa often cannot. Adults of Cicindela togata are unable to survive immersion in water, but larvae are able to survive a prolonged period, up to 6 days, of anoxia during floods. Anoxia tolerance in the larvae may have been sustained by switching to anaerobic metabolic pathways or by reducing metabolic rate. Anoxia tolerance in the adult Carabid beetle Pelophilia borealis was tested in laboratory conditions and it was found that they could survive a continuous period of up to 127 days in <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> 99.9% nitrogen at 0°C.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of IK Pegasi B may be composed wholly of carbon and oxygen; alternatively, if its progenitor underwent carbon burning, {{it may have}} a core of oxygen and neon, surrounded by a mantle enriched with carbon and oxygen. In either case, the exterior of IK Pegasi B is covered by <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> almost pure hydrogen, which gives this star its stellar classification of DA. Due to higher atomic mass, any helium in the envelope will have sunk beneath the hydrogen layer. The entire mass of the star is supported by electron degeneracy pressure—a quantum mechanical effect that limits the amount of matter that can be squeezed into a given volume.|$|E

Fashions of the 1960s were researched to properly apply them to the various virtual crowds at these locations.|$|E
5|$|When American extremists {{loyal to}} the {{terrorist}} group Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO) kidnap a suburban family, Underwood allows Conway to negotiate with them, making his opponent look like a hero - and then releases NSA data that proves Conway illegally influenced Congress. Soon afterward, however, Underwood is hit with two crises at once: ICO's leader orders his followers to kill one of the hostages, while journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) exposes Underwood's crimes in the Washington Herald. Facing disgrace and possible impeachment, Underwood decides to declare war on ICO and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> widespread fear that he and Claire can exploit {{in the weeks before}} the election.|$|E

5|$|When a {{group of}} terrorists takes an American family hostage, Claire negotiates with their imprisoned leader, Yusuf Al Ahmadi (Farshad Farahat), who agrees to tell his {{followers}} to release the hostages. Al Ahmadi reneges on the deal, however, and tells them to kill the hostages. At the same time, journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) publishes an investigative news story detailing Frank's crimes. Claire gives Frank the idea to declare war on the terrorists and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> widespread fear that they can exploit. In the final scene, Claire finally breaks the fourth wall with Frank.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E
5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working in <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view {{of the actions of}} the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between tantalum and niobium were demonstrated unequivocally in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, {{as well as}} by Louis J. Troost, who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in 1865. Further confirmation came from the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, in 1866, who proved that there were only two elements. These discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing articles about the so-called ilmenium until 1871. De Marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of tantalum in 1864, when he reduced tantalum chloride by heating it in <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen. Early investigators had only been able to produce impure tantalum, and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in Charlottenburg in 1903. Wires made with metallic tantalum were used for light bulb filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{rainfall}} {{was the most}} destructive aspect of Tropical Storm Bret in Venezuela. On the offshore Isla Margaria, the rains flooded the primary hospital, and rivers overflowed, although damage was minimal. On the mainland, {{heavy rainfall}} caused damaging mudslides and flooding, and entire houses buried {{in the middle of}} the night with little notice. Flooded rivers washed away cars and homes in the hills of Caracas, mostly along the flooded La Guarre River. Floodwaters mixed with raw sewage from damaged water lines across the region. Residents returned to damaged homes despite warnings. Damage was worst in Petare, La Vega, and El Valle, all surrounding Caracas on insecure mountainsides. One home was wrecked in Petare, killing four family members. At least 19people perished in Miranda state, and another three deaths were reported in Aragua due to landslides. Residents requested assistance from the local fire company, although disrupted telephone service created <b>an</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> confusion. Strong winds also destroyed the roofs of other houses, and areas were left without power. Portions of the Pan-American Highway and a coastal road were disrupted by landslides, and the state of Barinas was largely isolated due to road blockages. Most roads west of Caracas were likewise blocked.|$|E
