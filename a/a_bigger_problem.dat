5|$|<b>A</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said {{it would be impossible to}} lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Krycek head to {{a subway}} station, where Dr. Girardi is {{expected}} to arrive for Grissom's funeral. Mulder sees Cole there, and Cole seems to shoot Girardi, but this is shown to be in Mulder's head. In reality, Cole has captured Girardi and holds him hostage, about to show him a similar fate as his other victims. By searching surveillance footage, they track his location and find Girardi wounded. Mulder finds Cole, who is ready to kill himself. Krycek, believing Cole is holding a gun instead of the Bible he is actually holding, shoots him, and Cole dies of his wounds. Mulder and Scully find both of their files on the case missing. Krycek reports to the Smoking Man and others, telling them that {{the dissolution of the}} X-Files and the separation of Mulder and Scully has been ineffective, and their determination is only stronger. He also notes that Scully is <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> than they anticipated.|$|E
25|$|The United States also {{assisted}} the Chinese Air Force. The Air Corps conducted {{most of the}} training for the Chinese at three Arizona installations: Luke, Williams, and Thunderbird Fields. Training the Chinese presented some special challenges. Because of their small stature some students could not reach all the controls. That problem was usually solved {{through the use of}} extra cushions and occasionally by switching them to another type of airplane. <b>A</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> was the language barrier. It took all the interpreters the Air Corps could muster to support the training programs for the Chinese. In the end, 3,553 Chinese received flying and technical training, including 866 pilots.|$|E

25|$|This was {{a pivotal}} time {{for women in}} higher education, {{particularly}} at Michigan. Lloyd knew this and dealt with it in a reserved and mature manner, especially {{when it came to}} women's hours and overcrowding in housing. She wrote editorials in the Daily, attempting {{to bridge the gap between}} faculty and students. This was frequently a sore spot due to the shifting position over in loco parentis, which was causing an irritation amongst the student body in regards to the strict curfew hours women held. Additionally, the lack of student housing for women with the influx of students was turning into <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> than seen in past years.|$|E
25|$|The {{studies that}} {{conclude}} abuse is <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> in military families than civilian families attribute {{this to the}} long hours, frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress. They point out that military families may be more reluctant to report issues of abuse {{because of the potential}} impact on the service member's career. Other studies, however, argue that military families have a smaller problem than civilian families because military culture offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. Military families have health care, housing, and family support programs often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members {{are more likely to be}} ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.|$|E
500|$|San Francisco's Dead Kennedys made {{a career}} out of {{mentioning}} Reagan in songs like [...] "Moral Majority," [...] "We've Got <b>a</b> <b>Bigger</b> <b>Problem</b> Now," [...] "Bleed for Me," [...] and the track [...] "Kinky Sex Makes the World Go Round," [...] a spoken word piece about World War III formatted as an erotic phone call between Margaret Thatcher and Reagan's fictitious Secretary of War. [...] The band's 1986 studio album, Bedtime for Democracy, is a play on Reagan's film Bedtime for Bonzo and features a multitude of songs about Reagan. [...] "Potshot Heard Round the World" [...] is about U.S. military actions in the Middle East, [...] "with Reagans and Gaddafis cast as cartoon villains and heroes." [...] Reagan plays the title role in the song, [...] "Rambozo the Clown," [...] a portmanteau of Sylvester Stallone's Rambo franchise and Bozo the Clown from children's daytime TV. The Dead Kennedys were done in by a lawsuit against their inclusion of H. R. Giger's Penis Landscape painting as an insert the album Frankenchrist. Singer Jello Biafra chose to include in the album the first time he saw it, saying, [...] "“This picture is like Reagan America on parade." ...|$|E

500|$|One {{prototype}} {{was ordered}} from Českomoravská Kolben-Daněk in 1931, but development {{was slow and}} it was accepted only in November 1932. Its evaluations were very positive and an order for fifty was placed on 19 April 1933. The first six of these were to serve as pre-production models and were to be delivered by 30 September 1933. The delivery date for the next batch of twenty-four was a year after that and the final batch of twenty was due by 30 July 1935. Production was delayed by quality problems with the initial batch of armor plates from Poldi and delivery of the pre-production series did not occur until 23 April 1934. <b>A</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> was that the Army had rejected ČKD's proposed armament of a [...] Vickers 44/60 gun and two ZB vz. 26 machine guns so the contract was signed with no design work on the desired armament configuration. ČKD did not finalize its design until December 1933 and the first six tanks were delivered with only a pair of ZB vz. 26 machine guns. The last tanks were delivered on 14 January 1936, but the six pre-production models had {{to be returned to}} the factory to be upgraded with the proper armament and otherwise modified up to the latest standards. The last one was delivered on 17 August 1936.|$|E

[...] She also said, [...] "Lloyd Webber's score (conducted skilfully by Guy Simpson) intermittently and elegantly reprises the original Phantom, connecting the two stories" [...] but she did feel that, [...] "several songs, with trite lyrics, lack punch. <b>A</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> is the unsatisfying story.

2500|$|Later albums also {{contained}} memorable songs, but with less popularity than the earlier ones. The EP In God We Trust, Inc. contained the song [...] "Nazi Punks Fuck Off!" [...] {{as well as}} [...] "We've Got <b>A</b> <b>Bigger</b> <b>Problem</b> Now", a rewritten version of [...] "California Über Alles" [...] about Ronald Reagan. Punk musician and scholar Vic Bondi considers the latter song to be the song that [...] "defined the lyrical agenda of much of hardcore music, and represented its break with punk". The band's most controversial album, Frankenchrist, brought with it the song [...] "MTV Get Off the Air", which accused MTV of promoting poor quality music and sedating the public. The album {{also contained}} a controversial poster by Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger entitled Penis Landscape.|$|E

2500|$|Direct {{contact is}} rare in this route for humans in {{developed}} countries, but relatively common for humans in developing countries, especially those living in urban slums without access to adequate sanitation. More common in developed countries are the indirect routes; foodstuffs or water become contaminated (by people not adequately washing their hands before preparing food or tending to patients, or untreated sewage being released into a drinking water supply) {{and the people who}} eat and drink them become infected. In some developing countries, many people are not connected to sewer systems, and where they are, most sewage is discharged into the environment without treatment. However, <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> in some developing countries is open defecation which leads to disease transmission via the fecal-oral route, especially for children. Even in developed countries there are periodic system failures resulting in a sanitary sewer overflow. [...] This is the typical mode of transmission for the infectious agents of (at least): cholera, hepatitis A, polio, Rotavirus, Salmonella, and parasites (e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides).|$|E
