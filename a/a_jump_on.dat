25|$|An edge {{violation}} {{occurs when}} a skater executes <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> <b>on</b> the incorrect edge. The hollow is a groove {{on the bottom of}} the blade which creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge of the blade is on the side closest to the skater, the outside edge is on the side farthest from the skater, and a flat refers to skating on both edges at the same time, which is discouraged. An unclear edge or edge violation is indicated with an 'e' and reflected in the GOE according to the severity of the problem. Flutz and lip are the colloquial terms for a Lutz and flip jump with an edge violation.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{origin of}} the name remains a mystery. In the early 1860s, when the United States Congress was {{considering}} organizing a new territory in the Rocky Mountains, eccentric lobbyist George M. Willing suggested the name [...] "Idaho", which he claimed was derived from a Shoshone language term meaning [...] "the sun comes from the mountains" [...] or [...] "gem of the mountains". Willing later claimed he had simply invented the name. Congress ultimately decided to name the area Colorado Territory when it was created in February 1861. Thinking they would get <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> <b>on</b> the name, locals named a community in Colorado [...] "Idaho Springs".|$|E

6000|$|So the Snark {{started on}} her long voyage without a navigator. We beat through the Golden Gate on April 23, {{and headed for}} the Hawaiian Islands, twenty-one hundred sea-miles away as the gull flies. And the outcome was our justification. We arrived. And we arrived, furthermore, without any trouble, as you shall see; that is, without any trouble to amount to anything. To begin with, Roscoe tackled the navigating. He had the theory all right, but {{it was the first time}} he had ever applied it, as was {{evidenced}} by the erratic behaviour of the Snark. Not but what the Snark was perfectly steady on the sea; the pranks she cut were on the chart. On a day with a light breeze she would make <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> <b>on</b> the chart that advertised [...] "a wet sail and a flowing sheet," [...] and on a day when she just raced over the ocean, she scarcely changed her position on the chart. Now when one's boat has logged six knots for twenty-four consecutive hours, it is incontestable that she has covered one hundred and forty-four miles of ocean. The ocean was all right, and so was the patent log; as for speed, one saw it with his own eyes. Therefore the thing that was not all right was the figuring that refused to boost the Snark along over the chart. Not that this happened every day, but that it did happen. And it was perfectly proper and no more than was to be expected from a first attempt at applying a theory.|$|E
6000|$|I {{did my best}} to sit very still, but I couldn't help giving <b>a</b> <b>jump</b> <b>on</b> {{seeing in}} The Times after I had been a week or two in Munich and before, as I knew, Corvick had reached London, the {{announcement}} of the sudden death of poor Mrs. Erme. I instantly wrote to Gwendolen for particulars, and she replied that her mother had succumbed to long-threatened failure of the heart. She didn't say, but I took the liberty of reading into her words, that {{from the point of view}} of her marriage and also of her eagerness, which was quite a match for mine, this was a solution more prompt than could have been expected and more radical than waiting for the old lady to swallow the dose. I candidly admit indeed that at the time--for I heard from her repeatedly--I read some singular things into Gwendolen's words and some still more extraordinary ones into her silences. Pen in hand, this way, I live the time over, and it brings back the oddest sense of my having been for months and in spite of myself a kind of coerced spectator. All my life had taken refuge in my eyes, which the procession of events appeared to have committed itself to keep astare. There were days when I thought of writing to Hugh Vereker and simply throwing myself on his charity. But I felt more deeply that I hadn't fallen quite so low, besides which, quite properly, he would send me about my business. Mrs. Erme's death brought Corvick straight home, and within the month he was united [...] "very quietly"--as quietly I suppose as he meant in his article to bring out his trouvaille--to the young lady he had loved and quitted. I use this last term, I may parenthetically say, because I subsequently grew sure that at the time he went to India, at the time of his great news from Bombay, there was no engagement whatever. There was none at the moment she affirmed the opposite. On the other hand he certainly became engaged the day he returned. The happy pair went down to Torquay for their honeymoon, and there, in a reckless hour, it occurred to poor Corvick to take his young bride a drive. He had no command of that business: this had been brought home to me of old in a little tour we had once made together in a dogcart. In a dogcart he perched his companion for a rattle over Devonshire hills, on one of the likeliest of which he brought his horse, who, it was true, had bolted, down with such violence that the occupants of the cart were hurled forward and that he fell horribly on his head. He was killed on the spot; Gwendolen escaped unhurt.|$|E
