25|$|Suddenly, Pozzo and Lucky reappear, but {{the rope}} is much shorter than during their last visit, and Lucky now guides Pozzo, {{rather than being}} {{controlled}} by him. As they arrive, Pozzo trips over Lucky and they together fall into a motionless heap. Estragon sees an opportunity to exact revenge on Lucky for kicking him earlier. The issue is debated lengthily until Pozzo shocks the pair by revealing {{that he is now}} blind and Lucky is now mute. Pozzo further claims to have lost <b>all</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> time, and assures the others that he cannot remember meeting them before, but also does not expect to recall today's events tomorrow. His commanding arrogance from yesterday appears to have been replaced by humility and insight. His parting wordswhich Vladimir expands upon laterare ones of utter despair. Lucky and Pozzo depart; meanwhile Estragon has again fallen asleep.|$|E

500|$|Besides the {{official}} honours, Shackleton's Antarctic feats were greeted in Britain with great enthusiasm. Proposing {{a toast to}} the explorer at a lunch given in Shackleton's honour by the Royal Societies Club, Lord Halsbury, a former Lord Chancellor, said: [...] "When one remembers what he had gone through, one {{does not believe in}} the supposed degeneration of the British race. One does not believe that we have lost <b>all</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> admiration for courage [...] endurance". The heroism was also claimed by Ireland: the Dublin Evening Telegraph's headline read [...] "South Pole Almost Reached By An Irishman", while the Dublin Express spoke of the [...] "qualities that were his heritage as an Irishman". Shackleton's fellow-explorers expressed their admiration; Roald Amundsen wrote, in a letter to RGS Secretary John Scott Keltie, that [...] "the English nation has by this deed of Shackleton's won a victory that can never be surpassed". Fridtjof Nansen sent an effusive private letter to Emily Shackleton, praising the [...] "unique expedition which has been such a complete success in every respect". The reality was that the expedition had left Shackleton deeply in debt, unable to meet the financial guarantees he had given to backers. Despite his efforts, it required government action, {{in the form of a}} grant of £20,000 (2008: £1.5 million) to clear the most pressing obligations. It is likely that many debts were not pressed and were written off.|$|E
30|$|To {{evaluate}} correct <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{an opinion}} word having multiple senses, we consider three polarity scores: positive, negative, and objective <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of the parts-of-speech (P-O-S) {{of a word}} available in the SWN.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, average positive, negative, and {{objective}} polarity scores for <b>all</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> P-O-S {{of the word}} “left” are 0.0125, 0.05, and 0.9375 respectively.|$|R

Precious--oh, yes, very {{precious}} these days--like drinking gold. Thirty-five lire a bottle, my boy!" [...] Argyle pulled a long face, and made a noise with his lips.

2500|$|Chomsky's biographers look at {{this issue}} in {{different}} ways. In Noam Chomsky: A life of dissent, Robert Barsky focuses on Steven Lukes' critique of Chomsky in The Times Higher Education Supplement. Barsky cites Lukes' claim that, 'obsessed by {{his opposition to the}} United States' role in Indochina,' Chomsky had 'lost <b>all</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> perspective' when it came to Pol Pot's Cambodia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exhibition}} {{was a public}} success {{with many of the}} works finding a buyer. The response from critics, however, was mixed. The most scathing review came from leading critic James Smith, who said the 9 by 5s were [...] "destitute of <b>all</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the beautiful" [...] and [...] "whatever influence [...] was likely to exercise could scarcely be otherwise than misleading and pernicious." [...] The artists pasted up the review outside the entrance of the venue—attracting many more passing pedestrians—and responded with a letter to the Editor of Smith's newspaper, The Argus. Described as a manifesto, the letter defends freedom of choice in subject and technique, concluding: ...|$|E

5000|$|Andy Whitman, a Paste {{reviewer}} {{called this}} song, [...] "the quintessential Van Morrison moment, the most thrilling and thrillingly strange soul music—in <b>all</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> the term—ever recorded.

5000|$|In {{the same}} interview, Winter-Bates also commented on why they settled on this also being the {{choice for the}} album's title, saying [...] "It’s {{certainly}} an overview {{of a lot of}} themes that are kind of running around that. That feeling <b>of</b> helplessness, in <b>all</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> the word." ...|$|R
2500|$|Samuel Beckett's The Unnamable and Waiting for Godot were {{influential}} upon {{writing in}} the 1950s. In the former <b>all</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place and time are dispensed with; all that remains is a voice poised between the urge to continue existing and the urge to find silence and oblivion. (The only other major writer to use [...] "The Unnamable" [...] as a title was H. P. Lovecraft.) In the latter, time and the paradoxes {{of cause and effect}} become thematic. Beckett's influence on the intelligentsia—as well as the general influence of existentialism and the legal battles to publish books then classified as obscene—made science fiction more sophisticated, especially in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, theatre was {{strictly}} censored in the UK, to Beckett's amazement since {{he thought it}} a bastion of free speech. The Lord Chamberlain insisted that the word [...] "erection" [...] be removed, [...] "'Fartov' became 'Popov' and Mrs Gozzo had 'warts' instead of 'clap'". Indeed, there were attempts to ban the play completely. Lady Dorothy Howitt wrote to the Lord Chamberlain, saying: [...] "One of the many themes running through the play is the desire of two old tramps continually to relieve themselves. Such a dramatisation of lavatory necessities is offensive and against <b>all</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> British decency." [...] "The first unexpurgated version of Godot in England ... opened at the Royal Court on 30 December 1964." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe had {{continued}} playing baseball as a pitcher and {{had begun to}} play semi-professionally while still in college. In 1952 he earned a tryout with the New York Giants but was cut after three days, which Wolfe blamed on his inability to throw good fastballs. Wolfe abandoned baseball and instead followed his professor Fishwick's example, enrolling in Yale University's American studies doctoral program. His PhD thesis was titled The League of American Writers: Communist Organizational Activity Among American Writers, 1929–1942. In {{the course of his}} research, Wolfe interviewed many writers, including Malcolm Cowley, Archibald MacLeish, and James T. Farrell. A biographer remarked on the thesis: [...] "Reading it, one sees what has been the most baleful influence of graduate education on many who have suffered through it: it deadens <b>all</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> style." [...] His thesis was originally rejected but it was finally accepted after he rewrote it in an objective rather than a subjective style. Upon leaving Yale, he wrote a friend explaining through expletives his personal opinions about his thesis.|$|E

2500|$|Beckett's {{outstanding}} {{achievements in}} prose {{during the period}} were the three novels Molloy (1951), Malone meurt (1951; Malone Dies) and L'innommable (1953: The Unnamable). In these novels—sometimes {{referred to as a}} [...] "trilogy", though this is against the author's own explicit wishes—the prose becomes increasingly bare and stripped down. Molloy, for instance, still retains many of the characteristics of a conventional novel (time, place, movement, and plot) and it makes use of the structure of a detective novel. In Malone Dies, movement and plot are largely dispensed with, though there is still some indication of place and the passage of time; the [...] "action" [...] of the book takes the form of an interior monologue. Finally, in The Unnamable, almost <b>all</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place and time are abolished, and the essential theme seems to be the conflict between the voice's drive to continue speaking so as to continue existing, and its almost equally strong urge towards silence and oblivion. Despite the widely held view that Beckett's work, as exemplified by the novels of this period, is essentially pessimistic, the will to live seems to win out in the end; witness, for instance, the famous final phrase of The Unnamable: 'I can't go on, I'll go on'.|$|E
2500|$|The Eighth Amendment forbids {{executing}} the insane because doing so offends human decency {{in that it}} serves neither the goal of retribution or deterrence. [...] "The potential for a prisoner's recognition {{of the severity of}} the offense and the objective of community vindication are called into question, however, if the prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relation to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole." [...] This is what the Court in Ford was referring to when it held that an inmate who lacks a rational understanding of the reason for his execution. A death-row inmate who is [...] "so callous as to be unrepentant, so self-centered and devoid of compassion as to lack <b>all</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> guilt, so adept at transferring blame to others as to be considered, at least in the colloquial sense, to be out of touch with reality" [...] may still have a [...] "rational understanding" [...] of the reason for his execution. Panetti's claim was that, by virtue of his mental illness, his psychotic disorder, he lacked such a [...] "rational understanding". Both the Texas courts' procedural missteps and the Fifth Circuit's substantive definition of incompetence precluded consideration of this contention.|$|E
