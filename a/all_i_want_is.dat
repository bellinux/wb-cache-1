5|$|In 2007, Miguel {{was signed}} to Jive Records-imprint label ByStorm Entertainment. He {{subsequently}} recorded <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You, but legal issues {{with his former}} production company prevented the album from being released for two years. Miguel continued working with various underground acts and writing songs for mainstream recording artists, including Johnson, Asher Roth, Jaheim, and Usher. Recording sessions for the album took place at Black Mango Studios in Van Nuys, California, Germano Studios in New York City, Glenwood Studios and Instrument Zoo in Miami, Florida, Studio 609 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and The Gym in Los Angeles, California.|$|E

It sold poorly {{at first and}} was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself {{as more than a}} typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. He said that the experience of balancing creativity and business sense on his first album made him more confident in his approach on Kaleidoscope Dream.|$|E

500|$|According to The Independents Holly Rubenstein, Kaleidoscope Dream is [...] "widely {{considered}} a leading example" [...] of alternative R; Miguel himself {{described it as}} [...] "avant soul". In the opinion of NPR's Frannie Kelley, the record combined R, pop, funk, rock and soul genres. Its music features sparse production, eccentric details, thick bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds. Allmusic's Andy Kellman found the album [...] "funkier and weirder" [...] than <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You and observed an [...] "illusory atmosphere ... intensified by some unexpected touches". Maura Johnston said much of it [...] "sounds, as the title might suggest, fractal." [...] As an R album, The A.V. Clubs Evan Rytlewski said, Kaleidoscope Dream deviated from genre conventions by minimizing the influence of hip hop; Jim DeRogatis believed it drew heavily on psychedelic rock and psychedelic pop. Music writers compared the album's style to Prince, Alex Macpherson of The Guardian perceives a [...] "headier aesthetic" [...] than on <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You, with [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "intimate experiments in Purple Rain-esque rock". Writing about the record for WNYC, Gretta Cohn claimed Miguel was [...] "redefining what contemporary R can be". Miguel said he [...] "definitely think it's an R record, though other people may not ... are so conditioned to expect certain things out of current R, and it's about following a formula. But R was once live music, it was psychedelic, it was rock, it was funk, and all these genres stem from soul music ... There would be no hip-hop or rock without R It was {{important for me to}} be true to what R is, and that is soulful." ...|$|E

The lead single, [...] "Genie in a Bottle", became a commercial success, peaking the top spot of the US Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks and became the biggest hit of the summer of 1999. The album is among the top 100 certified albums according to the RIAA. Christina Aguilera has sold over 14 million copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|According to Miguel, Jive marketed {{him as a}} [...] "typical R artist" [...] {{during their}} {{promotion}} of <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You: [...] "That album was a huge learning experience. I left the marketing of my album and me as an artist up to {{the discretion of the}} label ... I can't really blame them for , because that's what they know. But that's not what my lifestyle was." [...] Four singles were released from the album: the title track [...] "All I Want Is You", [...] "Sure Thing", [...] "Quickie", and [...] "Girls Like You". As the title track gradually received radio airplay, Miguel began touring as a supporting act for Usher and Trey Songz. By May 2011, [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] and [...] "Sure Thing" [...] had reached a combined digital/mobile sales of over 825,000 units.|$|E

500|$|According to Jason Newman from MTV Buzzworthy, <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You is [...] "a diverse album {{rooted in}} R and hip-hop, thoughtfully laced with {{elements}} of classic rock, funk and electro". Marc Hogan from Spin said it featured neo soul music, while AllMusic critic David Jeffries {{described it as}} a [...] "slick" [...] and [...] "sexy" [...] synthesis of influences from Prince, Kanye West, and electro. [...] "Girl Like You" [...] and [...] "Hard Way" [...] feature aggressive hip hop beats, while [...] "Pay Me" [...] and [...] "To the Moon" [...] explore European electronic music and EDM, respectively. The album's first half features two romantic songs, an interlude, a song about a prostitute, and another about a quickie. The closing track [...] "My Piece" [...] uses a [...] "piece"-"peace" [...] homonym. Jeffries said the album featured Miguel's [...] "sly sense of humor". On [...] "Sure Thing", Miguel sang about loyalty in a passionate committed relationship.|$|E
500|$|American singer Christina Aguilera rose to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her 1999 self-titled debut album. It topped the US Billboard 200 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It produced three Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: [...] "Genie in a Bottle", [...] "What a Girl Wants", and [...] "Come On Over Baby (<b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You)". Despite the success, Aguilera was displeased with being marketed as her then-manager Steve Kurtz desired, and felt unable to control her image. She told The Sydney Morning Herald her dissatisfaction with being a part of the late 1990s teen pop trend, [...] "The label [...] wanted to push the cookie-cutter, [...] almost virginal kind of imagery that wasn't me," [...] Aguilera said. [...] "I really wanted to squirm away from that, because I really thought it was really fake and superficial and untrue of what I was about." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for About.com, Mark Edward Nero gave <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You three-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars and said Miguel [...] "somehow managed to vocally glide across each" [...] of the {{different}} styles he explored in music that was nonetheless rooted in R He deemed the record imperfect but devoid of a poor song. B. Wright from Vibe found the music inconsistent and [...] "schizophrenic" [...] but praised Miguel's singing and songwriting abilities while determining the record was [...] "worth the purchase price". In a three-and-a-half star review, Slant Magazines Matthew Cole said {{the second half of}} songs was [...] "less stimulating" [...] on an album that [...] "blends slick, radio-friendly R with Prince-aping theatrics, both refracted around a sense of humor that, surreal and sexually unsubtle, would have to make [...] proud". Cole also compared Miguel to singer Kelis, [...] "whose work has an undeniably commercial cunning to it, but who never fails to imbue her pop confections with real personality".|$|E

500|$|Reviewing <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You for MSN Music in 2012, Christgau {{gave it a}} [...] "B+" [...] and {{believed}} Miguel [...] "front-loaded his Prince-channeling debut" [...] with [...] "five hooky tracks" [...] that were [...] "followed by six pleasant tracks and capped by two hooky novelties". He viewed the song [...] "Teach Me" [...] as [...] "a treasure hidden in the middle" [...] and [...] "'s" [...] song, [...] "unprecedented" [...] in [...] "a genre that makes its nut promising untold pleasures".

Who knows what pleases her? She does, she alone, and Miguel craves to be let in on that shifting and enthralling secret."

Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned.

Her dialogue, [...] "All I want is what I have coming to me. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> my fair share" [...] is a verbatim homage to Sally's Christmas list scene with Charlie Brown in the Christmas classic, A Charlie Brown Christmas. Just as Charlie Brown is with Sally, Finn is appalled by how much Rachel wants, though she assures him that five of the items are enough. When she later hints that an early gift would not be amiss, he surprises her with the donation of a sow in her name to needy Africans. Rachel is unhappy, reminds Finn that she is a vegan, and recommends that he stick to her list to avoid embarrassment, while pointedly mentioning earrings.|$|E
