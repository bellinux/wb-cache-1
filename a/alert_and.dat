40|$|<b>Alerts</b> <b>and</b> prompts {{represent}} promising {{types of}} decision support in electronic prescribing to tackle inadequacies in prescribing. A systematic review {{was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy of computerized drug <b>alerts</b> <b>and</b> prompts searching EMBASE, CINHAL, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO up to May 2007. Studies assessing the impact of electronic <b>alerts</b> <b>and</b> prompts on clinicians' prescribing behavior were selected and categorized by decision support type. Most <b>alerts</b> <b>and</b> prompts (23 out of 27) demonstrated benefit in improving prescribing behavior and/or reducing error rates. The impact appeared to vary based {{on the type of}} decision support. Some of these alerts (n = 5) reported a positive impact on clinical and health service management outcomes. For many categories of reminders, the number of studies was very small and few data were available from the outpatient setting. None of the studies evaluated features that might make <b>alerts</b> <b>and</b> prompts more effective. Details of an updated search run in Jan 2009 are included in the supplement section of this review...|$|R

5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably <b>alert</b> <b>and</b> ready.|$|E
5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the aims of Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of the plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a diversionary attack. As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher <b>alert</b> <b>and</b> were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E
5|$|Gregarious animals, {{hartebeest}} form {{herds of}} 20 to 300 individuals. They are very <b>alert</b> <b>and</b> non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place {{throughout the year}} {{with one or two}} peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Hartebeest {{are remarkably}} <b>alert</b> <b>and</b> {{cautious}} animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual {{stays on the}} lookout for danger, often standing on a termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E
5|$|Locating prey: The wolves {{travel in}} search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, and tracking. Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand <b>alert,</b> <b>and</b> point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.|$|E
5|$|On August31 {{before the}} storm's arrival, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine {{declared}} a state of emergency, putting the Virginia National Guard and state agencies on <b>alert</b> <b>and</b> opening the state's new Emergency Operations Center in suburban Richmond.

5|$|Due to the threat, the {{government}} of Honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the Bay Islands and prepared all air and naval resources. The government of Belize issued a purple <b>alert</b> <b>and</b> asked for citizens on offshore islands {{to leave for the}} mainland. Because the hurricane threatened to strike near Belize City as a Category4 hurricane, much of the city was evacuated in fear of a repeat of Hurricane Hattie 37years earlier. Guatemala issued a purple alert as well, recommending boats to stay in port, telling people to prepare or seek shelter, and warning of potential overflowing rivers. By the time hurricane Mitch made landfall, numerous people were evacuated along the western Caribbean coastline, including 100,000 in Honduras, 10,000 in Guatemala, and 20,000 in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.|$|E
5|$|During late November, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 625kilometers (390mi) east-southeast of Pohnpei. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic {{turning in}} {{the lower levels of}} the atmosphere, and a trough was located near the surface. The disturbance developed rainbands and gradually became better organized. By December2, the system had an elongated low-level circulation, located to the south of the convection. At 0600UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression about 735km (450mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation <b>Alert,</b> <b>and</b> at 1800UTC on December 2 the agency classified the system as Tropical Depression 31W. Initially the depression moved to the west-northwest, and early on December3 the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm.|$|E

5|$|In early October 1944, Landis {{checked into}} St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, {{where his wife}} Winifred had been hospitalized, with a severe cold. While in the hospital, {{he had a heart}} attack, causing him to miss the World Series {{for the first time in}} his commissionership. He {{remained}} fully <b>alert,</b> <b>and</b> as usual signed the World Series share checks to players. His contract was due to expire in January 1946; on November 17, 1944, baseball's owners voted him another seven-year term. However, on November 25, he died surrounded by family, five days after his 78thbirthday. His longtime assistant, Leslie O'Connor, wept as he read the announcement for the press. Landis is buried at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{surfaced}} {{again after}} dark, and successfully attacked after the moon set. Dykers {{found that the}} Japanese escorts were <b>alert,</b> <b>and</b> was unable to penetrate the convoy. As a result, he attacked three times by firing a total of 19 torpedoes from long range into the mass of ships {{at the center of}} the convoy. These attacks sank the 5,425-ton freighter SS Yoshida Maru No. 1, which was carrying an entire regiment of the 32nd Division. All 3,000 soldiers onboard drowned when the ship sank quickly. The remaining Japanese ships continued to Manila, arriving there on 29 April.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May 1915, the Turkish {{launched}} an assault against the Anzac perimeter. Forewarned by naval reconnaissance aircraft, {{the troops were}} on <b>alert</b> <b>and</b> the position was reinforced by {{the return of the}} 2nd and New Zealand Infantry Brigades from Cape Helles and the arrival of the 1st Light Horse Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade from Egypt. Along most of the line, the attack met with immediate disaster, with the Turkish attackers swept away by the rifle and machine gun fire of the Anzac defenders. At Courtney's Post, one of the most exposed parts of the perimeter, the Turks managed to enter the trenches but there they encountered Lance Corporal Albert Jacka and others, who drove them out again. For his action, Jacka became the first Australian to win the Victoria Cross in the war.|$|E
