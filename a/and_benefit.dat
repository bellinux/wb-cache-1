40|$|Knowledge about {{differences}} in consumer perceptions of health risks <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> related to fish consumption {{is important for}} the development of targeted health interventions associated with dietary choice. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify individual {{differences in}} Russian consumers according to their perceptions of health risks <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> associated with fish consumption. By application of a cluster analysis on perceptions of personal risks <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> associated with the consumption of fish, four groups of Russian consumers were classified as: very positive; positive; moderately positive; and ‘high risk–high benefit’ about the healthiness of fish consumption. Differences in perceptions of personal risks <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> across consumers were related to self-reported fish consumption, optimism about personal risks <b>and</b> <b>benefits,</b> <b>and</b> optimism about personal knowledge about risks <b>and</b> <b>benefits.</b> Implications for the development of targeted health interventions to influence perceptions of risks <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> associated with fish consumption, and ultimately fish consumption, are discussed. It is concluded that optimism regarding perceptions and knowledge of health risks, <b>and</b> health <b>benefits</b> should be taken into account when developing interventions aimed at consumer health...|$|R

Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts.

5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe ONS {{analysis}} of The effects of taxes <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> on household income, most recently published in May 2011, examines how the Government's intervention, through taxes <b>and</b> cash <b>benefits,</b> redistributes income among households.

This periodic analysis updates ‘The redistribution of household income 1977 to 2006 / 07 article’ published by ONS in 2008.

5|$|The {{first of}} these four territories to be {{incorporated}} into Imerina was Fanongoavana, then a principality ruled by Andriampanarivofomanjaka. Continual threats to his kingdom's security led Andriampanarivofomanjaka to secretly travel to the Rova of Antananarivo to pledge submission to Andriamasinavalona. He was accompanied by seven advisers who eloquently communicated their master's willingness to acknowledge Andriamasinavalona as his king. Andriamasinavalona accepted this offer and sealed the union of their territories by marrying Andriampanarivofomanjaka to his sister, Ranavalontsimitovy.

5|$|Despite {{the tribute}} and a {{negotiation}} between Laoshang Chanyu (r.174–160 BC) and Emperor Wen (r.180–157 BC) to reopen border markets, {{many of the}} Chanyu's Xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the Great Wall for additional goods. In a court conference assembled by Emperor Wu (r.141–87 BC) in 135 BC, the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement. Emperor Wu accepted this, despite continuing Xiongnu raids. However, a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a limited engagement at Mayi involving {{the assassination of the}} Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> the Han. When this plot failed in 133 BC, Emperor Wu launched a series of massive military invasions into Xiongnu territory. Chinese armies captured one stronghold after another and established agricultural colonies to strengthen their hold.

Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it.

5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> from hybrid vigour. These advantages are {{observed in the}} breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E
