25|$|According to H. L. Oldie, {{writing in}} Russian is <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>way</b> for Ukrainian authors to be {{published}} and reach a broader audience.

In 2010, synthetic nucleases called transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provided <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>way</b> to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require {{the creation of a}} custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires making only a short RNA sequence.|$|E

500|$|After Brannan {{visited the}} hot springs in the upper Napa Valley in 1859, he planned a new resort for the area. He bought land {{containing}} the springs in the northern portion of the Rancho Carne Humana in 1861 and founded the town of Calistoga, {{said to be a}} combination of the words [...] "California" [...] and then-fashionable Saratoga Springs in New York. Brannan also founded the Napa Valley Railroad there in 1864 in order to provide tourists with <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>way</b> to reach Calistoga from the San Francisco Bay ferry boats that docked in the lower Napa Valley at Vallejo. The railroad was later sold at a foreclosure sale in Napa County in 1869. Many poorer Calistoga residents were angered by Brannan's take-over of the region. At one point the opposition was so intense that Brannan and a couple others were shot at. Because of the incident, Brannan used a cane {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

500|$|Delrina's initial product {{offering}} was an electronic forms application called PerForm. Amato and Skapinker {{came up with}} the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically, rather than <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>way</b> to create paper-based forms from a computer. There was significant and long-term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in Canada and the United States, the latter spurred on in particular by the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce the total amount of paperwork handled by the United States government. One of the firm's early major software deals included a multi-year agreement to sell PerForm to the U.S. Navy in 1990. Soon after the software was installed on Compaq laptops that accompanied U.S. troops during the First Gulf War, where it was used to requisition [...] "everything from Coca-Cola to privies". Other significant volume sales went to 3M and Rockwell International. What helped set apart Delrina's electronic forms from its competitors in product reviews included its easy-to-use interface, its extensive development tools, and its comparatively low price. It also scored highly when it came to workflow and routing functions as well as security features. In early 1991 InfoWorld selected PerForm Pro ...|$|E
500|$|Ryses combat puts lots of {{focuses on}} [...] "flow" [...] and crowd control. As a result, the team {{introduced}} a rhythm-styled combat. The flow was described {{to be one}} of the most important part in the game's mechanics, and the artificial intelligence of enemies were designed to break and disrupt players' flow. The team later chose to introduce the execution mechanics as they found that the combat was proven to be too difficult for players, and that the execution mechanics provided <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>way</b> for players to defeat enemies. The game also focused on precision and timing, tasking players to hit enemies at the correct time and position to gain greater rewards. The developer also hoped that players will use creativity when dealing with enemies. A concept called [...] "mashing to mastery" [...] was introduced in Ryse, in which the game's combat was designed to be accessible for newcomers and be challenging for hardcore players. In order to achieve the [...] "mashing to mastery" [...] mechanic, the team introduced the execution mechanic, which is a series of quick-time events, as the team at Crytek hoped that it would make these scene more rewarding to players, as well as allowing the flow of combat to continue.|$|E
500|$|In 1828, {{there was}} a {{proposal}} to build a canal from West Stockwith on the River Trent to the River Don at Doncaster, which would have bypassed the Stainforth and Keadby. There was also {{a plan for a}} lower Don bypass, to connect direct to the Goole Canal, avoiding the difficult Dutch River. Neither scheme progressed any further, but the Keadby end of the canal was improved, and a new deep water jetty was constructed on the Trent in 1833. Traffic improved, with boats using the canal as <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>way</b> to reach the Don than the Dutch River. The Don Navigation Company then proposed a new canal from Stainforth to the River Ouse at Swinefleet in 1836. They needed to buy [...] of the Stainforth and Keadby from the Don towards Stainforth, and started to negotiate, while applying for an Act of Parliament. The Stainforth and Keadby opposed the bill, and an agreement was reached in May 1836 that the Don would buy the whole canal for £48,000. A bill to authorise the sale was opposed by some of the Stainforth and Keadby shareholders and was rejected by the House of Lords. After several more abortive plans at amalgamation, where the Stainforth and Keadby pulled out at the last minute, agreement was finally reached, and the Don Navigation took control of the canal on 1 January 1849. A year later, it became part of the South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Company, after the Don Navigation and the Doncaster and Goole Railway companies merged.|$|E

2500|$|Over-the-counter {{preparations}} containing dextromethorphan {{have been}} used in manners inconsistent with their labeling, often as a recreational drug. At doses much higher than medically recommended, DXM and its major metabolite, dextrorphan, acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which produces dissociative hallucinogenic states somewhat similar to ketamine and phencyclidine. Along with other drugs such as ketamine or phencyclidine, also known as PCP, there is a street name for dextromethorphan-infused substances which is also known as [...] "Angel." [...] It may produce distortions of the visual field – feelings of dissociation, distorted bodily perception, excitement, and a loss of sense of time. Some users report stimulant-like euphoria, particularly in response to music. Dextromethorphan usually provides its recreational effects in a non-linear fashion, so that they are experienced in significantly varied stages. These stages are commonly referred to as [...] "plateaus".

(Ellen Dane was forced to decamp to the US, shortly after meeting Amelia, to escape {{the attention of the}} authorities.) Unmarried mothers in Victorian Britain often struggled to gain an income, since the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act had removed any financial obligation from the fathers of illegitimate children, whilst bringing up their children in a society where single parenthood and illegitimacy were stigmatised. This led to the practice of baby farming in which individuals acted as adoption or fostering agents, in return for regular payments or a single, up-front fee from the babies’ mothers. Many businesses were set up to take in these young women and care for them until they gave birth. The mothers subsequently left their unwanted babies to be looked after as [...] "nurse children".|$|E
