5000|$|On 17 May 1923, the GWR {{introduced}} {{some new}} coaches on their South Wales services; {{some of these}} coaches had British Standard <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> and screw couplers as used on many other GWR coaches; some had Pullman-type <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> and Laycock [...] "buckeye" [...] couplers; {{and there were some}} with one type at one end, and the other end having the other type. In 1925 the GWR started to use the [...] "suspended" [...] form of <b>gangway</b> <b>connection</b> instead of the [...] "scissors" [...] pattern. From 1938, GWR coaches which were expected to need coupling to LNER or SR coaches were fitted with gangway adaptors, to allow the dissimilar types to be connected.|$|R

50|$|Eight 2-car 103-3550 series {{refurbished}} sets (M1 to M8) {{were formed}} between January and October 2004 ahead of Kakogawa Line electrification in March 2005. These sets feature cab <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> and toilets.|$|R
50|$|A {{corridor}} <b>connection</b> (or <b>gangway</b> <b>connection)</b> is {{a flexible}} connector fitted {{to the end}} of a railway coach to enable passage from one coach to another without falling out of the train.|$|R
50|$|The fleet {{underwent}} life-extension refurbishment between 1994 and 2001. This involved {{upgrading the}} train interiors and also forming six-car sets from the remaining three-car sets {{by removing the}} cab ends and adding <b>gangway</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 7 March 1892, the Great Western Railway (GWR) {{introduced}} {{a set of}} coaches on their [...] to Birkenhead service. It was the first British side-corridor train where a corridor connection was provided between all the coaches, and was {{to the design of}} William Dean. The purpose was not to enable passengers to move around the train, but to allow the guard to reach any compartment quickly. Electric bells were provided so that he could be summoned. When the guard was not so required, he kept the communicating doors locked. Passengers could still use the corridor within the coach to reach the toilet. The <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> of the early GWR corridor coaches were offset to one side. Some coaches intended for use at the ends of trains had the <b>gangway</b> <b>connection</b> fitted at only one end. The GWR introduced restaurant cars in 1896; corridor connections were fitted, but passengers wishing to use the restaurant car were expected to board it at the start of their journey, and remain there: the <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> were still not for public use.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> are modified {{versions of}} Taiwan Railways Administration EMU800 series trains {{that have a}} similar design. The primary modification added LCD screens {{similar to those used}} on newer Japanese commuter and subway trains.|$|R
50|$|MEMU {{trains are}} {{designed}} for semi-urban and rural areas, unlike EMU (electric multiple unit) trains that {{are designed for}} urban and semi-urban areas. MEMU trains also have end vestibules (<b>gangway</b> <b>connections)</b> not found on EMU trains. Also, unlike EMU, MEMU trains have lavatories.|$|R
50|$|Sixteen cars {{formed as}} eight 2-car sets were {{delivered}} from Nippon Sharyo to Nagoya Depot in February 1999. These featured {{a number of}} minor changes compared with the earlier KiHa 75-0/100 sets. Externally, an additional set of headlights was included above the end <b>gangway</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|R
50|$|The trains {{were built}} by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, with {{exterior}} and interior styling overseen by Japanese industrial designer Ken Okuyama. The driving cabs {{at each end of}} the three-car trainsets includes an automatically extending <b>gangway</b> <b>connection</b> to allow trains to be coupled or split en route.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s saw {{the first}} class {{accommodation}} downgraded. Being of a non-standard design, the class {{was not included in}} the DMU refurbishment programme so remained in close-to-original condition. The main alteration was the plating over of the outer <b>gangway</b> <b>connection</b> on the DMS vehicles in 1979-81 following drivers' complaints of draughts.|$|R
50|$|Corridor {{connections}} {{were provided}} throughout each unit, including between units. This {{gave them a}} distinctive front-end appearance as the headcode display {{was placed on the}} opposite side of the <b>gangway</b> <b>connection</b> to the driving cab window, leading to their nickname of Nelsons (referring to Lord Nelson's eyepatch, and also to their connection with Portsmouth).|$|R
50|$|This second {{batch of}} fifty units were {{classified}} as Class 150/1 and numbered in the range 150101-150. Like the prototype units, {{they did not have}} front-end <b>gangway</b> <b>connections.</b> Originally based at Derby Etches Park depot, these units were introduced in 1986, mainly concentrated around Birmingham and Manchester, and in later years were restricted mainly to commuter services.|$|R
50|$|The train has a {{modified}} front design with two stripes {{of blue and}} includes the Taipei Metro logo. Unlike previous trains, the front face has an emergency door at its center, featuring a translucent window. Replacing the four ribbon barriers on previous Taipei Metro trains, the <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> have four small rectangular fall-prevention barriers, while each carriage has two similar fall-prevention barriers.|$|R
50|$|A vestibuled {{train is}} a {{passenger}} train whose cars have enclosed vestibules at their ends, {{in contrast to}} the open platforms on early cars. Typically, a vestibule has doorways on either side to allow passenger egress at stations, a door into the body of the car, and, {{at the end of the}} car, a doorway to allow access to the next car through a flexible <b>gangway</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|R
50|$|Often, but not always, {{passenger}} cars in a train are linked together with enclosed, flexible <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> through which passengers and crewmen can walk. Some designs incorporate semi-permanent connections between cars {{and may have}} a full-width connection, effectively making them one long, articulated 'car'. In North America, {{passenger cars}} also employ tightlock couplings to keep a train together {{in the event of}} a derailment or other accident.|$|R
50|$|The final {{batch of}} 85 two-car units were built with {{front-end}} <b>gangway</b> <b>connections,</b> which allowed passengers to move between two units that {{were working in}} multiple. These units were classified as Class 150/2 and numbered in the range 150201-285. They were used on longer-distance services. The end gangways make them very similar in appearance to the Class 317/2 EMUs, also based on the Mark 3 bodyshell.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the trains was overseen by {{industrial}} designer Kenji Ekuan. Retracting <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> on the end cars allow two sets to be coupled together to form 12-car formations. Electrical and safety equipment is duplicated, as on the E233 series commuter trains, to improve safety and reliability. Active suspension on end cars and yaw dampers between all cars for improved ride comfort. The MoHa E259-500 car is equipped with two pantographs, but one is for emergency use.|$|R
5000|$|The {{external}} styling of {{the train}} {{was the work of}} Hiroyuki Wakabayashi, an architect who was also responsible for designing Uji Station on the Keihan Uji Line. The design theme was [...] "Outdated Future", and is the reason for the train's futuristic and retro styling. The end cars feature streamlined cabs with no <b>gangway</b> <b>connections.</b> The cars are painted an all-over metallic deep blue colour. The side windows are elliptical in shape, giving an aircraft-like appearance.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} of SP1900 is yellowish with blue flooring, with fully longitudinal seating {{akin to the}} M-Trains on the urban lines and a wider <b>gangway</b> <b>connection</b> than the refurbished Metro Cammell EMUs. Each car has six 15-inch LCD monitors mounted on stanchions and broadcasting looping daily TV news provided by Cable TV Hong Kong (Newsline Express), advertisements and safety guidelines when announcements are being broadcast. Two small video cameras are mounted in opposite positions on each car for driver to keep the train under surveillance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{increase}} the riding comfort and running stability of articulated type high speed railway vehicles(HSRV), {{it is important}} that the <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> for the passenger car satisfied fire safety, sound proof and durability under triaxial angular displacement (rolling/yawing/pitching) modes. On the other hand, a domestic test standard on the durability of the rubber components has not been determined. In this study, the fatigue life was predicted using the results of the nonlinear finite element analysis and the fatigue properties. Moreover, a fatigue rig test of th...|$|R
50|$|The Metropolitan was {{introduced}} at the 1999 ITB Berlin trade fair; two train formations were delivered on June 14 and July 12, 1999. The push-pull train units with control cars were hauled by specifically equipped DB Class 101 highpower locomotives. Each unit comprised seven specially manufactured railway coaches based on ICE 2 cars, with flexible <b>gangway</b> <b>connections</b> and a luxurious pearwood and leather interior manufactured by Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau. The Metropolitan's silver, black and orange corporate design clearly differentiated {{it from the}} Deutsche Bahn parent group.|$|R

50|$|The LNER's {{locomotive}} design team, {{headed by}} Nigel Gresley, produced a new design of tender that was slightly {{longer than the}} old, but built as high and wide as possible without compromising the loading gauge. A passageway was incorporated along the right-hand side, and at the rear end a Pullman type <b>gangway</b> <b>connection</b> was fitted, together with a buckeye coupler, {{both of which were}} compatible with LNER coaches; the gangway was of concertina pattern, and was pressed against the corresponding gangway on the leading coach by means of sprung pistons. Although a normal <b>gangway</b> <b>connection</b> was used, the passageway through the tender was only 5 ft high and 18 in wide, and the floor of the passage was 2 ft above the bottom of the water tank, giving a high step at both ends. The passageway was illuminated by a single circular window in the tender rear panel, placed high up and {{to the right of the}} corridor connection. Ten of these tenders were placed in service between April and September 1928, of which three were attached to new locomotives of Class A3; two were attached to existing Class A3 locomotives, and five attached to Class A1 locomotives. The design was patented by Gresley in August 1928.|$|R
25|$|The {{carriages}} feature fifteen compartments and {{a corridor}} {{on the one}} side. There are regular doors at the {{one end of the}} carriage, where there is a vestibule, while smaller doors on the other end act as emergency exits. To provide comparability with older WLAB and B5 carriages, WLAB2s were initially installed without a closed <b>gangway</b> <b>connection.</b> On the compartment side there is one window for each compartment. On the corridor side there are two rows of windows and fifteen folding seats, each with place for two people.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{employed}} {{is one of}} {{the smaller}} 2-4-2 tank engines of the 1300 class, introduced for branch traffic two or three years ago, with a boiler pressure of 160 lb per sq in... Coupled to the engine is a corridor composite carriage seating nine first and 30 third class passengers... To this is attached a driving car which is a... third class carriage seating 46 passengers... The end compartment of this coach is set apart for the driver and guard. A <b>gangway</b> <b>connection</b> is provided between the two vehicles.|$|R
50|$|This {{locomotive}} {{came into}} existence during the 1950s when the Dk, Ds and Dg locos were upgraded to motors of the same type as in Da. Many of the engines also lost their <b>gangway</b> <b>connections.</b> In this rebuilding the difference between passenger and freight locos disappeared, since they now were capable of 100 km/h. The Du became a universal locomotive, though {{in the end it}} was mainly used for freight trains. It disappeared from service in 1977, with the dismantle of the wooden locos, while the steel units were rebuilt to Du2. 244 of the D units have had the Du designation.|$|R
