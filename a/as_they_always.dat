5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E
25|$|Although most {{governments in}} the world are, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> have been, autocracies {{of one kind or}} another, no idea hold greater sway in the mind of educated Americans than the belief that it is {{possible}} to democratize governments, anytime, anywhere, under any circumstances... (But) decades, if not centuries, are normally required for people to acquire the necessary disciplines and habits.|$|E
25|$|French Canadians had {{continued}} to farm <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> had. By the 1850s, soil nutrients were becoming exhausted. Their farming methods were outdated. About this time the textile industry in New England experienced a boom. With living conditions so harsh, and {{work very hard to}} find even in the largest city, Montreal, emigration seemed the only option for many. As the first wave moved out in 1850's, word of mouth soon began to move larger crowds by the late 1870s. Mill owners hired these French immigrants to staff their mills more cheaply than American and Irish-born workers, who were themselves displaced.|$|E

25|$|The Russian {{conquest of}} Transcaucasia in the 19th century split the Azerbaijani {{language}} community across two states, the other being Iran. The Soviet Union promoted {{development of the}} language, but set it back considerably with two successive script changes – from the Persian to Latin {{and then to the}} Cyrillic script – while Iranian Azerbaijanis continued to use the Persian <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> had. Despite the wide use of Azerbaijani in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, it did not become the official language of Azerbaijan until 1956. After achieving independence from the Soviet Union 1991, the new Republic of Azerbaijan decided to switch back to the Latin script.|$|E
25|$|Saltwater {{crocodiles}} are exclusively tropical reptiles {{and usually}} found in Far North Queensland (several hundred kilometres north-west of Fraser Island), however, occasionally during the warmer season (December through March, when water temperatures reach consistent tropical temperatures) crocodiles may appear in areas {{in and around}} Fraser Island. During the 2008–2009 summer several crocodiles (one over 4metres in length) {{were present in the}} surrounding ocean. It is thought that these reptiles are seasonal visitors, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> disappear during the cold months (presumably returning to tropical northern Queensland.) This sort of activity was apparently reported but unverified decades ago (a handful of crocodiles have also historically been observed on very rare occurrences around Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast during the warmer season) but within recent years has been proven and observed more often. Crocodiles do not breed nor do they appear to have any permanent populations living on Fraser Island.|$|E

500|$|Twenty-two {{years prior}} to this film's production, actor Mark Lindsay Chapman, while professionally using the name Mark Lindsay, had been almost cast as John Lennon in the biopic [...] (1985). Yoko Ono had been deeply {{involved}} in the production and had herself been initially impressed with his audition and approved his casting prior to discovering his full name was Mark Lindsay Chapman. She then nixed his casting on the grounds it was [...] "bad karma", {{and a great deal of}} press attention was given to his having almost gotten the role. The director of Chapter 27, Jarrett Schaefer, auditioned many Lennon impersonators, but was especially impressed with Mark Lindsay Chapman's tape because he conveyed the [...] "tough town" [...] street-smart quality of Lennon that the impersonators failed to convey, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> played Lennon as larger-than-life. Schaefer described Lennon as having a [...] "chip on his shoulder and always cracking these cynical one-liners", and felt that actor Chapman was best at conveying this quality. Schaefer had some difficulty negotiating the casting with the film's producers because of Chapman's name. After Chapman was cast, he asked Chapman how he should be billed to which Chapman replied [...] "Mark fucking Lindsay Chapman. That's my fucking name." [...] Schaefer remarks that this was so reflective of how Lennon talked, it just reinforced his sense that Chapman was right for the part.|$|E

2500|$|Some viral vectors, for {{instance}} [...] gamma-retroviruses, insert their genomes at a seemingly random location {{on one of}} the host chromosomes, which can disturb the function of cellular genes and lead to cancer. In a severe combined immunodeficiency retroviral gene therapy trial conducted in 2002, four of the patients developed leukemia {{as a consequence of the}} treatment; three of the patients recovered after chemotherapy.

2500|$|In the north, Stalinist and absolutist, often brutalist {{architecture}}, was championed.

[...] Nomenclatura lived in Soviet-style apartment blocks, farmers and rural workers lived in traditional houses <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> had; urbanization did not occur. [...] Grand buildings and huge public squares were developed in Pyongyang as architectural showpieces. [...] Formal processional landscapes accompanied these sites. [...] Nearly all architecture was government sponsored, and maintained great homogeneity of function and style.|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, 2012, Barack Obama {{became the}} first sitting U.S. {{president}} to say he supports same-sex marriage. Previously, he had opposed restrictions on same-sex marriage such as the Defense of Marriage Act, which he promised to repeal, California's Prop 8, and {{a constitutional amendment to}} ban same-sex marriage (which he opposed saying that [...] "decisions about marriage should be left to the states <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> have been.") but also stated that he personally believed marriage to be {{between a man and a}} woman and that he favored civil unions that would [...] "give same-sex couples equal legal rights and privileges as married couples". Earlier, when running for the Illinois Senate in 1996, he said that he [...] "unequivocally support(ed) gay marriage" [...] and [...] "favor(ed) legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages." [...] Senator John Kerry, Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, did not support same-sex marriage. Former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and former vice presidents Joe Biden, Al Gore, and Walter Mondale also support gay marriage.|$|E

[...] He acknowledged that there had been [...] "isolated hisses" [...] on the first night because some audience members did not like the reappearance of the ghosts or a reference to the [...] "Supreme Court" [...] (according to D'Oyly Carte, misunderstood as [...] "Supreme Being") but asserted that both objections had been addressed by the removal of the offending material, and that audience reaction had been otherwise enthusiastic.
