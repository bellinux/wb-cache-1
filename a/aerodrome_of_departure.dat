50|$|The Private Pilot Licence confers on {{the holder}} a {{privilege}} to act as the pilot in command of certain kinds of aircraft. The holder may not operate for valuable consideration, i.e. any form of reward, either financial or in kind. However, subject to national restrictions governing the soliciting of passengers to be carried on board an aircraft operated by a PPL holder, {{and in addition to}} several other requirements, a PPL holder may carry passengers who make a remunerative contribution toward the direct cost of the flights. A Flying Instructor rating may be included, subject to requirements under EASA-FCL being satisfied, in an EASA-FCL PPL provided the applicant has successfully completed a number of additional examinations. Such a person giving instruction in flying training may be remunerated. Applicants for a Private Pilot Licence must be at least 17 years old, hold a valid EASA Part-MED Class 2 Medical Certificate, and have met the specified practical and theoretical training requirements laid down in EASA-FCL. This presently includes nine written theory examinations, completing at least 45 hours' flying training, including ten hours' solo flying, five hours' solo 'cross-country' flying and at least one solo flight of not fewer than 150 nautical miles with full-stop landings at two or more different aerodromes other than the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new idea}} how trajectory calculations {{could be improved}} in order to match real flights better. Exact trajectory calculation is important for future of air traffic control, because {{it is one of}} the enablers for safe traffic increase. Methods used to calculate trajectories are based on aircraft types and their performances mainly. However, we believe that there are many other influencing factors which should be taken into account. We collect available data about flights and store them into a multi-dimensional database. Knowledge accumulated in this database is the basis for aircraft performances prediction using machine learning methods. In that way the prediction is not based on aircraft type alone, but also on other attributes like <b>aerodrome</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> destination and operator. There attributes indirectly imply to procedures, operator’s best practices, local airspace characteristics, etc. and enable us to make better predictions of aircraft performances. Predictions in this case are not static but tailored to every particular flight...|$|E
