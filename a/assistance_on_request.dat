The MTW Campaign is a collaboration between the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) and 39 cosponsors including national associations, state and federal agencies, community-based organizations, foundations, and businesses. This initiative gives recognition and visibility to innovative and effective service delivery models. Models are selected based on a set of criteria that includes delivery of high quality primary care services, community participation, integration of health and social services, quantifiable outcomes, and replicability.

40|$|BackgroundWe {{conducted}} a pilot test of American Cancer Society Workplace Solutions, an intervention {{that takes a}} marketing approach to increasing employers' adoption of evidence-based practices to prevent and control chronic diseases among their employees. ContextWe delivered the intervention and assessed the changes in practices of 8 large employers in the Pacific Northwest. MethodsWorkplace Solutions recommends 15 employer practices in 5 categories: 1) health insurance benefits, 2) policies, 3) workplace programs, 4) health-promoting communication, and 5) tracking of employee health behaviors to measure progress. The intervention includes 4 meetings with employers over 2 months and begins with a questionnaire-based assessment of employer practices. Tailored recommendations follow, along with practice-specific implementation <b>assistance</b> <b>on</b> <b>requested</b> topics. We tested the intervention in a before 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cafter study without a comparison group. ConsequencesThe employers ranged in size from 7500 to 115, 522 employees and included private companies and public employers. Seven of the eight employers implemented more of the recommended practices at follow-up (an average of 13 months after the intervention) than at baseline. Overall, implementation of the practices increased from 38...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of educational {{reform in the}} United Arab Emirates (UAE) imposes a change agent role on secondary school department heads however the assistance-intensive process is inhibited by the current educational structure. As the concept of teacher empowerment becomes accepted, some department heads {{have the ability to}} develop a professional learning community while others are unable to do so. The present study considers the present and ideal role of the department head as a change agent facilitating the {{implementation of}} educational reform in the UAE. A sequential mixed method mode of inquiry with two phases was employed. In phase one, department heads were profiled from a self, superior and subordinate perspective and a conceptual framework related to patterns of effective change agent behaviour was developed. Findings show that effective change agent characteristics of department heads included priorities related to change implementation and teacher support, a collaborative leadership style, seven strategies related to a participatory, supportive and facilitative approach and ten skills that motivate, energise and encourage teachers. The identification of two ineffective department heads by teacher informants in phase one provided an opportunity to study the work of effective and ineffective department heads as cases in-depth. Case study findings confirm the conceptual framework because effective heads were rated high for all characteristics identified, while ineffective heads were rated low. All department heads accepted the change agent role unofficially with no additional time release, but effective heads took ownership of the process and empowered teachers while ineffective heads provided <b>assistance</b> <b>on</b> <b>request.</b> Effective heads used interpersonal skills and asserted themselves as technical experts while ineffective heads were passive and were considered to be traditional teachers. Strategies and skills employed by effective heads included resource linking, collaborative problem solving, facilitation, support and administration/organisation while ineffective department heads used resolution giving and providing technical assistance. Time constraints, restrictive school schedules and role ambiguity were identified as major impediments to the change agent role of department heads in his study. Nevertheless, the new curriculum is being implemented in all of the departments studied verifying that the department head is an untapped resource in the change process. Educational StudiesD.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of support of the integrated rescue system with assigned Army detachments. The theoretical part summarizes the transformation of the Ministry of Defence which had a major impact on the extent of the assistance provided. All rescue battalions were canceled and three engineer battalions and two separate rescue companies were created. Two rescue battalions were transformed into light motorized battalions and forwarded to the subordination of the Fourth and Seventh Mechanized Brigade. Organizational components of the ACR allocate a number of specialized teams for support intervening IRS. These include teams for ground and aerial radiation survey and decontamination detachments of people and technology, as well as some others, such as rescue detachment, detachment of transport humanitarian aid, a subunit of the earthwork, a subunit of the blasting and demolition, and more. Conditions requiring deployment of detachment vary according to the type of the assistance requested. They are primarily intended deployment Permanent Standby Force as planned <b>assistance</b> <b>on</b> <b>request.</b> This is the detachments in the central alarm plan and in accordance with the Act on the IRS ACR is required to provide such assistance. In providing assistance in dealing with radiological emergencies, ACR is equipped with a large number of devices, equipment and technologies. These are mainly radiometers, personal and group dosimeters. In the decontamination means is a habitat for decontamination of people and habitat for decontamination techniques LINE- 82 nd. The purpose of this thesis was to analyze whether the equipment ACR is still up-to-date with the times and that will be sufficient in comparison with similar Fire Rescue equipment. In the event of a radiation emergency is important to minimize the harmful effects of ionizing radiation on the population and the affected people. The lower limit of measurement was elected as the main comparing of the parameters measuring devices. In the case of decontamination of the equipment, attention was focused on the capacity of decontaminated people and technology. Carried out research revealed that earmarked detachments are equipped with measuring devices of varying ages and abilities. Some devices have been created {{at the time of the}} risk of nuclear war. This corresponds to their durable construction and a relatively high threshold, which is insufficient for the conditions solving a radiation accident in peaceful state. In addition, some of these instruments provide information and the measured value in the old, disused units, which can cause transmission of misleading information. Other devices are, however, modern, ergonomic, highly sensitive at low dose rate values, providing real-time information on the clear LCD display. Unique capabilities of the ACR give the possibility of performing aerial radiation survey, which greatly helps to keep the overview and assessment of future developments spread of radioactivity in the environment. The equipment ACR is quite outdated in the area of decontamination technology. Again, it originated at the time of the risk of nuclear war. The priority was a simple construction and operation, the ability of decontamination of large numbers of affected persons and equipment. However, there was practically no environmental solutions, separate showers for men and women and water consumption. On the other hand, the number of decontamination equipment of ACR virtually doubles the capacity of the firefighters equipment, which in terms of large accidental release of radioactive substances and decontaminated large number of people and technology is a distinct advantage. Overall, the Army units are able to qualitatively and quantitatively support the affecting IRS components and thus contribute significantly to dealing with radiological emergencies of any kind...|$|E
