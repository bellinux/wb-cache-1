40|$|Here {{we report}} on <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> {{measurements}} of a commercial high power CW diode-pumped solid-state laser (Coherent Verdi-V 5). This kind of lasers usually presents large frequency jitter (up to 50 MHz) both {{in the short term}} (1 ms time scale) and in the long term (> 10 s time scale). A precise measurement of <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>deviations</b> in both temporal scales should require a set of different devices (optical cavities, optical wave-meters), each suited for measurements only at a specific integration time. Here we demonstrate how a frequency comb can be used to overcome this difficulty, allowing in a single step a full characterization of both short (103 s) <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> jitter with a resolution better than 1 MHz. We demonstrate in this way the flexibility of optical <b>frequency</b> combs for <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> measurements not only of ultra-stable lasers but also of relatively unstable lasers. The <b>absolute</b> <b>frequency</b> calibration of the Verdi laser that we have obtained have been used in order to improve the accuracy of the measurements of the local gravitational acceleration value with 88 Sr atoms trapped in 1 D vertical lattices...|$|R

The proposed scheme employs an additional control loop relying on the system <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> that operates {{in combination with the}} maximum power point tracking control loop. To improve the power-smoothing capability while preventing over-deceleration of the rotor speed, the gain of the additional loop is modified with the rotor speed and <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation.</b> The gain is set to be high if the rotor speed and/or <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> is large. The simulation results based on the IEEE 14 -bus system clearly demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly lessens the output power fluctuation of a WPP under various scenarios by modifying the gain with the rotor speed and <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation,</b> and thereby it can regulate the <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> within a narrow range...|$|R

40|$|<b>Frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> is {{a common}} problem for power system signal processing. Many power system {{measurements}} are carried out in a fixed sampling rate assuming the system operates in its nominal frequency (50 or 60 Hz). However, the actual frequency may deviate from the normal value {{from time to time}} due to various reasons such as disturbances and subsequent system transients. Measurement of signals based on a fixed sampling rate may introduce errors under such situations. In order to achieve high precision signal measurement appropriate algorithms need to be employed to reduce the impact from <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> in the power system data acquisition process. This paper proposes an advanced algorithm to enhance Fourier transform for power system signal processing. The algorithm is able to effectively correct <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> under fixed sampling rate. Accurate measurement of power system signals is essential for the secure and reliable operation of power systems. The algorithm is readily applicable to such occasions where signal processing is affected by <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation.</b> Both mathematical proof and numerical simulation are given in this paper to illustrate robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
