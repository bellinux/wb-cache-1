50|$|Purified Air is {{supplied}} {{in the gap}} between the water surface and the top of the Super-Kamiokande tank. The air purification system contains three compressors, a buffer tank, dryers, filters, and activated charcoal filters. A total of 8 m3 of activated charcoal is used. The last 50 L of charcoal is cooled to −40 °C to increase removal efficiency for radon. Typical flow rates, dew point, and residual radon concentration are 18 m3/h, −65 °C (@+1 kg/cm2), and a few mBq m−3, respectively. Typical radon concentration in the dome air is measured to be 40 Bq m−3. Radon levels in the mine tunnel air, near the tank cavity dome, typically reach 2000-3000 Bq m−3 during the warm season, from May until October, while from November to April the radon level is approximately 100-300 Bq m−3. This variation is due to the chimney effect in the ventilation pattern of the mine tunnel system; in cold seasons, fresh air flows into the Atotsu tunnel entrance that is a relatively short path through exposed rock before reaching the experimental area, while in the summer, air flows out the tunnel, drawing radon-rich air from deep within the mine past the experimental area.In order to keep radon levels in the dome area and water purification system below 100 Bq m−3, fresh air is continually pumped at approximately 10 m3/min from outside the mine which generates a slight over-pressure in the Super-Kamiokande experimental area to minimize the entry of ambient mine air. A “Radon Hut” (Rn Hut) was constructed near the Atotsu tunnel entrance to house equipment for the dome air system: a 40 hp air pump with 10 m^3 min−1 /15 PSI pump capacity, <b>air</b> <b>dehumidifier,</b> carbon filter tanks, and control electronics. In autumn 1997, an extended intake air pipe was installed at a location approximately 25 m above the Atotsu tunnel entrance. This low level satisfies that goals of air quality so that carbon filter regeneration operations would no longer be required.|$|E

40|$|A solar liquid {{desiccant}} {{cooling system}} uses renewable energy and natural refrigerant (water) {{which makes it}} attractive. Its main components are <b>air</b> <b>dehumidifier,</b> solar liquid desiccant regenerator and direct/indirect evaporative cooler. In this cooling system, strong liquid desiccant absorbs water from air in the dehumidifier that must be rejected in the solar regenerator. This makes regeneration of a liquid desiccant {{one of the key}} processes in the cooling system that requires thermal energy. The energy needed for regeneration can be obtained from sun {{with the help of an}} open type solar collector cum regenerator. It also enables storage of energy in the form of regenerated desiccant for use during non-sunshine hours. Detailed analysis of the performance of this device has prime importance in integrating it with a liquid desiccant air cooling system. This entails the development and experimental performance testing of a liquid desiccant solar regenerator under actual weather conditions over the sunshine hours.

40|$|Preservation of {{agricultural}} products {{have a very}} important to avoid the dropped of selling price when the harvest season arrives. Agricultural products are perishable because of high water content approximately 80 % which if the moisture content above 10 % encourages proliferation of spoilage microorganisms in the material and cause the short shelf life. One way {{that has been done}} to preserve agricultural products such as red Chili is dried using direct sunlight. Weakness of the sun drying can not reduce the water content to below 10 % so spoilage microorganisms can live and breed, cause the short self life. Drying using Heat Pump Humidification Technology (HPD) is one solution to overcome the disadvantages of the direct sun drying. HPD can reduce the moisture content up to or below 10 % will increase the self life and make easier to crush and to produce a Chili powder.

In the combined system, the air is first dehumidified in the dehumidifier and then mixed with ambient air by AHU before entering the evaporator. Experiments using lithium chloride as the liquid desiccant have been carried out for the performance evaluation of the dehumidifier and regenerator. Based on the air mixture (AHU) design, the electrical coefficient of performance (ECOP), thermal coefficient of performance (TCOP) and whole system coefficient of performance (COPsys) models used in the hybrid liquid desiccant solar cooing system were developed to evaluate this system performance.

40|$|The Need and the Opportunity Codes such as ASHRAE 90. 2 and IECC, and {{programs}} such as Energy Star and Builders Challenge, are causing new homes to be built to higher performance standards. As a result sensible cooling loads in new homes are going down, but indoor air quality prerogatives are causing ventilation rates and moisture loads to increase in humid climates. Conventional air conditioners are unable to provide the low sensible heat ratios that are needed to efficiently cool and dehumidify homes since dehumidification potential is strongly correlated with cooling system operating hours. The project team saw an opportunity to develop {{a system that is}} at least as effective as a conventional <b>air</b> conditioner plus <b>dehumidifier,</b> removes moisture without increasing the sensible load, reduces equipment cost by integrating components, and simplifies installation. Project Overview Prime contractor Davis Energy Group led a team in developing an Integrated Heating, Ventilation, Cooling, and Dehumidification (I-HVCD) system under the DOE SBIR program. Phase I and II SBIR project activities ran from July 2003 through December 2007. Tasks included: (1) Mechanical Design and Prototyping; (2) Controls Development; (3) Laboratory and Field Testing; and (4) Commercialization Activities Technology Description. Key components of the prototype I-HVCD system include an evaporator coil assembly, return and outdoor air damper, and controls. These are used in conjunction with conventional components that include a variable speed air handler or furnace, and a two-stage condensing unit. I-HVCD controls enable the system to operate in three distinct cooling modes to respond to indoor temperature and relative humidity (RH) levels. When sensible cooling loads are high, the system operates similar to a conventional system but varies supply airflow in response to indoor RH. In the second mode airflow is further reduced, and the reheat coil adds heat to the supply air. In the third mode, the reheat coil adds additional heat to maintain the supply air temperature close to the return air temperature (100 % latent cooling). Project Outcomes Key Phase II objectives were to develop a pre-production version of the system and to demonstrate its performance in an actual house. The system was first tested in the laboratory and subsequently underwent field-testing at a new house in Gainesville, Florida. Field testing began in 2006 with monitoring of a 'conventional best practices' system that included a two stage air conditioner and Energy Star dehumidifier. In September 2007, the I-HVCD components were installed for testing. Both systems maintained uniform indoor temperatures, but indoor RH control was considerably better with the I-HVCD system. The daily variation from average indoor humidity conditions was less than 2 % for the I-HVCD vs. 5 - 7 % for the base case system. Data showed that the energy use of the two systems was comparable. Preliminary installed cost estimates suggest that production costs for the current I-HVCD integrated design would likely be lower than for competing systems that include a high efficiency <b>air</b> conditioner, <b>dehumidifier,</b> and fresh <b>air</b> ventilation system. Project Benefits This project verified that the I-HVCD refrigeration compacts are compact (for easy installation and retrofit) and can be installed with air conditioning equipment from a variety of manufacturers. Project results confirmed that the system can provide precise indoor temperature and RH control under a variety of climate conditions. The I-HVCD integrated approach offers numerous benefits including integrated control, easier installation, and reduced equipment maintenance needs. Work completed under this project represents a significant step towards product commercialization. Improved indoor RH control and fresh air ventilation are system attributes that will become increasingly important in the years ahead as building envelopes improve and sensible cooling loads continue to fall. Technologies like I-HVCD will be instrumental in meeting goals set by Building America and other programs to reduce energy use while improving the indoor environment. Next Steps The following steps are needed to bring the product to commercialization: (1) Value engineering to reduce costs; (2) Addition of zoning capability to improve marketability; (3) Fabrication and testing of additional prototypes; and (4) Identification of a manufacturer. Initial efforts to interest large air conditioner manufacturers has shown some interest, but the preferred path to market may be to employ a boutique manufacturer that markets to HVAC contractors. Distribution of the results of this work will improve opportunities for attracting manufacturers. Additional funding is needed to prepare the product for this final step...|$|R

Comprehensive use was defined as using at least five of eight ECPs: (i) <b>air</b> filter, (ii) <b>dehumidifier,</b> (iii) mattress cover, (iv) pillow cover, (v) pet avoidance, (vi) smoke avoidance, (vii) removing carpets, and (viii) washing sheets in hot water. Univariate and multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between comprehensive use of ECPs and receipt of preventive asthma care, as measured by number of routine asthma visits in the prior year and physician advice to modify the environment. Overall, 17 % (95 % CI: 14 - 19 %) of participants had comprehensive ECP use. The most commonly used practices were 'smoke avoidance' (85 %), 'pet avoidance' (59 %), and 'washing sheets in hot water' (46 %). Comprehensive use of ECPs was associated with having received physician advice [odds ratio (OR) 3. 1, 95 % CI: 2. 2 - 4. 4] and increased asthma visits (1 - 2 visits: OR 1. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 2. 4; 3 - 4 visits: OR 2. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 3. 8; = 5 visits: OR 2. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 5 - 4. 8). Only a minority of parents implement comprehensive ECPs, and receipt of preventive asthma care is associated with comprehensive use. Further research is needed to determine the factors mediating these associations in order to inform more effective asthma counseling. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{comprehensive}} secondary analysis of indoor household environmental exposures, socioeconomic and demographic confounding factors, and asthma in children. Data used in this research was accessed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey, National Asthma Survey. Previous literature has recognized asthma {{as one of the}} most prevalent conditions affecting children nationwide. While previous literature about the interrelationships and interactions between environmental exposures, socioeconomic, and demographic factors is growing, little is known about the significance of indoor household mold exposure. This survey interviewed 1193 participants aged 0 to 17 years of age, and 161 children were classified as having lifetime asthma, while 122 had current asthma. ?? 2 analyses and logistic regression analysis were used to determine potential contributing factors of lifetime and current asthma in the sample of 120 children. Logistic regression determined indoor household mold exposure (OR= 1. 37, p=. 021), air cleaners/purifiers (OR= 1. 85, p=. 001), and gas used for cooking (OR= 1. 91, p=. 006) to be statistically significant positive indicators of current asthma. For lifetime asthma, the same environmental exposures were found to be statistically significant and positive indicators: indoor household mold exposure (OR= 1. 33, p=. 032), air cleaners/purifiers (OR= 1. 75, p=. 001), and dehumidifiers (OR= 2. 11, p=. 0001) were all found to be statistically significant and positive correlates of lifetime asthma. Independent exposure to indoor household mold was a statistically significant correlate of both lifetime (OR= 1. 33, p=. 029) and current asthma (OR= 1. 38, p=. 015). Indoor household mold exposure was found to be statistically significant in the analyzed sample of NAS children, which could suggest that the <b>air</b> filters/purifiers and <b>dehumidifiers</b> used in participating households did not reduce exposure to particulates...|$|R
40|$|The global air {{temperature}} {{has increased by}} 0. 74 ± 0. 18 °C since 1905 and scientists have shown that CO 2 accounts for 55 percentages of the greenhouse gases. Global atmospheric CO 2 has been sharply increased since 1751, however the trend has slowed down in last fifty years in the Western Europe. UK and EU countries have singed the Kyoto agreement to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by a collective average of 12. 5 % below their 1990 levels by 2020. In the EU, 40 % of CO 2 emission comes from the residential energy consumption, in which the HVAC system accounts for 50 %, lighting accounts for 15 % and appliances 10 %. Hence, reducing the fossil-fuel consumption in residential energy by utilizing renewable energy is an effective method to achieve the Kyoto target. However, in the UK renewable energy only accounts for 2 % of the total energy consumption in 2005. A novel heat recovery/desiccant cooling system {{is driven by the}} solar collector and cooling tower to achieve low energy cooling with low CO 2 emission. This system is novel in the following ways: • Uses cheap fibre materials as the air-to-air heat exchanger, dehumidifier and regenerator core • Heat/mass fibre exchanger saves both sensible and latent heat from the exhaust <b>air</b> • The <b>dehumidifier</b> core with hexagonal surface could be integrated with windcowls/catchers draught • Utilises low electrical energy and therefore low CO 2 is released to the environment The cooling system consists of three main parts: heat/mass transfer exchanger, desiccant dehumidifier and regenerator. The fibre exchanger, dehumidifier and regenerator cores are the key parts of the technology. Owing to its proper pore size and porosity, fibre is selected out as the exchanger membrane to execute the heat/mass transfer process. Although the fibre is soft and difficult to keep the shape for long term running, its low price makes its frequent replacement feasible, which can counteract its disadvantages. A counter-flow air-to-air heat /mass exchanger was investigated and simulation and experimental results indicated that the fibre membranes soaked by desiccant solution showed the best heat and mass recovery effectiveness at about 89. 59 % and 78. 09 %, respectively. LiCl solution was selected as the working fluid in the dehumidifier and regenerator due to its advisable absorption capacity and low regeneration temperature. Numerical simulations and experimental testing were carried out to work out the optimal dehumidifier/regenerator structure, size and running conditions. Furthermore, the simulation results proved that the cooling tower was capable to service the required low temperature cooling water and the solar collector had the ability to offer the heating energy no lower than the regeneration temperature 60 ℃. The coefficient-of-performance of this novel heat recovery/desiccant cooling system is proved to be as high as 13. 0, with a cooling capacity of 5. 6 kW when the system is powered by renewable energy. This case is under the pre-set conditions that the environment {{air temperature}} is 36 ℃ and relative humidity is 50 % (cities such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Spain and Thailand, etc). Hence, this system is very useful for a hot/humid climate with plenty of solar energy. The theoretical modelling consisted of four numerical models is proved by experiments to predict the performance of the system within acceptable errors. Economic analysis based on a case (200 m 2 working office in London) indicated that the novel heat recovery/desiccant cooling system could save 5134 kWh energy as well as prevent 3123 kg CO 2 emission per year compared to the traditional HVAC system. Due to the flexible nature of the fibre, the capital and maintenance cost of the novel cooling system is higher than the traditional HVAC system, but its running cost are much lower than the latter. Hence, the novel heat recovery/desiccant cooling system is cost effective and environment friendly technology. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
