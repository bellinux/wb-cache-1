5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Patricia's effects in Mexico were tremendous; however, the affected areas were predominantly rural, mitigating a potential large-scale disaster.

Total damage {{was estimated to be}} in excess of 5.4billion pesos (US$323.3million), with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses.

5|$|Thus {{while other}} European sovereigns were {{building}} luxurious, modern Renaissance and Baroque palaces, politics {{and common sense}} demanded that the palace of the Monegasque rulers be fortified.

Indeed, when its fortifications were finally relaxed during the late 18th century, it was seized by the French <b>and</b> <b>stripped</b> of its treasures, and fell into decline, while the Grimaldi were exiled for over 20 years.|$|E
