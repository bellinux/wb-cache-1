40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) This {{research}} {{sought to}} explain how sculptural forms, artistic and curatorial practices might have developed in response to iconoclasm and counter-iconoclasm. It is my contention that sculpture has historically been shaped by the ideas of Iconoclasm and, what I have somewhat awkwardly termed, Counter-Iconoclasm as much as by any technique or material. A series of 'creative' works were made and tested through exhibition in the Fine Art mode throughout my candidature. An agnostic approach and the terminology counter-iconoclasm was adopted in order to bypass the highly polarised theological discourse on idolatry. Iconoclasm was thus treated as any other mode of cultural behaviour. The agnostic approach enabled issues of theology and ecclesiology {{to be treated as}} examples of political ideology. The agnostic approach also opened up consideration {{of the ways in which}} sculpture and iconoclasm and countericonoclasm are learned and promulgated. Hence the role of Happy Toys, Barbies and Bratz are able to be recognised. The exhibition Busted presents the historical process by which a new genre of sculpture has emerged despite recent outbreaks of iconoclasm and the resurgence of iconoclastic ideologies. The new genre presented is the styling head. A genre of polychrome plastic sculpture busts with nylon hair sold as educational and entertaining toys for girls. Although the genre is ostensibly secular, its forms defer to or comply with <b>a</b> series of <b>theological</b> <b>rules</b> and often reference historic sculpture which had a religious function. The new genre raises the possibility that girls who grow up to experience secular polychrome figurative sculpture as normal will be able to emerge as a generation of sculptors and consumers of sculpture able to make and support figurative sculpture freed from theocratic rules...|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>theological</b> {{bioethics}} needs, first, <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> politics. The {{thesis of}} this essay rests on {{the claim that the}} contours of <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> politics are found in the nature of sacramental practices. More specifically, <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> politics of medicine is found in the sacramental practice of anointing of the sick. Anointing provides <b>a</b> radically <b>theological</b> hermeneutic—a theologically robust vision for interpreting medicine that, if enacted, can powerfully make real God 2 ̆ 7 s work in the world. Such a vision is embodied in one particular twentieth-century exemplar—the organization called Partners In Health (PIH) and its cofounder, Paul Farmer. Farmer and PIH, I argue, live the théologie and theological politics of medicine embodied in the practice of anointing. What is more, they show—against those who would accuse such an approach of being naively idealistic—that such <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> politics is possible, powerful, and can even change the world...|$|R
