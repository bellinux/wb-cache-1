40|$|Xu's (2008) paper {{inspired}} us {{to investigate}} the relationship between exchange rate and trade deficit. Based on economic theories, if a country does not interfere its exchange rate and allows it be totally flexible in the market, the exchange rate should have long-run (cointegrate) and short-run (causality) relationships with the trade deficits. After our research, {{we found out that}} there was no cointegrating and causality between China, Japan <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea's</b> exchange rate <b>and</b> their trade deficit with the U. S. Since China's exchange rate was well known for fixing or pegging with other countries' currencies, Japan <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea's</b> data couldn't prove they had a flexible exchange rate. There must be other factors not included in our study. Just based on exchange rates and trade deficits, we have to conclude that China, Japan <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea's</b> government influence their exchange rates by excessively holding U. S. dollars as their foreign currency reserves. All three countries had an unfair advantage on their export with the U. S., which caused the U. S. trade deficit to grow continuously...|$|R
