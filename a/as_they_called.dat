Now in regard of the universal there happened little that did not first or last arrive here... And those news-mongers, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> them, did not only take the boldness to weigh the public but most intrinsic actions of the state, which some courtier or other did betray to this society.|$|E
5|$|The various dissidents {{formed a}} pro-Thi, anti-Kỳ {{organization}} called the Military-Civilian Struggle Committee, {{better known as the}} Struggle Movement. Their message and influence quickly spread <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> for the end of military rule and took over radio stations and government buildings in I Corps. They intensified their calls for Kỳ to fulfil his promise to hold democratic elections. Some I Corps units supportive of Thi then decided to join the Struggle Movement and ceased military operations against the Vietcong, instead starting a stand-off against Kỳ. Throughout April and May there were tense incidents as units loyal to the junta were flown in from Saigon, and the factions came close to warfare.|$|E

25|$|Robert Antoine Pinchon {{was born}} into an artistic and {{literary}} environment. His father, Robert Pinchon, a librarian, journalist, playwright and drama critic, was an intimate friend of Guy de Maupassant and also became a close protege of Gustave Flaubert. Maupassant and Robert Pinchon (La Tôque, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> him) co-wrote in 1875 a script for a play entitled A la Feuille de Rose, Maison Turque, {{on the subject of}} eroticism and prostitution. The piece was presented officially on 15 May 1877 at the studio of Maurice Leloir, in front of Gustave Flaubert, Émile Zola, Ivan Turgenev and eight elegantly dressed masked women.|$|E

There are also several other private colleges, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> formally in Greece, as the establishment of private universities is prohibited by the constitution. Many of them are accredited by a foreign state or university such as the American College of Greece and the Athens Campus of the University of Indianapolis.|$|E

500|$|While {{attending}} {{early morning}} prayers {{at the church}} of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, William Kent and Fanny met Richard Parsons, the officiating clerk. [...] Although he was generally considered respectable, Parsons was known locally as a drunk and was struggling to provide for his family. [...] He listened to the couple's plight and was sympathetic, offering them the use of lodgings in his home on Cock Lane, {{to the north of}} St Sepulchre's. [...] Located along a narrow, winding thoroughfare similar to most of central London's streets, the three-storey house was in a respectable but declining area, and comprised a single room on each floor, connected by a winding staircase. Shortly after Mr and Mrs Kent (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> themselves) moved in, Kent loaned Parsons 12guineas, to be repaid at a rate of a guinea per month.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1570s, there was open discontent among the less wealthy {{members of the}} Stationers' Company about Day's {{extensive}} patents. He was compelled {{to go to court}} against printers who pirated works to which he owned the rights. Among those brought to trial was Roger Ward, who admitted to pirating 10,000 copies of ABC with Catechisms in a font which imitated Day's. Day's former apprentice and sub-contractor John Wolfe admitted in court that he had pirated The Whole Booke of Psalmes but justified his actions on the grounds that Day's monopolies were a restraint of trade. It was Wolfe who led a group of [...] "poor printers", <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> themselves, in a campaign against the patents in the late 1570s. As a result of an official investigation, Day was eventually obliged to concede certain titles to the Company {{for the benefit of the}} poorer printers, but he kept the titles he printed most.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{seeing the}} Hitman {{franchise}} reduced to its core elements, the development team saw a Lara Croft Tomb Raider version as an obvious next step (or <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> it, a [...] "go-brainer"). The team consisted of ten people (on average) {{who were able}} to work closely and nimbly, similar to an indie development team. They fit Lara Croft in the Hitman Go setting and knew to change elements like less focus on assassinating foes, less board game aesthetic, more animations, and more emphasis on environment than enemies. The team chose the classic Tomb Raider visual design over that of the series reboot, but reconstructed that series aesthetic from memory rather than from its actual design documents. They sought to recreate the moments of being chased by a giant animal or boulder. In place of time restraints, like the quick time events from the series, the developers added floors that crack with each successive turn to give a sense of time-based urgency.|$|E

500|$|Starting on the {{electric}} piano, Charles played what felt right: {{a series of}} riffs, switching then to a regular piano for four choruses backed up by a unique Latin conga tumbao rhythm on drums. The song changed when Charles began singing simple, improvised unconnected verses ("Hey Mama don't you treat me wrong / Come and love your daddy all night long / All right now / Hey hey / All right"). Charles used gospel elements in a twelve-bar blues structure. Some of the first lines ("See the gal with the red dress on / She can do the Birdland all night long") are influenced by a boogie-woogie style that Ahmet Ertegun attributes to Clarence [...] "Pinetop" [...] Smith who used to call out to dancers {{on the dance floor}} instructing what to do through his lyrics. In the middle of the song, however, Charles indicated that the Raelettes should repeat what he was doing, and the song transformed into a call and response between Charles, the Raelettes, and the horn section in the orchestra <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> out to each other in ecstatic shouts and moans and blasts from the horns.|$|E
