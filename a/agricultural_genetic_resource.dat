40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{develops}} {{an economic}} model {{of investment in}} the conservation of <b>agricultural</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources.</b> For a putative national decision maker investing in conservation across species, it proposes an approach of maximization of returns from conservation subject to a budget constraint. Returns are {{a function of the}} value of the conserved resources and the costs of conservation. The value of the resources depends on both supply and demand factors, both domestically and internationally. Demand factors include the current domestic and international of values of the production of different species, adjusted for trend changes. National capacity to exploit <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> is also proposed as a consideration. Supply factors include the amount of unique genetic variability at the national level, the rate of its loss, “genetic erosion”, and the amount of available internationally conserved genetic variability.

5|$|The {{implications}} of crop diversity are at {{both local and}} world levels. Global organizations that aim to support diversity include Bioversity International (formerly known as International Plant <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> Institute), the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative, and the International Network for Improvement of Banana and Plantain. Members of the United Nations, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002 at Johannesburg, said that crop diversity {{is in danger of}} being lost if measures are not taken. One such step taken in the action against the loss of biodiversity among crops is gene banking. There are a number of organizations that enlist teams of local farmers to grow native varieties, particularly those that are threatened by extinction due to lack of modern-day use. There are also local, national and international efforts to preserve <b>agricultural</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> through off-site methods such as seed and sperm banks for further research and crop breeding.|$|R

40|$|World {{population}} {{increased at}} a tremendous pace during the 20 Century when the fastest billion {{was added to}} the human population. Increase in population certainly requires extra land and water resources for urbanization, industrialization and agriculture. This extra pressure on land and water resources is already placing the environment under threat. Therefore, the development of modern biotechnology has produced crops resistant to both biotic and abiotic stress. On the other hand, products produced with the biotechnological method show this method to be a proven, fast and steady mechanism for improvement and increase of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> in agriculture. In vitro techniques of plant cell, tissue and organ cultures are no longer novel to us. Hence, we are in a good position to discuss the relevance of wide agricultural biodiversity, where the importance of sophisticated biotechnology is strictly related to increasing and improving <b>agricultural</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources.</b> Thus, somatic embryogenesis, through another culture in pepper, is an effective method for obtaining the haploid and doublehaploid homozygote.

We also investigate the dynamic effects of claims on behalf of farmers on the profits of private crop breeders whose output is newly protected by patents. We show that the choices about patent life and licensing share that optimize worldwide dynamic social welfare can be quite different from the values that maximize steady-state social welfare. Further, recognition of farmers' rights entails a dynamic welfare loss to producers and consumers that is not revealed in a comparative-statics analysis.

40|$|European seed {{policies}} and legislation {{have contributed to}} fostering {{a system in which}} fewer varieties are traded in ever bigger markets in accordance with the law of economy of scale. Informal seed systems have been marginalised and perceived as outdated in a scenario in which the agricultural system was being modernised. In 1998, however, the European Union recognised the need to conserve <b>agricultural</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> and created a catalogue specially for registering what it called ‘conservation varieties’.

This article sets out to address these questions by analysing the concept of conservation variety from when the phrase was coined up to the recent European directive 62 / 2008. After describing and evaluating the impact that the directive may have, Italian regulation on conservation varieties will be analysed focusing on synergies and diversities. &# 13; Lastly, {{in the light of the}} International Treaty on <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> for Food and Agriculture, attention will turn to the regulations in order to verify how they correspond...|$|R

40|$|In industrialized countries, the {{proliferation}} of intellectual property rights (IPRs) that relate to biotechnologies, genes and plants has been dubbed an 'anti-commons' tragedy. Their extension to developing countries presents an even bigger concern, as the IPR models of the industrialized world might not cater {{for the needs of}} developing nations. Pressures to adopt IPRs arise primarily from trade instruments, rather than from the desire to support innovation in these countries. Private ownership of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> also conflicts with widely held traditions in farming communities that 'seeds' should be freely shared. As early as the 1980 s, worries about the concentration of power in the seed and pharmaceutical sectors were linked to the control of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources.</b> This resulted in these resources being brought under state sovereignty by the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992), allowing countries to regulate access to these <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> within their borders and negotiate a share of the benefits that arise from their use. It also stimulated the recognition of the rights of farmers and traditional healers, who developed and now maintain these resources within these countries. A dilemma is now arising as countries start to develop and implement legislation on access and benefit sharing. These laws seem to be contributing to an anti-commons situation instead of reversing it; as stakeholders can veto access, transaction costs are skyrocketing, and laws could lead to preferential access by large multinational companies, which can promise the highest benefits. Groups that oppose the legal enclosure of genetic materials through IPRs have, paradoxically, promoted the development of mechanisms that keep even more materials out of the public domain. So far, this has led to a decline in exchange, while the benefits for farmers have been minimal. The International Treaty on Plant <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> for Food and Agriculture (2004) attempts to address some of these concerns. Its multilateral system facilitates access and benefit sharing, reducing transaction costs and regaining some aspects of common access and use. A major task at the first session of its governing body in June 2006 will be to design rules for implementation that create significant benefits, while supporting the conservation and sustainable use of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources,</b> as well as farmers' rights. In addition, strategies from the patent system that keep technologies available to farmers could be adapted and built into biodiversity laws to suit the exchange of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources.</b> These could include broad humanitarian license systems (as pioneered by the Generation Challenge Programme), joint IPR strategies that are followed by public universities (as developed by the Public Intellectual Property Resource for Agriculture), and open-source strategies (as initiated by CAMBIA). Seeking to maximize benefits for access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> by using either IPRs or access laws will not support equity among nations or improve the livelihoods of those in developing countries...|$|R

At it's 16 th Session in September 2004, the <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> Policy Committee (GRPC) of the CGIAR recommended that the CGIAR’s System-wide <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> Programme (SGRP) and the Centres work together to determine the scope of microorganisms relevant to food and agriculture, {{as a first step}} in analyzing policy on access, use and conservation of culture collections within the CGIAR system and outside.

40|$|The {{concept of}} 'sustainable development' as {{used by the}} Brundtland Commission was meant to {{separate}} environmental policy from distributional conflicts. Increases in income sometimes are beneficial for the environment (for instance, they allow the use of domestic cooking fuels which in some ways are less damaging to the environment), but higher incomes have meant higher emissions of greenhouse gases, and higher rates of genetic erosion. In {{the aftermath of the}} Rio conference of June 1992, this article analyses some unavoidable links between distributional conflicts and environmental policy. Often, environmental movements have tried to keep environmental resources and services outside the market, but there are now attempts to establish property rights on, and to give money values to environmental resources and services, such as <b>agricultural</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> and the CO 2 absorption facility provided by the oceans and new vegetation. European 'green' proposals to impose an 'eco-tax', and proposals from India to create a world market for CO 2 emission permits are considered. The issue raised by the growing Third World agroecology movement, of payment of 'farmers' rights' for in situ agricultural biodiversity is discussed. The article includes a short discussion of the North American free trade agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico and the USA, in so far as it involves so-called 'ecological dumping', i. e. trading at values which do not include environmental costs. In the last sections, the article asks how prices in ecologically-extended markets would be formed, how much such prices will depend on distribution, and how much (or how little) such payments would change distribution of income. Environmental movements of the Poor are faced with the dilemma of keeping environmental resources and services out of the market, or else asking for property rights to be placed on them. property rights, environmental movements, greenhouse effect, agricultural biodiversity, environmental policy, poverty and environment, ecological debt...|$|R

However, the IU was reliant {{on the principle}} of <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> being the common heritage of humanity. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) (1993) brought <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of national governments.

40|$|What is {{intellectual}} property? ACP {{countries are}} responding to global pressure {{to develop and implement}} policies on intellectual property (IP) to protect ideas and innovations to facilitate global access and trade. IP is an idea that, when expressed in a tangible form, can be protected by law. The owners, both inventors and investors, are granted rights by a state under varying agreements and periods of time so that they can reap the rewards of their investments. The granting of intellectual property rights (IPRs) can help to balance public and private sector interests in that the invention must be disclosed publicly. Technically, it can assist the public good because it allows others to improve upon the invention, after the termination of the monopoly rights, or to develop competing products. However, there is an ongoing international debate about whether the harmonized IPR regimes being promoted benefit technological leaders as opposed to technological followers - mainly developing countries. The concept of IP is not new; it dates back to medieval guilds in Europe. In many developed countries, the legislative framework to support IP is very strong, in the United States it is codified in the Constitution. In agriculture, the concept of IP is well established, including patents (e. g. on farm machinery), copyright on information products, plant breeders´ rights (PBRs) and geographical indications (GIs). Patents : A patent is an exclusive right granted to an inventor. Once issued, a patent gives the inventor the legal right to create a limited monopoly by excluding others from creating, producing, selling or importing the invention. This right is of limited duration, for a minimum period of 20 years from the date of filing the patent application. In exchange for the right of exclusion, the inventor must disclose all details describing the invention, so that when the 20 -year patent right expires, the public may have the opportunity to develop and profit from the use of the invention. Plant breeders´ rights (PBRs), or plant variety protection (PVP), allow for the protection of new plant varieties for a term of 20 years (25 for tree crops). A country can develop its own system of protection, referred to as a sui generis system, i. e. a system of rights designed to fit a particular context and need that is a unique alternative to standard patent protection. PVP versus patents Patents are granted provided the invention is novel (new), is non-obvious to one skilled in the field and has a utility (use). Patents allow protection of plant genes, rather than just the plant, and to control the use of the genetic material of a number of plants for multiple uses such as pharmaceuticals, pest protection, herbicide resistance, oil production, etc. PVP is less expensive than patents and simpler for both applicants and administrators; hence they tend to be favoured by developing countries. PVP allows for two important exclusions that patents do not: (a) farmer saved seed, and (b) an exemption for research use. Both patents and PVP are enforceable only in the countries for which protection is granted. Copyright gives authors legal protection to benefit from the sale of published material of their expressions of their ideas contained in a selected format, e. g. books, journals and CD-ROMs. The right extends {{for the life of the}} author plus 50 to 70 years. Geographical indications (GIs) identify a good as originating from a particular region or territory which ascribes to it a particular quality that distinguishes it from a similar good produced in another locality. International agreements The main international agreements that impact intellectual property are highlighted below: WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) The TRIPS Agreement, adopted in 1994, requires that ´patents shall be available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology´. However, it allows countries to exclude from protection ´plants and animals other than micro-organisms´. It does require that countries provide for the protection of plant varieties either by patents or by an effective sui generis system (i. e. PVP) or both. The TRIPS Agreement permits countries some flexibility in the precise form and the extent of protection. Nonetheless, it promotes the fundamental idea of extending IPRs to <b>agricultural</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources.</b> The general objectives of the TRIPS Agreement are the protection and enforcement of IPRs, the promotion of technological innovation and the transfer and dissemination of technology. Under this Agreement a WTO member must be non-discriminatory and extend the same treatment to all other members that it affords one member. Most developing countries are opposed to the use of patent systems in agriculture. International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) The UPOV Convention was signed in 1961, entered into force in 1968 and was then revised several times, in 1972, 1978 and 1991. This Convention allows countries to protect plant variety by patents. As of mid- 2004, the UPOV Convention had been ratified by 55 states, including a number of developing countries. Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) The CBD entered into force in 1993 and establishes countries´ sovereignty and right to control access to <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> and biodiversity. The CBD also promotes the sharing of benefits (monetary and other) derived from the use of natural (including genetic) resources/biodiversity in areas such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. It contains statements promoting the granting of more favourable IPR terms, particularly patents, to promote fair and equitable benefit sharing and recognizes the right to respect, preserve and maintain indigenous knowledge systems. Some developing countries view the CBD as revisiting the terms of the WTO, but this is a source of controversy. International Treaty on Plant <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> for Food and Agriculture This treaty, which entered into force on 29 June 2004, focuses on <b>agricultural</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> - access to and sharing of the benefits derived from them. The treaty is concerned with preserving the <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> developed by poor farmers and maintaining access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> for international public research. ACP countries are required to meet their obligations under these agreements and as such may need to amend, update and/or draft IP legislation. Technical and legal assistance and support for capacity building in these areas are also required to facilitate national policy development. The WTO´s emphasis on science-based regulatory standards as in the area of biotechnology will require strengthening of the underlying scientific capacity of developing countries. Access to technological developments such as biotechnology and collaboration with public or private sector institutions in other countries, such as the US, Europe or Japan, require an understanding of and the capacity to manage intellectual property in order to encourage investment and ensure benefit sharing through cooperative agreements. As noted, there is tension between the ´North and South´ with respect to the international instruments for IPR (TRIPS versus the CBD). In the past, it was possible to address the policy issues using a bottom-up approach: building a hands-on understanding of IPR and related policies, e. g. biosafety in the context of facilitating access to biotechnology. This was done through engagement of developing countries in these issues as they arose in the collaborative technology development process. Thus IPR and biosafety were part of the process of building access to a particular biotechnology application of national interest, rather than being seen as solely external issues that served the interests of one country or multinational company. With the pressure of compliance with these international IPR agreements, there is likely to be a top-down environment for policy development with politics playing a much bigger role. As was evident during the negotiations on the Biosafety Protocol, some developing countries came to the negotiations without having held broad discussions at the national level. In some cases, national representatives had little knowledge of the status of biotechnology research and regulations in their countries. Given limited resources, what then should be done to build the underlying scientific and technical capacity to contribute to the policy dialogue, development and implementation of IPR, to ensure the effective participation of ACP scientists in international negotiations and, simultaneously, to enhance their contribution to developing national systems to protect and support inventions and innovation?

At each site, 10 randomly selected farmers were interviewed. Useful indigenous woody species were common in cultivated fields in the two agroecological zones of the state. Farmers identified poor soil as second major production constraint after cash/credit in their farming systems. Combinations with maize, cassava and yams, ranged from 4 % frequency of Discorea/Cajanus in home gardens to 37 % Zea/Cajanus in distant farms. Farmers rated the plant as {{the second most important}} vegetable protein after cowpea. In Esan LGA, it is the preferred grain legume. Seven uses of pigeon pea were rated from food (100 %) to cover crop (5 %). Desirable traits of pigeon pea in order of priority were-faster cooking varieties, high yielding varieties, pest resistant varieties, day neutral varieties and varieties suitable for home gardens. The potential of pigeon pea for planted fallow is high in the northern zone due to its cultural, economic, nutritional and <b>agricultural</b> importance. <b>Genetic</b> <b>resources</b> management and fallow technology research will facilitate the adoption and spread of pigeon pea in planted fallows in Edo State...|$|R
40|$|Conservation and {{utilization}} of mungbean genetic resourcesCurrently 1, 024 mungbean germplasm accessions consisted of 142 local and 833 introduced varieties, 32 promising lines, and 17 commercial varieties are being maintained in the National Genebank at Indonesian Center for <b>Agricultural</b> Biotechnology and <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> Research and Development. The seeds of mungbean germplasm are preserved in {{two types of}} invironment. The active collections are maintained at 15 – 18 C as short-term storage, while the base collections are kept at - 5 C as mid-term storage. A wide range of variability was observed for all the agronomic characters studied, especially for days to maturity, plant height, pods per plant, and seed size. Germplasm evaluation has identified several resistance sources. One accession (V 4281) was resistant to beanflies, three accessions were resistant to cercospora leaf spot, and six accessions were resistant to powdery mildew. The variation for protein content of germplasm was not very broad. Two accessions (VR 290 and VR 194) had the highest protein content of 30 %, respectively. Germplasm evaluation also obtained four accessions which had largest seed size and good seed quality. Utilization of mungbean <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> has made a significant contribution on mungbean breeding program.

In order to develop integrated weed management program, a research to select competitive rice lines to E. crus-galli was conducted in a green house of Indonesian Centre of <b>Agricultural</b> Biotechnology and <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resource</b> Research and Development Bogor. The research design was split plot with four replications, E. crus-galli was designed as the main plot (rice without E. crus-galli compared  rice with four E. crus-galli per pot), and the sub-plots were 25 genotypes (23 lines, 1 tolerant variety and 1 sensitive variety). Level of tolerance {{was determined by the}} reduction percentage of grains weight, the number of productive tillers and dry matter weight. The results showed that rice competition with E. crus-galli reduced plant height, productive tiller numbers, filled spikelet numbers per panicle, dry matter weight and dry grain weight. Three lines, i. e., IR 10 L- 155, IR 10 L- 133 and BIO-R 84 - 1 were classified as tolerant, 19 lines were moderate and 3 lines were sensitive to E. crus-galli competition.

40|$|In <b>agricultural</b> research, plant <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> (PGR) are “non-traditional infrastructural resources”, {{which may}} {{generate}} higher social value and positive externalities {{if they are}} managed in an openly accessible manner. The privatisation of crop biodiversity {{is based on the}} assumption that the internalisation of these externalities is the panacea to fostering private research investment. However, if the domestic plant breeding and biotechnology capacity is limited, the above normative approach may fall short of expectations because the social costs of establishing or strengthening exclusion rights are higher than their social benefits. The International Treaty on Plant <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) is the only international agreement whose normative approach reflects in part this economic reality. However, its constructively ambiguous intellectual property rights-related provisions do not effectively fence off crop biodiversity from private appropriation. Besides, the desire of most countries not to prejudice the negotiation of an international access and benefit sharing regime under the UN Convention of Biological Diversity may prevent the extension of the ITPGRFA’s “commons” management principles to a larger number of essential food crops. The scope of this study, which focuses on PGR and agricultural innovation, derives from the paramount importance that both the design and allocation of rights in these areas might have for global food security. The innovation system perspective shows that social and economic development depends on the institutional context in which technological change occurs. Finally, the study of the transition between property regimes shows that the global reform of the institutional arrangements, which govern the present and future allocation of wealth from agriculture, is insufficient to achieve international equity so as to meet the target of reducing the proportion of people who suffer from hunger in accordance with goal 1 of the Millennium Development Goals.

40|$|Winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) is an {{herbaceous}} multipurpose legume {{grown in}} {{hot and humid}} countries as a pulse, vegetable (leaves and pods), or root tuber crop depending on local consumption preferences. In addition to its different nutrient‐rich edible parts which could contribute to food and nutritional security, it is an efficient nitrogen fixer {{as a component of}} sustainable <b>agricultural</b> systems. Generating <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> and improved lines would help to accelerate the breeding improvement of this crop, as the lack of improved cultivars adapted to specific environments {{has been one of the}} limitations preventing wider use. A transcriptomic de novo assembly was constructed from four tissues: leaf, root, pod, and reproductive tissues from Malaysian accessions, comprising of 198, 554 contigs with a N 50 of 1462 bp. Of these, 138, 958 (70. 0 %) could be annotated. Among 9682 genic simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs identified (excluding monomer repeats), trinucleotide‐repeats were the most abundant (4855), followed by di‐nucleotide (4500) repeats. A total of 18 SSR markers targeting di‐ and tri‐nucleotide repeats have been validated as polymorphic markers based on an initial assessment of nine genotypes originated from five countries. A cluster analysis revealed provisional clusters among this limited, yet diverse selection of germplasm.

Growth performance and survival rates of local guinea fowl varieties were recorded in three zones of Benin: Collines, Atacora and Borgou. Seven varieties, Gray, Common, Bonaparte, White, Black, Isabelle and Multicolored, were identified in Benin. The farmers choose a variety to be raised based on breeding system, agro-ecological zone, disease resistance, market price and production purpose. Bonaparte, Common and Gray varieties emerged as the most resistant whereas White, Black and Gray outperformed in growth and may be used for breeding purposes. The semi-confinement system could be recommended for startup as a temporary solution to improve production of local guinea fowls in Benin. The existence of several varieties on farms does not encourage genetic conservation and improvement of these resources. Establishing selection or crossbreeding programs in controlled environments would be more appropriate for guinea fowls raised in Benin. Peer reviewe...|$|R
