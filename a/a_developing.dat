Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00UTC on October22, featuring prominent outflow, well-defined banding features, and <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> eye. Data from Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia to have reached Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00UTC.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Andres was {{the first}} named storm and {{hurricane}} of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. Forming on June 21, Andres gradually intensified as it tracked along the Mexican coastline. Deep convection developed around the center of circulation and by June23, the storm attained hurricane-status, peaking with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Upon attaining this intensity, the storm featured <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> eyewall within a central dense overcast. Within 36hours, the storm rapidly degenerated, having most of the convection being displaced by high wind shear, becoming a non-tropical trough during the afternoon of June24.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} week of December, a frontal trough stalled south of Bermuda. An upper level {{disturbance}} moved over the area on December 9, and produced widespread convection along the frontal wave. The system moved to the northeast, and based on <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> circulation within the convection, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as a subtropical storm on December 12 while located 275miles (440km) northeast of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|The storm rapidly {{weakened}} as {{it continued}} northward, and degenerated into a tropical depression by July 20. The weak depression moved through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, maintaining a well-defined cloud signature.

This rare phenomenon occurred due to interaction with <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> trough and its associated baroclinic zone.|$|E

5|$|A {{cluster of}} {{thunderstorms}} developed over Florida in late May. A shortwave trough {{brought it to}} the northeast, enhancing convection around <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> center of circulation. The low pressure area, which formed on May31, developed into a subtropical depression on June1. Operationally, it was treated as a frontal low, but post-analysis suggested it remained separate throughout its lifetime, and was classified as an unnamed subtropical storm. It reached subtropical storm strength six hours later as it moved rapidly parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The convection continued to wrap around the center, and despite unfavorable conditions from an approaching cold front it continued to intensify. Late on June1, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) while off the coast of North Carolina. The storm turned to the east, and transitioned extratropical late on June2 southeast of Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of the storm merged with a cold front.|$|E
5|$|A second Chera Kingdom (c. 800–1102), {{also known}} as Kulasekhara dynasty of Mahodayapuram (present-day Kodungallur), was {{established}} by Kulasekhara Varman, which ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu. During {{the early part of}} the Kulasekara period, the southern region from Nagerkovil to Thiruvalla was ruled by Ay kings, who lost their power in the 10th century, making the region a part of the Kulasekara empire. Under Kulasekhara rule, Kerala witnessed <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. A Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils, became linguistically separate during this period around the seventh century. For local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Naduvazhis, with each province comprising a number of Desams under the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis.|$|E
5|$|A strong upper-level trough {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated {{that it did not}} have the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E
