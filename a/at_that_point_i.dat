25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E

500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "When I say things, I think people believe me so much that they take it a different way — it's, like, not rap anymore <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> say some great things about him in the book I have coming out [...] — that's wasn't a cheap plug," [...] he laughed. [...] "He's gonna be embarrassed, I said some really great things about him and people's perception of him. But it is what it is, he took it that wrong way, and I didn't know I said anything wrong!" ...|$|E
500|$|It was '97 and I {{was leaving}} my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's {{what he would}} say to me.

500|$|The album {{ends with}} [...] "The Tourist", which Jonny Greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece where {{something}} [...] "doesn't have to happen... every three seconds." [...] He said, [...] "'The Tourist' doesn't sound like Radiohead at all. It {{has become a}} song with space." [...] The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it {{was chosen as the}} closing track because [...] "a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast {{and not being able to}} keep up. It was really obvious to have 'Tourist' as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, 'Idiot, slow down.' Because <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> needed to. So that was the only resolution there could be: to slow down." [...] The [...] "unexpectedly bluesy waltz" [...] draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell.|$|E
500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. I noticed that the No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just about the time the aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> thought he was going to come back to the airport." ...|$|E
500|$|She is {{also known}} for {{changing}} her physical appearance for each album by altering her mode of dress or hairstyle, creating a unique aesthetic that extends to {{all aspects of the}} album, from the album art to the live performances. She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album. Around the time of To Bring You My Love, for example, Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances. Her former fashion style, which consisted of simple black leggings, turtleneck sweaters and Doc Martens boots, was replaced by ballgowns, catsuits, wigs and excessive make-up. She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust-style flashlight microphone. She denied the influence of drag, Kabuki or performance art on her new image, a look she affectionately dubbed [...] "Joan Crawford on acid" [...] in an interview with Spin in 1996, but admitted that [...] "it's that combination of being quite elegant and funny and revolting, all at the same time, that appeals to me. I actually find wearing make-up like that, sort of smeared around, as extremely beautiful. Maybe that's just my twisted sense of beauty." [...] However, she later told Dazed & Confused magazine, [...] "that was kind of a mask. It was much more of a mask than I've ever had. I was very lost as a person, <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> had no sense of self left at all", and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the To Bring You My Love tour.|$|E
6000|$|At 12.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphed me as follows: [...] "There {{has been}} much hard {{fighting}} this morning.

5000|$|By one account, Cavanaugh was {{attending}} a lecture by Meredith L. Jones, curator of worms at the Smithsonian Institution, shortly after {{she began her}} graduate studies. Jones was discussing the giant tube worm, a creature lacking both mouth and gut, where the challenge was to understand how it survived. Jones mentioned elemental sulfur crystals within the worms gut; Cavanaugh states that [...] "It was <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> jumped up and said, 'Well, it's perfectly clear! They must have sulphur-oxidising bacteria inside their bodies'". Jones apparently told her to sit down, but provided Cavanaugh with a specimen captured by a research submarine working {{on the bottom of}} the Pacific Ocean. Cavanaugh eventually substantiated her case.|$|R
5000|$|Hell, I kick myself now, because I'm getting great press {{being more}} cooperative, and I {{could have had}} a {{trillion}} more endorsements, but that wasn't my driving force. The problem was, when I tried to give in a little bit, it never got better. I knew I {{was in the midst of}} that image, and <b>I</b> determined <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was never going to get out of it.|$|R
500|$|The album's first song, [...] "Tired of Sex", {{written before}} {{the release of}} the Blue Album, has Cuomo {{describing}} meaningless sex encounters with groupies, reciting his list of encounters and wondering why true love eludes him. [...] "Across the Sea" [...] was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan: [...] "When I got the letter, I fell in love with her. It was such a great letter. I was very lonely at the time, {{but at the same time}} I was very depressed that I would never meet her." [...] Second single [...] "The Good Life" [...] chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote the song after [...] "becoming frustrated with that hermit's life I was leading, the ascetic life. And I think I was starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And so I wrote the song. And I started to turn around and come back the other way." [...] Lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] addresses Cuomo's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard; he explained that the song [...] "is more about me, because <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> hadn't even talked to the girl, I didn't really know much about her." [...] The album's final single, [...] "Pink Triangle", describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.|$|E
500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E

40|$|Published in The Chronicle Newspaper of 2013 on the {{productivity}} column. The issue of capacity utilization became a spotlight issue {{during and after}} the economic decline that bedeviled the Zimbabwean productive sector in the years running to 2008. Many figures of percentage utilization were talked about but did someone stop to say that those really are the utilization figures that people should be talking about. It is <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel organizations and the nation at large should know what capacity they have. This will enhance plans for economic revival and its associated growth. Having capacity means a connected network of functional systems that are capable of producing per unit time. The interdependency is also critical. Hence {{it is not enough to}} define capacity by what a single machine or worker can produce...|$|R
40|$|When I was fifteen, I {{was having}} {{serious doubts about}} the {{existence}} of a supernatural entity benevolently looking over me, and—perhaps even more disturbingly—about the possibility of an afterlife in which I would again see my friends and relatives and exist happily ever after.

Almost immediately, from the knee down, all the feeling was gone in my right leg. The endorphins had kicked in, and I was not in pain." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} October 1969, Griffiths, who was {{the sole}} married {{occupant}} of the communal group's home and also was raising a child (born in December 1968), left the group. [...] His responsibilities created friction, mainly between Griffiths' wife, Evans, and manager Collins. Griffiths later said: [...] "Tommy [...] created the bad blood. He'd convinced the others that [...] {{not one of the}} boys any more". Drummer Gibbins remembered that he wasn't even consulted about the decision: [...] "I was considered a nothinghead <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> wasn't even worth conversing with".|$|E
2500|$|On April 4, 2004, Kean again {{stated that}} the September 11 attacks could have been prevented, saying that the United States {{government}} should have acted sooner to dismantle al-Qaeda and responded more quickly to other terrorist threats.

Should we have sent a cruise missile into a site where he was <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point?</b> <b>I</b> think those early opportunities are clear. We had him. We saw him.

"Then when I heard Nixon {{talk about}} it, he said {{open up the}} borders, the {{consumers}} should be represented there ultimately and strengthen the military and get the government off our backs.

2500|$|Big Black's first {{release for}} Touch and Go was the Headache EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited {{original}} {{edition of the}} EP {{was a pair of}} forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic [...] "body bag" [...] to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers. A sticker on the EP's cover read [...] "Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese!" [...] According to Durango, [...] "We didn't want to sit there and screw people. If we felt it wasn't as good, then we should just be honest about it." [...] Indeed, Headache recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on Atomizer, showing signs that the band was lagging creatively. Durango later remarked that [...] "I was feeling tapped out ideawise. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> think we had tried everything that we wanted to try, musically and in the studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|The orange man {{was portrayed}} by serious up-and-coming actor Peter Geeves; the advert's co-creator Al Young {{recalled}} that [...] "the guy we used [...] {{was like a}} Shakespearean actor," [...] and noted that out of all who auditioned for the role, [...] "he {{was the one who}} made [...] laugh the most," [...] adding that the way he ran [...] "was surreal". Robinson recalled, [...] "We knew as soon as he auditioned – the way he ran with his stomach sticking out – that he'd be perfect." [...] Geeves recalled in 2006, [...] "I was asked to first of all run around, then run around and scream, then run around screaming topless, it was <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> thought 'aye-aye, this isn't the normal run of the mill advert'." [...] The orange paint on him was orange grease paint fixed with hairspray, which took several weeks to remove after filming. Geeves himself was scared of hitting the finally chosen actor {{in the role of the}} Tango drinker too hard, though the actor did not mind, telling him a hard hit would [...] "make it look real".|$|E

So we’ll put portions of that material that were made during that time span on the actual street. It’s {{not going to do anything}} but build momentum.|$|R
5000|$|Gregson-Williams was {{the first}} {{composer}} whom director Andrew Adamson approached for the film because they had worked together on Shrek (2001) and Shrek 2 (2004). Because Adamson had to shoot the film in New Zealand {{for an extended period}} and Gregson-Williams was working on scores for films such as Kingdom of Heaven, he initially only prepared for the project by re-reading the book and reading the film script. It wasn't until he saw the first cut of the film that, as he put it, [...] "I could see the look of it, the look of the characters. I found that what I felt emotionally, when compared to the book, was quite different and it was then <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could really 'get under the skin' of the project."
