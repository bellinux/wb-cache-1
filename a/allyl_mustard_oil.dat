50|$|These are {{generally}} mustard oils, which {{are characterized by}} a burning taste; their principal occurrence is in mustard and Tropaeolum seeds. Sinigrin, or the potassium salt of inyronic acid not only occurs in mustard seed, but also in black pepper and in horseradish root. Hydrolysis with baryta, or decomposition by the ferment myrosin, gives glucose, <b>allyl</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> and potassium hydrogen sulfate. Sinalbin occurs in white pepper; it decomposes to the mustard oil, glucose and sinapin, a compound of choline and sinapic acid. Jalapin or scammonin occurs in scammony; it hydrolyses to glucose and jalapinolic acid.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{isolation}} of allyl isothiocyanate from {{the seeds of}} black mustard over a century ago, the occurrence of isothiocyanates in nature has frequently been reported. Organic isothiocyanates are commonly called mustard oils because of their long recognized distribution in plants of the mustard family, Cruciferae, which derived the name originally from the French condiment moustarde. Various of the mustards have been important items of commerce since ancient times. Mustard oils may be conveniently grouped as volatile and non-volatile. Volatile oils, such as <b>allyl</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>oil,</b> have a characteristically sharp taste and odor, whereas the non-volatile, such as p-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate (the active principle of table mustard), are odorless but also possess a sharp taste. Volatile mustard oils may be easily separated from the seed mixture by steam distillation, and consequently have been more extensively investigated than non-volatile mustard oils. The purpose of this investigation is to elucidate the chemical nature of the precursors of mustard oils in plants, the mustard oil glucosides...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that in the Raman spectra of many disubstituted acetylenes the line corresponding to the so-called C≡C frequency is split into two components of not greatly different intensity (1), though {{this is not the}} case in the monosubstituted compounds. In the mustard oils the C≡N Raman line is double (2), and in <b>allyl</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> (3), the one substance which appears to have been studied with sufficient dispersion, the corresponding infrared band shows definite indications of splitting into two components. This doubling is not observed in the organic thiocyanates. These facts have caused some speculation so far appear never to have received a satisfactory explanation. The presence of two fundamentals in the 2200 cm^- 1 region appears quite impossible for most of the molecules showing the doubling, and on the other hand the coexistence of two forms of molecule with slightly different frequencies appears unlikely, especially in the case of the acetylenes. Consequently the author proposes an explanation involving a Fermi resonance interaction between the C≡C or C≡N fundamental, as the case may be, and the overtone of a certain other vibration of approximately one-half or one-third the frequency...|$|E

40|$|Various TRP {{channels}} act as polymodal sensors {{of thermal}} and chemical stimuli, but the mechanisms whereby chemical ligands impact on TRP channel gating are poorly understood. Here {{we show that}} AITC (<b>allyl</b> isothiocyanate; <b>mustard</b> <b>oil)</b> and menthol represent two distinct types of ligands at the mammalian cold sensor TRPM 8. Kinetic analysis of channel gating revealed that AITC acts by destabilizing the closed channel, whereas menthol stabilizes the open channel, relative to the transition state. Based on these differences, we classify agonists as either type I (menthol-like) or type II (AITC-like), and provide a kinetic model that faithfully reproduces their differential effects. We further demonstrate that type I and type II agonists have a distinct impact on TRPM 8 currents and TRPM 8 -mediated calcium signals in excitable cells. These findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding the differential actions of TRP channel ligands, with important ramifications for TRP channel structure-function analysis and pharmacology. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceChemical {{irritation}} in {{the human}} nasal cavity is poorly documented. In this field, an important issue concerns the differential responses produced by successive stimulation. Repeated identical chemical irritant stimuli can produce increases or decreases in responses (two phenomena known as self-sensitization or self-desensitization). In the same way, different molecules can interact and produce cross-sensitization or cross-desensitization. The {{aim of this study}} was to contribute to this question using two specific molecules, acetic acid (AA) and allyl isothiocyanate (AIC). As the self-sensitization and -desensitization for AIC is known, a first experiment in the present work investigated the response, acute effects and time course of sensitization or desensitization to acetic acid. A second experiment tested the responses of acetic acid after a previous stimulation with <b>allyl</b> isothiocyanate (<b>mustard</b> <b>oil)</b> and inversely with a short inter-stimulus interval (ISI of 45 s). A third experiment similar to the second used a long inter-stimulus interval (ISI of 3 min 30). Twelve healthy subjects participated in the study using psychophysical (intensity ratings) and psychophysiological (skin conductance response) measurements. Firstly, the results showed that repeated nasal stimulation with acetic acid produced a self-desensitization whatever the ISI. Secondly, the results showed a cross-desensitization of allyl isothiocyanate by previous acetic acid stimulation. In contrast, previous stimulation with allyl isothiocyanate had no effect on the following acetic acid response. These findings confirm that trigeminal sensitization and desensitization in the nasal cavity do not follow the same processes in relation to molecules used...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the temporal pattern of oral irritation elicited by sequential application of <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> (allyl-isothiocyanate), {{and whether it}} exhibits self-desensitization and cross-desensitization with capsaicin. <b>Mustard</b> <b>oil</b> (0. 125 %, 40 µl) was sequentially applied {{to one side of}} the tongue at 1 min intervals, and subjects rated the intensity of the irritant sensation elicited by each stimulus. Ratings successively declined across trials, indicating desensitization. In contrast, sequential application of capsaicin (10 ppm) elicited irritation that increased in intensity across trials (sensitization). To test for self-desensitization by <b>mustard</b> <b>oil,</b> a 10 min hiatus was imposed following the series of unilateral <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> stimuli, after which <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> was applied to both sides of the tongue. In a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm, subjects chose which side had stronger irritation and also independently rated the irritant intensity on each side. A significant majority of subjects chose the side not previously receiving <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> as more intense, and assigned significantly higher intensity ratings to that side, indicating self-desensitization. In two additional sessions, the same paradigm was used to show <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> cross-desensitization of irritation elicited by capsaicin, and capsaicin cross-desensitization of irritation from <b>mustard</b> <b>oil.</b> In a final session, sequential application of <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> at faster (20 s) intervals initially evoked a sensitizing pattern followed by desensitization.

3000|$|<b>Mustard</b> <b>oil</b> is {{biodegradable}} and non-toxic oil, essentially {{free from}} sulfur and aromatics. <b>Mustard</b> <b>oil</b> {{has a high}} boiling point and flash point which makes it safer to handle and transport. Further, <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> has a low vapor pressure and volumetric energy density compared to diesel. In addition, <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> has low better lubricating property than diesel as it removes the deposits in the fuel lines and improves the engine life. <b>Mustard</b> <b>oil</b> has high cetane index and hence it possesses less knocking tendency.

40|$|Membrane phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) is {{critical}} for the function of many transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. The role of PIP 2 in TRPA 1 function is not well known. The effect of PIP 2 on TRPA 1 was investigated by direct application of PIP 2 and by using polylysine and PIP 2 antibody that sequester PIP 2. In inside-out patches from HeLa cells expressing mouse TRPA 1, polytriphosphate (PPPi) {{was added to the}} bath solution to keep TRPA 1 sensitive to <b>allyl</b> isothiocyanate (AITC; <b>mustard</b> <b>oil).</b> Direct application of PIP 2 (10 μM) to inside-out patches did not activate TRPA 1, but AITC and Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produced strong activation. In inside-out patches in which TRPA 1 was first activated with AITC (in the presence of PPPi), further addition of PIP 2 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of TRPA 1 [agonist concentration producing half-maximal activity (K 1 / 2), 2. 8 μM]. Consistent with the inhibition of TRPA 1 by PIP 2, AITC activated a large whole cell current when polylysine or PIP 2 antibody was added to the pipette but a markedly diminished current when PIP 2 was added to the pipette. In inside-out patches with PPPi in the bath solution, application of PIP 2 antibody or polylysine caused activation of TRPA 1, and this was blocked by PIP 2. However, TRPA 1 was not activated by polylysine and PIP 2 antibody under whole cell conditions, suggesting a more complex regulation of TRPA 1 by PIP 2 in intact cells. These results show that PIP 2 inhibits TRPA 1 and reduces the sensitivity of TRPA 1 to AITC...|$|R
