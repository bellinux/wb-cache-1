5|$|Ahmose I's {{campaigns in}} Nubia are better documented. Soon {{after the first}} Nubian campaign, a Nubian named Aata rebelled against Ahmose, but was crushed. After this attempt, an anti-Theban Egyptian named Tetian {{gathered}} many rebels in Nubia, but he too was defeated. Ahmose restored Egyptian rule over Nubia, which was controlled from a new administrative center established at Buhen. When re-establishing the national government, Ahmose appears to have rewarded various local princes who supported his cause <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dynastic predecessors.|$|E
5|$|By 1720, Vanbrugh's direct {{connection}} with the theatre had been terminated, but the leases and rents had been transferred to both his own family <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife's {{through a series of}} trusts and benefices, with Vanbrugh himself building a new home in Greenwich. After the fire, the Vanbrugh family's long association with the theatre was terminated, and all their leases were surrendered by 1792.|$|E
5|$|In 195 BC, Flamininus summoned {{his army}} in Greece <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> allies at Plataea in Boeotia. He then marched from Plataea to Argos {{where he was}} joined by 10,000 Achean {{infantry}} and 1,000 cavalry. After a few brief skirmishes, the allies decided to abandon the siege and they pitched in Tegea. They then advanced upon Caryae where {{they were joined by}} 1,500 Macedonians and 400 Thessalian cavalry.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{argue that}} von Däniken {{misrepresented}} data, <b>that</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> claims were unfounded, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> none <b>of</b> <b>his</b> core claims have been validated.|$|R
50|$|Avery {{says he is}} from L.A., <b>and</b> <b>that</b> two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cousins {{ran with}} a gang of vampire hunters. This is likely a {{reference}} to Charles Gunn's gang.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was later}} voted by the Senate that Sosibius {{be given a}} million sesterces for giving Britannicus the benefit <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teachings <b>and</b> Claudius <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> counsel (i.e. for his {{involvement}} in the case against Asiaticus).|$|R
5|$|In the 1820s however, Tucker's {{views of}} slavery changed notably with {{personal}} experience, and profit, realized in his purchase {{and sale of}} slaves for his account <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father-in-law, Charles Carter. For years he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical, then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable. Though he recounted the insipid benefits of slavery, he predicted its eventual death. Indeed, he freed his own slaves in 1845, 16 years prior to his death.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} {{enthusiastic}} artist in pencil and watercolour, a skill which he used throughout his life for his own amusement <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends. His enormous correspondence shows that he {{could also be a}} witty writer in German and English– sometimes accompanied by humorous sketches and cartoons in the text.|$|E
5|$|More generally, Neferhotep's time on {{the throne}} was likely prosperous as there are many private monuments datable to his reign <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother, and {{especially}} in sculpture some remarkably high quality art works were produced.|$|E

50|$|Brixi was an {{important}} composer at the junction between Baroque and the Classical period.Brixi's style is distinguished from <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries by its fresh melodic writing, vivacious rhythm and lively bass lines, <b>and</b> from <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessors by its simple yet effective instrumentation. During his lifetime his music was widely disseminated in Bohemia and Moravia.|$|R
25|$|Tariq Ali {{made the}} same {{complaint}} in <b>his</b> survey <b>of</b> the reactions, {{in an article in}} Counterpunch, arguing that Grass had foreseen the reactions, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> criticism <b>of</b> <b>his</b> poem in Germany assumed that 'all Germans are guilty for eternity for the crimes of the Third Reich'.|$|R
5|$|The tablets were {{produced}} in periods 2 and 3 (c.AD92–103), {{with the majority}} written before AD102. They were used for official notes about the Vindolanda camp business and personal affairs of the officers and households. The largest group is correspondence of Flavius Cerialis, prefect of the ninth cohort of Batavians <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife, Sulpicia Lepidina. Some correspondence may relate to civilian traders and contractors; for example Octavian, the writer of Tablet 343, is an entrepreneur dealing in wheat, hides and sinews, {{but this does not}} prove him to be a civilian.|$|E
5|$|Zappas left {{a fortune}} for {{the funding of}} future Olympiads {{to be held at}} the Panathenian stadium. He died in 1865. His immense fortune was used for the {{construction}} of permanent sporting facilities in Athens, {{as well as for the}} continuation of the Olympiad. He also instructed on the building of the Zappeion exhibition and conference center, which is named in his honour <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cousin Konstantinos Zappas.|$|E
5|$|Zephaniah Kingsley wrote {{a defense}} of slavery and the three-tier social system that {{acknowledged}} the rights of free people of color that existed in Florida under Spanish rule. Kingsley briefly served on the Florida Territorial Council, planning the transition when Florida was annexed by the United States. During his time on the council, he attempted to influence Florida lawmakers to recognize free people of color and allow mixed-race children to inherit property. In addition to the architectural qualities, the site is significant as his home <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> unique family.|$|E
50|$|All the {{evidence}} gathered so far is, then, {{expelled from the}} defendant's file, {{with the exception of}} those pieces <b>of</b> evidence <b>that</b> cannot be repeated, such as the initial autopsy or a search <b>and</b> seizure, or <b>that</b> were gathered in the defendant's presence <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lawyer or his experts.|$|R

5|$|As one on an {{official}} mission, Wright {{would probably have}} offered greetings to Leopold's ambassador extraordinary in London, the Marqués de Lede, and to Alonso de Cárdenas, the regular Habsburg ambassador, who had also been engaged since 1649 in art procurement for the Spanish Monarch. The lack of records means that the timing and duration of this visit remain uncertain. However, de Lede left in late June, and de Cárdenas {{a few weeks later}} – as relations between Cromwell and the Habsburgs deteriorated – so Wright probably arrived back in Flanders, with any acquisitions he had made, just in time to learn of the Archduke's impending departure – <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> huge art collection – from Brussels in the autumn of 1655.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1066 Norman {{conquest of}} England, {{the land and}} {{properties}} of Aldermaston formed part of the estates of Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex, who later became King Harold II of England. Harold's assessment of Aldermaston valued the village's 15 hides at £20 a year. As {{with much of the}} land seized by William the Conqueror after his arrival in England in 1066, Aldermaston was held in demesne. His Domesday Survey of 1086 identified the existence of a mill, worth twenty shillings, and two fisheries, worth five shillings. During the rest of William's reign, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son William Rufus, Aldermaston was owned by the Crown.|$|E
5|$|Dejan {{was one of}} the {{prominent}} figures of Dušan's reign and during the subsequent fall of the Serbian Empire, after Dušan's death. Under Emperor Dušan, despot Jovan Oliver, with his brother Bogdan and sevastokrator Dejan, ruled over all of eastern Macedonia. Dejan is not mentioned much in Dušan's military endeavors, although his reputation <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> successors suggest that he was involved in most of Dušan's successes. His prominence beyond Serbia is also evident from the fact that Pope Innocent VI addressed Dejan in 1355, asking him to support the creation of the union between the Catholic Church and the Serbian Orthodox Church (such letters were sent to the highest nobility and the church).|$|E
50|$|Ali Khan {{asked the}} Tribunal why his son Majid was facing {{allegations}} {{that his family}} members had asserted that {{he had become a}} religious fanatic. He disputed that his son was a religious fanatic, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> member <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family had ever asserted that he was a religious fanatic.|$|R
50|$|After her release, her fortune was {{returned}} to her, and she lived {{the rest of her}} life quietly and comfortably with her own court at Nottingham Castle, through Henry V's reign <b>and</b> into <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son, Henry VI. She died at Havering-atte-Bower in Essex, and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral next to Henry IV.|$|R
50|$|Fantozzi is {{not always}} submissive, and can {{sometimes}} react ruthlessly, often {{having the courage to}} rebel and assert <b>his</b> dignity, <b>and</b> also <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> colleagues, when others cannot. It is, however, his superiors who always retain the power and Fantozzi, due to his dignity and gentle soul, is forced to endure the worst possible suffering.|$|R
5|$|Ernst's rule, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> four Wittelsbach successors, {{strengthened}} {{the position of}} his family in Imperial politics. The victory of the Catholic party further consolidated the Counter-Reformation in the northwest territories of the Holy Roman Empire, especially in the bishoprics of Münster, Paderborn, Osnabrück and Minden, which were bordered by Protestant territories. Once Ernst's brother or such allies as the Duke of Parma regained control, Jesuits efficiently identified any recalcitrant Protestants and converted them to Catholicism. The Counter-Reformation was thoroughly applied in the lower Rhineland, with the goal that every Protestant, whether Lutheran or Calvinist, would {{be brought to the}} Catholic fold. For their efforts, the Spanish acquired important bridgeheads on the Rhine River, securing a land route to the rebellious northern provinces, which helped to extend an already long war of secession well into the next century.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{continued}} to publish his newsletter, The Liberty Bell, and sold his books as his health and eyesight {{continued to}} fail. On February 11, 1936, {{he died at}} Monte Ne due to peritonitis after an attack of intestinal influenza. The tomb made to house his son in 1903 was blasted open, and Harvey's simple cheap pine casket <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son were placed in a glass casket filled with copies of Harvey's books {{and some of his}} other papers. The tomb was then resealed. A small funeral was held on February 14, and a small plaque bearing the names and dates of the two Harveys was posted.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} regular skateboarding {{commentators}} {{have been critical}} of Eaton's participation at professional-level skateboarding events, including Burnquist who believes that separate junior divisions should be established for competitions. David Daniels of Bleacher Report suggested <b>that</b> Eaton's entry (<b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> others <b>his</b> age) in professional competitions harms the credibility of skateboarding in the sporting context.|$|R
50|$|Count Aleksandr Ivanovich Shuvalov (Алекса́ндр Ива́нович Шува́лов; 1710-1771) was a Russian statesman {{from the}} Shuvalov family. His career was {{dependent}} on <b>and</b> overshadowed by <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> more brilliant brother, Pyotr Ivanovich Shuvalov.|$|R
50|$|He was {{previously}} {{closely associated with}} the development of Éditions Gallimard. Under the presidency <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grandfather Gaston Gallimard <b>and</b> later <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father Claude, he encouraged the autonomy of the house by separating it from the diffusion Hachette and co-editions such as Le Livre de Poche, which gave rise to the , or L'Univers des formes and the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, which remained at Gallimard.|$|R
5|$|Iginla has {{recorded}} several Gordie Howe hat tricks – a fight, a goal and an {{assist in the}} same game – and as {{it is not an}} official statistic, The Hockey News estimated that as of 2012, he was the active leader with nine. His fights, including one with Tampa Bay Lightning star Vincent Lecavalier in the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, have had a motivating effect on his play <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teammates. Iginla has suffered injuries {{as a result of his}} fighting, including a broken hand from a 2003 fight with Bill Guerin of the Dallas Stars. His physical style of play also leads to a greater risk of persistent injuries and penalties. Iginla's truculent style of play has gained approval from hockey commentator Don Cherry.|$|E
5|$|In 1203 Norreis, {{secure in}} his {{alliance}} {{with his own}} monks, once again began to exploit the monastery for his own profit <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family and friends. His monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent Thomas, along with other monks, to appropriate the harvest from some lands that had been given by Norreis to a non-member of the community. Norreis protested to King John and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately and explain {{the actions of the}} monks. Thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about Norreis's exactions and abuse of his monks.|$|E
5|$|In taking office, Morales {{emphasized}} nationalism, anti-imperialism, and anti-neoliberalism, although did {{not initially}} refer to his administration as socialist. In what was widely termed a populist act, he immediately reduced both his own presidential wage <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ministers by 57% to $1,875 a month, also urging members of Congress {{to do the}} same. Morales gathered together a largely inexperienced cabinet made up of indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals, although over {{the first three years}} of government there was a rapid turnover in the cabinet as Morales replaced many of the indigenous members with trained middle-class leftist politicians. By 2012 only 3 of the 20 cabinet members identified as indigenous.|$|E
50|$|Ferdinand {{was then}} taken {{prisoner}} by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, and {{was moved to}} Barcelona as a hostage. Nevertheless, he gained the King of Aragon's friendship <b>and</b> later <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grandson <b>and</b> successor Charles. Charles even arranged Ferdinand of Naples' marriage with <b>his</b> stepgrandmother, Ferdinand <b>of</b> Aragon's widow Germaine of Foix, in 1526.

50|$|Ibn Mājah {{was born}} in Qazwin, the modern-day Iranian {{province}} of Qazvin, in 824 CE/209 AH to a family who were clients (mawla) of the Rabīʻah tribe.
