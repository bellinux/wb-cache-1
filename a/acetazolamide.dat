5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is <b>acetazolamide</b> (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. <b>Acetazolamide</b> cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if <b>acetazolamide</b> is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{includes}} a healthy diet, salt restriction, and exercise. Bariatric surgery {{may also be}} used to help with weight loss. The medication <b>acetazolamide</b> may also be used along with the above measures. A small percentage of people may require surgery to relieve the pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 the ApHC {{implemented}} {{new drug}} rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs furosemide, {{known by the}} trade name of Lasix, and <b>acetazolamide.</b> Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. <b>Acetazolamide</b> ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers. The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and owners {{have the option to}} choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers. Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP will be required to be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.|$|E
5|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin, {{has been}} shown to improve the {{ventilatory}} response, but this has been poorly studied and is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Similarly, the drug <b>acetazolamide</b> can reduce bicarbonate levels, and thereby augment to normal ventilatory response, but this has been researched insufficiently to recommend wide application.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc. It can occur {{in association with the}} use of Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as <b>acetazolamide,</b> repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (<b>acetazolamide),</b> or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, <b>acetazolamide</b> and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Winter Olympics was {{the first}} of three {{consecutive}} Olympic games Öhlund appeared in. He played in all four games for Sweden and registered one assist as Sweden finished in a tie for fifth place, out of medal contention. Four years later, Öhlund was selected for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. However, in pre-Olympic drug testing by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Öhlund tested positive for the banned substance <b>acetazolamide.</b> The substance was inadvertently ingested after Öhlund took Diamox, a drug he had used previously while undergoing eye surgery. As the ingestion was unintentional, he was cleared to play. After a dominant round-robin, Sweden was eliminated by Belarus in the quarter-final game—considered one of the biggest upsets in international hockey history and the darkest moment in Swedish hockey history. Öhlund finished the tournament with two points in four games.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetazolamide</b> is {{pregnancy}} category B3 in Australia, {{which means}} that studies in rats, mice and rabbits in which <b>acetazolamide</b> was given intravenously or orally caused {{an increased risk of}} fetal malformations, including defects of the limbs. Despite this there is insufficient evidence from studies in humans to either support or discount this evidence.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulants, cardiac glycosides, {{may have}} their effects potentiated by <b>acetazolamide.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Acetazolamide</b> {{came into}} medical use in 1952. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Acetazolamide</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 1.40 to 16.93 USD per month. In the United States the wholesale cost is about 125.34 USD per month.|$|E
25|$|Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as dorzolamide, brinzolamide, and <b>acetazolamide,</b> lower {{secretion}} of {{aqueous humor}} by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary body.|$|E
25|$|Marked {{liver disease}} or {{impairment}} of liver function, including cirrhosis {{because of the}} risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy. <b>Acetazolamide</b> decreases ammonia clearance.|$|E
25|$|In the {{treatment}} of mountain sickness, <b>acetazolamide</b> forces the kidneys to excrete bicarbonate, the conjugate base of carbonic acid. By {{increasing the amount of}} bicarbonate excreted in the urine, the blood becomes more acidic. As the body equates acidity of the blood to its CO2 concentration, artificially acidifying the blood fools the body into thinking it has an excess of CO2, and it excretes this imaginary excess CO2 by deeper and faster breathing, which in turn increases the amount of oxygen in the blood. <b>Acetazolamide</b> is not an immediate cure for acute mountain sickness; rather, it speeds up part of the acclimatization process which in turn helps to relieve symptoms. <b>Acetazolamide</b> is still effective if started early in the course of mountain sickness. As prevention it is started one day before travel to altitude and continued for the first 2 days at altitude.|$|E
25|$|Evidence is {{insufficient}} to {{support the use of}} medications to treat obstructive sleep apnea. This includes the use of fluoxetine, paroxetine, <b>acetazolamide</b> and tryptophan among others.|$|E
25|$|Depending on subtype, many {{patients}} find that <b>acetazolamide</b> therapy {{is useful in}} preventing attacks. In some cases, persistent attacks result in tendon shortening, for which surgery is required.|$|E
25|$|Limited {{data are}} {{available}} on the effects of nursing mothers taking <b>acetazolamide.</b> Therapeutic doses create low levels in breast milk and are not expected to cause problems in infants.|$|E
25|$|Common {{adverse effects}} of <b>acetazolamide</b> include the following: paraesthesia, fatigue, drowsiness, depression, {{decreased}} libido, bitter or metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, black feces, polyuria, kidney stones, metabolic acidosis and electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hyponatremia). Whereas less common adverse effects include Stevens–Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis and blood dyscrasias.|$|E
25|$|People with FHM are {{encouraged}} to avoid activities that may trigger their attacks. Minor head trauma is a common attack precipitant, so FHM sufferers should avoid contact sports. <b>Acetazolamide</b> or standard drugs are often used to treat attacks, though those leading to vasoconstriction should be avoided due {{to the risk of}} stroke.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include numbness, ringing in the ears, loss of appetite, vomiting, and sleepiness. It is not {{recommended}} in those with significant kidney problems, liver problems, or who are allergic to sulfonamides. <b>Acetazolamide</b> is in the diuretic and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor families of medication. It works by decreasing the amount of hydrogen ions and bicarbonate in the body.|$|E
25|$|A diet {{which is}} high in protein from meat and dairy, as well as alcohol {{consumption}} can reduce urine pH, whilst potassium and organic acids such as from diets high in fruit and vegetables can increase the pH {{and make it more}} alkaline. Some drugs also can increase urine pH, including <b>acetazolamide,</b> potassium citrate, and sodium bicarbonate.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamides {{are used}} to treat allergies and cough, as well as {{antifungal}} and antimalarial functions. The moiety is also present in other medications that are not antimicrobials, including thiazide diuretics (including hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone, and indapamide, among others), loop diuretics (including furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide), <b>acetazolamide,</b> sulfonylureas (including glipizide, glyburide, among others), and some COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib).|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetazolamide,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Diamox among others, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} glaucoma, epilepsy, altitude sickness, periodic paralysis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and heart failure. It may be used long term {{for the treatment of}} open angle glaucoma and short term for acute angle closure glaucoma until surgery can be carried out. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|Zonisamide is an antiseizure drug {{chemically}} {{classified as}} a sulfonamide and unrelated to other antiseizure agents. The precise mechanism by which zonisamide exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown, although {{it is believed that}} the drug blocks sodium and T-type calcium channels, which leads to the suppression of neuronal hypersynchronization (that is, seizure-form activity). It is also known to be a weak carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (similarly to the anticonvulsant, <b>acetazolamide).</b> It is also known to modulate GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission.|$|E
25|$|Episodic ataxia (EA) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder characterized by sporadic bouts of ataxia (severe discoordination) {{with or without}} myokymia (continuous muscle movement). There are seven types recognised but the majority are due to two recognized entities. Ataxia can be provoked by stress, startle, or heavy exertion such as exercise. Symptoms can first appear in infancy. There are at least 6 loci for EA, of which 4 are known genes. Some patients with EA also have migraine or progressive cerebellar degenerative disorders, symptomatic of either familial hemiplegic migraine or spinocerebellar ataxia. Some patients respond to <b>acetazolamide</b> though others do not.|$|E
25|$|Episodic ataxia type-3 (EA3) {{is similar}} to EA1 but often also {{presents}} with tinnitus and vertigo. Patients typically present with bouts of ataxia lasting less than 30 minutes and occurring once or twice daily. During attacks, they also have vertigo, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus and diplopia. These attacks are sometimes accompanied by headaches and precipitated by stress, fatigue, movement and arousal after sleep. Attacks generally begin in early childhood and last throughout the patients' lifetime. <b>Acetazolamide</b> administration has proved successful in some patients. As EA3 is extremely rare, there is currently no known causative gene. The locus for this disorder has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42).|$|E
25|$|Full acclimatization, however, {{requires}} days or even weeks. Gradually, {{the body}} compensates for the respiratory alkalosis by renal excretion of bicarbonate, allowing adequate respiration to provide oxygen without risking alkalosis. It takes about four days {{at any given}} altitude and can be enhanced by drugs such as <b>acetazolamide.</b> Eventually, the body undergoes physiological changes such as lower lactate production (because reduced glucose breakdown decreases the amount of lactate formed), decreased plasma volume, increased hematocrit (polycythemia), increased RBC mass, a higher concentration of capillaries in skeletal muscle tissue, increased myoglobin, increased mitochondria, increased aerobic enzyme concentration, increase in 2,3-BPG, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Pulmonary artery pressure increases {{in an effort to}} oxygenate more blood.|$|E
500|$|Both {{drugs are}} controversial, {{in part because}} they are {{considered}} drug maskers and diuretics that can make it difficult to detect the presence of other drugs in the horse's system. On one side, it is argued that the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF), which sponsors show competition for many different horse breeds, and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI), which governs international and Olympic equestrian competition, ban the use of furosemide. [...] On {{the other side of the}} controversy, several major stock horse registries that sanction their own shows, including the American Quarter Horse Association, American Paint Horse Association, and the Palomino Horse Breeders of America, allow <b>acetazolamide</b> and furosemide to be used within 24hours of showing under certain circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Acetazolamide</b> 250mg {{twice daily}} dosing assists in AMS {{treatment}} by quickening altitude acclimatization. A {{study by the}} Denali Medical Research Project concluded: [...] "In established cases of acute mountain sickness, treatment with <b>acetazolamide</b> relieves symptoms, improves arterial oxygenation, and prevents further impairment of pulmonary gas exchange." ...|$|E

2500|$|The drug <b>acetazolamide</b> (trade name Diamox) {{may help}} some people making a rapid ascent to {{sleeping}} altitude above , {{and it may}} also be effective if started early in the course of AMS. <b>Acetazolamide</b> can be taken before symptoms appear as a preventive measure at a dose of 125mg twice daily. The Everest Base Camp Medical Centre cautions against its routine use as a substitute for a reasonable ascent schedule, except where rapid ascent is forced by flying into high altitude locations or due to terrain considerations. The Centre suggests a dosage of 125mg twice daily for prophylaxis, starting from 24 hours before ascending until a few days at the highest altitude or on descending; with 250mg twice daily recommended for treatment of AMS. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest the same dose for prevention of 125mg <b>acetazolamide</b> every 12 hours. <b>Acetazolamide,</b> a mild diuretic, works by stimulating the kidneys to secrete more bicarbonate in the urine, thereby acidifying the blood. This change in pH stimulates the respiratory center to increase the depth and frequency of respiration, thus speeding the natural acclimatization process. An undesirable side-effect of <b>acetazolamide</b> is a reduction in aerobic endurance performance. Other minor side effects include a tingle-sensation in hands and feet. [...] Although a sulfonamide; <b>acetazolamide</b> is a non-antibiotic and has not been shown to cause life-threatening allergic cross-reactivity in those with a self-reported sulfonamide allergy. Dosage of 1000mg/day will produce a 25% decrease in performance, on top of the reduction due to high-altitude exposure. The CDC advises that Dexamethasone be reserved for treatment of severe AMS and HACE during descents, and notes that Nifedipine may prevent HAPE.|$|E
2500|$|In {{epilepsy}}, {{the main}} use of <b>acetazolamide</b> is in menstrual-related epilepsy {{and as an}} add on to other treatments in refractory epilepsy. It has been demonstrated in drug trials to relieve symptoms associated with dural ectasia in individuals with Marfan's Syndrome. A 2012 review and meta-analysis {{found that there was}} [...] "limited supporting evidence" [...] but that <b>acetazolamide</b> [...] "may be considered" [...] for the treatment of central (as opposed to obstructive) sleep apnea.|$|E
