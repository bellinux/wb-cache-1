5|$|As {{a result}} of Gaudí's {{increasing}} fame, in 1902 the painter Joan Llimona chose Gaudí's features to represent Saint Philip Neri in the paintings for the <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sant Felip Neri church in Barcelona. Together with Joan Santaló, son of his friend the physician Pere Santaló, he unsuccessfully founded a wrought iron manufacturing company the same year.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, a {{landmine}} exploded {{near the}} south <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral, {{resulting in the}} roof of the nave collapsing and the shattering of the windows. Sir Charles Nicholson was hired to rebuild the roof, and made the decision to remove the altarpiece that Rossetti had added to the north aisle. In 1949, Nicholson was replaced with George Pace of York, who in coordination with the dean at the time, Glyn Simon, saw a number of improvements in the modern style, though many fittings were clearly still influenced by the Gothic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} {{corner of the}} south <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church is a {{monument}} of the Baber family, who formerly had large possessions in the parish. Inserted in a window of the aisle, is a wooden effigy, supposed to be of Sir John de Hautville, a Knight of Henry III's, who owned the northeastern estate named Norton Hautville, now Norton Hawkfield: in the same directional corner of the church are monuments to the Strach(e)y family who lived at Sutton Court.|$|E
50|$|Bishop Franklin {{was known}} for his homily style. He would walk <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church and speak {{directly}} to the congregation, often asking them questions.|$|R
30|$|Lastly one can cite Raman {{converters}} {{realized in}} silica nanofibers {{immersed in a}} liquid for which <b>the</b> evanescent <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guided mode efficiently interact with the surrounding liquid [15, 16].|$|R
2500|$|The main {{doors open}} into a full-width {{vestibule}} with flat-beamed ceiling. From it doorways {{go to the}} towers and <b>the</b> three <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary. At its front is a baptismal font of white Caen stone. Walnut pews sit on a marble patterned floor.|$|R
5|$|The house burnt down in 1894. However the {{detached}} {{music room}} in which Crosse conducted his experiments survived, {{along with some of}} the books and oil paintings by Anthony van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens. The laboratory table on which Crosse carried out experiments stands in the <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church of St. Mary and All Saints in Broomfield and an obelisk in his memory is in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, the Croatian {{archeologist}} Ćiro Truhelka excavated {{bones in}} a settlement close to Jajce known as Kraljev Grob (meaning King's Tomb) {{and found the}} skeleton of a decapitated adult male. The head {{was placed on the}} chest, with two coins in the mouth. Though by no means certain, it was assumed that the skeleton belonged to Stephen Tomašević. Despite objection from the friar Antun Knežević, who argued for leaving the bones where they had laid for centuries and constructing a small church at the site, the skeleton was placed in a glass coffin in the right <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Franciscan monastery in Jajce.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian {{woodwork}} {{was created}} to match the few older pieces that remained, or to follow a similar style; thus, the new wooden pulpit follows the themes of the medieval font. Of the stained glass smashed in the Reformation only fragments have been recovered, and these have been incorporated in a window in the north <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. Nine Arts and Crafts windows by James Powell and Sons are featured on the east and south sides of the church, and the north porch has two modern windows of predominantly blue colour. St Nicholas contains some notable memorials, including several plaques for the Blakeney lifeboats and their crews, and much pre-Reformation graffiti, particularly depictions of ships. The location of the latter suggests that they were votive in nature, although the saint concerned is now unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choir {{previously}} both extended {{on either}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady Chapel. The south aisle was shortened in about 1870 by George Gilbert Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming <b>the</b> chapel <b>of</b> StErasmus. <b>The</b> eastern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> contains <b>the</b> chapel <b>of</b> St Werburgh.|$|R
50|$|At the crossing, {{the nave}} meets the transept, which is {{actually}} slightly wider than the nave. The transept, however, is short, barely emerging from <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, but still giving the structure a typical cruciform plan. Beyond it, <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church terminate in three apses, each sized according to <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b>|$|R
25|$|The central nave, {{a sort of}} triumphal alley {{which leads}} to the mihrab, is {{significantly}} higher and wider than <b>the</b> other sixteen <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prayer hall. It is bordered on each side of a double row of arches rested on twin columns and surmounted by a carved plaster decoration consisting of floral and geometric patterns.|$|R
5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length of the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.|$|E
5|$|Barker was cremated at {{a private}} humanist funeral at Banbury Crematorium, which was {{attended}} only by family and close friends. A public memorial service for Barker was held on 3 March 2006 at Westminster Abbey, with some 2,000 people in attendance. Corbett, Richard Briers, Josephine Tewson, Michael Grade, and Peter Kay all read at the service, while others in attendance included David Jason, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin, Leslie Phillips, Lenny Henry, Dawn French and June Whitfield. A recording of Barker's rhyming slang sermon from The Two Ronnies was played, and while the cross was in procession in the <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abbey, it was accompanied by four candles {{instead of the usual}} two, in reference to the Four Candles sketch. Barker was the third comedy professional to be given a memorial at Westminster Abbey, after Joyce Grenfell and Les Dawson.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2009, Paramount flew 50 {{members of}} the press to New York with Anna Kendrick, Sad Brad Smith and representatives of American Airlines to promote Up in the Air. The film was shown on the aircraft's video {{monitors}} during the flight from New York to Los Angeles. American Airlines provided the Boeing 767 gratis. Smith performed a few songs including Help Yourself in the <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. On November 18, 2009, Backstage and Paramount Pictures had a special screening of Up in the Air for Screen Actors Guild and Backstage members at The Paramount Theatre (on the Paramount Lot), Los Angeles, California. The screening of the film was followed by a conversation with cast members Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick. The Starz Denver Film Festival closed on November 22, 2009 with a screening of Up in the Air, with an introduction by J.K. Simmons, who was in town to accept the festival's Cassavetes Award earlier that afternoon. The 20th Stockholm International Film Festival, which ran from November 18 to November 29, 2009, closed with a screening of Up in the Air on November 29, 2009.|$|E
25|$|Passengers on <b>the</b> flight complained <b>of</b> a smoke smell {{shortly after}} meal service. One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, walked <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane {{to assess the}} source. She found Reid sitting alone near a window, {{attempting}} to light a match. Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane, and Reid promised to stop.|$|R
50|$|Anna Louizos' scenery {{has been}} {{modified}} to fit <b>the</b> architecture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New London Theatre {{from the traditional}} proscenium arch stage at Winter Garden Theatre. Changes include <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-show curtain, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a revolving stage and action taking place in <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stalls. While the show remains to be set in America, the script has been adapted to include some minor references for a British audience.|$|R
50|$|Although {{only the}} nave pillars remain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} church, {{there is a}} record that in 1180 it had a nave <b>of</b> three bays. <b>The</b> old church probably had narrow aisles and a small chancel, <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church occurred in the 13C with new chancel windows, north and south, and possibly itssingle frame roof with tie beams. At that time <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave were probably widened to give more room in the nave.|$|R
5|$|The {{south side}} of the nave is characterised by eight bays with stepped buttresses between them, with aisle windows {{featuring}} reticulated heads. At the side of the south <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary is Chapter House, a small, square building, of two storeys. It dates to the mid 13th century and is made from Chipping Camden and Bath limestone, with some local red sandstone from Radyr. The octagonal roof was the brainchild of Prichard, though it was lowered in pitch by Pace and later worked on by Donald Buttress. The buttresses of the building are made from ashlar. The seven stained glass roundels are of 16th century Flemish origin. In the interior is a pulpit featuring Moses. Also of note is the St David's Chapel, added by George Pace in 1953–56, which is accessed through the Norman north door of the cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Its royal {{occupant}} {{may very}} well have made York House the pinnacle of Brettingham's career. Built during the 1760s, it was one of his last grand houses. His last country-house commission was at Packington Hall, Warwickshire. In 1761, he published his plans of Holkham Hall, calling himself the architect, which led critics, including Horace Walpole, to decry him as a purloiner of Kent's designs. Brettingham died in 1769 at his house outside St. Augustine's Gate, Norwich, and was buried in the <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parish church. Throughout his long career, Brettingham did much to popularise the Palladian movement. His clients included a Royal Duke and at least twenty-one assorted peers and peeresses. He is not a household name today largely because his provincial work was heavily influenced by Kent and Burlington, and unlike his contemporary Giacomo Leoni he did not develop, or was not given the opportunity to develop, a strong personal stamp to his work on country houses. Ultimately, he and many of his contemporary architects were eclipsed by the designs of Robert Adam. Adam remodelled Brettingham's York House in 1780 and, in addition to Kedleston Hall, went on to replace James Paine as architect at Nostell Priory, Alnwick Castle, and Syon House. In spite of this, Adam and Paine remained great friends; Brettingham's relationships with his fellow architects are unrecorded.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{went through}} periods of {{enlargement}} and renovation following {{the fires of}} 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to {{the northern and southern}} walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapterhouse dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.|$|E
50|$|Herringfleet Priory (also St Olave's Priory) was an Augustinian priory of Black Canons {{located in}} St Olaves, 6 mi {{northwest}} of Herringfleet, Suffolk, England.

2500|$|The team mascot is Barsik, an {{anthropomorphic}} snow leopard. Barsik wears a Barys jersey {{with his}} name on the back, and the numbers [...] "99". He keeps the crowd excited, signs autographs, participates in entertainment during the intermissions, skates across the ice, throws T-shirts, and runs throughout <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arena to high five fans. Prior to the Mascots Contest at the 2014 KHL All-Star Game, Barsik changed his skin feature to look more snowy, while previous was looked more leopard.|$|R
25|$|In 1360, {{the west}} <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south {{transept}} {{and the south}} <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave were widened, and the outer south aisle added. Also, at this time, the south porch and the tower were built.|$|E

25|$|The Domesday Book {{mentions}} Acton as a Church with 30 {{acres of}} land. The original building was constructed circa 1250. The South <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church {{was constructed in}} the 15th Century, and {{the upper part of}} the Church tower was pulled down in the late 19th Century for safety, to be rebuilt in the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Located {{previously}} in the crypt, {{where it was}} touched in the evening by the setting sun, was the Grave of the Unknown Soldier, a realistic depiction of a dead soldier sculpted by George Washington Lambert. Although previously visible to the public from above, the tomb has now been moved into the <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral, to give the public greater access to it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 14th Century the North <b>Aisle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church was widened, with the South Aisle being {{similarly}} widened and the West Door rebuilt in the 15th Century. Thus the church developed into its present almost rectangular shape. The Church's first spire {{was constructed in}} the 15th century and {{by the beginning of}} the 16th century a Chantry Chapel projected from the South Chapel.|$|E
500|$|In {{its final}} form, <b>the</b> church {{consisted}} <b>of</b> a nave [...] long by [...] wide, with {{north and south}} <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same length and [...] wide, and a chancel [...] long by [...] wide.

25|$|The {{church is}} rather narrow and {{consists}} of a nave and two side <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same height, unifying inner space as in a hall church, a characteristic that would be found in later Manueline spaces like <b>the</b> nave <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jerónimos Monastery <b>of</b> Lisbon. Each pillar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave, supporting a pointed arch, is composed of three intertwined subcolumns in rough granite. These spiralling columns {{would also be a}} typical theme in later Manueline buildings, like the Guarda Cathedral. The side aisles are supported by semi-barrel vaults.|$|R
25|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> façade by Alessandro Galilei (1735), the cliché {{assessment}} {{has ever}} been that it is <b>the</b> façade <b>of</b> a palace, not of a church. Galilei's front, which is a screen across the older front creating a narthex or vestibule, does express the nave and double <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archbasilica, which required a central bay wider than <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequence. Galilei provided it, without abandoning <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> identical arch-headed openings, by extending the central window by flanking columns that support the arch, in the familiar Serlian motif.|$|R
