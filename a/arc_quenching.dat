The interaction between polyamide materials and arc plasmas occurs particularly in the low voltage circuit breaker and aerospace fields.

To confirm the effect of water absorption into the polyamide material on spallation phenomena, polyamide specimens with and without water absorption were irradiated by Ar inductively coupled thermal plasma.

Lightning initiated flashovers on distribution networks do not necessary lead to power follow current.

The <b>arc</b> <b>quenching</b> properties of wooden distribution line poles during lightning strikes are {{an important factor in}} the reduction of switchgear operation, hence outages.

Distribution lines predominantly use wooden poles with a specific configuration which incorporates a 'wooden' spark gap. This paper provides background to the basic configuration of a typical distribution line and the processes which govern the electric arc. A simulation using a dynamic arc model shows that field measured lightning overvoltages on a distribution line are reproducible through system modelling.

For ISH 2007 we presented a new theoretical approach to detect small gas leakages in SF 6 switchgear.

40|$|SF 6 self-blast circuit {{breakers}} {{are widely used}} as switching elements in electrical power systems. In case of a short-circuit fault the breaker contacts are separated leading to an ignition of an electric arc. Hence, the current flow is carried by the electric arc itself. Due to a cooling of the arc at the current zero phase, the arc can be successfully extinguished. The switching gap is converted from a conductive state to an insulating one. Thus, {{the development of the}} gap resistance over time is a measure of this switching process. Up to now, the total resistance value of the switching arc is used for the assessment of the switching performance without considering the spatial distribution of the resistance. In this thesis a measuring arrangement is developed to determine the partial resistance distribution of the switching arc during the current zero phase. This arrangement is adapted to a self-blast circuit breaker model. The physical cooling mechanisms can be evaluated by using an Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation of this process. Due to the high global warming potential of SF 6, the replacement by alternative gases in self-blast {{circuit breakers}} is gaining importance. Hence, the promising substitute gas CO 2 is analysed using this investigation concept and discussed in reference to SF 6. Due to the measurements of the spatial distribution of the resistance of the switching arc a more detailed insight into the current zero phase is achieved. In addition, the simulated cooling behaviour can be considered to identify the important physical processes for the <b>arc</b> <b>quenching.</b> Two characteristic areas can be identified. The resistance of the first area is generated by a convective cooling process, while the cooling of the second area is evolved due to a turbulent process.

The total cooling performance of the SF 6 circuit breaker is superior to the CO 2 circuit breaker leading to a higher total resistance and thereby a better interruption capability.

However, in recent years, the future use of SF 6 has been debated throughout the world in spite of it having all the desirable properties of a good insulating and <b>arc</b> <b>quenching</b> medium.

In the presence of metallic contamination can seriously reduce the insulation performance of a GIS. Particularly the influence of free metallic particles has been regarded as an important issue for many years, since free particles are considered to be hazardous because of the possibility of initiating a voltage breakdown. Transient over voltages due to lightning voltages cause steep build up of voltage on transmission lines and other electrical apparatus. Therefore GIS must be able to withstand such voltages without breakdown of insulation. As GIS operates under power frequency voltages.

The insulation defects in SF 6 -insulated equipment show great influence on the stability of entire insulated system. On the one hand, the dielectric strength of filled insulated gas obviously reduces under discharge because of the decomposition of SF 6. On the other hand, the decomposition components (low-fluorine sulfides) corrode the surface of SF 6 -insulated equipment with the action of trace water and oxygen in equipment [21]. Besides, most of the insulation defect-induced discharge is hard to be found by the inspection workers as the discharge is always unsustainable. Therefore, online detection method, which assesses the insulation status automatically in real time, becomes an effective to solve the detection difficulty [22 – 24]. However, the current detections methods: ultra high frequency (UHF) method, transient earth voltage (TEV) method, ultrasonic method, and fluorescence detection method are easily affected by the environmental interference signal [25 – 28]. Thanks to the distinguished anti-interference and high detection precision properties of gas sensors detection method, online gas detection becomes a new breakthrough for insulation status assessment of SF 6 -insulted equipment.|$|E

The target is to use <b>arc</b> <b>quenching</b> properties of ablation material {{to reduce the size}} of load break switches (LBSs) that interrupts current in atmospheric air. Consequently, the air insulated LBSs can be more competitive to more compact SF 6 insulated breakers. The present thesis is an experimental study of polypropylene (PP) as ablation material. Experiments are performed in a medium-voltage (MV) laboratory to determine the interruption limits with regards to current level and shape of transient recovery voltage (TRV). Little has earlier been published in this field of study so the design of the test switch is developed through experimental work. The test switch interrupts the thermal part of the current interruption for all tested currents, up to 800 A. Even for hard TRVs the switch interrupted the thermal part to an impressive degree. The dielectric strength in the arcing zone after the thermal phase is however a larger challenge. For a current of 800 A, the test switch struggles to withstand a recovery voltage higher than 6 kV the first 300 &# 181;s after current zero (CZ) crossing. The ablation effect is more or less self-regulated since the arc intensity is directly related to current magnitude. Experiments indicate that the test switch struggles with low currents since the heat becomes too low.

This paper is devoted to the investigation of compositions, thermodynamic properties, and transport coefficients of high-temperature C 5 F 10 O mixed with CO 2 and O 2. Firstly, the partition functions and enthalpies of formation for a few molecules (CxFy and CxFyO) which are likely to exist in the mixtures, are calculated based on the G 4 (MP 2) theory. The isomers of the above molecules are selected according to their Gibbs energy. The compositions of C 5 F 10 O-CO 2 -O 2 mixtures are then determined using the minimization of the Gibbs free energy. Next, the thermodynamic properties (mass density, specific enthalpy, and specific heat) are derived from the previously calculated compositions. Lastly, the transport coefficients (electrical conductivity, viscosity, and thermal conductivity) are calculated based on Chapman-Enskog method. It is found that, as an <b>arc</b> <b>quenching</b> gas, C 5 F 10 O could not recombine into itself with the temperature decreasing down to room temperature after the arc extinction. Besides, the key species at room temperature are always CF 4, CO 2, and C 4 F 6 if graphite is not considered. When taken into account, graphite will replace C 4 F 6 as one of the dominate particles. The mixing of CO 2 with C 5 F 10 O plasma significantly affects the thermodynamic properties (e. g. vanishing and/or shifting of the peaks in specific heat) and transport coefficients (e. g. reducing viscosity and changing the number of peaks in thermal conductivity), while the addition of O 2 with C 5 F 10 O-CO 2 mixtures has no remarkable influence on both thermodynamic and transport properties...|$|E
40|$|SF 6 (Sulphur HexaFluoride) gas is {{exclusively}} {{used as a}} dielectric insulator and <b>arc</b> <b>quenching</b> {{medium in}} high voltage power networks. The electronegative properties of the gas {{and its ability to}} recombine after dissociation make it a gas of choice for high voltage equipment. However, SF 6 is a greenhouse gas and therefore research is needed to find an alternative. This thesis explores the potential of PolyTetraFluoroEthylene (PTFE) powder as a dielectric insulator. This has been deployed in a compacted form and when buoyant in air. This approach opens up new avenues for existing research related to gaseous dielectrics and current interruption through the utilisation of small particulates made from insulating materials. A detailed database, of breakdown voltage signals and high speed camera shots, has been compiled to facilitate comparative analysis of the effect of airborne polymer (e. g. PTFE) powders on breakdown voltage across different gap widths, relative to SF 6. The breakdown voltage results which were obtained from experimental tests to demonstrate an effect on the voltage withstand that these airborne materials have comparable to that of SF 6. Also, their ability to suppress electrical discharges between dielectric probe contacts is also demonstrated {{during the course of this}} thesis. In addition, a combined electrical/optical system has been constructed in order to investigate the relationship between airborne particle concentration and the resultant breakdown voltage between electrodes. The optical system was tested using smoke particles prior to its utilisation for powder particles. For both smoke and powder systems, chromaticity was utilised to assess changes in particle density. A model was used to interpret the optical signal and thereby estimate the concentration of airborne particles. This employs factors such as the refractive index, particle radius and essentially the ratio of the light source intensity as seen through the container with scattering particles to the intensity of the same light source seen through the same container without scattering particles.

40|$|Due to its {{excellent}} <b>arc</b> <b>quenching</b> capability, SF 6 -gas {{is widely}} used for medium voltage switchgear. Because it is a highly potent greenhouse gas, {{it is expected to}} be many restrictions for the allowed use of this gas in near future. It is therefore important to conduct research on development of more environmental friendly switchgear. The challenge is to keep both the interruption capability and volume, of todays SF 6 insulated switchgear. One of the most promising solution to this challenge, is to use ablation material to improve the current interruption capability. Experimental work with an ablation-assisted circuit breaker, is the foundation for the work in this thesis. The primary aim of this thesis is to evaluate the arc voltage distribution inside an ablation tube during ablation-assisted current interruption, using air as the insulation medium. This is performed by gathering the readouts from three high voltage resistive probes placed at different key locations in the plasma arc. The first part of the thesis contains work performed to weed out any large sources of measurement error. From previous work, {{it was found that the}} experimental setup used in this work contained one or more of these sources. The second part of this work contains the experimental portion of this work. This part explains how the tests were conducted, and lists the results together with a discussion around their significance and wider implications. By applying the corrections suggested in this work, the probes gave valuable results for conductivity measurements in switching arcs. The results are considered valid for measurements from contact separation and until 100 μs after current interruption. The results show clearly that the field strength was significantly higher where the gas outlet was located, when the pressure inside the ablation tube was low. When acting as a "self-blast" switch, which increased the pressure, gave the system an increase in field strength. Additionally, there was also a change in the position of the field strength peaks. With an increase in pressure, the field strength changed from being largest over the gas outlet to being largest over the first few millimeters of the arc...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{discharges}} {{have been}} used extensively in devices for interruption of fault currents. Much work has investigated the use of arc discharges for interrupting DC current. The problem with DC current {{is that there is}} no natural current zero where thermal losses from the arc dominate thus leading to arc extinction and the interruption of fault current. Helical arc been arranged by using splitter blades to separate the arc turns. The expansion of a helical arc confined between polymeric splitter blades is governed by both electromagnetic and aerodynamic forces. These arise due to the complex interaction between the individual arc turns, arc/ splitter blade interactions and surrounding media. These interactions can be exploited to control the rate of expansion. During this expansion stage there is a substantial increase in arc voltage which in low voltage systems can limit the current thereby causing current interruption providing the <b>arc</b> <b>quenching</b> conditions are suitable. An experimental study has been undertaken to assess the fundamental characteristics of helical arcs con�fined between �different arrangements of PTFE, PE and copper blades in three different sizes (180 mm, 360 mm and 500 mm). Significant improvements in arc current limitation and interruption capability are observed when the arc voltage increases. A substantial increase in arc voltage was observed for all combinations of copper/ PTFE splitter blades. It was noted that the prospective fault current is forced to near zero when copper blades are used in conjunction with PTFE blades. With the larger PTFE and PE blades sized 360 mm and 500 mm, it was observed that the arc stayed within the limit of blades, thus providing better arc control capability. Simplified modelling of the forces acting on the arc (electromagnetic, aerodynamic) have been assessed. The electromagnetic forces act not only to produce radial expansion of the arc but also to keep alignment between the turns. The generation of the aerodynamic forces is very complex to model and indeed the modelling presented can only be used indicatively in any analysis at this stage. The work indicates that a compact DC interruption device may be possible based on the confinement of the plasma within the splitter blades and interaction with polymeric material...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{switching}} technology and switchgear industry, the insulation properties of gases are extensively utilized as excellent methods of <b>arc</b> <b>quenching.</b> To optimize {{the efficiency and}} effectiveness of switchgear performance in interruption of the fault current through extinguishing the arc {{as well as to}} withstand the rate of rise of recovery voltage (rrrv) after current zero, the properties of these gases have been utilized. The present research is to develop a technique to identify the probe current flow during the weakened dielectric strength of the gases. Through the probe current flow during the weakened dielectric strength of the gases, the behaviour of the gases are described and compared since gases are most used in the circuit breaker for fault current extinction. In particular, the properties of sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) gas have been widely utilized due to its outstanding properties, but, given the connection of SF 6 with global warming, there is a drive to find alternatives (National Electrical Manufacturers Association). Although the exposed SF 6 gas is recycled back into the cylinder after exposure, there may be some leakages into the atmosphere. More so, the decomposed SF 6 gas into sulphur-fluoride and metal fluoride powdery substances when exposed to the environment after the gas might have been recycled may contribute to global warming at a later period. Hence, this research is focused to develop a technique used to determine the behavior of alternative gases which are potential candidates to replace SF 6. The work is an experimental assessment of gases and their reaction to the presence of an arc discharge and recovery from that exposure. The investigation of these gases is achieved by using a negative DC voltage-biased dielectric probe and monitoring small current flow through this probe. The primary gases considered are dry air, nitrogen (N 2) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) as a comparison. The probe current flowing through these gases are investigated and identified respectively. The research identifies the variation in leakage current in compressed dry air in a changing electric field and pressure rise, typical examples of gas behaviour in an electric field. The search indicates that nitrogen gas is more susceptible to the fault current as compared to dry air, followed by sulphur hexafluoride SF 6 gas. These gases were examined from the probe current flow responses obtained from the negative DC voltage-biased dielectric probe when the fault current was passed in the gases’ respective vicinity. Consequently, the research identified that a SF 6 dielectric medium has better insulation property regarding the fault current as compared to dry air and N 2 gas mediums under the same experimental conditions. The probe current flow in N 2 gas was experimentally determined and calculated, and the direction of current flow before and during the arcing period of the arc discharge was also identified. The direction of current depended on the circuit condition; in this case, the dielectric probe operates below its breakdown voltage in the gas, meaning the probe tips and the surrounding gas may have with positive ions, thus applying the positive half cycle of fault current will repel the positive ions while recombining with the negative ions and electrons. Moreover, the polarities of the probe voltages (input V 1 and output V 2) may also influence the direction of the probe current flow during the arcing period, since current flow is conventionally from negative to positive. The probe current flowing during the arc was identified as more when compared to no arc discharge. The gap resistance for nitrogen gas at various increases in pressure before and during the arcing era were also calculated. The result demonstrates that the gap resistance of nitrogen gas is greater when no arc was present, though both show some forms of variation over time...|$|E
