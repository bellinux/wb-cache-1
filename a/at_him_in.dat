5|$|On {{his way to}} Denmark through Belgium on 4 April 1900 Edward was {{the victim}} of an {{attempted}} assassination, when fifteen-year-old Jean-Baptiste Sipido shot <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> protest over the Boer War. Sipido, though obviously guilty, was acquitted by a Belgian court because he was underage. The perceived laxity of the Belgian authorities, combined with British disgust at Belgian atrocities in the Congo, worsened the already poor relations between the United Kingdom and the Continent. However, in the next ten years, Edward's affability and popularity, as well as his use of family connections, assisted Britain in building European alliances.|$|E

After opening a locked box atop an altar, Adrienne unknowingly releases Carno's demon, which promptly possesses Don. Don starts acting menacingly and aggressively toward Adrienne and becomes progressively worse as time passes, culminating in a controversial scene in which he rapes Adrienne. Eventually, Adrienne meets Harriet Hockaday (V. Joy Lee), a superstitious vagrant, and her strong but dim-witted son, Cyrus (Steven W. Bailey), who are secretly living in a barn on the estate. After Adrienne agrees to let them stay, they volunteer to help around the mansion. When a technician named Mike (Carl Neimic) visits the mansion to install the phone, Don screams <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a jealous rage, warning him {{to stay away from}} his wife, much to Adrienne's horror. Later, unbeknownst to Adrienne, Don bludgeons Mike to death.|$|E

5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Pembleton (Andre Braugher), an {{excellent}} detective but a lone wolf, {{that he must}} work with a partner. Pembleton ends up investigating {{the death of a}} 65-year-old man with rookie detective Bayliss (Kyle Secor). Bayliss initially believes the death to be a heart attack, but Pembleton correctly determines it is a murder because the man's car is missing. Police later arrest a man named Johnny (Alexander Chaplin) who is found driving the dead man's car. During an interrogation, Pembleton fools Johnny into waiving his Miranda Rights, then sneakily persuades him into confessing to the murder. Bayliss, although convinced of Johnny's guilt, nevertheless questions the ethics of Pembleton's approach, prompting Pembleton to yell angrily <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> front of the other officers. The episode ends with Bayliss responding to his first homicide as the primary detective: the brutal murder of an 11-year-old girl named Adena Watson.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of September 18, 1964, Kinne left the hotel without Pugliese, either to acquire money because the couple was running low or to get {{medicine}} she required. Kinne encountered Francisco Parades Ordoñez, a Mexican-born American citizen, at a bar that night and accompanied {{him back to his}} room in Hotel La Vada. According to Kinne's account, she went with Ordoñez to see photographs he offered to show her, but he soon began to make sexual advances toward her and she was forced to fire her gun <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to protect herself. Kinne maintained later that she had had no intention of killing or harming Ordoñez, and had intended only to frighten him, but her bullets struck him in the chest and killed him. Responding to the sound of gunfire, hotel employee Enrique Martinez Rueda entered the room. Kinne fired again and hit Rueda in the shoulder. Wounded, Rueda fled the room, locking Kinne inside, and called the police.|$|E
5|$|A new convoy, codenamed Operation Excess {{was on its}} {{way through}} Malta with {{ammunition}} supplies. Excess coincided {{with the arrival of the}} Luftwaffe Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps) in Sicily to support the faltering Italians in the theatre, after the failed invasion of Egypt. On 9 January the Regia Aeronautica flew a fighter sweep over the Grand Harbour. Eighteen Macchi C.200s from 6° Gruppo were engaged in aerial combat. MacLachlan climbed to 22,000 feet and spotted the enemy fighters 10,000 below. He attacked a group of six and shot one down into the sea where it left a large plume of water. MacLachlan circled the sea and noticed the Italian pilot had escaped his aircraft and survived. Capitano Luigi Armanino was taken aboard a rescue craft to a prisoner of war camp in Malta, wounded in the thigh and arm. MacLachlan claimed a second Macchi shot down minutes later. The following day he attacked an Italian Fiat CR.42 over the Excess convoy as the Italians attacked the ships once more. Four others appeared and they climbed over him and dropped onto his tail. Not risking a five to one encounter, MacLachlan flew over the Excess convoy hoping the ship's fire would protect him The British vessels fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> error but his aircraft was not hit.|$|E

25|$|Williams demanded loyalty {{from those}} around him. He could not forgive the fickle {{nature of the}} fans— booing a player for booting a ground ball, then turning around and roaring {{approval}} of the same player for hitting a home run. Despite the cheers and adulation of most of his fans, the occasional boos directed <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Fenway Park led Williams to stop tipping his cap in acknowledgement after a home run.|$|E

After reading Dearborn's account in The Port Folio, Trumbull {{wrote a letter to}} the late General Putnam's son, Daniel, expressing his regrets and disappoint over Dearborn's accusations, defending the general's character and role in the battle. Trumbull maintains that Putnam was at the redoubt and saved the life of British officer, Colonel John Small, and old friend of Putnam's who fought together during the French and Indian War, by ordering colonial soldiers not to fire <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his defenseless state. His letter was later published, along with other veteran accounts, in the 1818 Munroe & Francis publication of Dearborn's and Putnam's accounts.|$|E
25|$|After {{a year in}} Santo, Speck {{moved with}} his mother, his stepfather, and his sister Carolyn to the East Dallas section of Dallas, Texas, living at ten {{addresses}} in poor neighborhoods over the next dozen years. Speck loathed his often drunk and frequently absent stepfather, who psychologically abused him with insults and threats. Speck, a poor student who needed glasses for reading but refused to wear them, struggled through Dallas public schools from fourth through eighth grade, repeating eighth grade at J. L. Long Jr. High School, {{in part because he}} refused to speak in class because of a lifelong fear of people staring <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> autumn 1957, Speck started ninth grade at Crozier Technical High School, but failed every subject and did not return for the second semester in January 1958, dropping out just after his 16th birthday.|$|E
25|$|According to {{accounts}} of the following event reported by Glenn Boyer in I Married Wyatt Earp, Earp had run two cowboys, Tobe Driscall and Ed Morrison, out of Wichita earlier in 1878. During the summer, the two cowboys—accompanied by another two dozen men—rode into Dodge and shot up the town while galloping down Front Street. They entered the Long Branch Saloon, vandalized the room, and harassed the customers. Hearing the commotion, Earp burst through the front door, and before he could react, {{a large number of}} cowboys were pointing their guns <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> another version, there were only three to five cowboys. In both stories, Holliday was playing cards {{in the back of the}} room and upon seeing the commotion, drew his weapon and put his pistol at Morrison's head, forcing him and his men to disarm, rescuing Earp from a bad situation. No account of any such confrontation was reported by any of the Dodge City newspapers at the time. Whatever actually happened, Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day, and the two men became friends.|$|E

25|$|After {{the battle}} fatigue started {{affecting}} the King Porus, he {{slowly began to}} retire. Throughout the battle, Alexander {{is said to have}} observed with growing admiration, the valor of King Porus and understood that he intended to be killed in combat. Hoping {{to save the life of}} this competent leader and warrior, Alexander commanded Taxiles to summon Porus for surrender. However, Porus turned indignant on the very sight of his nemesis and tossed a spear <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> furor without listening to his proposal forcing him to take flight on his steed. In such manner many other messengers, dispatched by the determined Alexander were spurned, till at last Meroes, a personal friend of Porus convinced him to listen to the message of Alexander. Overpowered by thirst, the weary Porus finally dismounted his War-Elephant and demanded water. After being refreshed, he allowed himself to be taken to Alexander. On hearing that the Indian King was approaching, Alexander himself rode out to meet him and the famous surrender meeting took place.|$|E
25|$|Afonja {{sees him}} {{lying on the}} road and takes him to his residence. Afonja and his wife gave him herbs for relief of his {{constant}} catarrh.

The next morning, he goes to the market square to observe the body language of Prince Aderopo, who suspiciously stares <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> confidence and even winks at him that {{there is no evidence to}} prove he indeed killed the girls. Danladi visits Tawa in the school she works as a teacher, in order to question her about the relationship she has with the Prince. Danladi discovers that Aderopo and Agbekoya are both recipients of a scholarship from a Reverend Father in the town, Father Dowling (Colin David Reese). Danladi visits Agbekoya, who reveals to him that they were constantly molested by the Reverend Father in Lagos city. At a celebration on the eve of Independence, Prince Aderopo invites Tawa to their childhood hideout, which has been renovated.

25|$|From time to time, {{the link}} between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples will be symbolically expressed, through pow-wows or other types of {{ceremony}} held to mark the anniversary of a particular treaty — sometimes with the participation of the monarch, another member of the Canadian Royal Family, or one of the Sovereign's representatives—or simply an occasion mounted to coincide with the presence of a member of the Royal Family on a royal tour, Aboriginals having always been a part of such tours of Canada. Gifts have been frequently exchanged and Aboriginal titles have been bestowed upon royal and viceregal figures {{since the early days of}} indigenous contact with the Crown: The Ojibwa referred to King George III as the Great Father and Queen Victoria was later dubbed as the Great White Mother. Queen Elizabeth II was named Mother of all People by the Salish nation in 1959 and her son, Prince Charles, was in 1976 given by the Inuit the title of Attaniout Ikeneego, meaning Son of the Big Boss. Charles was further honoured in 1986, when Cree and Ojibwa students in Winnipeg named Charles Leading Star, and again in 2001, during the Prince's first visit to Saskatchewan, when he was named Pisimwa Kamiwohkitahpamikohk, or The Sun Looks <b>at</b> <b>Him</b> <b>in</b> a Good Way, by an elder in a ceremony at Wanuskewin Heritage Park.|$|E
