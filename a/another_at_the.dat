5|$|A heated {{confrontation}} between Randy Orton and Edge was seen, with Edge spearing Orton. The following week, {{it was announced}} that Orton would defend the Intercontinental Championship against Edge at Vengeance.

5|$|As in all oryzomyines, {{the upper}} molars all have one root {{on the inner}} (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar in Pseudoryzomys and some other species has another labial root. The first lower molar has large roots at {{the front and back}} of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two roots at the front, one labial and one lingual, and <b>another</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time, the Italian Grand Prix {{was held at}} the Livorno Circuit rather than the {{traditional}} venue of Monza. Caracciola took pole position, and despite two false starts caused by spectators pouring onto the track, held his lead {{for the majority of the}} race and won from his teammate Lang by just 0.4seconds. In doing so Caracciola clinched the European Championship for the second time. He backed up the win with <b>another</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Masaryk Grand Prix two weeks later. He trailed Rosemeyer for much of the race until the Auto Union skidded against a kerb and allowed the Mercedes into the lead.|$|E

Players control one character at a time, and can switch to <b>another</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> press of a button.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, most of Mdina's enciente had {{a system}} of double walls. The land front was flanked by four towers, one near Greeks Gate, <b>another</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre of the land front, the Turri Mastra (also known as Turri dila bandiera) near the main {{entrance}} and the Turri di la Camera at {{the southeast corner of}} the city. A barbican was built near Mdina's main entrance sometime after 1448. In the 1450s there were fears of a Barbary or Ottoman attack, so efforts were made to improve Mdina's walls. The main ditch was completed, and the Castellu di la Chitati was partially demolished by royal licence in 1453, due to its ruinous state and the excessive cost for its upkeep.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one <b>another</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of the Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E

5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and <b>another</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternate}} story line, Nemo admits to Anna he cannot swim; the two spend time together {{and fall in}} love. Anna {{turns out to be}} Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one another. When Harry and Nemo's mother break up, Anna goes to New York with her father, and they lose touch. Years later, Nemo works as a pool cleaner, hoping to run into Anna by chance. They finally see one <b>another</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> train station and immediately recognize each other in a crowd of passers-by. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives him her number, asks him to call her in two days and meet at the lighthouse. However, he loses her number when a sudden downpour makes her note illegible. Nemo waits at the lighthouse every day, but Anna does not come.|$|E
5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; <b>another,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour {{to pack up and}} leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E

5|$|The anteroconid—the cusp at {{the front}} of m1—is usually divided in two by a central {{indentation}} (the anteromedian fossettid) in A.donovani, but this fossettid is absent in A.praeuniversitatis. Behind the anteroconid is the protoconid—metaconid pair of cusps. There is an anterolabial cingulum—a crest {{at the front}} labial margin, in front of the protoconid. There is a long crest behind the metaconid, a mesolophid. There is usually no corresponding crest (an ectolophid) behind the protoconid. Another pair of cusps—the hypoconid and the entoconid—is located {{at the back of the}} tooth. The entoconid, the lingual cusp of the two, is oriented forwards. There is always a large root {{at the front of}} the tooth and <b>another</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back. A.donovani usually has a small labial root between the two large roots and often also another small root at the lingual side, but only one of four A.praeuniversitatis m1s even has the labial rootlet.|$|E
5|$|The canal then looped {{around the}} {{northern}} edge of Horse Marsh to reach West Deeping, where there was another lock. There are visible remains of this lock, indicating that it had stone piers at both ends to support the gates, with turf sides between them. It then crossed King Street. An enclosure map dating from 1810 shows that the road crossed the canal by a ford, but that there was also a footbridge to allow pedestrians to cross the canal without getting wet. From West Deeping to Market Deeping, the canal was close to the northern bank of the northern river channel. There were two more locks in open countryside, and <b>another</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> western edge of the town, after which the cut rejoined the river. The final two locks were built on the River Welland, Briggins Lock in Deeping St James, and Low Lock to the south-east of the village.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} Sitric in the Irish Annals is in 917 {{when he and}} Ragnall, another grandson of Ímar, are described as leading their fleets to Ireland. Sitric sailed his fleet to Cenn Fuait in Leinster, and Ragnall sailed his fleet to Waterford. Niall Glúndub, overking of the Northern Uí Néill saw these Vikings as a threat, and he marched an army south to repel them. The Vikings fought against {{the men of the}} Uí Néill at Mag Femen in County Tipperary and claimed victory, though only through timely reinforcement by Ragnall and his army. This was followed by <b>another</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Confey (also known as the Battle of Cenn Fuait), against Augaire mac Ailella, overking of Leinster, who died in the battle. Augaire's death marked the end of effective opposition to the Vikings' return to Ireland. Sitric led his men on a triumphant return to Dublin, where he established himself as king, while Ragnall returned to England and soon became King of Northumbria.|$|E
