5|$|For {{the central}} {{section of the}} ceiling, Michelangelo has taken four episodes from the story of <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> as told in the first, second and third {{chapters}} of Genesis. In this sequence of three, two of the panels are large and one small.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} original sin. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E

5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It {{was the color of}} the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve.</b> However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} panel of this {{sequence}} Michelangelo combines two contrasting scenes into one panel, that of <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> taking fru{{it from the}} forbidden tree, Eve trustingly taking it from {{the hand of the}} Serpent and Adam eagerly picking it for himself; and their banishment from the Garden of Eden, where they have lived in the company of God, to the world outside where they have to fend for themselves and experience death.|$|E

5|$|Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin {{is a large}} oil and tempera on oak panel painting, usually dated between 1435 and 1440, {{attributed}} to the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. Housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it shows Luke the Evangelist, patron saint of artists, sketching the Virgin Mary as she nurses the Child Jesus. The figures are positioned in a bourgeois interior which leads out towards a courtyard, river, town and landscape. The enclosed garden, illusionistic carvings of <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> on the arms of Mary's throne, and attributes of St Luke are amongst the painting's many iconographic symbols.|$|E

5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Wilhelm Fränger {{argued that}} the triptych's center panel portrays a joyous world when mankind will {{experience}} a rebirth of the innocence enjoyed by <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> before their fall. In his book The Millennium of Hieronymus Bosch, Fränger wrote that Bosch {{was a member of}} the heretical sect known as the Adamiteswho were also known as the Homines intelligentia and Brethren and Sisters of the Free Spirit. This radical group, active in the area of the Rhine and the Netherlands, strove for a form of spirituality immune from sin even in the flesh and imbued the concept of lust with a paradisical innocence.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, {{it was set}} intact into the Kaaba's wall by the prophet Muhammad in the year 605 AD, five years before his first revelation. Since then it has been broken {{into a number of}} {{fragments}} and is now cemented into a silver frame {{in the side of the}} Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. Islamic tradition holds that it fell from heaven as a guide for <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> to build an altar. It has often been described as a meteorite, a hypothesis which is now uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after {{completing}} The Road to Glory, Hawks began writing his next film, Fig Leaves, his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays {{a married couple}} by juxtaposing them in the Garden of Eden and in modern New York City. The Garden of Eden humorously depicts <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> awoken by a Flintstones-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading the morning news on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eve's gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy flapper and fashion model when Adam is at work. The film starred George O'Brien as Adam and Olive Borden as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks's first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.|$|E
5|$|Marge {{dreams that}} she and Homer are <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve.</b> They peacefully live in the Garden of Eden until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the {{forbidden}} tree. He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate many apples, God only caught Eve eating an apple, and she is therefore banished from the Garden of Eden. Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks {{of a way of}} getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the Garden of Eden.|$|E
5|$|The saints are {{identifiable}} from Latin inscriptions {{lining the}} borders of the imitation bronze frame, which is original. Van der Paele is identifiable from historical records. He is dressed in the finery of a medieval canon, including white surplice, as he piously reads from a book of hours. He is presented to Mary by Saint George, his name saint, who holds aloft his metal helmet in respect. Saint Donatian, dressed in brightly coloured vestments, stands to the left. The panel is noted for the finery of clothing, including exquisite representations of furs, silks and brocades, and the elaborate and detailed religious iconography. The Virgin's throne is decorated with carved representations of <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve,</b> prefigurations of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus, and scenes from the Old Testament. The painting is lined with a series of inscriptions which comment on the saints, and include van Eyck's signature.|$|E

5|$|Simonovich-Efimova died on 24 February 1948 in Moscow, Soviet Union. Posthumously, she was {{inducted}} into the International Academy of Puppeteers for her innovations in life-sized puppets. The couple are known as the <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> of Russian puppetry. She left a large legacy, including around 3,000 works, some of which are housed in a memorial workshop at their former home, though art historians mostly ignored her work {{until the end of the}} 20th century. Her works can be seen in the permanent collections of the Russian Museum, Tretyakov Gallery, the Tver Regional Art Gallery, among others. There have been posthumous solo exhibitions of her work in 1959, 1968 and 1975. In 2011, The Museum of Russian Art (TMORA) in Minneapolis, Minnesota included some of her ethnic paintings of women in their native dress. The following year, her 1935 book, Adventures of a Russian Puppet Theatre: Including Its Discoveries in Making and Performing with Hand-Puppets, Rod-Puppets and Shadow-Figures (English version) was reprinted by Martino Publishing. The Efimova crater on Venus is named after Simonovich-Efimova.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is {{the resurrection of the}} just and to the left is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the top is the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E
5|$|The poem is in {{many ways}} deeply Christian, with {{frequent}} references to the fall of <b>Adam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eve</b> and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at {{it in the context of}} the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare Sir Gawain to the other three poems of the Gawain manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem Cleanness (also known as Purity), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in Gawain's case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In Cleanness the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.|$|E
