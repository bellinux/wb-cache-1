Some were old ballads and traditional songs ... but others Bob would make up as he went along. ... We'd play the melody, he'd sing a few words he'd written, and then make up some more, or else just mouth sounds or even syllables as he went along. It's a pretty good way to write songs." [...] Danko told Dylan biographer Howard Sounes, [...] "Bob and Robbie, they would come by every day, five to seven days a week, for seven to eight months." [...] Hudson added, [...] "It <b>amazed</b> <b>me,</b> Bob's writing ability. How he would come in, {{sit down at the}} typewriter, and write a song. And what was amazing was that almost every one of those songs was funny." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Return to Sender" [...] was {{generally}} praised by critics. Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode's [...] "most interesting facet" [...] was its flashbacks to Dexter's youth from Debra's perspective, though {{he felt that the}} young Debra's hasty apology to Dexter after insulting him was [...] "a slightly cheesy moment". He thought that LaGuerta's bonding with Oscar [...] "was okay, but [...] fell a little flat". TV Guides Paula Paige [...] "love" [...] the episode, saying that [...] "It just keeps getting better and better", but was unsure [...] "what Deb having dinner with the Doakes' family has to do with anything". Writing for TV Squad, Jonathan Toomey opened his review of [...] "Return to Sender" [...] by saying, [...] "Dexter did it again. Wowed me. <b>Amazed</b> <b>me.</b> Edge of my seat for the whole hour." [...] He was amused that Debra's profile of Valerie's murderer matched Dexter, but was uninterested in Rita's storyline with her husband.|$|E
500|$|Pullin had a wide {{knowledge}} of the game, and remembered past events and players very clearly. His readers appreciated his expertise and frequently wrote to him with queries. A tribute in the Yorkshire Post after his death suggested that Pullin enjoyed this correspondence and felt very close to his readers. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack stated that [...] "his writings were at all times discriminative, informative and voluminous". The Manchester Guardian noted that Pullin wrote {{at a time when}} many famous cricketers played. It stated that, of these times, he [...] "wrote with a keenness of judgement, a descriptive style, and a fund of anecdote that made the games live again". E.W. Swanton described him as [...] "a thick, bearded fellow" [...] and [...] "a faithful old war-horse". The Yorkshire Post said that Pullin [...] "stood for all the best in sporting critics of the older school... He was proud, and rightly proud, of the high position which he held in sporting journalism and in the administrative circles of the games on which he wrote". The newspaper judged that he wrote about cricket and rugby players [...] "with a clarity akin to genius... There can scarcely be a football or cricket ground in England where he was not known and welcomed, and his striking appearance and still more striking personality became traditional in the Press box which he graced. To the players of the games he was generous in praise and kindly in his criticism." [...] Gerald Pawle was told when he became a journalist in 1931 that Pullin originally sent reports to his newspaper by pigeon. Pawle writes: [...] "For the vast Yorkshire cricketing public Old Ebor wrote at inordinate length, unhampered by any consideration of literary style—he was one of the severely factual school—and it <b>amazed</b> <b>me</b> how any pigeon ever struggled into the air when shackled to one of his weighty effusions." ...|$|E

[...] "I didn't think it would work," [...] Chuck D admitted of the full-length performance. [...] "But it ended up being something that worked tremendously well. Now we have a problem to get away from it. It <b>amazed</b> <b>me</b> {{that a lot of people}} who have gravitated to the album weren't even born when it was recorded. But it's YouTube and iLike and MySpace and file sharing which highlighted the existence of it. So I can't shoot down file sharing, as it's benefited us tremendously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrews' {{stepfather}} sponsored {{lessons for}} her, {{first at the}} Cone-Ripman School (now known commonly as ArtsEd), an independent arts educational school in London, then with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame Lilian Stiles-Allen. [...] "She had an enormous influence on me", Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, adding, [...] "She was my third mother– I've got more mothers and fathers {{than anyone in the}} world." [...] In her memoir Julie Andrews – My Star Pupil, Stiles-Allen records: [...] "The range, accuracy, and tone of Julie's voice <b>amazed</b> <b>me</b> ... she had possessed the rare gift of absolute pitch" [...] (though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography Home). According to Andrews: [...] "Madame was sure that I could do Mozart and Rossini, but, to be honest, I never was". Of her own voice, she says [...] "I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range – dogs would come for miles around." [...] After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.|$|E

2500|$|On 9 November Blamey {{addressed}} {{the men of}} the 21st Brigade on the parade ground at Koitaki. The men of Maroubra Force expected congratulations for their efforts in holding back the Japanese. However, instead of praising them, Blamey told the brigade that they had been [...] "beaten" [...] by inferior forces, and that [...] "no soldier should be afraid to die". Captain H.D. [...] "Blue" [...] Steward, medical officer of the 2/16th recalled [...] "The troops could have withstood the Japanese field gun more easily than what they received. Blamey got them on edge almost at once by saying that they had been beaten by inferior troops in inferior numbers. Then he made his famous remark that 'the rabbit that ran away is the rabbit that got shot'. The whole parade was almost molten with rage and indignation." [...] Blamey's personal assistant Lieutenant Colonel Norman Carlyon, realised that damage had been done. [...] "Standing beside the small platform from which Blamey was to address the troops, I realised that he was in a most aggressive mood. He was soon expressing this in harsh words ... It <b>amazed</b> <b>me</b> that Blamey should deal so insensitively with the men of such a well-proven brigade." ...|$|E
