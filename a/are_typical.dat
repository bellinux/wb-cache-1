5|$|Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> data-link {{protocols}} {{for larger}} networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> data-link protocols for LANs.

Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.|$|E
5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E

5|$|The calls {{given by}} flocks near the {{breeding}} areas <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> swift screams, including a trilled tsiririri or harsher spee-eer.

50|$|The {{ultraviolet}} protection factor (UPF) is {{a similar}} scale developed for rating fabrics for sun protective clothing.

5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, most Russian churches from before the Petrine period had bulbous domes. The largest onion domes were erected in the seventeenth century in the area around Yaroslavl, {{incidentally}} famous for its large onions. Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with Ukrainian Baroque, while cone-shaped domes <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E
5|$|Durian {{flowers are}} large and {{feathery}} with copious nectar, and give off a heavy, sour, and buttery odour. These features <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> of flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat nectar and pollen. According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (Eonycteris spelaea); however, a 1996 study indicated two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.|$|E

The general spider's {{approach and}} capture <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> for salticids hunting prey that has high ability to escape. Two modes of approach {{in close proximity}} of prey were observed. One <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> {{for the majority of}} predatory encounters where the spider's velocity was significantly reduced with decreasing distance to prey. Stalk and movement masking <b>were</b> <b>typical</b> for this type of approach.

5|$|Freshwater {{resident}} {{rainbow trout}} usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are {{native to the}} alluvial or freestone streams that <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks. Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.|$|E
5|$|George placed B.epica in B.subg. Banksia, {{because its}} inflorescences <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> Banksia flower spikes; B.sect. Banksia {{because of its}} {{straight}} styles; and B.ser. Cyrtostylis because it has slender flowers. He considered its closest relatives to be B.praemorsa (cut-leaf banksia) and B.media, {{both of which have}} shorter flowers and smaller pollen-presenters than B.epica. In addition, B.praemorsa differs in having a hairless perianth, and B.media has larger, more undulate leaves.|$|E
5|$|H. erectus {{arrived in}} Eurasia {{approximately}} 1.8 million years ago, in an event {{considered to be}} the first African exodus. There is evidence that the Java population of H. erectus lived in an ever-wet forest habitat. More specifically the environment resembled a savannah, but was likely regularly inundated ("hydromorphic savanna"). The plants found at the Trinil excavation site included grass (Poaceae), ferns, Ficus, and Indigofera, which <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> of lowland rainforest.|$|E
