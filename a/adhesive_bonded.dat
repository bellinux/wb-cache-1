A system, built up of a steel frame, a single glass pane and a flexible <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> joint across the full thickness of the glass pane was subjected to a concentrated horizontal in-plane load at the top. Experiments with square glass pane sizes showed that the system had a very small inplane stiffness, a glass-steel contact at large horizontal in-plane loads and a good residual capacity. The parametric studies by means of finite element models only focused on the variation of the geometry of the glass pane. The behaviour of the system mainly depends on the stiffness of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> joint. At larger horizontal in-plane displacements, systems with rectangular glass pane sizes have two glass-steel contacts. The mechanic models well predict the in-plane stiffness of the system, the largest maximum principle stress and the maximum normal and shear stresses in the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> joint. The horizontal in-plane load and the horizontal in-plane displacement at the top at the first glass-steel contact are also well predicted. The criteria are the limitation of the horizontal in-plane displacement at the top (serviceability) or the strain rate of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> joint (strength). To guarantee the stability of a building all glass panes in the facade have to be mobilized to transfer in-plane load...|$|E

40|$|A {{thermoplastic}} adhesive bonding process {{was developed for}} galvanized steel to polypropylene (PP) composite using a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) based adhesive with a total process cycle of less than 120 seconds. The processing temperature significantly affected the strength of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> lap joints. Cataplasma and cyclic moisture/temperature aging tests demonstrated that the hot-dipped galvanized steel with a polyester melamine based primer did not improve the joint durability of galvanized steel to PP composite bonded with this HDPE based adhesive. The significant loss in the adhesion of the primer to galvanized steel under Cataplasma environment {{was due to the}} blistering of the primer. The blistering was essentially a process of the cathodic disbondment. ^ The fracture performance of HDPE based <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> double cantilever beam (DCB) aluminum joints was investigated. The fracture toughness, 1. 77 kJ/m 2, of the joints with a bondline thickness of 0. 2 mm at a testing crosshead speed of 5. 08 mm/minute, derived from beam theory equation, was significantly different from fracture toughness, 2. 54 kJ/m 2, obtained by cohesive zone model (CZM) approach, in which Needleman 2 ̆ 7 s modified exponential traction-separation law was employed. The large amount of deformation occurring in adhesive ahead of the crack tip significantly contributes the fracture toughness of joints. A modified equation was proposed to compute the fracture toughness of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> DCB joints. ^ The mechanical properties of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> DCB joints are strongly rate-dependent due to the viscoelasticity of the adhesive layer.

40|$|Abstract: The current {{quest for}} low weight {{structures}} {{has led to}} {{a significant increase in the}} use of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> joints more so for applications involving fibre reinforced composite materials. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> joints have major advantages over conventional joining methods such as riveting and bolting; and the nature of composite materials precludes use of other conventional methods such as welding, brazing and soldering. These advantages include lower structural weight due to lower density of the adhesive compared to traditional structural joining materials, lower fabrication costs, resistance to environmental degradation, better aesthetic appeal, lower stress concentrations, noise and vibration isolation capabilities and relative ease of use. Incorporating <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> joints into mechanical component design requires a higher level of understanding of adhesive joint behaviour. In particular it is important to understand the load transfer and joint failure mechanisms operative in the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> joints. A lot of design information is available on conventional joining methods while information on design of bonded joints remains restricted to specialised applications such as automotive and aerospace. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of bond thickness on the load transfer between a steel insert and tubular glass fibre reinforced composite component under axial loading. A finite element analysis model is developed to analyse the behaviour of the joint. The model is validated using experimentally measured tensile response data for a selected insert length and adhesive layer thickness. The obtained results show the close relationship between the load transfer distances with adhesive elastic modulus. Furthermore the stress distribution along the adhesive bond layer was found to be independent of adhesive layer thickness. Adhesive layer thickness also has insignificant contribution to stress levels and load transfer distance...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. In {{the distant}} past, {{adhesive}} materials {{were considered to}} be a kind of mere glue. But today adhesive materials are used extensively in the field of manufacturing because of the good properties they exhibit. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> aluminum laminates are well known materials that belong to the family of metal laminates. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> aluminum laminates are made by joining several thin sheets of aluminum. These sheets are bonded by an adhesive material in between. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> aluminum laminates when compared to the monolithic aluminum plates, exhibit very good mechanical and chemical properties. They also exhibit some useful properties such as weight reduction, capability of withstanding high loads, thermal resistance, etc. Because of this, they are widely used in aerospace, marine and automobile fields, particularly in manufacturing of doublers plates. Optimizing the design of structural joint will definitely improve the load carrying capability of the structural joint. Identifying the significant factors that affect the structural joint is one way to avoid failure at the joints. The main purpose of this study is to predict the stress concentration around the hole in single and double lap joints of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonded</b> aluminum laminate. A three dimensional finite element model is developed in ABAQUS to know the effect of stress concentration and is validated by comparing the results of the finite element model with the results obtained from theoretical closed form solution. The present study shows the relationship between the stress concentration around the hole and the Young‟s modulus of the adhesive material, Radius of the fastener holes, Distance between the fastener holes, position of the adhesive layer and number of the adhesive layers.

40|$|In this work, {{ultrasonic}} {{techniques to}} nondestructively evaluate <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation have been studied. The {{key to the}} present approach is the introduction of an external factor which pulls the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> in the nonlinear range, simultaneously with the application of an ultrasonic technique. With the aid of an external static tensile loading, a superimposed longitudinal wave has. been used to obtain {{the slopes of the}} stress-strain curve of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> at a series of load levels. The critical load, at which a reduction of the slope is detected by the superimposed longitudinal wave, is an indication of the onset of nonlinear behavior of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond,</b> and therefore of bond degradation. This approach has been applied to the detection of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation induced by cyclic fatigue loading. Analogously to the longitudinal wave case, a superimposed shear wave has been used to obtain the effective shear modulus of adhesive layers at different shear load levels. The onset of the nonlinear behavior of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> under shear loading has been detected by the use of a superimposed shear wave. Experiments show that a longitudinal wave can also detect the nonlinear behavior when an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> is subjected to shear loading. An optimal combination of ultrasonic testing and mechanical loading methods for the detection of degradation related nonlinear behavior of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds</b> has been discussed. For the purpose of a practical application, an ultrasonic technique that uses a temperature increase as an alternative to static loading has also been investigated. A general strain-temperature correspondence principle that relates a mechanical strain to a temperature has been presented. Explicit strain-temperature correspondence relations for both the tension and shear cases have been derived. An important parameter which quantifies the relation between the wave velocity and temperature has been defined. This parameter, which is indicative of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> nonlinearity and which can be conveniently obtained by an ultrasonic measurement, has been used as an indication of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation.
