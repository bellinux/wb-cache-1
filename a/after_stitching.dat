50|$|The reticella was {{the design}} {{that was the}} {{catalyst}} of the transition between fabrics made into lace by subtracting threads after needling, and lace made from scratch without fabric support. The reticella design required one to draw out threads <b>after</b> <b>stitching</b> onto fabric. As that design evolved, {{an increasing number of}} threads required withdrawing. Eventually, so many threads were drawn-out that the foundation became very flimsy and lace makers devised a new framework that did not require original foundation fabric.

50|$|Many {{360-degree}} videos are {{labelled as}} 3D or VR, {{but some experts}} argue that these terms should be used more narrowly. If <b>after</b> <b>stitching</b> {{there is only one}} 360x180 equirectangular image then the resulting video is 2D and not 3D. It takes two distinct 360x180 equirectangular images to make a 3D video. For this reason, most content labelled as 3D is not 3D. Likewise, representations of reality made using a computer do not necessarily include any virtual simulations for the viewer. As a result of these ambiguities, the term VR should only be used if the content is indeed virtual.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{profiler}} is {{a typical}} modern device for precision form error measurement. In our use of the equipment, {{we found that the}} surface form profile <b>after</b> <b>stitching</b> is ambiguous if the lens magnification is changed. The error in terms of PV value can be up to 3200 % when the lens magnification changes from 2. 5 times to 30 times. This has been confirmed by the equipment supplier. It is worthwhile to offer a comprehensive study as many users may use the instrument of the kind straightforward without detailed investigation of the performance. We found that, among the 6 key parameters studied, 3 independent parameters are more important. For the 3 independent parameters, we recommend to set the magnification A= 2. 5 times, the resolution r= 0. 5, and the overlap p= 20 %. With the recommended settings, the measurement error can be less than 0. 5 %. Backscan and length for scanning in the vertical direction, and cut off frequency for delivering form profile are less critical compared with the three independent parameters. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications...|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{large number}} of women undergo {{caesarean}} section throughout the world. These women pass {{through a period of}} post operative pain and a morbidity period. These women translate into a substantial portion of population and hence there is a load on the financial resources of healthcare system. Use of the appropriate technique to approximate the wound after caesarean section would not only avoid financial load but also help in early recovery of the patient. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the effects of alternative techniques for closure of subcutaneous fat and skin on maternal health and use of healthcare resources in caesarean section. Materials and Methods: Patients undergoing Caesarean section were divided in two groups of one thousand patients each. Patients with hematological disorders or a malignancy, diabetes, septicemia or chorioamnionitis were excluded from the study. In all the patients, <b>after</b> <b>stitching</b> the uterus, the rectus sheath was stitched with thread vicryl No. 1 (synthetic absorbable braided sutures with polyglycolic acid, polycaprolactone and calcium stearate coating), using a round body needle. Then the patients were divided into two groups. In group I, vicryl No. 1 thread used in stitching of the rectus sheath was continued into the skin with application of subcuticular stitches, after securing the edges with a knot. In group II, <b>after</b> <b>stitching</b> the rectus sheath with vicryl No. 1, the thread was cut and interrupted sutures were applied in subcutaneous fat with thread vicryl No. 2. Skin was stitched with subcuticular stitches using proline 2, a non-absorbable propylene suture. The two groups of patients were observed for the duration of surgery, post-operative pain in stitches, patient satisfaction about removal of stitches, evidence of wound infection or seroma, and cosmetic results. Results: It was noted that the duration of surgery in group I was on average 7. 5 minutes less as compared to the duration in group II. Patients in group I were more satisfied with the results of the surgery and were relieved to know that their stitches did not need to be removed. Conclusion: Although no difference was found in the rates of wound infection and formation of scar tissue between the group I and group II, the duration of surgery was less and the patients were more satisfied in group I...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for testing {{aspheric}} surfaces by annular subaperture stitching interferometry is introduced. It can test large-aperture and large-relative-aperture aspheric surfaces at high resolution, low cost, and high efficiency without auxiliary null optics. The basic {{principle of the}} method is described, the synthetical optimization stitching model and effective algorithm are established based on simultaneous least-square fitting. A hyperboloid with an aperture of 350 mm is tested by this method. The obtained peak-to-valley (PV) and root-mean-square (RMS) values of the surface error <b>after</b> <b>stitching</b> are 0. 433 λ and 0. 052 λ (λ is 632. 8 nm), respectively. The reconstructed surface map is coincide with the entire surface map from null test, and the difference of PV and RMS errors between them are 0. 031 λ and 0. 005 λ, respectively. This stitching model provides another quantitive method for testing large aspheric surfaces besides null compensation. OCIS codes: 220. 4840, 120. 3940, 120. 3180, 070. 4560.

30|$|A {{graphical}} {{user interface}} allows for intuitive operation for both the capture as the processing. A large painting like the Jewish Bride by Rembrandt consisted out of 240 captures, which all need to be stitched {{to each other in}} order to have one coherent capture. Since the registration between our depth and color data perfectly overlaps, we can use the color information to stitch multiple captures in 3 -D, since this is directly linked to the color information. This was again done through SIFT keypoint extraction with sub-pixel accuracy and matching. Since our captures are highly accurate, only basic rotation and translation between consecutive captures were necessary for the stitching, without any need of scaling or warping. Around 20 % overlap was taken between each neighboring capture. <b>After</b> <b>stitching,</b> investigation of the overlap of neighboring captures revealed there was no spatial discrepancy visible between separate captures. On a global scale, we also visually verified the absence of shape deformation caused by our stitching through single images acquired by the institutions themselves. Due to the enormous amount of information captured of this specific painting, data stitching took almost two weeks on a high end PC.|$|E

40|$|Delamination of {{advanced}} composite materials due to various scenarios such as low velocity and ballistic impacts and high strain rate {{is one of}} the major problems for aerospace and automotive structural applications. The low velocity impact does not immediately induce any visible damage on the surface of structures whilst the stiffness and compressive strength of the structures decrease dramatically. Shape memory alloy (SMA) materials possess many unique mechanical, thermal and thermal–mechanical properties compared with other conventional materials. Many studies have reported that the superelastic and hysteresis properties of the SMA materials can absorb energies coming from external excitations or sudden impacts. Stitching is well recognized as a promising technique to enhance the through-the-thickness reinforcement, in order to improve the delamination properties of composite structures. By stitching SMA wires into the composite structures one is theoretically able to reduce the risk of delamination of the structures during impact. In this paper, the damage resistance properties of SMA stitched glass/epoxy composites after low velocity impact are experimentally and theoretically studied. The results show that the tensile strength of composite plates increased and the number of translaminar cracks decreased after being stitched by SMA wires. Theoretical study also proves that the delamination energy of composite plates <b>after</b> <b>stitching</b> by superelastic SMA wires is smaller than that of an unstitched composite plate because of the energy absorbed by the SMA wires.

30|$|The main {{indication}} for sacrospinous ligament suspension is {{to correct}} total procidentia, a posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse, or a posthysterectomy enterocele. The operation is effective for anatomic correction but does distort the vaginal axis. Because of the distorted vaginal axis, dyspareunia {{is a possible}} postoperative complication after sacrospinous fixation and, generally, is an operation considered for the sexually less active patient [34]. De novo dyspareunia after sacrospinous ligament fixation has been evaluated in a few publications. Nieminen et al. [34, 35] evaluated 122 cases of unilateral sacrospinous ligament fixation and 33 were sexually active with a median length of follow-up of 24  months; the rate of reported dyspareunia was 9 % (three out of 33).

This study aimed to evaluate sexual function and anatomic outcome for patients after sacrospinous ligament suspension. METHODS: For this study, 52 {{patients who had}} undergone sacrospinous ligament fixation during the preceding 5 years {{were asked to complete}} the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. The patients were vaginally examined using the ICS POP score, and the results were compared with their preoperative status. For statistical analysis, GraphPad for Windows, version 4. 0, was used. RESULTS: The 52 patients were examined during a follow-up period of 38 months. No major intraoperative complications were noted. Recurrence of symptomatic apical descent was noted in 6 % of the patients and de novo prolapse in 13. 5 %. Only one patient was symptomatic.
