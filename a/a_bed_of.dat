5|$|A {{teaser trailer}} has been {{released}} on 5 November 2012. The teaser shows Björk stuck in <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> quicksand, wearing a blue wig. The video was premiered at an exclusive screening at the MOCA Grand Avenue on November 12, 2012. It was digitally released on November 13, 2012 on MOCA YouTube's channel, MOCAtv, {{as part of a}} series of music videos called ART+MUSIC which features collaborations between artists and musicians. The channel also posted a behind-the-scenes video on the same day. The video features glimpses of filming and an interview with the director of the video, who explains the filming process.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke is {{situated}} on <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of clayey and loamy soil, inset with combined clay and flint patches. Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line {{the bed of}} the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John throughPopley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which has in the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Frank McNamara made <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> {{leaves for}} the {{survivor}} {{and built a}} fire to help keep him as warm and comfortable as possible. McNamara stayed with the survivor while Inkpen went to summon help. After several hours, ambulance crews arrived and administered first-aid and morphia. Rescue workers constructed a stretcher using saplings, bandages and overcoats. They covered the survivor with an overcoat and carried him for two hours to cover about two miles through thickly wooded country to McNamara's utility truck, which then carried him and his rescuers to a waiting ambulance.|$|E
40|$|During a {{study of}} dietary effects on {{reproductive}} efficiency in female rats, high mortality among the sucking pups was observed in both control and experi-mental groups. This mortality was attributed to keeping the pups on <b>a</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>of</b> highly aromatic cedar-wood shavings. The experiment described demonstrates this effect and warns of the hazards in raising rat pups on <b>a</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>of</b> cedar-wood shavings. Pick & Little (1965) have shown that keeping rats on <b>a</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>of</b> cedar-wood shavings affected the thresholds of response to pentylenetetrazol, but no studies of the effects <b>of</b> such <b>bedding</b> on pup growth and mortality have been reported. The present experiment also describes the suitability <b>of</b> rat <b>bedding</b> materials consisting <b>of</b> ground corncobs and shredded aspen shavings. In <b>a</b> later study, <b>bedding</b> made from hardwood chips ('Betta Chip'; Northeastern Product...|$|R

5000|$|For floors, {{quarry tile}} is usually set in <b>a</b> thick <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> {{cementitious}} mortar. For wall applications, {{it can be}} set in either <b>a</b> thick <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> cementitious mortar or <b>a</b> thin <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> mastic. For both floors and walls, the joints between tiles are usually grouted with cementitious grout. Grout joints are traditionally about [...] inch in width. Matching trim shapes such as coves, bases, shoes, and bullnoses are available to turn corners and terminate runs of the tile.|$|R
5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{includes}} a depiction of the city wall, and two silver strips representing the River Avon and the hot springs. The sword of St. Paul is a link to Bath Abbey. The supporters, a lion and a bear, stand on <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> acorns, a link to Bladud, {{the subject of the}} Legend of Bath. The knight's helmet indicates a municipality and the crown is that of King Edgar (referencing his coronation at the Abbey). A mural crown, indicating a city, is alternatively used instead of the helmet and Edgar's crown.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E

5|$|Elcor sat atop <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> {{taconite}} {{consisting of}} a uniform mixture of about 30% iron, interspersed with pockets of high-grade ore, {{a part of the}} Biwabik iron formation. The Biwabik iron formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the Precambrian era {{on the bottom of the}} Animikie Sea. This iron-bearing rock extends under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and Vermilion Iron Ranges, to the Gogebic Iron Range from northern Wisconsin into the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range. Michigan's steel-blue high grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was soft brown hematite. There is iron in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are practical to mine.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Criss Angel {{became the}} creator, director, and {{executive}} producer of the A Network show Criss Angel Mindfreak, and had entered production in January. Seasons 1 and 2 were filmed at The Aladdin in Las Vegas, with Season 3 at the Luxor Las Vegas. Premiering on July 20, 2005, the show's illusions included walking on water, levitating, walking up the side of Luxor Hotel (in the light of 39 focused lamps that can be seen from space), floating between two buildings, causing a Lamborghini to disappear, surviving in an exploding C4 Crate, cutting himself in half in full view of an audience and getting run over by a steamroller while lying on <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> broken glass.|$|E

5|$|Later {{that year}} John Quiller Rowett, who had financed this last {{expedition}} {{and was a}} former schoolfriend of Shackleton’s from Dulwich College, South London, decided to present the James Caird to the college. It remained there until 1967, although its display building was severely damaged by bombs in 1944. In 1967, the boat {{was given to the}} care of the National Maritime Museum, and underwent restoration. It was then displayed by the museum until 1985, when it was returned to Dulwich College and placed in a new location in the North Cloister, on <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> stones gathered from South Georgia and Aberystwyth. This site has become the James Cairds permanent home, although the boat is sometimes lent to major exhibitions and has taken part in the London Boat Show and in events at Greenwich, Portsmouth, and Falmouth. It has travelled overseas to be exhibited in Washington, D.C., New York, Sydney, Australia and Bonn, Germany.|$|E
5|$|Other {{finishing}} {{moves in}} the various Mortal Kombat games include Animalities (introduced in Mortal Kombat 3) turning a victor into an animal to violently finish off the opponent; Brutality (introduced in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) which is bashing an opponent into pieces with a long combo of hits; and Stage Fatalities/Death Traps (introduced in the original Mortal Kombat Pit Stage where the victor can uppercut their opponent off of the platform into <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> spikes below, and later made more difficult in Mortal Kombat II by requiring specific and different button sequences to be pressed) utilizing parts of certain stages to execute a lethal finishing move (such as a pool of acid). Mortal Kombat: Deception added the Hara-Kiri, a self-Fatality allowing the losers {{to engage in a}} suicide-based finishing move (enabling a possible race between both players to see if the winning player can finish off the losing player before the losing character can kill himself or herself first).|$|E
5|$|Seventy-three bais, or forest clearings, {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Nki National Park. In April 2006, while looking for elephant groups, a WWF team discovered the largest bai in the region, Ikwa Bai. Dr. Mike Loomis, {{a member of the}} group, confirmed that this bai is slightly larger than Dzanga Sangha Bai (Central African Republic), which had previously held the record. He also reported little human development adjacent to the bai, and noticed 21 elephants and 16 buffaloes in it simultaneously. The bai has a small creek running through its center, which sits atop <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> rocks and sand. A large mineral pit is located next to the stream. It is the habitat of several wildlife species, the largest-numbering being chimpanzees, elephants, buffaloes, and gorillas.|$|E

5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests on <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid on <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> wood dust or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, {{each of which is}} generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days of age in the wild and up to 30days of age in captivity.|$|E
5|$|He {{returns to}} the {{observation}} room and finds the letter he'd written to Amanda, in which he'd used his knowledge of her role in Jill's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches {{the end of his}} path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape of Kramer that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily shifts the switch and <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> needles swings down and injects William's body with the acid, killing him. Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope, which contains his photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand and jamming the trap as it activates, and he pulls his head free, ripping open his cheek.|$|E
