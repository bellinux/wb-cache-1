5000|$|To produce marzipan, raw almonds are cleaned [...] "by sieving, <b>air</b> <b>elutriation,</b> {{and other}} {{electronic}} or mechanical devices", then immersed in {{water with a}} temperature just below the boiling point for about five minutes, in {{a process known as}} blanching. This loosens the almonds' skin, which is removed by passing the almonds through rubber-covered rotating cylinders. This process reduces hydrogen cyanide (HCN) concentration and increases water content. They are then cooled, after which they are coarsely chopped and ground, with up to 35% sugar, into almond flour.|$|E
40|$|For the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, powder segregation {{can occur in}} many processes such as blending and compression solid dose unit operations. Yet {{it is important that}} the high quality standards of drug product manufacture are maintained throughout the whole processes. Powder segregation has been identified by {{the pharmaceutical}} industry as a potential issue, and in some cases it may cause variability in tablet assay and uniformity throughout a compression run. Early studies suggested for certain Direct Compression (DC) products, the separation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) from excipients could arise due to air-induced segregation of the powders discharging from an Intermediate Bulk Container (IBC) to the tablet press via a vertical chute. Segregation tests were carried out on trial powder blend materials supplied by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), using a laboratory-scale <b>air</b> <b>elutriation</b> test facility at The Wolfson Centre. Particle size analysis of the virgin and segregated sub-samples clearly indicated that powder segregation occurred as a result of aerodynamic effects. Subsequent chemical assay results concurred with the particle size results. Flowability testing of the powder blends indicated them to be free-flowing materials; this in addition to the presence of large particle size differentials within the powder blends is the likely cause of the susceptibility to air-induced segregation...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{volcanic}} eruptions produce fine ash (< 200 Âµm) {{which has a}} long atmospheric residence time (1 hour or more) and can be transported great distances from the volcanic source, thus, becoming a hazard to aircraft and public health. Ash particles have irregular shapes, so data on particle shape, size, and terminal velocities are needed {{to understand how the}} irregular-shaped particles affect transport processes and radiative transfer measurements. In this study, a methodology was developed to characterize particle shapes, sizes, and terminal velocities for three ash samples of different compositions. The shape and size of 2, 500 particles from 1) distal fallout (~ 100 km) of the October 14, 1974 Fuego eruption (basaltic), 2) the secondary maxima (~ 250 km) of the August 18, 1992 Spurr eruption (andesitic), and 3) the Miocene Ash Hollow member, Nebraska (rhyolitic) were measured using image analysis techniques. Samples were sorted into 10 to 19 terminal velocity groups (0. 6 - 59. 0 cm/s) using an <b>air</b> <b>elutriation</b> device. Grain size distributions for the samples were measured using laser diffraction. Aspect ratio, feret diameter, and perimeter measurements were found to be the most useful descriptors of how particle shape affects terminal velocity. These measurement values show particle shape differs greatly from a sphere (commonly used in models and algorithms). The diameters of ash particles were 10 - 120 % larger than ideal spheres at the same terminal velocity, indicating that irregular particle shape greatly increases drag. Gas-adsorption derived surface areas are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than calculated surface areas based on measured dimensions and simple geometry, indicating that particle shapes are highly irregular. Correction factors for surface area were derived from the ash sample measurements so that surface areas calculated by assuming spherical particle shapes can be corrected to reflect more realistic values...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT As ethanol {{production}} is increasing, new processes {{are being developed}} to maximize {{ethanol production}} from corn and to create new, more highly marketable corn distillers dried grains with or without solubles (DDGS or DDG, respectively). This current study evaluated coproducts produced from 2 new modi-fied processes, the enzymatic milling (E-Mill) and the Elusieve process. The E-Mill process subjects the corn kernel to enzymes that hydrolyze starch and help in re-moving germ, pericarp, and endosperm fiber to create a modified higher protein, lower fiber DDG. The Elusieve process involves sieving the finished co-product, DDGS, and then elutriating (air classifying) to remove fiber from the DDGS samples. A precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay was conducted to determine TMEn and amino acid digestibilities of E-Mill DDG and sever-al Elusieve DDGS samples produced using different screen sizes and <b>elutriation</b> <b>air</b> velocities. When com-pared with a conventionally processed DDGS, E-Mill DDG had increased protein (56. 4 vs. 29. 9 %), increased TMEn (3. 656 vs. 3. 299 kcal/g of DM), and higher ami-no acid digestibilities. When DDGS was subjected to various Elusieve processes, the resulting DDGS samples generally had an increased protein content and TMEn. As expected, the higher fiber fractions obtained from the Elusieve process had reduced protein, amino acid concentrations, amino acid digestibilities, and TMEn {{in comparison to the}} lower fiber fractions produced from the Elusieve process. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the Elusieve and E-Mill processes can be used to increase the nutritional value of DDGS for poultry. Nutritional composition, nitrogen-corrected true metabolizable energy, and amino acid digestibilities of new corn distillers dried grains with solubles produced by new fractionation processe...|$|R
