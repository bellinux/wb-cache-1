5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patient.</b> Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E

Transcranial Doppler (TCD) provides information regarding compensatory collateral flow as well as mechanisms of cerebral autoregulation in patients with carotid stenosis. Patients and methodsForty eight symptomatic and 81 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patients</b> with unilateral severe carotid stenosis were examined by TCD before and in early postoperative period after CEA. ResultsCigarette smoking was the only risk factor significantly more frequent in symptomatic patients. Preoperative anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) asymmetry, basilar artery velocity and number of ophthalmic arteries with reversed flow, {{were not significantly different}} between the two groups. Pulsatility index, cerebrovascular reactivity and flow acceleration on the side of stenosis were significantly lower in symptomatic patients. After surgery there was a significant improvement of all TCD parameters in symptomatic as well as <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patients.</b> ConclusionsThe exhausted ability of cerebral autoregulation is an important factor differentiating between symptomatic and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patients</b> with severe carotid stenosis.

We evaluated the potential of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) for prediction of abnormal myocardial perfusion in this population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — CIMT and SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging were assessed in 98 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patients</b> with {{type 2 diabetes}}. An increased CIMT was defined as � 75 th percentile of reference values. RESULTS — Increased CIMT was an independent predictor of the extent of abnormal perfusion (P � 0. 001). In patients with increased CIMT as compared with patients with normal CIMT, abnormal perfusion (75 vs. 9 %) and severely abnormal perfusion (28 vs. 3 %) were observed more frequently. CONCLUSIONS — Increased CIMT was significantly related to the presence and extent of abnormal myocardial perfusion.

BackgroundManagement of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patients</b> with BrS and inducible arrhythmias remains a key issue. Effectiveness of class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, which inhibit the potassium transient outward current {{of the action}} potential, has been suggested in BrS. MethodsFrom a cohort of 106 BrS patients, we studied 35 who received HQ (32 men; mean age 48 ± 11 years). <b>Patients</b> had <b>asymptomatic</b> BrS and inducible arrhythmia (n = 31) or multiple appropriate shocks from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (n = 4). <b>Asymptomatic</b> <b>patients</b> with inducible arrhythmia underwent electrophysiologic (EP) -guided therapy. When ventricular tachycardia (VT) /ventricular fibrillation (VF) inducibility was not prevented, or in case of HQ intolerance, an ICD was placed. ResultsHydroquinidine prevented VT/VF inducibility in 76 % of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patients</b> who underwent EP-guided therapy. Syncope occurred {{in two of the}} 21 patients who received long-term (17 ± 13 months) HQ therapy (1 syncope associated with QT interval prolongation and 1 unexplained syncope associated with probable noncompliance). In <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patients</b> who received an ICD (n = 10), one appropriate shock occurred during a follow-up period of 13 ± 8 months. In patients with multiple ICD shocks, HQ prevented VT/VF recurrence in all cases during a mean follow-up of 14 ± 8 months. ConclusionsHydroquinidine therapy prevented VT/VF inducibility in 76 % of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patients</b> with BrS and inducible arrhythmia, as well as VT/VF recurrence in all BrS patients with multiple ICD shocks.

Taub and Adams try to do a differential, but Park wants to know why Chase is embarrassed about having had a manicure when he's the type of guy who gets his hair cut frequently and obviously doesn't mind people knowing his grooming habits.

40|$|Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) {{is one of}} the few clinicaldiseases that {{is mainly}} {{diagnosed}} by the ECG. One of the ultimate goals of modern medicine is to find a method to prevent disease. One of the best examples is catheter ablation of the accessory tracts in patients with WPW that will prevent tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in 95 % of the patients. In patients with WPW, catheter ablation is the treatment of choice in the highly symptomatic patient with severe arrhythmias. A major challenge today is to ascertain the benefits versus the risks of doing catheter ablation in the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patient</b> with WPW. In this issue of Circulation, Obeyesekere et al. 1 with the use of meta-analysis, studied the risk of arrhythmia and sudden death in patients with asymp-tomatic preexcitation and summarized the breadth of pub-lished evidence regarding the risks and benefits of catheter ablation in the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patient.</b> This study is an impor-tant milestone in the history of WPW, since its first descrip-tion 82 years ago 2 and the ablation of atrioventricular con-duction by use of a catheter was first accomplished in the dog 36 years ago 3 and its first use in humans was officially reported 21 years ago. 4 The major conclusion of this metic-ulous review is that the available evidence is insufficient to justify the use of catheter ablation in the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>patient.</b> This conclusion underscores the need to establish a prospective clinical and electrocardiographic database to determine the natural history of WPW (and other ECG abnormalities, as well) from birth to death.
