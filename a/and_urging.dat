5|$|In 1291 Pope Nicholas IV sent {{a letter}} to Joachim III, dated 23 March, {{reminding}} the Bulgarian Patriarch of their old friendship <b>and</b> <b>urging</b> him to join the Roman Church. The Pope also {{sent a letter}} to George Terter I expressing his hope to see Bulgaria return to the authority of Rome, alluding to the union between Bulgaria and Rome concluded in 1205 during the reign of emperor Kaloyan. Despite some hesitations Joachim III maintained the firm position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church on the matter and the papal initiative failed to produce any tangible results.|$|E
5|$|Pankhurst visited North America in 1916 {{together}} with the former Secretary of State for Serbia, Čedomilj Mijatović, whose nation {{had been at the}} centre of fighting {{at the start of the}} war. They toured the United States and Canada, raising money <b>and</b> <b>urging</b> the US government to support Britain and its Canadian and other allies. Two years later, after the US entered the war, Pankhurst returned to the United States, encouraging suffragettes there – who had not suspended their militancy – to support the war effort by sidelining activities related to the vote. She also spoke about her fears of communist insurgency, which she considered a grave threat to Russian democracy.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 19July 1941, Stojanović and Bašić arrived at the camp of the communists and their sympathisers who escaped from Prijedor, {{situated}} at Rajlića Kosa above the village of Malo Palančište. The news of Stojanović's escape soon spread throughout the Prijedor district. The group, mostly in the early twenties, enjoyed an increase in their credibility and esteem since a well-known and respected doctor had joined their camp. People from surrounding Serb villages brought food and other supplies to Stojanović and his young comrades. Stojanović gave speeches to the villagers, telling them {{to be prepared for}} an impending uprising <b>and</b> <b>urging</b> them to bring him rifles they were hiding in their homes. The camp at Rajlića Kosa was the first Partisan camp in the Kozara area.|$|E
5|$|UNPROFOR and the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) {{requested}} the HV to withdraw to positions held before the offensive, but the HV declined the request. However, Croatia agreed that UNPROFOR and ECMM monitors {{would continue to}} be present in the pink zones when Croatia assumed control over them. The move was planned as a way to reassure the Serb population that the pink zones could provide them safety. In the aftermath of the offensive, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted the UNSC Resolution 762, urging cessation of hostilities in or near the UNPAs, <b>and</b> <b>urging</b> the HV to pull back to positions held before 21 June. The 113th Brigade of the HV remained at the plateau regardless. The resolution authorised the UNPROFOR to perform monitoring of the pink zones. It also recommended establishment of a joint commission chaired by an UNPROFOR representative, and including representatives of the Government of Croatia, local authorities and the ECMM to oversee restoration of Croatian control in the pink zones.|$|E
5|$|The {{denial of}} the style Royal Highness to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, as did the {{financial}} settlement. The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess on the Civil List, and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI. The Duke compromised his position with his brother by concealing {{the extent of his}} financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall paid to him as Prince of Wales and ordinarily at the disposal of an incoming king. George VI also paid Edward for Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father, George V, and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession. In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money <b>and</b> <b>urging</b> that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.|$|E

50|$|We {{are thus}} left to {{distinguish}} between two contrary concepts of education: the classical one with self-control and the liberal one where passions <b>and</b> <b>urges</b> on the loose are permitted. The more this latter educational project triumphs, the more the desymbolized world of drives <b>and</b> <b>urges</b> will protude, according to Dufour. This world, however, creates a new problem: when no longer control of passions <b>and</b> <b>urges</b> is effected on a symbolic level, it must more and more be effected on a pure corporal level, inwards with pills and outwards with surveillance techniques - something happening not without implications for the function of democracy in liberal societies.|$|R

5|$|Fillmore sent {{a special}} message to Congress on August 6, 1850, {{disclosing}} {{the letter from}} Governor Bell and his reply, warning that armed Texans would be viewed as intruders, <b>and</b> <b>urging</b> Congress to defuse sectional tensions by passing the Compromise. Without the Great Triumvirate of John C. Calhoun, Webster and Clay who had long dominated the Senate, Douglas and others led that body towards the administration-backed package of bills. Each bill passed the Senate {{with the support of}} the section that wanted it, plus a few members who were determined to see all the bills passed. The battle then moved to the House, which had a Northern majority because of population. Most contentious was the Fugitive Slave Bill, whose provisions were anathema to abolitionists. Fillmore applied pressure to get Northern Whigs to abstain rather than oppose, including New Yorkers—threatening to kill the renomination of Congressman Abraham Schermerhorn of Rochester, whose constituents included Frederick Douglass, if he voted against the bill. Through the legislative process, various changes were made, including the setting of a boundary between New Mexico Territory and Texas—the state would be given a payment to settle any claims. California was admitted as a free state, the District slave trade was ended, and the final status of slavery in New Mexico and Utah would be settled later. Fillmore signed the bills as they reached his desk, holding the Fugitive Slave Bill for two days until he received a favorable opinion as to its constitutionality from the new Attorney General, John J. Crittenden. Although some Northerners were unhappy at the Fugitive Slave Act, relief was widespread, as was the hope this would settle the slavery question.|$|E
