5|$|After {{the third}} volume, a new editor was {{assigned}} to the series. Kamiya noted the third volume contained a lot of plot progression, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> balance it out in the fourth volume with more lighthearted and carefree events.. Volumes four and five were written as a single volume; since volume four lacked a climatic ending, Kamiya had to restructure the story. This, along with communication problems with his new editor, and other problems in Kamiya's life caused a month delay in volume four's release. After completing volume five, Kamiya was asked to submit volume six's manuscript before 2014 for the anime adaptation, and to complete the volume before the anime's premiere.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{positions}} were well-sited {{on the spur}} for an attack from the east along the track from Katika to Sattelberg, but at this point, Captain B. G. Cribb, the commander of D Company, 2/13th Infantry Battalion, came {{on the radio and}} announced that he was in contact with the Japanese to the west, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attack from that direction. A furious fight ensured. The Japanese held their fire until the Australians were almost on top of them. Realising that the position was stronger than he had thought, Cribb withdrew after suffering eight dead and twenty wounded. Windeyer ordered the 2/17th to bypass the position and proceed to its objective, the high ground south of the Song River. The 2/15th was ordered to attack Katika Spur. The attack was delivered at 15:15 after a preliminary bombardment by 3 inch mortars, but the Japanese defenders had withdrawn, leaving behind eight dead. By nightfall, most of the brigade was on their objectives.|$|E

5|$|While the {{division}} was never deployed overseas, its headquarters staff was deployed to Norway and briefly {{fought in the}} Norwegian Campaign. Afterwards, {{the division}} was deployed to Northern Ireland for almost three years {{as a result of}} rumours of a German intention to invade. In Northern Ireland, the division manned static defences, conducted internal security, and trained for future operations. Returning to England, the division participated in numerous military exercises and was scheduled to join the 21st Army Group for the Operation Overlord; the Allied invasion of German-occupied France. By late 1943, this role had been taken away from the division and it was assigned to train replacements for combat units. Throughout 1944, the division aided Overlord in various deception formats while most of the men were posted to combat formations within 21st Army Group. In late 1945, the division was re-organized as a light division <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be deployed to the Far East to fight Imperial Japan. The Japanese surrender resulted in the move not being made, and in November the division was disbanded.|$|E

25|$|Texas Instruments v. Sprague: On April 10, 1962, Lehovec {{received}} a patent for isolation by p-n junction.

Four years later, Texas Instruments hosted in Dallas an arbitration hearing with demonstrations of the Kilby's inventions and depositions by experts. However, Lehovec conclusively proved that Kilby did not mention isolation of components. His priority on the isolation patent was finally acknowledged in April 1966.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Kazembek's father, Hadji Kasim Kazem-Bey, was a {{prominent}} Azeri Muslim cleric and {{a native of the}} city of Derbent (then part of the Quba Khanate, Qajar Persia, later part of Russia), whose father (Alexander Kazembek's paternal grandfather) Nazir Muhammad khan was paymaster general of the Derbent Khanate. On his way back from a religious pilgrimage to Mecca, Muhammad Qasim Kazim-bey visited Rasht (present-day Gilan province, Iran) and met a woman named Sharafnisa, daughter of the local governor Bagher-khan. The two married and settled in Rasht, where Kazembek was born. In 1811, his father was appointed qadhi in Derbent, and the family moved there. Kazembek completed his studies in Islam and, already fluent in Azeri and Persian, also excelled in Russian, Turkish and Arabic. At the age of 17, he wrote his first book named Topics in Grammar of the Arabic Language (originally in Arabic). His father wanted him to become a Muslim scholar <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> send him away to Persia and Arabia to master Islamic studies.

25|$|Another American flyer, Hilaire du Berrier, {{was already}} is Spain by time they arrived. Frederic Ives Lord became their {{squadron}} commander, {{and he tried}} to convince the Loyalist authorities that the planes they were given were too dilapidated to fly. When the commandant insisted that the planes were safe, Lord took him up for a test flight, and at two thousand feet up one of the four wings broke off. The commandant motioned Lord to climb higher so they could escape by using their parachutes. Lord wanted to try to land with the remaining lower wings intact. He landed the plane safely but he was arrested <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be shot. The airplane mechanics intervened and explained that his loss of the wing was accidental, not intentional. Things became so difficult and dangerous for the Americans that each time one of them landed they pulled out their pistols in case someone was coming to arrest them. They went to Valencia, Spain to complain to the air ministry, but the ministry was only interested in reading to the flyers the reports on Bertrand Blanchard Acosta and his heavy drinking. Berry, Lord, Acosta and Schneider {{decided it was time to}} demobilize and return to the United States. Acosta, Schneider and Lord planned to escape from Bilbao to Biarritz, France by motorboat after they had been refused a promised Christmas leave. Their plan was discovered and the pilot of their boat was arrested and executed. The pilots were then jailed for 18 hours.|$|E
