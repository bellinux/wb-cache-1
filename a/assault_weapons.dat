5|$|Other {{proposals}} from Kelly and Giffords include {{limiting the}} sale of certain magazines, limiting {{the sale of}} <b>assault</b> <b>weapons,</b> and stopping gun trafficking. Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR-15 rifle. The shop owner denied Mr. Kelly the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly's previous statements on gun laws. Local news reports that Mr. Kelly tried to buy the firearm using his Texas drivers license and thus could not prove Arizona residency. Mr. Kelly had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department. In April 2013, Kelly was photographed at his mother-in-law's house in Arizona, with Giffords watching and cheering him on while he used a Glock 9 millimeter for target practice. The gun belongs to Giffords--she owned it prior to the 2011 attempt on her life. It is {{the same type of}} gun that was used in the January 2011 shooting.|$|E

25|$|New York had an <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> ban {{prior to}} 2013, but on January 16 {{of that year}} it passed the SAFE Act, which created a stricter {{definition}} of <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> and banned them immediately.

25|$|In California, {{measures}} {{were taken to}} first define and then ban <b>assault</b> <b>weapons,</b> resulting in the Roberti-Roos <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> Control Act of 1989. On the Federal level, Congressional legislators struggled {{with a way to}} ban weapons such as military-style rifles without banning sporting-type rifles. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush signed an executive order (the Semi-Automatic Assault Rifle Ban) banning importation of <b>assault</b> <b>weapons.</b> The federal <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> ban was enacted in 1994, and expired in 2004. President Bill Clinton signed another executive order in 1994 which banned importation of most firearms and ammunition from China.|$|E

25|$|While {{serving in}} the House of Representatives, Schumer, along with California senator Dianne Feinstein, {{authored}} the 1994 <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> Ban which expired in 2004. The National Rifle Association and other gun groups (see gun politics) have criticized him for allegedly not knowing much about guns, alluding to various errors regarding the subject. Supporters of gun control legislation, however, give him {{much of the credit}} for passage of both the <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> Ban and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.|$|E

25|$|Another major recommendation, {{which was}} {{addressed}} in the second Romney-Obama debate, is the banning of <b>assault</b> <b>weapons.</b> The ban, originally signed in 1994 and expired in 2004, stopped the sale of <b>assault</b> <b>weapons,</b> armor-piercing rounds, and high-capacity magazines to civilians. Senator Feinstein believes the ban should be resigned, not only to stop violence in Mexico and California, but to decrease the amount of gun violence in California, and across America.|$|E
