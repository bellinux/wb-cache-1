Take an instance. Let a leadsman cry, 'Half twain! half twain! half twain! half twain! half twain!' until it become as monotonous as the ticking of a clock; let conversation {{be going on}} all the time, and the pilot be doing {{his share of the}} talking, and no longer consciously listening to the leadsman; {{and in the midst of}} this endless string of half twains let a single 'quarter twain!' be interjected, without emphasis, and then the half twain cry go on again, just as before: two or three weeks later that pilot can describe with precision the boat's position in the river when that quarter twain was uttered, and give you such a lot of head-marks, stern-marks, and side-marks to guide you, that you ought to be able to take the boat there and put her in that same spot again yourself! The cry of 'quarter twain' did not really take his mind from his talk, but his trained faculties instantly photographed the bearings, noted the change of depth, and laid up the important details for future reference without requiring any assistance from him in the matter. If you were walking and talking with a friend, and another friend at your side kept up a monotonous repetition of the vowel sound A, for a couple of blocks, and then in the midst interjected an R, thus, A, A, A, <b>A,</b> <b>A,</b> <b>R,</b> A, A, A, etc., and gave the R no emphasis, you would not be able to state, two or three weeks afterward, that the R had been put in, nor be able to tell what objects you were passing at the moment it was done.

Since adenosine <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> receptors (<b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>Rs)</b> control neuroinflammation, as well as the production and function of BDNF, we tested to see if <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>R</b> controls the microglia-dependent secretion of BDNF and the proliferation of microglial cells, <b>a</b> crucial event in neuroinflammation. Methods Murine N 9 microglial cells were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/mL) in the absence or {{in the presence of the}} <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>R</b> antagonist, SCH 58261 (50 nM), as well as other modulators of <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>R</b> signaling. The BDNF cellular content and secretion were quantified by Western blotting and ELISA, <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>R</b> density was probed by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry and cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU incorporation. Additionally, the <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>R</b> modulation of LPS-driven cell proliferation was also tested in primary cultures of mouse microglia. Results LPS induced time-dependent changes of the intra- and extracellular levels of BDNF and increased microglial proliferation. The maximal LPS-induced BDNF release was time-coincident with <b>an</b> LPS-induced increase of the <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>R</b> density.

We present {{mid-infrared}} (MIR) 8 - 13 μm spectroscopy of {{the nuclear}} regions of the interacting galaxy Arp 299 (IC 694 +NGC 3690) obtained with CanariCam (CC) on the 10. 4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The high angular resolution (∼ 0. ″ 3 - 0. ″ 6) of the data allows us to probe nuclear physical scales between 60 and 120 pc, which is a factor of 10 improvement over previous MIR spectroscopic observations of this system. The GTC/CC spectroscopy displays evidence of deeply embedded active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in both nuclei. The GTC/CC nuclear spectrum of NGC 3690 /Arp 299 -B 1 can be explained as emission from AGN-heated dust in a clumpy torus with both a high covering factor and high extinction {{along the line of}} sight. The estimated bolometric luminosity of the AGN in NGC 3690 is 3. 2 ± 0. 6 × 1044 erg s- 1. The nuclear GTC/CC spectrum of IC 694 /Arp 299 -A shows 11. 3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission stemming from a deeply embedded (AV ∼ 24 mag) region of less than 120 pc in size. There is also a continuum-emitting dust component. If associated with the putative AGN in IC 694, we estimate that it would be approximately five times less luminous than the AGN in NGC 3690. The presence of dual AGN activity makes Arp 299 a good example to study such phenomena in the early coalescence phase of interacting galaxies. © 2013. The American Astronomical Society.

40|$|Treatment of non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) with {{cisplatin}} has {{a level of}} antitumor activity still modest. We have shown previously that MKP 1 /DUSP 1 inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells and is overexpressed in tumors from most patients with stage I–II NSCLC. Here, using different NSCLC cell lines we found that MKP 1 and NF-κB are differentially expressed. We studied whether targeting MKP 1, NF-κB or both affects cisplatin-induced cell death. MKP 1 is expressed in H 460 and H 727 cells. H 727 and H 1299 cells showed constitutive phosphorylation of Akt and increased NF-κB activity than did H 460 cells. H 460 -MKP 1 -siRNA-expressing cells (but not H 727 -MKP 1 -siRNA or H 1299 -MKP 1 -siRNA cells) exhibit a marked increase in cisplatin response compared with parental cells. Treatment with the PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002 or the NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11 - 7082 enhanced cisplatin antitumor activity in parental H 1299 cells but only weakly affected responses of H 727 and H 460 cells. MKP 1 -siRNA expression enhanced the chemosensitization effect of LY 294002 and BAY 11 - 7082 on H 727 and H 460 cells. Additionally, NSCLC cell lines with higher NF-κB-constitutive activation were the most sensitive to PS- 341 (Bortezomib), a non-specific NF-κB inhibitor. This finding suggests the proteasome as a suitable strategy in treating NSCLC tumors with high constitutive NF-κB activity. Altogether, these results showed that either an activated PI 3 K/Akt/NF-κB pathway and/or high MKP 1 was linked to reduced sensitivity to cisplatin in NSCLC cells. Inhibition of NF-κB or PI 3 K potently enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity in cells with endogenous or genetically induced low MKP 1 levels. These findings support the potential improvement in cisplatin responses by co-targeting NF-κB or Akt and MKP 1. This work was supported by Grants PI 051305 (R. P), PI 081485 (R.

40|$|ABSTRACT The sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} Ca 2 +-release channel plays {{a central}} role in cardiac muscle function by providing a ligand-regulated pathway for the release of sequestered Ca 2 + to initiate contraction following cell excitation. The efficiency of the channel as a Ca~+-release pathway will be influenced by both gating and conductance properties of the system.

The use of permeant organic cations in biological channels to explore structural motifs underlying selectivity has been an important tool for the electrophysiologist.
