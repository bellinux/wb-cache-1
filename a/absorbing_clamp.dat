40|$|This thesis {{describes}} how the Comite International Special des Perturbation Radioelectriques (CISPR) <b>Absorbing</b> <b>Clamp</b> {{can be used in}} design testing to optimize radiated emissions from small systems, whose physical size (up to approx. 1 m 3) is small in comparison with a wavelength at the measured frequency, and the electromagnetic interference is radiated mostly by the cables. The <b>Absorbing</b> <b>Clamp</b> is a simple, repeatable test which requires less investment in time and cost than Open Field Site testing, which is the main alternative. Cost and time to market are main criteria used to design new electronic hardware. During an engineering phase of the product development stage, repeated testing is done {{to assess the impact of}} design modifications on system performance. Open Field Site testing remains the only legally accepted test method for conformance testing of radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI) today. Proper design practices to achieve optimal electromagnetic compatibility performance are first reviewed. The theory and operation of the <b>Absorbing</b> <b>Clamp</b> are discussed. Finally, successful use of the <b>Absorbing</b> <b>Clamp</b> during product development, to evaluate the impact of design modifications on system radiated electromagnetic emissions, is demonstrated. Test results confirm that the <b>Absorbing</b> <b>Clamp</b> is a repeatable and inexpensive test method for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) engineering on small systems where cable radiation is a major contributing factor to the radiated EMI profile...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of an automated <b>absorbing</b> <b>clamp</b> mech-anism with video monitoring and position control to conduct the measurement process entirely from outside the screened room where the clamp is used for EMC tests. The system is im-plemented with a minimal change to the EMC measurement environment within the screened room. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{reduction of}} radiated emission of {{a printed circuit}} board by implementing Electromagnetic Band Gap structures (EBG) in the power distribution system. EBG structures and their effect on power plane resonances is analysed and several boards with EBG structures have been designed. The performance of standard power plane and EBG structured power plane has been measured. The scattering parameters show a reduction in resonances and the <b>absorbing</b> <b>clamp</b> measurements demonstrate a reduction in common mode currents and therefore radiated emission, indicating the feasibility of radiated emission reduction by means of EBG structured power planes...|$|E
