40|$|For {{studies on}} the {{mechanism}} of <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> formation, Union Internationale Contre Cancer (UICC) crocidolite asbestos fibers were added to a culture of mouse peritoneal macrophages. Small asbestos fibers were totally ingested by the macrophages, but fibers too long to be taken up completely remained as a consequence extracellular.

The basic mechanism underlying <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> formation was found to be the exocytotic activity of macrophages. The number of iron-rich inclusion bodies was dependent on the availability of iron in the culture media, and the same holds for the amount of iron in the <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> coat. This means that <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> formation is a phenomenon that occurs accidentally when macrophages come into contact with long fibers in an iron-rich environment.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the cell biology {{of the development}} of asbestos bodies after a single intraperitoneal injection of a suspension of crocidolite asbestos fibers into the mouse peritoneal cavity. The majority of the infected fibers were found in aggregates of peritoneal macrophages, exudate cells, and fibrous tissue. These aggregates developed into granulomas containing not only numerous asbestos fibers, but also cells of various types, including macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, fibroblasts, plasma cells, granulocytes, and mast cells. Cytoplasmic ferritin was abundantly present in macrophages and giant cells. In addition, iron-rich inclusion bodies were detected. The results of this study show that <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> formation can occur outside the pleural cavity. <b>Asbestos</b> <b>body</b> formation occurred in the granulomas after periods of 1 month and longer.

40|$|In {{this study}} we aimed to asses whether envorimental {{asbestos}} exposure could have an adjuvant effect in developing scleroderma by counting asbestos bodies (AB) in BAL.

BAL was performed by instillation of a total 100 mL saline in five aliquots into right middle lobe, lingula or effected segment of the lung by the disease. The quantification of asbestos bodies was done by filtration of 10 mL fresh BAL fluid, onto millipore filters and counting the numbers of asbestos bodies on paper of milipore filter. BAL fluid cells were counted and differantials were determined in remaining BAL fluid.

Analytical electron microscopy of <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> cores showed that in the BL group 95. 6 % were chrysotile fibres whereas in the AC group amphiboles accounted for 93. 1 %. The size characteristics of the central fibres differed for chrysotile and amphibole AB, the former being shorter and thinner. Examination of repeated bronchoalveolar lavage samples showed that the mechanisms of clearance of chrysotile fibres do not affect AB concentration for at least 10 months after cessation of exposure. It thus appears that routine counting of ABs in BAL allows the assessment of current or recent occupational exposures to asbestos.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of asbestos bodies {{was measured in}} lung sections in a necropsy series carried out at the London Hospital (1965 - 66) after exclusion of all known asbestos factory workers and cases of asbestosis and of mesothelioma. Associations were sought between the presence and number of asbestos bodies with the patients' sex, domiciliary address, occupation, industry, and diseases recorded at necropsy. Asbestos bodies were present in 42 % of the 216 men in the series and in 30 % of the 178 women. The number of bodies in the positive cases was small {{in comparison with the}} numbers seen typically in asbestosis; thus there were less than 6 asbestos bodies per 6 - 75 mm- 3 lung tissue in 107 of the total 145 positive cases in contrast to 1 000 or more in asbestosis. In comparison with the overall series, an increased number of <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> positives was present in males with carcinoma of stomach and females with carcinoma of breast. In view of this finding lung sections were counted in further post-mortem examples of these carcinomas making a total of 50 males with carcinoma stomach and 82 females with carcinoma breast. Thirty-five positive cases were found in the carcinoma stomach group as against 22 - 7 expected and 38 in the carcinoma breast group against 26 - 35 expected. There was no excess of observed over expected <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> positives in 51 males with carcinoma of bronchus. There was an excess of <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> positives (60 - 9 %) in heavy manual workers and in both heavy and light manual male workers in the shipping (61 %), electrical and engineering (56 %), and transport (54 %) industries.

40|$|Malignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} (MPM) is a rapidly fatal tumor with increasing incidence worldwide responsible for {{many thousands of}} deaths annually. Although {{there is a clear}} link between exposure to asbestos and mesothelioma, and asbestos is known to be both clastogenic and cytotoxic to mesothelial cells, the mechanisms of causation of MPM remain largely unknown. However, there is a rapidly emerging literature that describes inactivation of a diverse array of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) via promoter DNA CpG methylation in MPM, although the etiology of these alterations remains unclear. We studied the relationships among promoter methylation silencing, asbestos exposure, patient demographics and tumor histology using a directed approach; examining six cell cycle control pathway TSGs in an incident case series of 70 MPMs. Promoter hypermethylation of APC, CCND 2, CDKN 2 A, CDKN 2 B, HPPBP 1 and RASSF 1 were assessed.

We present our experience of MM in individuals whose only known asbestos exposure was to brake dust and correlate these findings with lung asbestos fiber burdens. Methods: Consultation files of one of the authors were reviewed for cases of MM in which brake dust was the only known asbestos exposure. Lung fiber analyses were performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in all cases for which formalin-fixed or paraffin-embedded lung tissue was available. Results: Ten cases of MM in brake dust-exposed individuals were males aged 51 – 73 yr. Nine cases arose in the pleura and one in the peritoneum. Although the median lung <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> count (19 AB/g) is at our upper limit of normal (range 0 – 20 AB/g), half of the cases had levels within our normal range. In every case with elevated asbestos fiber levels by SEM, excess commercial amphibole fibers were also detected. Elevated levels of chrysotile and non-commer...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOnce {{penetrated}} {{into the}} lungs of exposed people, asbestos induces an in vivo biomineralisation process {{that leads to}} the formation of a ferruginous coating embedding the fibres. The ensemble of the fibre and the coating is referred to as <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> and is believed to be responsible for the high toxicological outcome of asbestos. Lung tissue of two individuals subjected to prolonged occupational exposure to crocidolite asbestos was investigated using synchrotron radiation micro-probe tools. The distribution of K and of elements heavier than Fe (Zn, Cu, As, and Ba) in the asbestos bodies was observed for the first time. Elemental quantification, also reported for the first time, confirmed that the coating is highly enriched in Fe (~ 20 % w/w), and x-ray absorption spectroscopy indicated that Fe is in the 3 + oxidation state and that it is present in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin. Comparison of the results obtained studying the asbestos bodies upon removing the biological tissue by chemical digestion and those embedded in histological sections, allowed unambiguously distinguishing the composition of the asbestos bodies, and understanding to what extent the digestion procedure altered their chemical composition. A speculative model is proposed to explain the observed distribution of Fe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Environmental {{exposure}} to tremolite and erionite causes endemic {{diseases of the}} lung and pleura in Turkey. This study aimed to evaluate {{the impact of these}} exposures and further occupational exposures on fibre-related diseases in Turkish immigrants living in Belgium. The study included 51 males and 17 females that emigratedv 1 – 38 yrs ago. Most of them (n~ 46) had nonmalignant pleural lesions, one had asbestosis and one had mesothelioma. Environmental asbestos exposure was likely for the majority of patients (60 %), but there were also reports of possible occupational asbestos (n~ 14) and erionite (n~ 2) exposure. Tremolite was the main fibre type in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Elevated concentrations of amosite or crocidolite were detected in only two patients. The delay elapsed {{since the end of the}} environmental exposure had no influence on the <b>asbestos</b> <b>body</b> or the tremolite fibre concentrations in the BALF of Turkish immigrants. Most fibre-related diseases in Turkish immigrants are probably due to environmental rather than occupational exposure. Precise information about geographical origin and occupation should be obtained when investigating these patients. Mineralogical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid gives valuable information on the type and intensity of exposure, especially in patients with both environmental and occupational exposure...|$|E
40|$|Analyses of <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> {{from the}} general {{population}} have confirmed that these structures, like <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> from the lungs of asbestos workers, contain an asbestos core. In members of the general population this core is almost always an amphibole, whereas asbestos workers may have bodies formed on either amphibole or chrysotile. Most adults have a few bodies, and increasing numbers are seen in blue collar workers and others who handle small amounts of the fiber, with the highest levels being seen in asbestos workers. In men with minimal or extensive occupational exposure, <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> are formed on the commercial fibers, amosite and crocidolite, whereas women also form a significant number of bodies on the noncommercial fibers, anthophyllite and tremolite. These findings suggest that women may be exposed to specific asbestos-containing products, eg, cosmetic talc. The commercial fibers found in women and white collar men probably reflect atmospheric pollution with asbestos. At the highest levels of exposure, numbers of <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> correlate in a general way with the presence of asbestosis, although no precise value has been determined above which asbestosis is always found. In persons with much lower or environmental exposure, there {{does not appear to be}} any correlation between numbers of bodies and disease, in particular between numbers of bodies and carcinoma of the lung or gastrointestinal tract. The situation for mesothelioma is uncertain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Occupational or {{environmental}} exposure to asbestos fibres {{is associated with}} pleural and parenchymal lung diseases. A histopathologic hallmark of exposure to asbestos is the presence in lung parenchyma of the so-called <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies.</b> They are the final product of biomineralization processes resulting in deposition of endogenous iron and organic matter (mainly proteins) around the inhaled asbestos fibres. For shedding light on the formation mechanisms of <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> it is of fundamental importance to characterize at the same length scales not only their structural morphology and chemical composition but also to correlate them to the possible alterations in the local composition of the surrounding tissues. Here we report the first correlative morphological and chemical characterization of untreated paraffinated histological lung tissue samples with <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> by means of soft X-ray imaging and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) microscopy, which reveals new features in the elemental lateral distribution. Results The X-ray absorption and phase contrast images and the simultaneously monitored XRF maps of tissue samples have revealed the location, distribution and elemental composition of <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> and associated nanometric structures. The observed specific morphology and differences in the local Si, Fe, O and Mg content provide distinct fingerprints characteristic for the core asbestos fibre and the ferruginous body. The highest Si content {{is found in the}} asbestos fibre, while the shell and ferruginous bodies are characterized by strongly increased content of Mg, Fe and O compared to the adjacent tissue. The XRF and SEM-EDX analyses of the extracted <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> confirmed an enhanced Mg deposition in the organic asbestos coating. Conclusions The present report demonstrates the potential of the advanced synchrotron-based X-ray imaging and microspectroscopy techniques for studying the response of the lung tissue to the presence of asbestos fibres. The new results obtained by simultaneous structural and chemical analysis of tissue specimen have provided clear evidence that Mg, in addition to Fe, is also involved in the formation mechanisms of <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies.</b> This is the first important step to further thorough investigations that will shed light on the physiopathological role of Mg in tissue response to the asbestos toxicity. </p...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Asbestos {{constitutes}} a geophysical element with useful phisico-chemical properties, well {{known from the}} antiquity. Until the recent past, it was used widely in amateur and in industrial scale. The inhalation of asbestos fibers, even in small quantities, leads to their chronic remain in the tracheobronchial tree, so as a foreign body, activates a specific inflammatory procces to an effort to expel it from the organism. Finally, the asbestos fibers provokes injuries to the pleura and pulmonary parenchyma, decades afterwards. AIM : Investigation and determination of cellular type in BAL of apparently healthy individuals that have been exposed in asbestos {{for a long period}} of time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 39 workers (25 men and 14 women with a mean of age 46. 2 ± 4. 2 years and mean working time 23. 5 ± 4 years) from a total of 200, working in a manufacture of brakes and clutches for cars that used chrysotile. Selection criteria: A) Daily and directly contact for at least 15 years without other similar exposure in their free time. B) Apparent healthy individuals without respiratory symptoms and with negative radigraphy. From the studied population, smokers were 14 (36 %), former smokers 6 (15 %) and never smokers 19 (49 %). All of them, they underwent on bronchoscopy and receiving of BAL, after the infusion of 200 ml normal saline in medium lobe. Mean resorbed liquid was 119. 8 ml. In BAL, we evaluated the total number and the vitality of cells, the existence of dust leiden, of iron leiden as well as of <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> (May-Grunwald-Giemsa coloration). The specimens underwent in control for the mycobacterium tuberculosis (Ziehl-Nielsen coloration) and for the existence of cancer cells. RESULTS: Chronic bronchitis revealed in bronchoscopy in all but one (97. 5 %), that not related to smoking habit and none exhibited tubrculosis or neoplasm. <b>Asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> observed in the BAL in 14 (36 %) of 39 subjects, dust leiden in 37 (95 %) and iron leiden in 39 (100 %). Those with <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies,</b> had 3 times more probability to have lymphocytosis (with a cut-off point 10 % lymphocytes, Odds ratio = 3. 2, 95 %CI: 0. 84 - 12. 1 p = 0. 09) and they had an increased percentage of iron leiden (29 %), comparative to those who they did not had <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> in BAL (38. 4 % ± 23. 4, p = 0. 08). Those that they did not exhibit <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> in BAL had shown an increased number of neutrophils (5. 1 ± 1. 4 %, normal value < 3 %),. CONCLUSIONS: The long-lasting exposure in asbestos causes chronic inflammatory reaction of lungs, independent of the appearence of <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> in BAL. BAL in asbestos exposed asymptomatic individuals is more likely to present a lymphocellular type reaction and increased number of iron leiden, when is related with the existance of <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies.</b> Non existance of <b>asbestos</b> <b>bodies</b> in BAL is related by polymorphonuclear type reaction. ...|$|R
