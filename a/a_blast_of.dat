5|$|On September 22, 1915, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} during construction of the 23rd Street subway station that caused the tunnel to collapse. Seven people were killed after <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> dynamite in the subway tunnel destroyed the plank roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E
5|$|Guilty Gear X2 adds a {{new feature}} to the series: a burst gauge, which is {{fulfilled}} as the player causes or receives damage. By pressing buttons in combination, the player character jump and unleash <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> energy—a Psyche Burst. It allows the player to break combinations and super {{moves in the}} middle of the opponent's offensive. Also, if the blast hit the adversary, the tension gauge is filled to its maximum capacity immediately.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources of}} bromine are in the United States and Israel. The element is liberated by halogen exchange, using {{chlorine}} gas to oxidise Br− to Br2. This is then removed with <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> steam or air, and is then condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth {{the size of the}} chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.|$|E

5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
5|$|Varis zos Galvus is crowned Garlean {{emperor and}} begins {{consolidating}} power, lending new urgency {{to the search}} for Ivy. The Braves discover that Ivy is Raubahn's trusted advisor Eline Roaille, who is captured at the gates of a Garlean Castrum. A new Scion, Moenbryda, arrives from Sharlayan and provides critical advice for locating Iceheart. Using her body as a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr. Based on the player's encounters with Lahabrea and Shiva, Moenbryda hypothesizes that Ascians may be permanently destroyed by trapping their souls within white auracite and cleaving them with <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> pure aether, much like Hydaelyn's blade of light. Lucia of the Temple Knights requests that the Warrior of Light investigate suspicious activity at the Keeper of the Lake. At its apex, the adventurer discovers that Midgardsormr lives on, slowly regenerating from his apparent death. He divulges that Nidhogg, one of his seven children, has rallied the Dravanian horde to renew their attack on Ishgard. Sensing the hero's connection to Hydaelyn, Midgardsormr invokes an ancient pact with the Mothercrystal and seals away her blessing as a test of the player's worth. The Ascian Nabriales takes advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate the Scions' headquarters in pursuit of Louisoix's staff. Moenbryda sacrifices herself to create the blade of light necessary to completely destroy the Ascian.|$|E

25|$|That morning {{observers}} on the 16th {{floor of}} the M Bank Building in Buffalo watched as a gray wall covered the city; it appeared white as it came closer. <b>A</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> wind hit the building that caused the floor to move and the glass window to creak, and then the wall of white enveloped the building. It was 11:10 am.|$|E
25|$|Apart from distillation, ethanol may be dried by {{addition}} of a desiccant, such as molecular sieves, cellulose, and cornmeal. The desiccants can be dried and reused. Molecular sieves {{can be used to}} selectively absorb the water from the 95.6% ethanol solution. Synthetic zeolite in pellet form can be used, as well as a variety of plant-derived absorbents, including cornmeal, straw, and sawdust. The zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> hot carbon dioxide. Cornmeal and other plant-derived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated, but where ethanol is made from grain, they are often available at low cost. Absolute ethanol produced this way has no residual benzene, and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the plot}} and central {{characters}} mostly remain unchanged, many gameplay elements {{from the original}} have been tweaked for the DualShock 4 controller. For instance, touch-based elements in the original game have been re-mapped and modified for use on PlayStation 4. The creation aspects, where players used the touchscreen to draw objects that would appear in game, are now used on the DualShock's touchpad. Alternatively, the player may use the PlayStation Camera or the PlayStation App to input their drawings. The latter options {{can also be used}} to input a real world texture or colour into the game, a feature previously dedicated to the Vita's rear camera. Along with new creation methods, the touchpad is used for interacting with the world. Certain platforms require the player to grab, hold, or drag them off the environment for use. The player can also use the touchpad to create <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> wind, which can swipe enemies away and blow down extra platforms for use.|$|E
25|$|Suchet left Molins de Rei in {{the early}} evening. Marching rapidly, his troops arrived {{in front of the}} Ordal {{position}} at 11:00 PM. To his amazement, he found that the Allies failed to post any pickets. Suchet hustled his troops across the unguarded bridge and moved them uphill toward the drowsy Allies. As the French troops moved forward, telltale noises aroused the interest of a Spanish cavalry patrol, which trotted forward to see what was happening. These horsemen were greeted by <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> musketry, which awakened Adam's men. At the front of Harispe's division, General of Brigade Jean Mesclop led the 7th Line to the attack. Halfway up the hill, the 7th Line bumped into an entrenchment held by four Spanish infantry companies. The defenders fell back to a second field work higher up the hillside. After being joined by more Spaniards, these soldiers mounted a counterattack, which briefly pushed back the 7th Line.|$|E
25|$|While in battle, {{characters}} {{status is}} displayed in special {{windows on the}} battle screen: their window shows their current health, their Blast gauge (an energy bar linked to special abilities), and Spirit Chain (SC) gauge, which fuels the ability to link characters and perform special attacks. A high level of SC points grants conditional boons to characters, such as dealing higher damage and faster recovery of SC. Characters {{have the option to}} side-step (dodge forward, backward or to the side), and precisely timed dodges can allow characters to stagger enemies and fill the SC gauge. The Blast gauge allows characters to trigger <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> energy which knocks enemies back and heals injuries. The SC gauge allows for a maximum of four linked attacks, and any remaining points in the gauge can be used for later linked attacks. The order of activation for linked attacks cannot be changed. At the end of battles, if certain requirements are fulfilled, characters can learn skills called Battle Acts, abilities that grant the characters advantages in battle, such as being able to run around the field freely.|$|E

[...] However, {{he was not able}} to reach Wayne in time to recall him. [...] He immediately began moving additional troops forward in an attempt to prevent the trap from closing on Wayne. [...] In the meantime, the British charge had thrown the Americans into some confusion, and Wayne was concerned that a retreat would turn into a disorderly rout. [...] Wayne reformed his line, ordered his artillery to fire <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> grape shot, and then had the line charge the numerically overwhelming British with bayonets fixed.|$|E
500|$|Moustache's {{greatest}} {{achievement is}} said to have taken place at Austerlitz. [...] De Fivas states that Moustache went into battle with the cuirassiers and was present when the regimental standard bearer was surrounded by Austrian soldiers. [...] The standard bearer apparently killed three Austrians before he was himself cut down, wrapping the flag around him as he fell to prevent its capture. [...] It is at this point that de Fivas alleges that Moustache confronted the five or six remaining Austrians and was about to be bayoneted when the group was hit by <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> artillery grapeshot. [...] Moustache, wounded in the leg, is reputed to have torn the flag off the body of the standard bearer and returned it to the French camp.|$|E

500|$|In a {{negative}} way, The Village Voice criticized the album as a [...] "nü-Mariah on mood stabilizers, extended with pseudo-pastiches of semi-popular songs". Todd Burns for Stylus Magazine was also negative toward the album, giving it an [...] "F" [...] score and wrote, [...] "in between ten to twelve mediocre/good songs, we have {{eight to ten}} songs that {{would be better served}} as B-sides". Q provided a two-out-of-five-stars rating and commented that [...] "Sadly, bra-burning rhetoric and gospel warbling make poor substitutes for addictive songs". AllMusic's editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine also wrote {{a negative}} review, commenting that the album is [...] "the sound of an artist who was given too much freedom too early and has {{no idea what to do}} with it". Writing for The New York Times, Jon Pareles also provided a negative review, commenting that Stripped [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> excess that risks alienating Ms. Aguilera's old fans without luring new ones, and it's bursting with misguided energy".|$|E

[...] Billington praised Boyle, Devlin and Daldry, who had done a [...] "tremendous job in lending what might have been orthodox Olympic rituals <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> <b>of</b> theatrical vitality." [...] While Alexis Petridis writing for the same paper said that the lack of a [...] "gasp inducing moment" [...] spoilt the show. Jan Moir of the Daily Mail queried whether the ceremony truly reflected Britain's musical heritage and described the opening section as [...] "dull, dull, dull". [...] She asked [...] "how could anyone follow the Opening Ceremony for entertainment?", challenged [...] "the logic" [...] of clips of artists such as Bush and Bowie who had [...] "declined to appear", and said that the fashion section was [...] "dreary".|$|E

Hysterical, he attacks and kills a nurse (Bonnie Inch), then escapes the hospital in a panic. Loring and Dr. Theodore [...] "Ted" [...] Nelson (DeBenning), a scientist and friend of West, discover that the nurse's corpse is emitting feeble radiation, and realize West's body has become radioactive. Nelson believes West has gone insane, and concludes he must consume human flesh in order to slow the melting.
