25|$|Several Opiliones in Argentina {{appear to}} be vulnerable, if not endangered. These include Pachyloidellus fulvigranulatus, which is found only on top of Cerro Uritorco, the highest peak in the Sierras Chicas chain (provincia de Cordoba) and Pachyloides borellii is in {{rainforest}} patches in northwest Argentina which are in an area being dramatically destroyed by humans. The cave-living Picunchenops spelaeus is apparently endangered through human action. So far, no harvestman has been included in <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Red List in Argentina, so they receive no protection.|$|E

As a result, teams had a designated placer, typically the scrum-half, who would time the placement to coincide with the kicker's run-up. In 1958, the law governing conversions changed to today's version, which allows the kicker to place the ball and prohibits the defence from advancing toward the kicker until he begins his run-up.|$|E

25|$|Todd argues that, in {{addition}} to patriarchal prejudice, Behn suffered for her dismissal of any liberal agenda. Going against the tide of the times, she believed in the divine right of kings and aristocratic hierarchies. Todd writes that Behn was contemptuous of democracy and the common man in the street, not expressly interested in human rights — for women or slaves or anyone else — and that, {{because she did not}} support <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liberal agenda, her causes were not cheered by the progressives. She does not easily fit into any mould of proto-feminism. She had come into adulthood, following the English Civil War, under the harsh puritan rule of the Restoration, and regarded political populism as a sign of moral collapse and the triumph of venality.|$|E
25|$|He had {{difficulty}} adjusting to a vastly changed peacetime Army. In addition, Thompson's marriage had been troubled {{even before his}} captivity, and his wife Alyce, believing him dead, was living with another man {{at the time he}} was repatriated. He and his wife divorced in 1975. Alyce told author Tom Philpott that she believed prison had affected her husband's mind. She said he suffered from nightmares and was abusive towards both her and the children. Thompson later remarried but divorced soon afterwards. Thompson never formed <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relationship with his children. His daughters were 6, 5 and 4 when he left, and his son was born the day of his capture. Only his eldest child barely remembered him. He eventually became completely estranged from all of them.|$|E
500|$|Hastings {{took the}} lead in cross-examining Douglas-Pennant. She accused Bersey and others of {{promoting}} this [...] "rife immorality" [...] and not having {{the best interests of the}} WRAF at heart. When cross examined, however, she was unable to provide any evidence of this [...] "rife immorality" [...] or <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conspiracy, saying that she could not find any specific instance of [...] "immorality" [...] at the camps she visited and that it was [...] "always rumour". After three weeks the committee dismissed all witnesses. The final report was produced in December 1919, and found that Douglas-Pennant had been completely unable to substantiate her claims and was deserving [...] "of the gravest censure". As a result, Douglas-Pennant was never again employed by the government.|$|E

500|$|And lastly, {{there was}} not much support among the general populace in Europe for a Mongol alliance. Writers in Europe were {{creating}} [...] "recovery" [...] literature with their ideas about how best to recover the Holy Land, but few mentioned the Mongols as a genuine possibility. In 1306, when Pope Clement V asked the leaders of the military orders, Jacques de Molay and Fulk de Villaret, to present their proposals for how the Crusades should proceed, neither of them factored in <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Mongol alliance. A few later proposals talked briefly about the Mongols as being a force that could invade Syria and keep the Mamluks distracted, but not as a force that could be counted on for cooperation.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Phoebe Green was {{considered as a}} recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance. Chris Carter explained the character's origins, saying [...] "I thought {{it was interesting to}} show a little bit of Mulder's history by bringing an old girlfriend back. I've always wanted to do a Scotland Yard detective who was a woman. I also thought it was an interesting chance to use Amanda Pays and make a villainess of her". Executive producer Robert Goodwin felt that the episode [...] "was a hard one. <b>Any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fire stunt is a major undertaking, because it involves so many overlapping things.

500|$|Jamie meets Parker, an oncologist, {{and they}} begin dating. After five dates, they consummate their relationship, only {{to break up}} the next morning. Trying to be {{sympathetic}} and to console her, Dylan suggests she travels with him to California over the Fourth of July weekend, while he visits his family. Initially hesitant, Jamie agrees after much persistence from Dylan. They fly to Los Angeles, where Jamie meets his sister Annie, nephew Sammy, and father, who suffers from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. While in California, they begin to develop strong emotional romantic feelings for each other, and share a passionate kiss, which leads to a night of close intimacy unlike any other they had shared before. However, the next day, Jamie overhears a conversation between Annie and Dylan, where Annie suspects Dylan and Jamie like each other, though he insists he otherwise and says Jamie is too [...] "fucked up" [...] for him to date. Hurt, she flies back to New York. A few days later, Dylan returns to New York, trying to reconcile his friendship with Jamie and find out why she has been ignoring him. He finally finds Jamie, and she informs him she overheard everything he said and has no interest in maintaining <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friendship with him.|$|E

2500|$|After Aaron Perez's 59-yard punt {{resulted}} in a touchback, Notre Dame took over on its own 20-yard line with :55 remaining in the game, needing a touchdown to avoid its second loss of the season. [...] Rather than blitz Quinn, UCLA head coach Karl Dorrell opted to rush only his four down linemen. [...] UCLA was unable to generate <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pass rush against the Notre Dame offensive line, allowing the masterful Quinn to pick apart the Bruin defense with surgical precision. [...] On the first play of the drive, Quinn dropped back deep, but was initially unable to find an open man. [...] Quinn started to roll out to his right before he spotted Samardzija along the right sideline and fired a 21-yard strike that moved the Irish to the Notre Dame 41-yard line. [...] Quinn picked up 14 yards on the next play with a completion to wide receiver David Grimes, bringing Notre Dame to the UCLA 45.|$|E
2500|$|Parker and Neal worked {{together}} to promote Presley, using their own Hank Snow Tour to book him and tour him. Although Neal remained Presley's official manager, Parker was becoming increasingly involved in the running of his career, and {{by the summer of}} 1955 he had become Presley's [...] "special advisor." [...] As Presley was still a minor, his parents had to sign the contract with Parker on his behalf. Part of Parker's role was to secure a new recording contract with a bigger label. Presley had been at Sun Records since the beginning of his career, but Sam Phillips, the owner of Presley's current label, was aware that for Presley to have <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful future in the business he would need the backing of a much larger label.
