5|$|The <b>artist</b> <b>has</b> {{performed}} at political rallies led by Beck, and at campaign rallies for Herman Cain. Her husband joined Cain's presidential campaign as state director for Tennessee after hearing him speak at events where Branch performed. Branch said Cain {{was a natural}} choice {{for her and her}} husband because she felt their beliefs aligned with Cain's. Since 2010, she received three payments that totaled $10,000 for live entertainment services provided at political rallies from several political action committees associated with Cain's campaign.|$|E

5|$|With a pop art {{collage of}} musical styles, oblique and ironic lyrics, and postmodern {{arrangements}} incorporating samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics {{and the public}} throughout his musical career as being among the most idiosyncratically creative musicians of 1990s and 2000s alternative rock. Two of Beck's most popular and acclaimed recordings are Odelay and Sea Change, {{both of which were}} ranked on Rolling Stone list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The four-time platinum <b>artist</b> <b>has</b> collaborated with several artists and has made several contributions to soundtracks.|$|E
5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the <b>artist</b> <b>has</b> transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The 1499 Madonna {{panel is}} a free adaption, in that the <b>artist</b> <b>has</b> changed and repositioned a number of elements. However, art historians usually agree that they are to the {{detriment}} of the balance and impact of the composition. The panel attributed to Gossaert shows even more significant, though perhaps more successful, alterations, including shifting the centre of balance by adding a section to the right-hand side, dressing the Virgin entirely in dark blue and changing her facial features. Both copies omit the two pools of bright light on the floor across from her, thus removing the mystical element of van Eyck's original, perhaps because its significance was not grasped by the later artists. That Gossaert followed other aspects of the original so closely, however, is evidence of the high regard he held for van Eyck's technical and aesthetic ability, and his version has been seen by some as a homage. The Master of 1499's admiration for van Eyck can be seen in his left-hand panel, which contains many features reminiscent of van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, including the rendering of the ceiling beams and the colour and texture of the red fabrics.|$|E

40|$|<b>Artists</b> <b>have</b> {{long been}} viewed as pioneers of gentrification, and yet {{contemporary}} studies also point to how <b>artists</b> themselves <b>have</b> been displaced {{as a consequence of}} the revalorisation of property.

5|$|The {{painting}} {{contains the}} same white angular rails as the mid-grounds of his 1949 Head II, Head VI, and Study for Portrait {{of the same}} year. In this panel, the rails are positioned just below {{the area where the}} horizontal and vertical bars of the cross intersect. The rail begins with a diagonal line which intersects the chimera at {{what appears to be the}} creature's shoulder. The horizontal angular geometrical shape is sketched in white and grey in the mid-ground, and represents an early form of a spatial device Bacon was to develop and perfect during the 1950s, when it effectively became a cage used to frame the anguished figures portrayed in Bacon's foregrounds. In the mid-ground, the <b>artist</b> <b>has</b> sketched a street scene, which features walking stick figures and cars. The pedestrians appear oblivious to the slaughter before them.|$|E

25|$|Martine Cotten: this Breton <b>artist</b> <b>has</b> {{lived in}} les Saintes {{for more than}} twenty years. With soft pastels she draws on vellum paper scenes and panoramas of les Saintes and Brittany (Pont-Aven) which she sells and {{exhibits}} in her shop in the small port of Terre-de-Haut. Her art is appreciated by collectors and business managers. A lot of exhibitions are dedicated to her in France and abroad.|$|E

The greenery suggests the work was painted en plein air during the months of July or August, and possibly finished some time later in Biva's Parisian atelier.|$|E

25|$|Samoëla {{continues}} to regularly give open-air concerts {{around the country}} but also performs at cabarets {{in the capital city}} of Antananarivo where many of his urban fans prefer his more intimate performances.

25|$|With {{apparent}} Biblical authority, and {{the added}} convenience of giving Moses {{a unique and}} easily identifiable visual attribute (something the other Old Testament prophets notably lacked), it remained standard in Western art to depict Moses with small horns until well after the mistranslation was realized by the Renaissance. In this depiction of Moses, the error has been identified but the <b>artist</b> <b>has</b> chosen to place horns of light on Moses head to aid in identification.|$|E

25|$|In {{this picture}} Gleizes merges the sitter with the environment, {{blurring}} {{the distinction between}} background and foreground. In addition to the simultaneous views and multiple perspective, the <b>artist</b> <b>has</b> included {{the image of a}} clock in the upper left quadrant (as in Metzinger's Nu à la cheminée, Nude of 1910), a fact that reveals Gleizes' didactic visual and literary reference to the mathematician and philosopher of science Henri Poincaré, and to the philosopher Henri Bergson's concept of 'duration'.|$|E

Samoëla is the founder and owner of Be Mozik! production studio, which produces music videos for many new Malagasy artists.

25|$|The former New York City Opera <b>artist</b> <b>has</b> built a European {{career in}} recent years by taking on bel canto roles that other sopranos don't want to sing, mainly because they can't. Miss Anderson is made of braver stuff. The title role of Bellini's opera, written for Giuditta Pasta in 1833, lies {{extraordinarily}} high and probably was tailored for that legendary diva's voice. Miss Anderson...attacked Beatrice's brilliantly curlicued music with authority and a voice of piercing power.... In Beatrice's grand finale...Miss Anderson took off into the stratospheric area above high C, which justifiably set off a stomping, cheering ovation from the Carnegie audience.|$|E
