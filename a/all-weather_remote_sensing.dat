40|$|Ultra {{wideband}} (UWB) radar is {{an emerging}} technology with potential for <b>all-weather,</b> <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> of objects obscured by foliage or buried underground. Multiple octaves of frequency coverage and 90 degrees {{or more of}} viewing angle across a synthesized aperture are used to obtain high spatial resolution mapping of scattering behavior. Additionally, fully polarimetric responses can be measured, providing a multichannel characterization of objects in a scene. However, the diversity in wavelength and viewing angle presents significant challenges for system engineering and data interpretation. In particular, the multichannel UWB system poses unique imaging challenges arising from the variation of the UWB antenna response. We present an overview of calibration techniques for polarimetric wideband imagery, and introduce an image domain calibration technique using calibration targets...|$|E
40|$|The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{has been}} a very {{powerful}} and important contributor to all scientific questions related to precise positioning on Earth’s surface, particularly as a mature technique in geodesy and geosciences. With the development of GNSS as a satellite microwave (L-band) technique, more and wider applications and new potentials are explored and utilized. The versatile and available GNSS signals can image the Earth’s surface environments as a new, highly precise, continuous, <b>all-weather</b> and near-real-time <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> tool. The refracted signals from GNSS radio occultation satellites together with ground GNSS observations can provide the high-resolution tropospheric water vapor, temperature and pressure, tropopause parameters and ionospheric total electron content (TEC) and electron density profile as well. The GNSS reflected signals from the ocean and land surface could determine the ocean height, wind speed and wind direction of ocean surface, soil moisture, ice and snow thickness.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedRadar imaging {{is an area}} of tremendous interest as radar-based systems are perhaps the only <b>all-weather,</b> long range <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> systems. However, radar's continued utility and application in wide-ranging areas is fundamentally dependent on the ability to produce high-quality, artifact-free imagery. To date, the use of radar to identify and image moving objects remains of great interest, and {{it is well known that}} motion in the scene gives rise to mispositioning or streaking when target motion is not addressed. Many techniques have been developed to handle moving objects, but these techniques make use of the start-stop approximation, in which a target in motion is assumed to be momentarily stationary while it is being interrogated by a radar pulse. A new linearized imaging theory that combines the spatial, temporal and spectral aspects of scattered waves has been developed. This thesis studies the performance of this new imaging scheme via analysis of the point spread function. It is shown that the imaging PSF localizes, and is translation invariant in phase-space. It is also shown that the behavior of the imaging system is dependent on the aperture geometry and choice of radar waveforms transmitted. [URL] of Singapore Navy author...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSide-looking radar (SLR) is {{an active}} (<b>all-weather)</b> <b>remote</b> sensor that {{remained}} under a strict military blanket for a long time.
