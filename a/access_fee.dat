40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple model of competition among interconnected networks. <b>Access</b> <b>fees</b> are determined either by a regulator or by competition. We {{show that the}} price is higher when they compete in both access prices and final tariffs non-cooperatively than when the <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> are regulated. We also show that incentives to collude are higher when <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> are regulated {{to the level of}} marginal cost of access services. Thus it is ambiguous to judge the net effect of competition on prices and relevant regulations are necessary to enhance welfare effects. Network Competition, Access Pricing, Tacit Collusion...|$|R
40|$|The Pacific island {{countries}} depend {{heavily on}} bilateral aid. Much of this aid {{is provided by}} distant water fishing nations in exchange for cheap access to the Western and Central Pacific tuna fishery. Japan <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> (approximately USÂ $ 8 million) are comparable to about 5 % of Japanese aid to the region (approximately USÂ $ 150 million). If <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> were maximised, there is potential for the <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> to match, possibly double, total Japanese aid to the region. It is argued that aid dependency is decreasing the transparency of fishing treaties, decreasing the flexibility of government spending, exposing the Pacific island countries to large financial risks associated with possible aid withdrawal, and stifling the region's own efforts for fisheries, and broader economic, development.

40|$|We study {{negotiations}} between Telecommunication Networks over <b>access</b> <b>fees,</b> that is, fees one net-work {{has to pay}} to another one, whenever a customer of the former places {{a phone call to}} a customer of the latter. We show that revenue generated from agreed <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> can alleviate the problem of providing telecommunication services at reasonable prices at rural and other high cost areas. The model consists of three interconnected networks- two located in the low cost area (urban area) and one located in the high cost (rural area) - who negotiate pair-wise over <b>access</b> <b>fees.</b> If urban customers place high value to being able to reach rural customers, then the rural network’s revenue from selling access will be high enough so that it will become profitable given interconnection, even though it would be making losses if it were not interconnected with the urban networks. The reason is that <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> allow market participants to internalize some of the network externalities. The results are robust with respect to the timing of the moves of the game and, more importantly, with respect to the degree of competition in the urban market. The lessons apply to other industries that have the network structure, for instance electricity, postal services and transportation...|$|R

40|$|Platforms use search {{diversion}} {{in order}} to trade off total consumer traffic for higher revenues derived by exposing consumers to unsolicited products (e. g. advertising). We show that competition between platforms leads to lower equilibrium levels of search diversion relative to a monopoly platform when the intensity of competition is high. On the other hand, if there is only mild competition, then competing platforms induce more search diversion relative to a platform monopolist. When platforms charge consumers fixed <b>access</b> <b>fees,</b> all equilibrium levels of search diversion under platform competition are equal to the monopoly level, irrespective {{of the nature of}} competition. Furthermore, relative to platforms that cannot charge such fees, platforms that charge positive (negative) <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> to consumers have weaker (stronger) incentives to divert searc...|$|R

40|$|This paper models {{competition}} between two firms, which provide broadband In-ternet access in regional markets with different population densities. The firms, an incumbent and an entrant, differ in two ways. First, consumers bear costs when switching to the entrant. Second, the entrant faces a make-or-buy decision in each region and can choose between service-based and facility-based entry. The usual trade-off between static and dynamic efficiency {{does not apply}} {{in the sense that}} higher <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> might yield both, lower retail prices and higher total coverage. This holds despite a strategic effect in the entrant’s investment decision. While investment lowers marginal costs in regions with facility-based entry, it intensifies competition in all regions. We show that the cost-reducing potential of investments dominates the strategic effect: Higher <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> increase facility-based competition...|$|R

40|$|Summary: In all network activities, {{liberalization}} {{requires some}} form of unbundling, in particular the unbundling of infrastructure operation and production/supply activities. In the energy industry, since the first electricity directive in 1996, the European Commission has been repeatedly calling for ownership separation whereas some Member States (in particular France and Germany) consider that management separation would be sufficient to guarantee fair use of the infrastructure. The question addressed in this paper is how to optimally determine <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> to the electricity network according to the legal regime of the transport operator. Using an elementary one-line/two-node network, we characterize the second-best prices for energy from which we deduce the essential features of the access tariff by an arbitrage condition. We show that <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> must not only cover network variable costs and congestion, but also the fixed cost of the infrastructure {{on the basis of}} market sensibility to price (demand elasticity and/or supply elasticity) ...|$|R
