40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Ammonium</b> <b>alginate</b> wool {{has proved}} to be a {{suitable}} collecting filter for estimating a small number of micro-organisms in a large volume of air. A large supply of air free from micro-organisms is needed for certain modern commercial processes, such as submerged fermentations, which depend upon aeration and the control of infection. Consequently, it is necessary to test this air for sterility. Most methods of estimation are unsuited to lengthy tests and to large quantities of air, for instance the membrane filter (Haas, 1956), which, though efficient, offers a high resistance to airflow. Sodium alginate wool was found by Richards (1955) to be a suitable filtering material, and, as it is water-soluble, it can be dissolved for plating out; it cannot be purchased, but it is readily formed when calcium alginate is added to a solution of certain sodium salts (Higgins, 1950). <b>Ammonium</b> <b>alginate</b> is available, and is, if anything, slightly better for the purpose than the sodium salt; its ability to collect the micro-organisms from air has been tested by passing artificially infected air afterwards through a membrane filter, which showed that th...|$|E

These materials exhibit mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} rigid PU foams or balsa; the compressive modulus (1 – 97 MPa) and density (0. 047 – 0. 174 g/cm 3) increase with increasing solids content, with an associated change from a layered to network microstructure structure. Calcium ions, either added directly or indirectly via CaCO 3 /gluconolactone (GDL) are an effective crosslinking agent for alginate, with the GDL route providing the greatest enhancement of mechanical properties. The thermal stability of the aerogels is also enhanced by the presence of crosslinking. The alginate/clay aerogels possess inherently low flammability, as measured by cone calorimetry, with heat release values decreasing as the proportion of clay in the composites is increased.

Small pores less than 1  μm were formed in the microparticles by the heat treatment. The bulk density of the heat-treated microparticle was as low as 0. 66  g cm− 3. The chemical durability of the heat-treated microparticles in simulated body fluid at pH =  6 and 7 was high enough for clinical application of in situ radiotherapy. Although {{the size of the}} microparticles should be decreased to around 25  μm using atomizing device such as spray gun for clinical application, we found that the porous Y 2 O 3 microparticles with high chemical durability and low density can be obtained by utilizing gelation of <b>ammonium</b> <b>alginate</b> in YCl 3 aqueous solution in this study...|$|E
