The generalizeability of these studies has been limited by both the simplicity of the tasks and the fact that, in general, only failure detection has been examined.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first field {{deployment}} {{and testing of}} a directional passive air sampler (DPAS) {{which can be used}} to cost-effectively identify and quantify air pollutants and their sources. The sampler was used for ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) over ten weeks from twelve directional sectors in an urban setting, and tested alongside an automatic chemiluminescent monitor. The time-integrated passive directional results were compared with the directional analysis of the active monitoring results using wind data recorded at a weather station. The DPAS discriminated air pollutant signals directionally. The attempts to derive quantitative data yielded reasonable results-usually within a factor of two of those obtained by the chemiluminescent analyser. Ultimately, whether DPAS approaches are adopted will depend on their reliability, added value and cost. It is argued that added value was obtained here from the DPAS approach applied in a routine monitoring situation, by identifying source sectors. Both the capital and running costs of DPAS were < 5 % of those for the <b>automatic</b> <b>monitor.</b> It is envisaged that different sorbents or sampling media will enable this rotatable DPAS design to be used for other airborne pollutants.

It is important that the problems can be detected in an early stage to avoid harming the welfare or the production of broilers. Moreover fully automated detection of problems will save a lot of controlling man hours for the farmer who better can use his time to solve problems. In this paper, an automated method to detect problems in a broiler house using cameras and an image analysis software is introduced. Three top view cameras mounted in the ridge of a commercial broiler house with 28. 000 animals continuously monitored the floor space below and the images taken by the cameras were translated into animal distribution index every 5 minutes by analysis software.
