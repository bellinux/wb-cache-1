5000|$|Likelihood ratio statistic: [...] Used to {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} that a model has perfect model fit. It should be applied to models with {{an increasing number of}} factors until the result is nonsignificant, indicating that the model is not rejected as good model fit of the population. This statistic should be used with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> and normally distributed data. There are some drawbacks to the likelihood ratio test. First, when there is <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size,</b> even small discrepancies between the model and the data result in model rejection. [...] When there is a small sample size, even large discrepancies between the model and data may not be significant, which leads to underfactoring. Another disadvantage of the likelihood ratio test is that the null hypothesis of perfect fit is an unrealistic standard.|$|E

50|$|The {{deficiencies}} in the study designs mentioned above reflect the evolution of research methodology over the last 50 years. The evaluation of an intervention such as MDA {{is complicated by the}} fact that the effect of the intervention on transmission can only be measured at the community and not at the individual level. Trial methods which use a community, a village, or a cluster as unit of inference have taken longer to evolve than those used for individually randomized trials. There are, with some notable exceptions, few properly designed and analysed cluster randomized trials conducted by health care researchers prior to 1978. One major handicap for researchers who need to use the cluster approach, besides the need for <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size,</b> is the need to use statistical methods that differ from the familiar methods used in individually randomized trials. Significant progress has been made in the development of statistical methods for the analysis of correlated data.|$|E
5000|$|The ornate monitor (Varanus ornatus) is {{a monitor}} lizard that {{is native to}} West and Middle Africa. Comprehensive {{molecular}} analyses of the group have demonstrated that animals previously assigned to [...] "Varanus ornatus" [...] do not constitute a valid taxon and are actually polymorphisms of two different species; Varanus stellatus and Varanus niloticus. Consequently Varanus ornatus is considered a synonym of Varanus niloticus and [...] "ornate monitor" [...] is a casual term that refers to forest forms of either species (V. niloticus or V. stellatus).Until 1997, the ornate monitor was considered a subspecies of the Nile monitor. It was subsequently described as a separate species {{on the basis of}} reduced number of ocelli rows on the body, a light coloured tongue and a more massive build. More recent work based on <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences indicates that Varanus ornatus is not a valid species and that animals with the diagnostic appearance belong either of two sister species of Nile monitor. Animals described as ornate monitor lizards are native to closed canopy forests in West and Middle Africa.|$|E
50|$|Going barefoot, {{particularly}} over terrain {{such as a}} beach where {{muscles are}} given a good workout, is good {{for all but the}} most extremely flatfooted, or those with certain related conditions such as plantar fasciitis. Ligament laxity is also among the factors known to be associated with flat feet. One medical study in India with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> of children who had grown up wearing shoes and others going barefoot found that the longitudinal arches of the bare-footers were generally strongest and highest as a group, and that flat feet were less common in children who had grown up wearing sandals or slippers than among those who had worn closed-toe shoes. Focusing on the influence of footwear on the prevalence of pes planus, the cross-sectional study performed on children noted that wearing shoes throughout early childhood can be detrimental {{to the development of a}} normal or a high medial longitudinal arch. The vulnerability for flat foot among shoe-wearing children increases if the child has an associated ligament laxity condition. The results of the study suggest that children be encouraged to play barefooted on various surfaces of terrain and that slippers and sandals are less harmful compared to closed-toe shoes. It appeared that closed-toe shoes greatly inhibited the development of the arch of the foot more so than slippers or sandals. This conclusion may be a result of the notion that intrinsic muscle activity of the arch is required to prevent slippers and sandals from falling off the childâ€™s foot.|$|E
