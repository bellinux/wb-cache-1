25|$|Po {{becomes a}} {{formidable}} challenge for Tai Lung, frustrating him with confusing fighting techniques {{on top of}} <b>a</b> <b>physique</b> that renders him immune to Tai Lung's dangerous nerve strikes. Tai Lung momentarily bests Po and retrieves the scroll, but is unable to understand or accept its symbolic meaning. Eventually, Po defeats Tai Lung in combat before using the mysterious Wuxi Finger Hold to vanquish him. Po is praised by the Valley of Peace and earns the respect of all the Furious Five, who fully acknowledge him as a true kung fu master. Po then finds Shifu, who finally attains inner peace with the valley safe once more.|$|E
500|$|An intense {{performer}} on {{the playing}} field, Youkilis {{was known for his}} scrappiness, grittiness, dirt-stained jerseys, home-plate collisions, and his strange batting stance. He excelled despite <b>a</b> <b>physique</b> that led many observers to underestimate his athletic ability. He was called [...] "roly-poly" [...] by his high school coach, [...] "pudgy" [...] by his college coach, a [...] "fat kid" [...] by general manager Billy Beane, and a [...] "thicker-bodied guy" [...] by the Red Sox scout who recruited him. As Jackie MacMullan wrote for the Boston Globe: [...] "He does not look like an MVP candidate; more a refrigerator repairman, a butcher, the man selling hammers behind the counter at the True Value hardware store." [...] Youkilis was named to the Sporting News list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking No. 36 on the list in 2009, No. 38 in 2010, and No. 35 in 2011.|$|E

2500|$|In 2017, a History Channel documentary, , {{proposed}} that a photograph in the National Archives of Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands {{was actually a}} picture of a captured Earhart and Noonan. [...] The picture showed a Caucasian male on a dock who appeared to look like Noonan and a woman sitting on the dock but facing away from the camera, who was judged to have <b>a</b> <b>physique</b> and haircut resembling Earhart's. [...] The documentary theorizes that the photo was taken after Earhart and Noonan crashed at Mili Atoll. [...] The documentary also said that physical evidence recovered from Mili matches pieces that could have fallen off an Electra during a crash or subsequent overland move to a barge. [...] The Lost Evidence [...] {{proposed that}} a Japanese ship seen in the photograph was the Koshu Maru, a Japanese military ship. [...] The Lost Evidence was quickly discredited, however, after Japanese blogger Kota Yamano found the original source of the photograph in the Archives in the National Diet Library Digital Collection. [...] The original source of the photo was a Japanese travel guide published in October 1935, implying that the photograph was taken in 1935 or before, and thus would be unrelated to Earhart and Noonan's 1937 disappearance. [...] Additionally, the researcher who discovered the photo also identified the ship in the right of the photo as another ship called Koshu seized by Allied Japanese forces in World War I and not the Koshu Maru.|$|E

60|$|The {{answer was}} in the affirmative, and {{the eyes of the}} whole party turned towards the subject of this remark.

All the while he talked in a low, conversational tone.|$|E

It's clear to me, on the contrary, with <b>a</b> <b>physique</b> like yours, you'll pull yourself together in something less than no time with a week or so at Spa. Before you're due in England to take up harness again you'll be walking miles at a stretch over those heathery hills there. Convalescence, with a man like you, is a rapid process. In a fortnight from to-day, I'll venture to guarantee, you'll be in a fit condition to swim the Channel on your back, or to take one of your famous fifty-mile tramps across the bogs of Dartmoor. I'll give you a tonic that'll set your nerves all right at once. You'll come back from Spa as fresh as a daisy." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{father is}} of {{opinion that the}} wedding should not be delayed too long. While at Versailles he made the {{acquaintance}} of M. de la Feste, and though they had but a short and hurried communion with each other, he was much impressed by M. de la Feste's disposition and conduct, and is strongly in favour of his suit. It is odd that Caroline's betrothed should influence in his favour all who come near him. His portrait, which dear Caroline has shown me, exhibits him to be of <b>a</b> <b>physique</b> that partly accounts for this: {{but there must be}} something more than mere appearance, and it is probably some sort of glamour or fascinating power--the quality which prevented Caroline from describing him to me with any accuracy of detail. At the same time, I see from the photograph that his face and head are remarkably well formed; and though the contours of his mouth are hidden by his moustache, his arched brows show well the romantic disposition of a true lover and painter of Nature. I think that the owner of such a face as this must be tender and sympathetic and true.|$|E
60|$|It {{would not}} have been easy to find a more noble {{specimen}} of vigorous manhood than was offered in the person of him who called himself Hurry Harry. His real name was Henry March but the frontiersmen having caught the practice of giving sobriquets from the Indians, the appellation of Hurry was far oftener applied to him than his proper designation, and not unfrequently he was termed Hurry Skurry, a nickname he had obtained from a dashing, reckless offhand manner, and a physical restlessness that kept him so constantly on the move, as to cause him to be known along the whole line of scattered habitations that lay between the province and the Canadas. The stature of Hurry Harry exceeded six feet four, and being unusually well proportioned, his strength fully realized the idea created by his gigantic frame. The face did no discredit {{to the rest of the}} man, for it was both good-humored and handsome. His air was free, and though his manner necessarily partook of the rudeness of a border life, the grandeur that pervaded so noble <b>a</b> <b>physique</b> prevented it from becoming altogether vulgar.|$|E

60|$|I smoked two pipes, {{one after}} the other, in a vain attempt to draw out some {{definite}} sequence of facts from the tangled web of happenings into which I seemed to have strayed. I {{came to the conclusion}} that Fate, which had bestowed on me <b>a</b> <b>physique</b> of more than ordinary size, a sound constitution, and muscles which had filled my study with various kinds of trophies, had not been equally generous in her dispensation of brains. Try as I would, I could make nothing of the situation in which I found myself. The most reasonable thing seemed to be to conclude that Louis was one of a gang of thieves, that I was about to become their accomplice, and that Felicia was simply the Delilah with whom these people had summoned me to their aid. Such a conclusion, however, was not flattering, nor did it please me in any way. Directly I allowed myself to think of Felicia, I believed in her. There were none of the arts of the adventuress about her methods, her glances, or her words. She did not, for instance, in the least resemble the young lady with the turquoises, who had also been good enough to take an interest in me! I gave the whole thing up at last. Perhaps by the morrow I should know more,--if, indeed, I thought, a little grimly, I knew anything! I could not help feeling that this little enterprise to which I had committed myself might turn out to be a serious affair. Even Louis had not tried to minimize the risks. I felt, however, that if it led me to any better understanding of the situation, I could welcome whatever danger it involved.|$|E
