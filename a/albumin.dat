5|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid. Noted examples at the time included <b>albumin</b> from egg whites, blood serum <b>albumin,</b> fibrin, and wheat gluten.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is taken}} orally, and is absorbed well – 80% of {{alprazolam}} binds to proteins in the serum (the majority binding to <b>albumin).</b> The concentration of alprazolam peaks after {{one to two}} hours.|$|E
5|$|About 50–80% of {{salicylate}} in {{the blood}} is bound to <b>albumin</b> protein, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.|$|E
40|$|Of {{the total}} protein in the protein bodies of castor bean (Ricinus communis L.), {{approximately}} 40 % {{is represented by}} a group of closely related <b>albumins</b> localized in the matrix of the organelle. This group of <b>albumins</b> has a sedimentation value of 2 S and is resolved into several proteins of molecular weight around 12, 000 daltons by sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. It has a high content of glutamate/glutamine and undergoes rapid degradation during the early stage of germination. In view of the abundance and ubiquitous occurrence of <b>albumins</b> in various seeds, we suggest that <b>albumins,</b> in addition to globulins, glutelins, and prolamines, are important storage proteins in seeds...|$|R
40|$|Immunological {{tolerance}} {{produced in}} rabbits by neonatal injections of BSA can be terminated {{by a series}} of injections of certain heterologous serum <b>albumins</b> which cross-react with BSA. Injections of <b>albumins</b> distantly related to BSA were more effective in terminating the tolerant state than injections of <b>albumins</b> closely related to BSA. It was concluded from results obtained with several heterologous <b>albumins</b> that immunological tolerance to BSA is directed to both the over-all antigenic or physical-chemical composition of the protein and the individual determinant groups present on the protein. Several possible mechanisms were given to explain the ability of cross-reacting <b>albumins</b> to terminate the tolerant state of BSA-tolerant rabbits. A possible relationship between the termination of tolerance in BSA-tolerant rabbits injected with cross-reacting <b>albumins</b> and autoimmunily was discussed. It was also suggested that the relative ease with which tolerance could be established to heterologous serum proteins in comparison to bacterial antigens {{is the result of the}} close serological and physical-chemical relationship of the heterologous serum proteins to the serum proteins of the rabbit. Rabbits injected with 500 mg of BSA during the first 5 days of life failed to form antibody capable of either eliciting an immune elimination of an injection of I* BSA given 3 to 4 months later or complexing with the circulating I* BSA...|$|R
40|$|Although thionins and 2 S <b>albumins</b> are {{generally}} considered as storage proteins, both classes of seed proteins {{are known to}} inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi. We have now found that the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) thionin concentration required for 50 % inhibition of fungal growth is lowered 2 - to 73 -fold when combined with 2 S <b>albumins</b> (at sub- or noninhibitory concentrations) from radish (Raphanus sativus L.) or oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). Furthermore, the thionin antifungal activity is synergistically enhanced (2 - to 33 -fold) by either the small subunit or the large subunit of the radish 2 S <b>albumins.</b> Three other 2 S albumin-like proteins, the barley trypsin inhibitor and two barley Bowman-Birk-type trypsin inhibitor isoforms, also act synergistically with the thionins (2 - to 55 -fold). The synergistic activity of thionins combined with 2 S <b>albumins</b> is restricted to filamentous fungi and to some Gram-positive bacteria, whereas Gram-negative bacteria, yeast, cultured human cells, and erythrocytes do not show an increased sensitivity to thionin/albumin combinations (relative to the sensitivity to the thionins alone). Scanning electron microscopy and measurement of K+ leakage from fungal hyphae revealed that 2 S <b>albumins</b> have the same mode of action as thionins, namely the permeabilization of the hyphal plasmalemma. Moreover, 2 S <b>albumins</b> and thionins act synergistically {{in their ability to}} permeabilize fungal membranes...|$|R
5|$|After secretion, only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the thyroid hormones travel freely in the blood. Most are bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (about 70%), transthyretin (10%), and <b>albumin</b> (15%). Only the 0.03% of T4 and 0.3% of T3 traveling freely has hormonal activity. In addition, up to 85% of the T3 in blood is produced following conversion from T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases in organs around the body.|$|E
5|$|In blood plasma, zinc {{is bound}} to and transported by <b>albumin</b> (60%, low-affinity) and {{transferrin}} (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.|$|E
5|$|Nephrotic syndrome, {{in which}} protein from the {{bloodstream}} is {{released into the}} urine due to kidney diseases, can predispose to thrombosis; this is particularly the case in more severe cases (as indicated by blood levels of <b>albumin</b> below 25g/l) and if the syndrome {{is caused by the}} condition membranous nephropathy. Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) predispose to thrombosis, particularly when the disease is active. Various mechanisms have been proposed.|$|E
40|$|Exogenous {{drugs that}} are used as {{antidote}} against chemotheray, inflammation or viral infection, gets absorbed and interacts reversibly to the major serum transport protein i. e. <b>albumins,</b> upon entering the circulatory system. To have a structural guideline in the rational drug designing and in the synthesis of drugs with greater efficacy, the binding mechanism of an antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory drug Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) with human and bovine serum <b>albumins</b> (HSA & BSA) were examined by spectroscopic and computational methods. NDGA binds to site II of HSA with binding constant (Kb) ~ 105 M- 1 and free energy (ΔG) ~ - 7. 5 kcal. mol- 1. It also binds at site II of BSA but with lesser binding affinity (Kb) ~ 105 M- 1 and ΔG ~ - 6. 5 kcal. mol- 1. The negative value of ΔG, ΔH and ΔS for both the <b>albumins</b> at three different temperatures confirmed that the complex formation process between <b>albumins</b> and NDGA is spontaneous and exothermic. Furthermore, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions are the main forces involved in complex formation of NDGA with both the <b>albumins</b> as evaluated from fluorescence and molecular docking results. Binding of NDGA to both the <b>albumins</b> alter the conformation and causes minor change in the secondary structure of proteins {{as indicated by the}} CD spectra...|$|R

50|$|The globulins are {{a family}} of {{globular}} proteins that have higher molecular weights than <b>albumins</b> and are insoluble in pure water but dissolve in dilute salt solutions. Some globulins are produced in the liver, while others are made by the immune system. Globulins, <b>albumins,</b> and fibrinogen are the major blood proteins. The normal concentration of globulins in human blood is about 2.6-4.6 g/dL.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} some debate over the {{relationship}} of Mammuthus to Loxodonta or Elephas. Some DNA studies suggest Mammuthus is {{more closely related to}} the former while others point to the latter. However, analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome profile of the woolly mammoth (sequenced in 2005) supports Mammuthus being more closely related to Elephas. Morphological evidence supports Mammuthus and Elephas as sister taxa while comparisons of protein <b>albumin</b> and collagen have concluded that all three genera are equally related to each other. Some scientists believe a cloned mammoth embryo could one day be implanted in an Asian elephant's womb.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum <b>albumin</b> and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Imipramine {{hydrochloride}} (IMP) is a cationic amphiphilic molecule {{belonging to}} the antidepressant category of drugs. Here we report the interaction of IMP with serum <b>albumins</b> (i. e., human (HSA) and bovine (BSA)) using various biophysical methods. Absorption spectroscopy provides qualitative information about the interaction and complex formation between IMP and serum <b>albumins.</b> The binding parameters and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters have been estimated by fluorescence quenching method. The results revealed that hydrophobic forces were the predominant intermolecular forces between serum <b>albumins</b> and IMP. The quenching rate constant (kq) values decrease with increase in temperature which indicates a staticquenching procedure. At very low concentrations of drug, the conformational changes in HSA/BSA due to interaction were investigated by circular dichroism (CD). For different molar ratios of protein and drug, the far-UV CD spectra showed an increase in �-helicity of serum <b>albumins</b> with the increment in �-helical structural content being slightly higher for IMP-BSA complex...|$|R
40|$|By using neutron and {{synchrotron}} x-ray {{small-angle scattering}} techniques, we investigated {{the process of}} the complexation of gangliosides with proteins. We treated monosialoganglioside (G(M 1)), disialoganglioside (G(D 1 a)), and a mixture of G(M 1) /G(D 1 a). Proteins used were bovine serum <b>albumins</b> whose surfaces were modified with different sugars (deoxy-D-galactose, deoxy-L-fucose, deoxymaltitol, and deoxycellobiitol), which were used as model glycoproteins in a membrane. We found that the complexation of gangliosides with <b>albumins</b> greatly depends on the combination of ganglioside species and protein surface modification. With a varying protein/ganglioside ratio in a buffer solution at pH 7, the complexation of G(M 1) or G(D 1 a) with <b>albumins</b> modified by monosaccharides appears to be less destructive for ganglioside aggregate structures in forming large complexes; the complexation of G(D 1 a) with the <b>albumins</b> modified by disaccharides induces the formation of complexes with a dimeric structure; and the complexation of G(M 1) with <b>albumins</b> modified by disaccharides, to form small complexes, is very destructive. The present results show a strong dependence of the interaction between ganglioside and protein on the characteristics of the ganglioside and protein surface, which would relate to a physiological function of gangliosides, such as a function regulating the receptor activity of glycoproteins in a cell membrane...|$|R
40|$|Nine Egyptian cultivars of Vicia faba were {{analyzed}} using electrophoretic and quantitative data from seed <b>albumins</b> and globulins and 100 seeds weight to measure genetic variation among faba bean cultivars in Egypt. Wide genetic variation was indicated for all the traits studied. The elctrophoregrams showed identity profile for each cutivar supporting the validity of electrophoresis of seed protein components in cultivar identification and assessing genetic variation in Vicia faba and other out-breeding plants at the infra-specific level. Negative correlation was indicated between seed globulins and both seed <b>albumins</b> and seed weight. Princpal component analysis and cluster analyses indicated higher role of seed <b>albumins</b> over seed globulins in genetic variation within Vicia faba in Egypt...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{fractions}} (<b>albumins,</b> globulins, prolamins, and glutelins) {{were prepared}} from oat seeds (variety Sentinel). Column chromatography on Sephacryl S- 200 {{revealed that the}} four solubility fractions had unique polypeptide compositions and there was little cross contamination among the fractions. Isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels resolved the fractions into {{a large number of}} bands covering a wide pH range. Differential scanning calorimetric studies showed that <b>albumins</b> and globulins had an endothermic peak at 87 and 110 °C, respectively, while prolamins and glutelins had no thermal response. Some functional properties of the solubility fractions were determined to assess the potential use of oat proteins as a food ingredient.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{domestic}} cooking on proteins, organic compounds and Fe distribution in beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were investigated. Sequential extraction with different extractant solutions (mixture of methanol and chloroform 1 : 2 v/v, water, 0. 5 mol L- 1 NaCl, 70 % v/v ethanol and 0. 5 mol L- 1 NaOH) {{were used for}} extracting lipids, <b>albumins,</b> globulins, prolamins and glutelins, respectively. Iron determination by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF AAS), proteins by Bradford method and organic compounds by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) were carried out in this work. High concentration of <b>albumins,</b> globulins and glutelins were found in raw beans, while in the cooked beans, <b>albumins</b> and glutelins are main proteins types. The MALDI-TOF MS spectra of raw and cooked beans revealed that the domestic cooking altered the molecular weight of the organic compounds, since that in the cooked beans were found compounds between 2 and 3. 5 kDa, which were not presented in the raw beans. Besides this, in cooked beans were also observed the presence of four compounds of high molecular weight (12 - 16 kDa), being that in the raw grains {{there is only one}} (ca. 15. 2 kDa). In raw grains is possible to observe that Fe is mainly associated to <b>albumins,</b> globulins and glutelins. For cooked grains, Fe is associated to <b>albumins</b> and globulins.

Accessions of V. narbonensis clustered together using prolamins profiles. <b>Albumins,</b> globulins and prolamins patterns joined all samples of V. lutea in the same subcluster with no discrimination between subsp. eu-lutea and subsp. vetsita. These observations show that there is an overlap between accessions of these two subspecies. The utilization of seed storage proteins shows a close relationship between the taxa when it is difficult to distinguish groups which could be identified as eu-lutea or as vestita. <b>Albumins</b> and globulins profiles not link accessions of V. lutea and V. narbonensis.
