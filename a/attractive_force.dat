5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom {{are attracted to}} the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the {{electrons in}}side an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the <b>attractive</b> <b>force.</b> Hence electrons bound {{near the center of}} the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E
5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> increases {{with the size of}} the atom {{as a result of the}} increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E
50|$|Earth element (pruhavī-dhātu)Earth element {{represents}} {{the quality of}} solidity or <b>attractive</b> <b>forces.</b> Any matter where <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> are in prominence (solid bodies) are called earth elements. Internal earth elements include head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bone, organs, intestinal material, etc.|$|R
30|$|The {{basic model}} of {{aggregation}} as {{given in the}} section, ‘A model of nanoparticle aggregation’, indicates the rate of aggregation caused by the collision of particles (in proximity, <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> outweigh the repulsive ones). We established a limit distance in which <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> outweigh the repulsive ones. The magnetic forces attract particles closer {{to each other and}} then they aggregate due to attractive van der Waals forces.|$|R
50|$|Deviations of the {{compressibility}} factor, Z, from unity {{are due to}} {{attractive and}} repulsive Intermolecular forces. At a given temperature and pressure, repulsive forces tend to make the volume larger than for an ideal gas; when these forces dominate Z is greater than unity. When <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> dominate, Z is less than unity. The relative importance of <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> decreases as temperature increases (see effect on gases).|$|R
5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic <b>attractive</b> <b>force,</b> while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
50|$|Simpson {{demonstrated}} that, in {{the same}} way as, in the Fermat triangle problem case, the constructed triangles ABE, ACF and BCG were equilateral because the three <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> were equal, in the Weber triangle problem case, the constructed triangles ABE, ACF and BCG, where E, F and G are located outside the ABC triangle, must be proportional to the <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> of the location system.|$|R
40|$|Adsorption is a {{physical}} phenomenon which occurs when gas or liquid molecules are brought into contact with a solid surface. It {{is a result of}} intermolecular <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> of the solid and the substance adsorbed. The <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> are different for each system. This variation of <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> causes an increased concentration of one molecular type on the solid surface when two different molecules are brought into contact with the solid. The process is reversible. In the chemical engineering sense, adsorption may be defined in terms of a unit operation which deals with the utilization of surface forces and the concentration of materials on the surfaces of solid bodies referred to as adsorbants...|$|R

5|$|When the {{right-hand}} side of the equation is a positive real number, the solution corresponds to an epispiral. When the argument θ1 – θ0 equals ±90°×k, the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity. Thus, when k is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure7). On the other hand, when k is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The possible values of the parameter k may range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, L12/m. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ < L12/m), as illustrated in Figure 7. Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion.|$|E
25|$|The Le Sage {{mechanism}} {{also has}} been identified as a significant factor in the behavior of dusty plasma. A.M. Ignatov has shown that an <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> arises between two dust grains suspended in an isotropic collisionless plasma due to inelastic collisions between ions of the plasma and the grains of dust. This <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between dust grains, and can counterbalance the Coulomb repulsion between dust grains.|$|E
25|$|In {{electrodynamic}} suspension (EDS), {{both the}} guideway {{and the train}} exert a magnetic field, and the train is levitated by the repulsive and <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> between these magnetic fields. In some configurations, the train can be levitated only by repulsive force. In {{the early stages of}} maglev development at the Miyazaki test track, a purely repulsive system was used instead of the later repulsive and attractive EDS system. The magnetic field is produced either by superconducting magnets (as in JR–Maglev) or by an array of permanent magnets (as in Inductrack). The repulsive and <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> in the track is created by an induced magnetic field in wires or other conducting strips in the track. A major advantage of EDS maglev systems is that they are dynamically stable – changes in distance between the track and the magnets creates strong forces to return the system to its original position. In addition, the <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> varies in the opposite manner, providing the same adjustment effects. No active feedback control is needed.|$|E

40|$|We {{formulate}} a microscopic, no adjustable parameter, theory of activated relaxation in supercooled liquids directly {{in terms of}} the repulsive and <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> within the framework of pair correlations. Under isochoric conditions, <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> can nonperturbatively modify slow dynamics, but at high enough density their influence vanishes. Under isobaric conditions, <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> play a minor role. High temperature apparent Arrhenius behavior and density-temperature scaling are predicted. Our results are consistent with recent isochoric simulations and isobaric experiments on a deeply supercooled molecular liquid. The approach can be generalized to treat colloidal gelation and glass melting, and other soft matter slow dynamics problems. Comment: Accepted to Physical Review Letters.

25|$|The Finger of God {{effect is}} {{one result of}} this phenomenon. In systems that are gravitationally bound, such as galaxies or our {{planetary}} system, the expansion of space is a much weaker effect than the <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> of gravity.|$|E

40|$|Molecular Dynamics {{simulations}} of a Lennard-Jones system with different range of attraction {{show that the}} <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> modify the radial distribution of the particles. For condensed liquids only, the forces within the the first coordination shell (FCS) are important, but for gases and moderate condensed fluids, even the <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> outside the FCS play a role. The changes in the distribution caused by neglecting the <b>attractive</b> <b>forces,</b> lead to a too high pressure.

25|$|In 1900 Lorentz {{tried to}} explain gravity {{on the basis of}} the Maxwell equations. He first {{considered}} a Le Sage type model and argued that there possibly exists a universal radiation field, consisting of very penetrating em-radiation, and exerting a uniform pressure on every body. Lorentz showed that an <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> between charged particles would indeed arise, if it is assumed that the incident energy is entirely absorbed. This was the same fundamental problem which had afflicted the other Le Sage models, because the radiation must vanish somehow and any absorption must lead to an enormous heating. Therefore, Lorentz abandoned this model.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} after the {{discovery}} of general relativity, it was realized that general relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics. It is possible to describe gravity {{in the framework of}} quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces, such that the <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons, {{in the same way as}} the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons. This reproduces general relativity in the classical limit. However, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the Planck length, where a more complete theory of quantum gravity (or a new approach to quantum mechanics) is required.|$|E

This reproduces general relativity in the classical limit, but only at the linearized level and postulating that the conditions for the applicability of Ehrenfest theorem holds, which is not always the case. Besides, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the Planck length.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} {{is different in}} a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound pairs of electrons known as Cooper pairs. This pairing is caused by an <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> between electrons from the exchange of phonons. Due to quantum mechanics, the energy spectrum of this Cooper pair fluid possesses an energy gap, meaning there is a minimum amount of energy ΔE that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if ΔE {{is larger than the}} thermal energy of the lattice, given by kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature, the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice. The Cooper pair fluid is thus a superfluid, meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.|$|E
25|$|Newton, {{faced in}} May 1686 with Hooke's {{claim on the}} inverse square law, denied that Hooke was to be {{credited}} as author of the idea. Among the reasons, Newton recalled that the idea had been discussed with Sir Christopher Wren previous to Hooke's 1679 letter. Newton also pointed out and acknowledged prior work of others, including Bullialdus, (who suggested, but without demonstration, {{that there was an}} <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> from the Sun in the inverse square proportion to the distance), and Borelli (who suggested, also without demonstration, that there was a centrifugal tendency in counterbalance with a gravitational attraction towards the Sun so as to make the planets move in ellipses).

25|$|He often {{referred}} to Le Sage's theory in his lectures on physics at the University of Göttingen. However, around 1796 Lichtenberg changed his views after being persuaded by the arguments of Immanuel Kant, who criticized any kind of theory that attempted to replace attraction with impulsion. Kant {{pointed out that the}} very existence of spatially extended configurations of matter, such as particles of non-zero radius, implies the existence of some sort of binding force to hold the extended parts of the particle together. Now, that force cannot be explained by the push from the gravitational particles, because those particles too must hold together in the same way. To avoid this circular reasoning, Kant asserted that there must exist a fundamental <b>attractive</b> <b>force.</b> This was precisely the same objection that had always been raised against the impulse doctrine of Descartes in the previous century, and had led even the followers of Descartes to abandon that aspect of his philosophy.|$|E
