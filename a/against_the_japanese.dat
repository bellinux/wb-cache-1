Of the 48 provinces in the Philippines, only 12 were in firm control of the Japanese.

During the occupation, many Filipino soldiers and guerrillas never lost hope of the United States.

5|$|By {{this stage}} of the war, the New Zealand Government had {{authorised}} the raising of the 3rd Division for service in the Pacific <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese.</b> To be formed in New Zealand, the division was based around the recently returned 8th and 14th Brigades, and the battalions making up these formations, and commanded by Major General Harold Barrowclough. Barrowclough set about organising the new division and implemented training programs to prepare his new command for fighting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> in the Pacific. However, at the request of Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area of Operations, the 34th Battalion was selected in October 1942 to garrison Tonga. The move was to replace American forces that had moved to Guadalcanal. The battalion was withdrawn from divisional exercises in the Waikato Region of the North Island and shipped to Tonga's main island of Tongatapu aboard the SS President Jackson. Now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Richard Eyre, the battalion remained here under American control for a period of five months.|$|E

5|$|In early 1943, {{along with}} the rest of the 9th Division, the {{battalion}} was brought back to Australia in order to take part in fighting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> in the Pacific. This was the final stage in the withdrawal of the 2nd AIF divisions from the Middle East, as the Australian Army's focus had shifted to operations in the Pacific theatre <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese.</b> As part of this process the 6th and 7th Divisions had been brought back to Australia earlier the previous year. Embarking upon the transport Aquitania on 27 January 1943, the battalion sailed as part of a large convoy established as part of Operation Pamphlet; this convoy included the transports Ile de France, Nieuw Amsterdam, and the armed merchant cruiser Queen of Bermuda, and was escorted by HMS Devonshire and several destroyers. The voyage lasted a month, with the troops arriving in Sydney on 27 February.|$|E
5|$|In early November, Vandegrift, {{fearing that}} the Japanese were {{planning}} {{an assault on}} the Lunga perimeter from the east using Shōji's forces plus additional reinforcements, launched an operation <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> units at Koli Point. Beginning on 4 November, two battalions of U.S. Marines and two battalions of U.S. Army troops attacked and attempted to encircle Shōji's men at Gavaga Creek near the village of Tetere in the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{attempted}} {{to slow the}} Japanese advance with an initial defense <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> landings. MacArthur's plan for holding all of Luzon <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> collapsed as it spread out the American-Filipino forces too thin. However, he reconsidered his confidence {{in the ability of}} his Filipino troops after the Japanese landing force made a rapid advance after landing at Lingayen Gulf on 21 December, and ordered a retreat to Bataan. Within two days of the Japanese landing at Lingayen Gulf, MacArthur had reverted to pre-July 1941 plan of attempting to hold only Bataan while waiting for a relief force to come. Most of the American and some of the Filipino troops were able to retreat back to Baatan, but without most of their supplies, which were abandoned in the confusion. Manila was declared an open city at midnight on 24 December, without any consultation with Admiral Thomas C. Hart, commanding the Asiatic Fleet, forcing the Navy to destroy considerable amounts of valuable material.|$|E
