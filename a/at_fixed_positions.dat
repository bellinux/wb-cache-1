2500|$|Fourier {{transform}} {{mass spectrometry}} (FTMS), {{or more precisely}} Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS, measures mass by detecting the image current produced by ions cyclotroning {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. Instead of measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an electron multiplier, the ions are injected into a Penning trap (a static electric/magnetic ion trap) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors <b>at</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>positions</b> in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near them over time, producing a periodic signal. Since the frequency of an ion's cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be deconvoluted by performing a Fourier transform on the signal. FTMS has the advantage of high sensitivity (since each ion is [...] "counted" [...] more than once) and much higher resolution and thus precision.|$|E

50|$|By definition, if a {{particle}} with no forces acting on {{it has its}} position expressed in an inertial coordinate system, (x1, x2, x3, t), then there it will have no acceleration (d2xj/dt2 = 0). In this context, a coordinate system can fail to be “inertial” either due to non-straight time axis or non-straight space axes (or both). In other words, the basis vectors of the coordinates may vary in time <b>at</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>positions,</b> or they may vary with position at fixed times, or both. When equations of motion are {{expressed in terms of}} any non-inertial coordinate system (in this sense), extra terms appear, called Christoffel symbols. Strictly speaking, these terms represent components of the absolute acceleration (in classical mechanics), but we may also choose to continue to regard d2xj/dt2 as the acceleration (as if the coordinates were inertial) and treat the extra terms as if they were forces, in which case they are called fictitious forces. The component of any such fictitious force normal to the path of the particle and in the plane of the path’s curvature is then called centrifugal force.|$|E

This description is a commonplace for betatron os-cillations, synchrotron oscillations in a static case, and for collective beam instabilities. However, the time is usually used for synchrotron oscillations in a changing magnetic fields. Also, betatron accelerations are sometimes ignored. We develop a symplectic theory for synchrotron oscilla-tions which uses the orbit length as an independent variable and includes betatron acceleration. Since sychrotron os-cillations are closly connected with transverse coordinates, we also study synchro-betatron coupling. ...|$|E
