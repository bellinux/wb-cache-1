40|$|Multi-rate {{digital signal}} {{processing}} (DSP) algorithms are often modeled with synchronous dataflow graphs (SDFGs). A lower iteration period implies a faster execution of a DSP algorithm. Retiming is a simple but efficient graph transformation technique for performance optimization, which can decrease the iteration period without <b>affecting</b> <b>functionality.</b> In this paper, we deal with two problems: feasible retiming — retiming an SDFG to meet a given iteration period constraint; and optimal retiming — retiming an SDFG to achieve the smallest iteration period. We present a novel algorithm for feasible retiming and based on that one, a new algorithm for optimal retiming, and prove their correctness. Both methods work directly on SDFGs, without explicitly converting them to their equivalent homogeneous SDFGs (HSDFGs). Experimental results show that our methods give a significant improvemen...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{retiming}} of DSP algorithms exhibiting multirate behavior is treated. Using the non-ordinary marked graph {{model and the}} reachability theory, we provide a new condition for valid retiming of multirate graphs. We show that for a graph with n nodes the reachability condition can be split into the reachability condition for the topologically -equivalent unit-rate graph (all rates set to one), and (n 2 Γ n) = 2 rate-dependent conditions. Using this property a class of equivalent graphs of reduced complexity is introduced which are equivalent in terms of retiming. Additionally, the circuit-based necessary condition for valid retiming of multirate graphs is extended for the sufficient part. 1.

While permissions provide an important level of security, for many applications they allow broader access than actually required. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that addresses this issue by adding finer-grained permissions to Android. Underlying our framework is a taxonomy of four major groups of Android permissions, {{each of which}} admits some common strategies for deriving sub-permissions. We used these strategies to investigate fine-grained versions of five {{of the most common}} Android permissions, including access to the Internet, user contacts, and system settings. We then developed a suite of tools that allow these fine-grained permissions to be inferred on existing apps; to be enforced by developers on their own apps; and to be retrofitted by users on existing apps. We evaluated our tools on a set of top apps from Google Play, and found that fine-grained permissions are applicable {{to a wide variety of}} apps and that they can be retrofitted to increase security of existing apps without <b>affecting</b> <b>functionality...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cell {{libraries}} are {{collections of}} logic cores (cells) {{used to construct}} larger chip designs; hence, any reduction in their power consumption may {{have a major impact}} in the power consumption of larger designs. The power consumption of a cell is often determined by triggering it with all possible input values in all possible orders at each state. In this paper, we first present a technique to measure the power consumption of a cell more efficiently by reducing the number of input orders that have to be checked. This is based on symbolic techniques and analyzes the number of (weighted) wire chargings taking place. Additionally, we present a technique that computes for a cell all orders that lead to the same state, but differ in their power consumption. Such an analysis is used to select the orders that minimize the required power, without <b>affecting</b> <b>functionality,</b> by inserting sufficient delays. Both techniques have been evaluated on an industrial cell library and were able to efficiently reduce the number of orders needed for power characterization and to efficiently compute orders that consume less power for a given state and input-vector transition. ...|$|E
40|$|The diverse pneumococcal {{diseases}} {{are associated with}} different pneumococcal lineages, or clonal complexes. Nevertheless, intra-clonal genomic variability, which influences pathogenicity, has been reported for surface virulence factors. These factors constitute the communication interface between the pathogen and its host and their corresponding genes are subjected to strong selective pressures <b>affecting</b> <b>functionality</b> and immunogenicity. First, the presence and allelic dispersion of 97 outer protein families were screened in 19 complete pneumococcal genomes. Seventeen families were deemed variable and were then examined in 216 draft genomes. This procedure allowed the generation of binary vectors with 17 positions and the classification of strains into surfotypes. They represent the outer protein subsets with the highest inter-strain discriminative power. A total of 116 non-redundant surfotypes were identified. Those sharing a critical number of common protein features were hierarchically clustered into 18 surfogroups. Most clonal complexes with comparable epidemiological characteristics belonged to the same or similar surfogroups. However, the very large CC 156 clonal complex was dispersed over several surfogroups. In order to establish a relationship between surfogroup and pathogenicity, the surfotypes of 95 clinical isolates with different serogroup/serotype combinations were analysed. We found a significant correlation between surfogroup and type of pathogenic behaviour (primary invasive, opportunistic invasive and non-invasive). We conclude that the virulent behaviour of S. pneumoniae {{is related to the}} activity of collections of, rather than individual, surface virulence factors. Since surfotypes evolve faster than MLSTs and directly reflect virulence potential, this novel typing protocol is appropriate for the identification of emerging clones...|$|E

However, individual residues that determine reciprocal specificity of the viral attachment and fusion (F) proteins {{have not been}} identified. We have developed an assay based {{on a pair of}} canine distemper virus (CDV) F proteins (strains Onderstepoort (ODP) and Lederle) that share ∼ 95 % identity but differ in their ability to form functional complexes with the measles virus (MV) attachment protein (H). Characterization of CDV F chimeras and mutagenesis reveals four residues in CDV F-ODP (positions 164, 219, 233, and 317) required for productive interaction with MV H. Mutating these residues to the Lederle type disrupts triggering of F-ODP by MV H without <b>affecting</b> <b>functionality</b> when co-expressed with CDV H. Co-immunoprecipitation shows a stronger physical interaction of F-ODP than F-Lederle with MV H. Mutagenesis of MV F highlights the MV residues homologous to CDV F residues 233 and 317 as determinants for physical glycoprotein interaction and fusion activity under homotypic conditions. In assay reversal, the introduction of sections of the CDV H stalk into MV H shows a five-residue fragment (residues 110 – 114) to mediate specificity for CDV F-Lederle. All of the MV H stalk chimeras are surface-expressed, show hemadsorption activity, and trigger MV F. Combining the five-residue H chimera with the CDV F-ODP quadruple mutant partially restores activity, indicating that the residues identified in either glycoprotein contribute interdependently to the formation of functional complexes. Their localization in structural models of F and H suggests that placement in particular of F residue 233 in close proximity to the 110 – 114 region of H is structurally conceivable...|$|E

40|$|Folate {{receptor}} α (FRα) is a cell surface, glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein {{which has}} focussed attention as a therapeutic target {{and as a}} marker for the diagnosis of cancer. It has a high affinity for the dietary supplemented folic acid (FOL), carrying out endocytic transport across the cell membrane and delivering the folate at the acidic pH of the endosome. Starting from the recently reported X-ray structure at pH 7, 100 ns classical molecular dynamics simulations {{have been carried out}} on the FRα-FOL complex; moreover, the ligand dissociation process has been studied by metadynamics, a recently reported method for the analysis of free-energy surfaces (FES), providing clues on the intermediate states and their energy terms. Multiple dissociation runs were considered to enhance the configurational sampling; a final clustering of conformations within the averaged FES provides the representative structures of several intermediate states, within an overall barrier for ligand escape of about 75 kJ/mol. Escaping of FOL to solvent occurs while only minor changes affect the FRα conformation of the binding pocket. During dissociation, the FOL molecule translates and rotates around a turning point located in proximity of the receptor surface. FOL at this transition state assumes an "L" shaped conformation, with the pteridin ring oriented to optimize stacking within W 102 and W 140 residues, and the negatively charged glutamate tail, outside the receptor, interacting with the positively charged R 103 and R 106 residues, that contrary to the bound state, are solvent exposed. We show that metadynamics method can provide useful insights at the atomistic level on the effects of point-mutations <b>affecting</b> <b>functionality,</b> thus being a very promising tool for any study related to folate-targeted drug delivery or cancer therapies involving folate uptake...|$|E
40|$|Large wood is a {{critical}} element in stream ecosystems, but only a subset of wood pieces actually provide hydraulic, geomorphic, and ecological functions. We test the current paradigm that larger pieces provide more function, and examine the role wildfires may play in <b>affecting</b> <b>functionality</b> of recruited wood. We conducted a cross-basin analysis in nine central Portugal watersheds, obtaining a variety of measurements on 1483 wood pieces (diameter ≥ 0. 05 m; length ≥ 0. 5 m) in 27 streams burned within six years prior. We examined nonlinear relationships and indirect effects on function using Generalized Additive Modeling and Structural Equation Modeling. Variables with direct effects on function were piece diameter, rootwads, anchoring, position (bridging, ramping, loose), longitudinal distance along the stream continuum, and the ratio of piece length to channel width. The effect of length ratio on function was nonlinear. Relatively long pieces {{were more likely to}} be functional until they were ∼ 3 times the channel width, at which point longer pieces became less likely to be functional. Post-fire wood likely lacked complexity and longer pieces {{were more likely to be}} bridging; both conditions may have prohibited them from interacting with the wetted area. Wildfires had indirect effects on function. Burned pieces were more likely to be large in diameter (thus more likely functional) but not anchored (thus less likely functional); these antagonistic effects may be the reason burned status had no direct effect on function. Our results challenge the wellestablished idea that the function of wood in streams is simply a matter of wood size, along with indicators of longevity (e. g. stability and decay status). Relatively long pieces may in fact provide less function to the stream, at least until they break or are transported further downstream. Practitioners installing wood to streams should consider pieces with wide diameter and rootwads, approximately 3 times the channel width, and anchored but not bridging the channe...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{performance}} measurement and management (PMM) is well filled with frameworks, models and guidelines addressing what {{to measure and}} how to design a performance measurement system (PMS). However, what has been less examined so far is how to ensure that PM evolve in tandem with their environments. Further, the few approaches available today are prescriptive and outlines how or what practitioners should {{do in order to}} manage change in their PM. Thus, a gap exists in understanding how organisations manage change in their PM in practice. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to outline and compare the approaches of three case companies for managing PM change. In order to fulfil the purpose of the paper, the data presented has been collected through the deployment of case studies. The choice of case studies as means for data collection stems from the possibility of an in-depth and holistic examination of the formulated phenomenon. All three case companies belong to the same company-group that operates within the transportation industry. The industrial footprint of the company is global with operations and sales spread out over the world. The findings suggest that all three companies have processes in place for managing change in PM. However, the approaches differ in design and context. Even though the case companies had different approaches in place to manage change in PM, they shared several commonalities. Commonalities were shared in the way of execution, process input and challenges in IT and culture. Furthermore, employee involvement seemed to be the biggest challenge for all three companies. The findings put forward in this paper are limited as they are confined to three companies from the same company-group. More studies, both from within and outside the company-group, are needed in order to establish a solid base of empirical data for generalisation. However, this paper makes a contribution both through describing how three companies manage PM change and through elaborating on the underlying factors <b>affecting</b> <b>functionality.</b> xpre...|$|E
