50|$|Three {{types of}} autocannons are {{available}} for Z-10, with the first being a 23 mm <b>automatic</b> <b>chain</b> gun indigenously developed by China. The largest caliber of gun carried by Z-10 is a 30 mm automatic gun, a Chinese development of the Russian 2A72 autocannon for aircraft use. One of the primary reasons to adopt the 2A72 30 mm gun for aerial use is its high reliability, and according to Russian claim, the failure rate of 2A72 is nearly zero. Another important reason for developing an aerial version of the 2A72 30 mm gun is to simplify logistics. Older 30 mm guns used on fighter jets such as Shenyang J-6 are not compatible with ground and naval guns of the same caliber, and using the same ammo for air, ground and naval guns with the same caliber would greatly reduce the operational cost.|$|R
40|$|The IST project Cuidado, {{which started}} in January 2001, aims at {{producing}} the first entirely <b>automatic</b> <b>chain</b> for extracting and exploiting musical metadata for browsing music. The Sony CSL laboratory is primarily interested {{in the context of}} popular music browsing in large-scale catalogues. First, we are interested in human-centred issues related to browsing "Popular Music". Popular here means that the music accessed to is widely distributed, and known to many listeners. Second, we consider "popular browsing" of music, i. e. making music accessible to non specialists (music lovers), and allowing sharing of musical tastes and information within communities, departing from the usual, single user view of digital libraries. This research project covers all areas of the music-to-listener chain, from music description - descriptor extraction from the music signal, or data mining techniques -, similarity based access and novel music retrieval methods such as automatic sequence generation, and user interface issues. This paper describes the scientific and technical issues at stake, and the results obtained, in {{the current state of the}} IST project...|$|R
30|$|The {{efficiency}} {{and effectiveness of}} rail freight services is largely dependent on the {{efficiency and}} effectiveness of terminals, marshalling yards along the transport <b>chain,</b> and <b>feeder</b> transports. Transhipment in terminals is traditionally performed vertically, {{using a variety of}} equipment, such as Transtainer (gantry crane), Reach Stacker, Straddle carrier, or Fork lift. With this type of equipment, a container is lifted from a train and moved to a stack yard, either for storage, or loading onto a truck, etc. Comparatively speaking, this vertical transhipment is costly, time consuming and incurs a higher risk of loss/damage to cargo. Moreover, 80  % of European trailers cannot be lifted, restricting market share.|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{replacement}} 1, 2, 3, 4 procedures, which {{search for}} placements of a starting model within the crystallographic unit cell that best {{account for the}} measured diffraction amplitudes, followed by <b>automatic</b> <b>chain</b> tracing methods 5, 6, 7, 8, have allowed the rapid solution {{of large numbers of}} protein crystal structures. Despite extensive work 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, molecular replacement or the subsequent rebuilding usually fail with more divergent starting models based on remote homologues with less than 30 % sequence identity. Here we show that this limitation can be substantially reduced by combining algorithms for protein structure modelling with those developed for crystallographic structure determination. An approach integrating Rosetta structure modelling with Autobuild chain tracing yielded high-resolution structures for 8 of 13 X-ray diffraction data sets that could not be solved in the laboratories of expert crystallographers and that remained unsolved after application of an extensive array of alternative approaches. We estimate that the new method should allow rapid structure determination without experimental phase information for over half the cases where current methods fail, given diffraction data sets of better than 3. 2 [*]Å resolution, four or fewer copies in the asymmetric unit, and the availability of structures of homologous proteins with > 20 % sequence identity...|$|R

These motorcycles were painted in the colour combinations black/blue metallic, black/red metallic and black/silver grey and were mainly marketed in Italy, France, and Australia.

40|$|International audienceAbstract 1. Feather pecking {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} facing the egg industry in non-cage systems and is set to become even more of an issue with the European Union ban on the keeping of laying hens in barren battery cages which comes into force in 2012 and a UK ban on beak-trimming in 2011. Reducing feather pecking without resorting to beak treatment is an important goal for the poultry industry. 2. We report here a longitudinal study that included over 335, 500 birds from 22 free range and organic laying farms. Accelerated failure time models and proportional hazards models were used to examine the effects of a wide range of factors (management, environment and bird) on development of substantial feather damage in lay. Particular emphasis was placed on risk factors during rear and on practices that could feasibly be changed or implemented. 3. The age at which a flock exhibits substantial feather damage could be predicted both by factors in the environment and by early symptoms in the birds themselves. Factors that were associated with earlier onset of severe feather damage included the presence of <b>chain</b> <b>feeders,</b> raised levels of carbon dioxide and ammonia, higher sound and light levels, particularly in younger birds. Increased levels of feather damage (even very slight) in birds at 17 - 20 weeks of age was also highly predictive of the time of onset of severe feather damage during lay. Raised levels of feed intake also indicated that a flock was at risk of early severe feather damage. 4. Birds that stayed on the same farm for rear and lay showed later onset of serious feather damage than those that experienced a change in farm from rear to lay. However, an increased number of changes between rear and lay (e. g. feeder type, drinker type, light levels etc) was not associated with earlier onset of serious feather damage. Further research needs to be done on the role of the transition from rear to lay as a risk factor for FP in lay. Keywords Feather pecking, alternate systems, risk predictio...|$|R

Fiscal Year 2016 funding budgets for 804 JLTVs. The Army received its first seven JLTVs for test {{at the end of}} September 2016 according to Colonel Shane Fullmer, JLTV project manager stated at an AUSA 2016 media briefing. He said test vehicles would be sent to Yuma, Arizona, for automotive and mobility testing; to Ft Huachuca, Arizona, for cyber, electronic warfare, and C4 testing; Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, for reliability and automotive testing; and to Alaska for automotive and environmental testing. Some JLTV testing was deferred during the EMD phase, as the government did not want to pay for testing with three suppliers, and it is now set for testing with a fleet of 100 JLTVs. By April 2017 30 JLTVs had been delivered, testing expected to continue through the first quarter of FY19. Also at an AUSA 2016 media briefing, Scott Davis, program executive officer for Combat Support & Combat Service Support, stated that Overall the JLTV programme expects to cut about five years off of the total program and save about US$5.9 billion, as Oshkosh's final competitive bid was low enough so the army decided to 'buy to budget' and get more platforms each year, which shrunk the total length of the contract and increased cost avoidances accrued each year.
