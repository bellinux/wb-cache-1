Apart from offering my own analyses of the two stories from the Mencius, the implication of which is central to this debate, I argue that it is unsuitable to rely on current conceptions and mode of argumentation adopted from Western analytic philosophy to read ancient stories, as is practised by one group of scholars.

He left his brothers, Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan, in charge of Pyeongyang before he left. Namgeon and Namsan took advantage of their brother's absence and took control of Pyeongyang and the Royal Courts. They falsely accused Namsaeng of being a traitor, and forced the King Bojang to order Namsaeng's arrest. With nowhere else to go, Namsaeng fled to Tang China <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>of</b> his son, who had escaped death <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hands of his uncles. Namsaeng fled to the Tang, and received a high position in the Tang military.|$|R

Gillan was unhappy with working on the album, as {{it had already been}} {{partially}} completed with Joe Lynn Turner, and he was only required to write replacement lyrics and vocal melodies, which, unsurprisingly, drew criticism from Blackmore.|$|E
5|$|Roman Polanski's 1971 {{film version}} of Macbeth {{contained}} many parallels to his personal life in its graphic and violent depictions. His wife Sharon Tate had been murdered two years earlier by Charles Manson and three women.

5|$|After the {{original}} serialization of Light House, Monahan reluctantly rewrote the novel several times <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> his agent in New York City. In 1998 Light House {{was sold to}} Riverhead Books, an imprint of Penguin Putnam, and Warner Bros. immediately optioned the film rights while the novel was still in manuscript. Penguin Putnam wanted to delay publishing the novel in order to release it concurrent with the anticipated film release. Warner Bros. hired Monahan to write the screenplay adaptation of Light House.|$|E
5|$|All {{efforts to}} extend the church beyond Kent {{encountered}} difficulties due to the attitude of King Rædwald of East Anglia, who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht's death. Rædwald was converted before the death of Æthelberht, perhaps <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Æthelberht, but his kingdom was not, and Rædwald seems to have converted {{only to the extent}} of placing a Christian altar in his pagan temple. It proved impossible for Mellitus to return to London as bishop, although Justus did resume his duties at Rochester.|$|E

5|$|In August 1835, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> strong <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Ohio's Congressmen, President Jackson removed Mason as Michigan's Territorial Governor and {{appointed}} John S.

While the idea was popular with Michigan residents, the effort failed: the judges held a midnight court before quickly retreating south of the Maumee River, where Ohio forces were positioned.|$|R
5|$|Although Philip {{considered}} Attalus' {{escape a}} bitter defeat, {{it proved to}} be the turning point of the war. Attalus was forced to return to Pergamon, when he learned at Opus that, perhaps <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Philip, Prusias I, king of Bithynia and related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Sulpicius returned to Aegina. Free from the pressure of the combined Roman and Pergamene fleets, Philip was able to resume the offensive against the Aetolians. He captured Thronium, followed by the towns of Tithronium and Drymaea north of the Cephisus, controlling all of Epicnemidian Locris, and took back control of Oreus.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Cicero, the Senate {{inducted}} Octavian {{as senator}} on 1 January 43BC, yet {{he also was}} given the power to vote alongside the former consuls. In addition, Octavian was granted propraetor imperium (commanding power) which legalized his command of troops, sending him to relieve the siege along with Hirtius and Pansa (the consuls for 43BC). In April 43BC, Antony's forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, forcing Antony to retreat to Transalpine Gaul. Both consuls were killed, however, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.|$|E

Shane criticizes Rick for continuing the seemingly pointless search for Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, infuriating Daryl (Norman Reedus).|$|E
50|$|When the Archbishop of Armagh, Thomas Lancaster, died in 1584, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland (and former Archbishop of Armagh), Adam Loftus, {{recommended}} Jones as a replacement, {{despite the}} criticism of his improvident leases.

25|$|Meanwhile, the {{northern}} Royalist column, the main {{thrust of the}} attack, stalled and began to retreat without joining the assault.

At about this time, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> personal <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> General Vang Pao, his BG 224 swept up its southern slopes. On 25 September 1970, the last few PAVN troopers were ousted from the PS 26 summit by the Honorable Dragon forces.|$|R

5|$|He {{then went}} to the Presidential Palace in central Yogyakarta, where the {{government}} leaders were discussing an ultimatum which stated that the city would be stormed unless the leadership accepted colonial rule.

Although his doctors forbade it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men. The central government evacuated to the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, but were captured and exiled.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Joe McEwen of Sire Records {{began to}} pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr and Shawn Colvin to Sire, had been {{interested}} in them since hearing the Not Forever, Just for Now demo tape. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Gary Louris, McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums, and specified a budget of $150,000 for their first.|$|E

5000|$|Arneaux {{started in}} vaudeville, {{and his first}} {{appearance}} on a major stage was in 1876 when he played Tom Walcott, a Southern Planter, in John S. Ladue's [...] "Under the Yoke, or Bond and Free" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Third Avenue theatre in New York. He did not immediately pursue a career in acting, and in 1883 published a song, [...] "Jumbo, the Elephant King!" [...] In 1884 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>of</b> a theatre manager, he took the role of Iago in Othello <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Brooklyn Atheneum, for which he received strong praise. This production was organized by Benjamin J. Ford, who had success <b>at</b> <b>the</b> New York City Lyric Theatre in 1878 as the lead of an all-black cast production of Richard III. Ford {{played the role of}} Othello, Alice Brooks played Desdemona, Marie Lavere as Emilia, B. C. Devreaux as Michael Cassio, and R. R. Cranvell as Brabantio. The group then formed what was perhaps the first Shakespearean troupe of black actors which became known as the Astor Place Tragedy company. The company was managed by Arneaux and presented plays throughout New York City; its most prominent stage was in November 1884 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Academy of Music where it presented John Banim's Damon and Pythias, with Arneaux as Damon and Ford as Pythias. John Ladue, Henrietta Vinton Davis, and Belle Martin were also in the production.|$|R
50|$|Ranx later returns, {{allied with}} the Sinestro Corps, {{apparently}} under the promise of revenge against Gardner.

Chthos-Chthas Chthatis is targeted and slain <b>at</b> <b>the</b> particular <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Ranx, who still remembers the assistance he gave Gardner. Ranx is destroyed by Sodam Yat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the Battle of Mogo, shortly after the Green Lanterns are authorised to use lethal force: Sodam destroys Ranx's power core, obliterating it.|$|R
5|$|In Hall's time, Paris {{was known}} for having a {{relatively}} large and visible gay and lesbian community– in part because France, unlike England, had no laws against male homosexuality. Marcel Proust's novels continued in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting lesbian and gay subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> her friend Jonathan Brockett– who may be based on Noël Coward– she has not yet spoken about her inversion to anyone. Brockett, acting as tour guide, hints at a secret history of inversion in the city by referring to Marie Antoinette's rumoured relationship with the Princesse de Lamballe.|$|E
5|$|Isidore's Latin, {{replete with}} nonstandard Vulgar Latin, {{stands at the}} cusp of Latin and the local Romance {{language}} of Hispania.

5|$|The 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence {{was issued}} by Charles II {{in an attempt}} to {{introduce}} greater religious freedom, and within Somerset, 82 places applied for licences to meet and worship, 22 of them for Baptists. However, the Declaration was withdrawn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Parliament the following year. This led to further hostilities toward Dissenters, which were heightened after the failed Monmouth rebellion, in which a large number of Dissenters fought against the King's forces. After the Glorious Revolution removed James II, his successor William III introduced the Act of Toleration 1689, which specifically allowed nonconformist worship.|$|E
