50|$|Water rights {{can also}} be {{affected}} by the natural <b>avulsion</b> or accretion <b>of</b> <b>lands</b> underlying or bordering a watercourse. Avulsions are marked by a sudden and violent change to the bed or course of a stream or river, causing a measurable loss or addition to land. Accretions are marked by the natural erosion of soil on one side of a watercourse and the gradual addition of soil to the other side. The extended shoreline made by sedimentary deposits is called an alluvion. Water rights are not altered by avulsions. However, any accretions of soil enure to the benefit of the landowner whose holdings have increased by the alluvion addition.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The usual {{causes of}} flexor tendon {{injuries}} in hand are penetrating wounds. Closed injury and <b>avulsion</b> <b>of</b> flexor tendon are rare and mostly occur as <b>avulsion</b> <b>of</b> flexor digitorum profundus tendon of ring finger from its bony insertion at distal phalanx. Closed <b>avulsion</b> <b>of</b> flexor digitorum superficialis is even rarer. The rarest is closed and simultaneous <b>avulsion</b> <b>of</b> both flexors {{in the same}} finger and only about ten cases are reported in the literature. Case Report: Patient was a healthy 27 -year-old right handed male shopkeeper. He fell down during his work ten days before referring to the hospital. After this event {{he was unable to}} flex his left fourth finger through interphalangeal joints. There was no injury to the skin of his hand. With the impression of closed rupture of both flexors of ring finger he underwent operation and repair of the flexor profundus tendon. Conclusion: Closed injury of both flexor tendons should be considered in differential diagnosis in similar situations even though they are rare...|$|R

On {{the basis of the}} site of damage of the PCL, hyperflexion, pretibial trauma, and hyperextension are proposed as mechanisms of PCL injuries. On the other hand, <b>avulsion</b> fractures <b>of</b> the tibial condyle are also rare. We report a PCL-mediated <b>avulsion</b> fracture <b>of</b> the lateral tibial condyle along with the tibial insertion of the PCL by extension-distraction force on the knee that has not been previously described in any study. This rare case may imply that application of an extension-distraction force to the PCL cause the avulsion fracture. Background <b>Avulsion</b> fractures <b>of</b> the {{posterior cruciate ligament}} (PCL) are uncommon. A few mechanisms of PCL injuries have been proposed {{on the basis of the}} site of damage of the PCL [1]. The most common mechanism <b>of</b> <b>avulsion</b> fractures <b>of</b> the PCL at the tibial insertion is a dashboard injury, in which the knee is in a flexed position, and a posteriorly directed force is applied to the pretibial area [1]. <b>Avulsion</b> fractures <b>of</b> the tibial condyle are also rare [2, 3]. The most common subset <b>of</b> <b>avulsion</b> fractures <b>of</b> the lateral tibial condyle is the Segond fracture. It is a small <b>avulsion</b> fracture <b>of</b> the proximal lateral tibial condyle that is induced by a force applied on the lateral capsule and the associated meniscotibial ligament [3]. Herein, we report a PCL-mediated <b>avulsion</b> fracture <b>of</b> the lateral tibial condyle along with the tibial insertion of the PCL by a mechanism that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously described in any study.

40|$|Although tibial end <b>avulsions</b> <b>of</b> the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament are relatively common in clinical practice, <b>avulsions</b> <b>of</b> the femoral end of this ligament are by comparison rare.
