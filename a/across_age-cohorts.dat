To the extent {{that there is a}} trade-off between early marriage and investment in a high-powered career, an age-induced decline in women fertility may cause marriage prospects of high-powered women to depend on the marriage-timing decisions of younger, more fertile women. Under these assumptions, women’s marriage-timing decisions exhibit strategic complementarities. For the initial cohort of younger women, these complemen-tarities induce a non-cooperative game with two Pareto-ranked, Nash-equilibria. Because of the interdependence of women marriage prospects <b>across</b> <b>age-cohorts,</b> the marriage-timing chosen by the initial cohort of younger women determines that of all subsequent cohorts, leading to steady-state equilibria whereby history repeats itself across all future cohorts of women. Either they all are married women with a high-powered career, or they all are married with a low-powered career. As the former is rather counterfactual, our analysis suggests that persistent professional imbal-ances between the sexes are caused by a coordination failure in the marriage-timing decisions of the initial cohort of younger women.

40|$|BackgroundSince 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has {{recommended}} hepatitis A (HepA) vaccination routinely for children aged 122 ̆ 01323 months to prevent hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. However, a substantial proportion of US children are unvaccinated and susceptible to infection. We present results of economic modeling {{to assess whether}} a one-time catch-up HepA vaccination recommendation would be cost-effective. MethodsWe developed a Markov model of HAV infection that followed a single cohort from birth through death (birth to age 95 years). The model compared the health and economic outcomes from catch-up vaccination interventions for children at target ages from two through 17 years vs. outcomes resulting from maintaining the current recommendation of routine vaccination at age one year with no catch-up intervention. ResultsOver the lifetime of the cohort, catch-up vaccination would reduce {{the total number of}} infections relative to the baseline by 741 while increasing doses of vaccine by 556, 989. Catch-up vaccination would increase net costs by 10. 2 million, or 2. 38 per person. The incremental cost of HepA vaccine catch-up intervention at age 10 years, the midpoint of the ages modeled, was 452, 239 per QALY gained. <b>Across</b> <b>age-cohorts,</b> the cost-effectiveness of catch-up vaccination is most favorable at age 12 years, resulting in an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio of 189, 000 per QALY gained. ConclusionsGiven the low baseline of HAV disease incidence achieved by current vaccination recommendations, our economic model suggests that a catch-up vaccination recommendation would be less cost-effective than many other vaccine interventions, and that HepA catch-up vaccination would become cost effective at a threshold of 50, 000 per QALY only when incidence of HAV rises about 5. 0 cases per 100, 000 population.

40|$|International {{comparisons}} of fertility behaviour {{are based on}} two crucial assumptions. First, {{it is assumed that}} the response of fertility rates to socio-economic factors is similar <b>across</b> different <b>age-cohorts</b> of female population in the reproductive age-group. Second, it is assumed that country-specific effects do not influence the parameter estimates of the fertility model. Recent availability of cross-country data {{for a number of years}} allows us to pool data for more than 100 countries for the period 1955 – 1985 and estimate the fertility model. The results show that the impact of socio-economic factors differs across different age-cohorts; particularly, the negative impact of improvements in female status on the fertility rates is higher among the younger age-cohorts. Similarly, our results show that cross-country differences affect fertility rates significantly. However, the differences tend to diminish as countries become more developed. These results indicate that not only cross-country differences but also the changes in age-composition of female population should be taken into account in formulating the policies to control fertility and population growth. Furthermore, improvements in female literacy turn out to be the most effective tool to control population growth. ...|$|R
