5|$|Today {{some of the}} McAuleys (and other various spellings of the name) {{living in}} Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland descend from Clan MacAulay (of Ardincaple). However, there are several {{different}} clans or septs of native Irish which bear exactly the same and similar names that are unrelated and have no connection <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>with</b> Clan MacAulay (of Ardincaple).|$|E
5|$|A monarch is {{the head}} of a monarchy, a form of {{government}} in which a state or polity is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>with</b> actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, {{the success}} of Rossini's Semiramide earlier the same season was what allowed A Life to be staged <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>with</b> {{virtually}} all the cast from Semiramide retained for A Life. Despite A Life's success, the furor over Semiramide aroused an overwhelming demand for Italian opera. This proved a setback for Russian opera in general and particularly for Glinka's next opera, Ruslan and Lyudmila when it was produced in 1842. Its failure prompted Glinka to leave Russia; he died in exile.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano {{also studied}} living languages, {{political}} economy, and public rights. The authors that most influenced him were Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, Adam Smith, and François Quesnay. Belgrano translated Quesnay's book Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d'un royaume agricole (General Maxims of the Economical Government in an Agricultural Kingdom) to Spanish. His main {{interest in the}} works of such authors were ideas that referred to the public good and popular prosperity. Like many South American students, he became interested in physiocracy, which stated that new wealth came from nature, that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed, and that the state should not interfere <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>with</b> it. By that time, South America had plenty of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in the economy. Belgrano developed the idea that the principles of physiocracy and those stated by Adam Smith could be applied together in the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In the development of this approach he was influenced by Fernando Galliani, who promoted the study of particular cases over theoric generalisations, and Antonio Genovesi, who thought that the absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be tempered by a moderate intervention by the state, such as the provision of free education for some. During his time in Europe, Belgrano became president of an Academy within the University of Salamanca devoted to Roman legislation, forensic practice and political economy.|$|E
5|$|The most {{characteristic}} initial {{physical symptoms}} are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea. Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction {{by at least}} three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain {{that is responsible for}} movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>with</b> rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the precise}} {{shape and size}} of the stomach varies widely among {{different}} vertebrates, the relative positions of the oesophageal and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. As a result, the organ always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish have no stomach <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>with</b> the oesophagus opening directly into the anus. These animals all consume diets that either require little storage of food, or no pre-digestion with gastric juices, or both.|$|E
25|$|But Virgil {{is still}} furious, and {{continues}} to berate the Emperor about class snobbery which he sees as the reason Holenia tried to drown the pups. He is so angry that he forgets Johanna is standing there listening and tells the Emperor he never should have agreed to give up Johanna to save her from a commoner's life with him. Johanna realises what Virgil has done and forgives him, and tells the Emperor that better she take one chance in a million of a happy life with Virgil, than no chance <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>with</b> someone she cannot love. The Emperor agrees to let Virgil and Johanna wed.|$|E
25|$|In teleosts, and a {{few other}} species (such as rabbits), there is no {{discrete}} pancreas <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>with</b> pancreatic tissue being distributed diffusely across the mesentery and even within other nearby organs, such as the liver or spleen. In a few teleost species, the endocrine tissue has fused to form a distinct gland within the abdominal cavity, but otherwise it is distributed among the exocrine components. The most primitive arrangement, however, appears to be that of lampreys and lungfish, in which pancreatic tissue is found as a number of discrete nodules within the wall of the gut itself, with the exocrine portions being little different from other glandular structures of the intestine.|$|E
