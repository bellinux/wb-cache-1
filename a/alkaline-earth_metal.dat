50|$|Alkaline earth metal {{complexes}} {{have been}} synthesized by RTLE, employing the same methodology used in synthesizing lanthanide complexes. The use of diphenylmercury in <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> reactions {{leads to the}} production of elemental mercury. The handling and disposal of elemental mercury is challenging due to its toxicity to humans and the environment. This led to the desire for an alternative RTLE reagent that would be less toxic and still very effective. Triphenylbismuth, BiPh3, was discovered to be a suitable alternative. Mercury and bismuth have similar electronegativity values and behave similarly in RTLE reactions. BiPh3 has been used to synthesize <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> amides and <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> cyclopentadienides. The difference between HgPh2 and BiPh3 in these syntheses was that the reaction time was longer when using BiPh3.|$|E
50|$|Alkali and {{alkaline}} earth metals such as Lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium {{has proven to}} be great dehalogenation catalysts. During dehalogenation reaction, the metals act as a reducing agent to break down carbon-halogen bond. Halogen can then leave as a leaving group. The generic way to synthesize alkanes using alkali and <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> is shown in scheme 2: Yus and his co-workers synthesized various lithium naphthalenide compounds that acts as a catalyst for lithiation of different functionalized halogenated arenes. The Li-arene reacted with water or deuterium to produce the dehalogenated product. The major drawback of using lithium naphthalene catalysts is {{that it is hard to}} separate from the reaction mixture because naphthalene adsorbs on surface of arene substrates. In polymer chemistry, sodium metal has been used for dehalogenation process.Removal of halogen atom from arene-halides in the presence of Grignard agent and water for the formation of new compound is known as Grignard degradation. Dehalogenation using Grignard reagents is a two steps hydrodehalogenation process. The reaction begins with the formation of alkyl/arene-magnesium-halogen compound, followed by addition of proton source to form dehalogenated product. Egorov and his co-workers have reported dehalogenation of benzyl halides using atomic magnesium in 3P state at 600oC. Toluene and bi-benzyls were produced as the product of the reaction. Morisson and his co-workers also reported dehalogenation of organic halides by flash vacuum pyrolysis using magnesium.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} adding alkaline-earth (IIA) metal oxides to NiZr-loaded Zeolite Y {{catalysts}} were investigated on hydrogen rich production by ethanol steam reforming (ESR). Four kinds of <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> (Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba) oxides of 3. 0 % by weight were loaded between the Ni 6 Zr 4 O 14 main catalytic species and the microporous Zeolite Y support. The characterizations of these catalysts were examined by XRD, TEM, H 2 -TPR, NH 3 -TPD, and XPS. Catalytic performances during ESR were found to depend on the basicity of the added <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> oxides and H 2 production and ethanol conversion were maximized to 82 % and 98 % respectively in 27 (Ni 6 Zr 4 O 14) 3 MgO/ 70 Zeolite Y catalyst at 600 oC.

This study demonstrates that hydrogen yields from ESR are closely related to the acidities of catalysts and that <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> oxides reduce the acidities of 27 (Ni 6 Zr 4 O 14) 3 MO/ 70 Zeolite Y catalysts and promote hydrogen evolution by preventing progression to hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} theoretical {{investigation of the}} surface properties, stability and reactivity, of rock-salt type <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> oxides including MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO. The accuracy of commonly used exchange-correlation density functionals (LDA, PBE, RPBE, PBEsol, BEEF-vdW and hybrid HSE) and random-phase approximation (RPA) is evaluated and compared to existing experimental values. Calculated surface energies of the four most stable surface facets under vacuum conditions: the (100) surface, the metal and oxygen terminated octopolar (111), and the (110) surfaces exhibit a monotonic increase in stability from MgO to BaO. On the MgO(100) surface, adsorption of CO, NO, CH 4 is characterized by physisorption while H 2 O chemisorbs, which is in agreement with experimental findings. We further use the on-top metal adsorption of CO and NO molecules to map out the surface energetics of each <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> oxide surface. The considered functionals all qualitatively predict similar adsorption energy trends. The ordering between the adsorption energies on different surface facets {{can be attributed to}} differences in the local geometrical surface structure and the electronic structure of the metal constituent of the <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> oxide. The striking observation that CO adsorption strength is weaker than NO adsorption on the (100) terraces as the period of the <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metal</b> in the oxide increases, is analyzed in detail in terms of charge redistribution within the σ and π channels of adsorbates. Finally, we also present oxygen adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation energies in these oxide systems. Comment: 10 pages, submitted to PRB as regular articl...|$|E

Systematic and simpler measurements of beta for <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>metals</b> are important for cold collision theory, since these elements have nondegenerate ground state and no hyperfine structure.
