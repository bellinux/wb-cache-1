25|$|Some <b>all</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{electric}} vehicles solve this challenge using one motor for each axle, thereby eliminating a mechanical differential between {{the front and}} rear axles. An example of this is the dual motor variant of the Tesla Model S, which on a millisecond scale can control the torque distribution electronically between its two motors.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Tesla {{introduced}} a 70kWh battery {{to replace the}} existing 60kWh batteries and base 60kWh Model S vehicles, as the 60 was low margin and not sufficiently welcomed by customers. All 70kWh cars can be had with rear-wheel drive or <b>all</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> The 60 was re-introduced in 2016 as a software-limited 75, upgradable to 75.|$|E

25|$|Development of the 959 (originally {{called the}} Gruppe B) started in 1981, {{shortly after the}} company's then-new Managing Director, Peter Schutz, took his office. Porsche's head {{engineer}} at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one. Bott knew that the company needed a sports car that they could continue to rely on {{for years to come}} and that could be developed as time went on. Curious as to how much they could do with the rear-engined 911, Bott convinced Schutz that development tests should take place, and even proposed researching a new <b>all</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system. Schutz agreed, and gave the project the green light. Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models. Seeing Group B rally racing as the perfect arena to test the new mule and its <b>all</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system, Bott again went to Schutz and got the go ahead to develop a car, based on his development mule, for competition in Group B.|$|E

The ESC controller can also receive data from and issue commands to other controllers on the vehicle such as an <b>all</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system or an active suspension system to improve vehicle stability and controllability.|$|E

However, others criticized the lack of interior room and reduced sight lines despite its full-sized exterior, and Edmunds noted that the eighth-generation Honda Accord (which competes in the mid-size category) had superior driving dynamics and a more efficient design and offered almost as much interior space as the Taurus despite considerably smaller external dimensions.|$|E
25|$|It was {{intended}} that Mercedes-Benz would enter rallying with the Mercedes-Benz W201 {{in the early}} 1980s.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the tractive efficiency of all-wheel-drive vehicles {{in general and}} the slip efficiency in particular. It focuses on the analysis of the conditions for achieving the optimal slip efficiency. Results of detailed theoretical analyses indicate that <b>all</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> operating at the same slip will be the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving the optimal slip efficiency, if their thrust-slip relationships are either linear or nonlinear with similar characteristics. If the thrust-slip relationships of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> are nonlinear with different characteristics, the optimal slip efficiency will be reached with the slips of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> not being equal. The basic findings of this investigation are substantiated with experimental data. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the requirement for <b>all</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> operating at the same slip provides a reasonable basis for a practical control strategy of an active system to distribute torque (thrust) among the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> to achieve the optimal (or close to the optimal) slip efficiency of all-wheel-drive vehicles under most operating conditions.

25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the <b>all</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{drive shaft}} of the bi-modal tram has been {{designed}} and built into independent <b>wheel</b> drive; <b>all</b> driving <b>wheels</b> are <b>driven</b> by electric motor-gearbox sets independently, {{in order to make}} low floor to provide the old and the handicapped with easy access, and to remove differential gears to reduce turning radius. This paper was aimed to evaluate torques on drive shafts while the bi-modal tram was running on slope way in the test track, and at maximum speed in public roadway. On the basis of the torques measured on the drive shafts, torsion characteristics of the independent <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> were discussed in this paper...|$|R

50|$|The VCR is a 6Ã—6 wheeled APC {{designed}} in the late 1970s {{and is based on}} the earlier 4Ã—4 M-3 APC which had been a huge success for Panhard on the export market, with over 1,200 built. Production of the VCR began in 1979. The center pair of wheels can be raised when the vehicle is operated on roads (when down <b>all</b> six <b>wheels</b> <b>drive).</b> The engine is located in the front to the right, with the driver in the front-center of the vehicle. The VCR has 8 mm of steel armor on all sides except the front which has 12 mm. This gives protection against 12.7 mm AP rounds in the front and against 7.62 mm AP rounds on all other sides.|$|R
5000|$|Steam {{locomotives}} suffer particularly badly from adhesion issues because {{power delivery}} is pulsed (especially in 2- or most 4-cylinder engines) and, on large locomotives, not <b>all</b> <b>wheels</b> are <b>driven.</b> The [...] "factor of adhesion", being the {{weight on the}} <b>driven</b> <b>wheels</b> divided by the theoretical starting tractive effort, was generally {{designed to be a}} value of 4 or slightly higher, reflecting a typical wheel-rail friction coefficient of 0.25. A locomotive with a factor of adhesion much lower than 4 would be highly prone to wheelslip, although some 3-cylinder locomotives, such as the SR V Schools class, operated with a factor of adhesion below 4 due to their smoother power delivery. Other steam locomotive design factors significantly affecting traction include wheel size (smaller diameter wheels offer superior traction at the expense of top speed) and the sensitivity of the regulator.|$|R
25|$|In 1965, A. J. M. Chadwick {{patented}} a 4WD system, GB 1113068, {{that used}} hemispherical wheels for an all-terrain vehicle. Twenty years later, B. T. E. Warne, patented, GB 2172558, an improvement on Chadwick's design {{that did not}} use differential gear assemblies. By using near-spherical wheels with provision to tilt and turn each <b>wheel</b> co-ordinatively, the <b>driven</b> <b>wheels</b> maintain constant traction. Furthermore, <b>all</b> <b>driven</b> <b>wheels</b> steer and, as pairing of wheels is not necessary, vehicles with an odd number of wheels are possible without affecting the system's integrity. Progressive deceleration is made possible by dynamically changing the front-to-rear effective wheel diameter ratios.|$|R
