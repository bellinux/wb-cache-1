5|$|Although the Philippines lacks large {{mammalian}} predators, it {{does have}} some very large reptiles such as pythons and cobras, together with gigantic saltwater crocodiles. The largest crocodile in captivity, known locally as Lolong, was captured in the southern island of Mindanao. The national bird, known as the Philippine eagle has the longest body of any eagle, it generally measures 86 to 102 cm (2.82 to 3.35 ft) in length and weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg (10.4 to 17.6 lb). The Philippine eagle {{is part of the}} <b>Accipitridae</b> family and is endemic to the rainforests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the family}} <b>Accipitridae,</b> the Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a member}} of the large genus Accipiter, which consists of small to medium-sized woodland hawks. Most of the Old World members of the genus are called sparrowhawks or goshawks. The species' name dates back to the Middle English word sperhauk and Old English spearhafoc, a hawk which hunts sparrows. The Old Norse name for the Eurasian sparrowhawk, sparrhaukr, was thought to have been coined by Vikings who encountered falconry in England. English folk names for the Eurasian sparrowhawk include blue hawk, referring to the adult male's colouration, as well as hedge hawk, spar hawk, spur hawk and stone falcon.|$|E
5|$|The Congo serpent eagle (Circaetus spectabilis) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the family <b>Accipitridae,</b> and is {{sometimes}} placed in the monotypic genus Dryotriorchis by some taxonomic authorities. This species is found in western and central Africa, with its range stretching from Sierra Leone south to Angola and west to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It occurs in upper and lower Guinean forests, which are dense rainforests. This serpent eagle specializes in hunting in these forests’ dark understories. It has two subspecies, the nominate subspecies Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis and Dryotriorchis spectabilis batesi. Though monotypic, {{it appears to be}} very closely related to Circaetus. This hawk is a medium-sized bird with distinctive short, rounded wings and a long, rounded tail. It is varying shades of brown on its back and has a slight crest. Its breast is white with variable amounts of a rufous wash and, in the nominate subspecies, is covered in round, blackish spots. The subspecies D. s. batesi only has these dots on its flanks. The Congo serpent eagle closely resembles Cassin's hawk-eagle, and some ornithologists believe that this likeness is a rare example of avian mimicry. It is a very vocal raptor, and often {{is one of the most}} heard species in its habitat.|$|E
25|$|Predator species include coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), American badger (Taxidea taxus), falcons (Falconidae), and hawks and eagles (<b>Accipitridae)</b> prey {{on adult}} and {{juvenile}}s. Crows and ravens (Corvus spp.) and magpies (Pica spp.) consume juvenile birds. Coyotes, ground squirrels (Sciuridae spp.), and badgers {{are the most}} important mammalian nest predators. Among bird species, magpies and ravens commonly prey on Greater Sage-Grouse nests.|$|E
25|$|There are 2 {{subspecies}} of {{the black}} sparrowhawks: Accipiter melanoleucus melanoleucus, which was named by A. Smith in 1830, and Accipiter melanoleucus temminckii, which was named by Hartlaub in 1855. As described in the next section, the 2 subspecies occur in different regions of Africa and both belong to the genus Accipiter in the family <b>Accipitridae</b> along with other well-known members such as hawks and eagles, {{all of which are}} part of the Falconiformes order.|$|E
25|$|The {{golden eagle}} (Aquila chrysaetos) {{is one of}} the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the most widely {{distributed}} species of eagle. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family <b>Accipitridae.</b> These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes. Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey (mainly hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels).|$|E
25|$|In 1779 English {{illustrator}} John Frederick Miller was {{the first}} European to describe the secretarybird, and it was soon after assigned to its own genus Sagittarius by French naturalist Johann Hermann in his Tabula Affinitatum Animalium. It was not until 1935 that the species was moved to its own family, distinct from all other birds of prey—a classification confirmed by molecular systematics. Recent cladistic analysis has shown Sagittariidae to be an older branch of the {{diurnal birds of prey}} than <b>Accipitridae</b> and Falconidae, but a younger divergence than Cathartidae. Sometimes, the enigmatic bird Eremopezus is classified as an early relative of the secretarybird, though this is uncertain as the bird is only known from a few fragmentary body parts such as the legs. The earliest fossils associated with the family are two species from the genus Pelargopappus. The two species, from the Oligocene and Miocene respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family. In spite of their age, it is not thought that the two species are ancestral to the secretary bird.|$|E

500|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} (Accipiter nisus), {{also known}} as the northern sparrowhawk or simply the sparrowhawk, is a small bird of prey in the family <b>Accipitridae.</b> Adult male Eurasian sparrowhawks have bluish grey upperparts and orange-barred underparts; females and juveniles are brown above with brown barring below. The female is up to 25% larger than the male – one of the largest differences between the sexes in any bird species. Though it is a predator which specialises in catching woodland birds, the Eurasian sparrowhawk can be found in any habitat and often hunts garden birds in towns and cities. Males tend to take smaller birds, including tits, finches, and sparrows; females catch primarily thrushes and starlings, but are capable of killing birds weighing [...] or more.|$|E
500|$|The white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), {{also known}} as the white-breasted sea eagle, is a large diurnal bird of prey in the family <b>Accipitridae.</b> Originally {{described}} by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, it is closely related to Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands, and the two are considered a superspecies. A distinctive bird, the adult white-bellied sea eagle has a white head, breast, under-wing coverts and tail. The upper parts are grey and the black under-wing flight feathers contrast with the white coverts. The tail is short and wedge-shaped as in all Haliaeetus species. Like many raptors, the female is slightly larger than the male, and can measure up to [...] long with a wingspan of up to , and weigh [...] Immature birds have brown plumage, which is gradually replaced by white until the age of five or six years. The call is a loud goose-like honking.|$|E
500|$|The {{black vulture}} (Coragyps atratus), {{also known as}} the American black vulture, is a bird in the New World vulture family whose range extends from the southeastern United States to Central Chile and Uruguay in South America. Although a common and {{widespread}} species, it has a somewhat more restricted distribution than its compatriot, the turkey vulture, which breeds well into Canada and south to Tierra del Fuego. [...] It is the only extant member of the genus Coragyps, which is in the family Cathartidae. Despite the similar name and appearance, this species is unrelated to the Eurasian black vulture, an Old World vulture in the family <b>Accipitridae</b> (which includes eagles, hawks, kites and harriers). It inhabits relatively open areas which provide scattered forests or shrublands. With a wingspan of , the black vulture is a large bird though relatively small for a vulture. It has black plumage, a featherless, grayish-black head and neck, and a short, hooked beak.|$|E
2500|$|The {{black-chested buzzard-eagle}} (Geranoaetus melanoleucus) is a {{bird of prey}} of the hawk and eagle family (<b>Accipitridae).</b> It lives in open regions of South America. This species {{is also known as}} the black buzzard-eagle, grey buzzard-eagle or analogously with [...] "eagle" [...] or [...] "eagle-buzzard" [...] {{replacing}} [...] "buzzard-eagle", or as the Chilean blue eagle. It is sometimes placed in the genus Buteo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{white-tailed eagle}} (Haliaeetus albicilla), {{also known as}} the ern, erne, gray eagle, Eurasian sea eagle and white-tailed sea-eagle, is a large bird of prey in the family <b>Accipitridae</b> which {{includes}} other raptors such as hawks, kites, and harriers. [...] They are found in Eurasia, near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting. [...] They are considered a close cousin of the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).|$|E
2500|$|During hibernation, predators of Indiana bats {{may include}} black rat snakes (Pantherophis obsoletus) [...] and {{northern}} raccoons (Procyon lotor). During other {{times of the}} year northern raccoons have been observed trying to grab bats from the air when they attempt to fly away. Skunks (Mephitidae), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and feral cats (Felis catus) may pose a similar threat. If Indiana bats fly from their day roosts during the day, they may be susceptible to predation by hawks (<b>Accipitridae).</b> Indiana bats foraging at night may also be susceptible to predation by owls (Strigidae). While not a predator, woodpeckers (Picidae) may disturb roosting bats through their foraging activities by peeling away sections of bark being utilized by Indiana bats, causing Indiana bats to fly from the roost during the day and making the tree unsuitable for future habitation.|$|E
