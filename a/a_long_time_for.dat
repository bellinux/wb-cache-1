5|$|Camelot Software Planning spent between {{twelve and}} {{eighteen}} months developing Golden Sun, {{which is considered}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a handheld video game; the finished product {{was described as a}} testament to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game {{a few weeks before the}} release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.|$|E
5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun {{is a process that}} involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} a weak form of a disease causing {{immunity}} to the virulent version was not new; this had been known for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> smallpox. Inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known {{to result in a}} much less severe disease, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison with the naturally acquired disease. Edward Jenner had also studied vaccination using cowpox (Vaccinia) to give cross-immunity to smallpox in the late 1790s, and by the early 1800s vaccination had spread to most of Europe.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Marengo on 14 June, Ott {{commanded}} the Austrian left wing. Because of congestion in the bridgehead, it took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> {{the left wing}} to deploy. However, once his attack at mid-day got underway, it broke the French right flank and helped convince them to retreat from Marengo. Later in the battle, when French reinforcements defeated the Austrian main body, Ott withdrew in good order and brought his command off in safety. This was his last active command.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden {{and states}} {{bordering}} the Baltic Sea, the oldest surviving manuscript {{from the first}} Swedish law {{to be put to}} paper is from c. 1345, although earlier versions probably existed. The law was created for the young town Stockholm's customs, but it was also used in Lödöse and probably in a few other towns, as well. No town was allowed to use the law without the formal permission by the Swedish king. Its use may have become more widespread {{if it had not been}} superseded by the new town law by King Magnus Eriksson (1316–1374). The term Bjarkey Laws was however used for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Magnus Eriksson's law in various locations.|$|E

25|$|Hipparchus is {{credited}} with the invention or improvement of several astronomical instruments, which were used for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> naked-eye observations. According to Synesius of Ptolemais (4th century) he made the first astrolabion: {{this may have been}} an armillary sphere (which Ptolemy however says he constructed, in Almagest V.1); or the predecessor of the planar instrument called astrolabe (also mentioned by Theon of Alexandria). With an astrolabe Hipparchus was the first to be able to measure the geographical latitude and time by observing fixed stars. Previously this was done at daytime by measuring the shadow cast by a gnomon, by recording the length of the longest day of the year or with the portable instrument known as a scaphe.|$|E
25|$|While the Hudson Tunnel Project {{would double}} the number of tracks under the Hudson River, it would not result in an {{increase}} in rail capacity due to constraints at Penn Station. Penn Station operates at capacity during peak periods, and since it takes <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> passengers to board and alight trains, trains cannot leave and enter the station as might otherwise be possible. Even with improvements in the station, there are inadequate train storage facilities at Penn, and there is no capacity in the East River Tunnels to allow for trains to be stored during middays at Sunnyside Yard. Without these additional improvements, it is assumed that the same number of trains going between New Jersey and New York today would be operating in 2030, albeit with the additional tunnel capacity.|$|E
25|$|In 1919 Huxley married Juliette Baillot (1896–1994). She was a French Swiss girl {{whom he had}} met at Garsington Manor, {{the country}} house of Lady Ottoline Morrell, a Bloomsbury Group socialite {{with a penchant for}} artists and intellectuals. The newly-weds' life {{together}} included students, faculty wives, grebes and, unfortunately, another depressive breakdown, this time rather serious. From his wife's autobiography it seems his mental illness took the form of a bipolar disorder, with the depressive phases being of moderate to severe intensity. It took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> him to recover on this occasion, but despite this he left a legacy of students who admired him, and who became leaders in zoology for the next thirty or forty years. E. B. Ford always remembered his openness and encouragement at the start of his career.|$|E

25|$|The town grew {{strongly}} in the 19th century. In 1801 the population was 3,095. By 1850 it was over 10,000 and by 1901 it was almost 39,000. Such rapid growth demanded a railway connection but the town had to wait <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> one. The London and Birmingham Railway (L) had been built through Tring in 1838, and the Great Northern Railway was built through Hitchin in 1852, both bypassing Luton, the largest town in the area. A branch line connecting with the L at Leighton Buzzard was proposed, but because of objections to release of land, construction terminated at Dunstable in 1848. It was another ten years before the branch was extended to Bute Street Station, and the first train to Dunstable ran on 3 May 1858. The line was later extended to Welwyn and from 1860 direct trains to King's Cross ran. The Midland Railway was extended from Bedford to St Pancras through Leagrave and Midland Road station and opened on 9 September 1867.|$|E
25|$|It took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the Maharajahs Ghulab Singh and Ranbir Singh {{to extend}} their writ over Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, and not until 1870 did they assert their {{authority}} over Gilgit town. The grip of the Jammu and Kashmir government over this area was tenuous. The Indian government undertook administrative reforms in 1885 and created Gilgit Agency in 1889 {{as a way for}} the British to secure the region as a buffer from the Russians. As a result of this Great Game, with British fear of Russian activities in Chinese Sinkiang increasing, in 1935 the Gilgit Agency was expanded by the Maharajah Hari Singh leasing the Gilgit Wazarat to the government of India for a period of sixty years and for an amount of 75,000Rs. This gave the British political agent complete control of defence, communications and foreign relations while the Kashmiri state retained civil administration and the British retained control of defence and foreign affairs.|$|E
25|$|Because of her {{participation}} in the musical, it took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Beni to release new material. When the musical stopped touring in 2006, she began modeling as the face of Cecil McBee, {{one of the largest}} and most popular Japanese clothing lines that appeals to teenage and college girls. She was also the host of the NHK fashion program, Tokyo Kawaii TV, where Beni discusses the latest fashion trends in Japan. When she became the face of Orion Beer a new single was announced to be released on September 20. Her seventh single was named How Are U?. This single was her first single not to chart on the Oricon chart and is considered a total flop. Her eighth single named Luna was an ending theme song for the Japanese drama Warui Yatsura. This single charted at the No. 77 spot making it a small comeback from Beni. On April 25, 2007, Beni released her third studio album named Gem. The album charted at the No. 114 place on the Oricon chart.|$|E
