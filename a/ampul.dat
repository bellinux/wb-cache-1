40|$|Abstract Gyropsylla spegazziniana (Paraguay tea <b>ampul)</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of Paraguay tea plants, and prohibition of synthetic insecticide use for control of this pest has led to the search for alternative methods. This laboratory study aimed to compare different control strategies for G. spegazziniana, utilizing a commercial neem seed oil product. Paraguay tea seedlings were treated with neem oil solution both pre- and post-infestation with 5 th instar nymphs. The systemic action of neem oil was also evaluated by treating plant soil with the neem oil solution, followed by transfer of the insects to plants 24 h post-treatment. Spray treatments were effective against the pest, especially post-infestation (80 % mortality), demonstrating the potential of neem oil for control of the Paraguay tea <b>ampul.</b> No significant effects were observed with respect to systemic activity...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{process for}} {{fabricating}} planar low dark-current InP- and In 0. ~ 3 GA 0. 47 As/InP-based photodetectors i de-scribed. The process utilizes {{a film of}} ZnF = {{as a source of}} Zn dopant and an encapsulat ing layer of either SiO 2 borosili-cate, or A 1203. Localized p-n junct ions were fabricated using standard photol i thography and diffusing in an open-tube air ambient. Dark currents as low as 5 • 10 -' ~ and 3 • 10 -I ~ at 10 V reverse bias voltage have been achieved in 75 ~m diam unpassivated planar diodes of InP and In 0. ~ 3 Ga 0. 47 As, respectively. Thermal diffusion of an acceptor such as Zn {{plays an important role in}} the formation of p-n junctions in III-V semiconductor devices, e. g., photodiodes for use in long-wavelength lightwave communication systems. In the fabrication of such devices, the p-n junctions may be formed by diffusion from the gas phase in sealed <b>ampuls</b> (i- 4), ion implantation (5), or open-tube diffusion from films deposited (6, 7) or spun-on (8) the semiconductor wafers. The diffusion from the gas phase requires accu...|$|R
40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper {{of this series}} (1) certain technical problems have been outlined which are encountered {{in the study of}} the growth cycle of influenza virus in the intact chick embryo. It has been shown there that some of the difficulties these present can be overcome in part by the use of deembryonation technics. Of particular interest was the observation that liberation of progeny from infected cells appeared to be a lengthy process in contrast to previous estimates (2, 3). This phenomenon has now been analyzed further by various technics and the results indicate that once a cell has been infected it may produce and liberate virus at nearly constant rates for periods of 30 hours or longer. These experiments, which have been summarized briefly elsewhere (4), will be described in detail below. Methods and Materials The PR 8 strain of influenza A virus was used throughout. The deembryonation (DE) technics have been recorded in detail, and the methods used for preparation of the seeds, titration of infectivity, and hemagglutinin assay have been referred to in {{the preceding}} paper (1). Hemagglutinin titrations were carried out within 24 hours after harvest. For infectivity titrations the fluids were diluted in 10 per cent normal horse serum and stored in glass sealed <b>ampuls</b> at- 65 °C. until the tests could be performed. Further experimental details are presented in the text. EXPERMI~rAL In order to study the liberation of virus from 1 set of infected entodermal cells of the allantois, two approaches can be used.

The resistivity measurements show that the quenching method produces a good homogeneity in the impurity distribution over the grown ingot. For these bulk alloys with x＜O. l, the composition and temperature dependence of resistivity and Hall coefficient in the temperature range 300 - 77 K have been measured to find out a zero-gap composition Xo at which the overlap energy between the conduction and valence bands vanishes.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the STS- 7 flight experiments of the GeSe-xenon system yielded positive results which surpass the original objectives of these experiments. The mass transport rates of GeSe observed in microgravity environment are {{in close agreement with}} theoretically predicted values for diffusion limited mass transport. This supports the earlier proposed hypothesis for the interpretation of flux anomalies observed in previous space experiments. In addition, the STS- 7 flight experiments led to the observation of unexpected crystal growth phenomena. The largest GeSe single crystals obtained in microgravity grew in the <b>ampul</b> without direct wall contact which could suggest homogeneous nucleation. The space grown crystals are much larger and have considerably improved surface and bulk morphologies relative to corresponding ground control specimens. The combined results are of basic scientific importance and of technological significance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe optical {{properties}} of BaAl 2 S 4 doped with Eu 2 + were investigated. The synthesis {{was performed in}} evacuated and sealed quartz <b>ampul</b> at 1000 degrees C during 1 h, then at 840 degrees C during 20 h. With absorption, excitation, and emission spectra we have determined the crystal- field splitting, the redshift, {{the influence of the}} lattice vibration properties, and the thermal quenching of the luminescence. The crystal- field splitting of Eu 2 + in BaAl 2 S 4 was estimated on the order of 8000 to 10 000 cm(- 1) and the Huang-Rhys parameter S = 5 +/- 1 corresponds to an intermediate electron-phonon coupling regime. The mean phonon energy for BaAl 2 S 4 was evaluated by optical and Raman methods, and the obtained values were 32 +/- 5 and 40 meV, respectively. These results confirm the very interesting properties of this blue BaAl 2 S 4 : Eu 2 + phosphor, the most important being the very slight thermal quenching of the luminescence.

40|$|Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are {{powerful}} superantigens that stimulate non-specific T-cell proliferation produced by Staphylococcus aureus and draw considerable attention as ideal drugs for cancer therapy. The filtrate of S. aureus {{culture has been}} used as <b>ampul</b> named Staphylococcal enterotoxin C injection in clinic for 10 years in China and proved to be effective. The superantigen SEC claimed to be the only active component without certifiable evidences. For further investigations of the active components of this injec-tion and establishment of foundations for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs, in this research we extracted total DNA from S. aureus (FRI 1230), cloned, expressed and purified recombinant proteins of Staphylococcal enterotoxin M and N (rSEM and rSEN). The MTT assay of the purified rSEM and rSEN demonstrated that their abilities of stimulating T cells and inhibiting the proliferation of K 562 –ADM cells and B 16 cells were equivalent to that of purified SEC 2 in vitro. These findings suggested that SEC was not the only active component of Staphylococcal enterotoxin C injection and the effective procedure of expression and purification may be useful for mass productions of these therapeutically important proteins...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} {{the role of}} order of acquisition of orthography on spelling using a written picture naming task in Turkish–French (L 1 -L 2) bilingual children. Turkish and French orthographies vary considerably in the manner they represent sound; French, like English, has opaque mappings between sound and print whilst Turkish has completely transparent mappings. Very {{little research has been}} conducted investigating the impact of the order of acquisition of literacy on spelling despite a wealth of research on reading acquisition in bilingual children. All other things equal, spelling in a completely transparent orthography ought to be easier than spelling in an opaque orthography. It is hypothesized that children who acquired Turkish first will make significantly more errors when spelling in French compared to spelling in Turkish by children who acquired French first. A total of 28 children resident in France, aged between 10 - 11, were allocated to two equal groups depending on whether they acquired their early literacy in either Turkey or France. The picture names are cognates in Turkish and French with similar pronunciation and spelling in L 1 and L 2 (e. g., light bulb is <b>ampul</b> in Turkish and ampoule in French). Formal analysis of the spelling error data show that children who acquired literacy in French first made surprisingly three times more errors in Turkish than French compared to children who acquired literacy in Turkish making marginally more errors in French than Turkish. The results are discussed within a bilingual model of spelling from a developmental perspective and the transferring of phonological and orthographic skills between L 1 and L 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} {{the role of}} orthographic transparency on written picture naming for 20 pictures in bilingual children whose first language was Turkish (L 1) and second language was French (L 2). The participants were 10 - 11 year old children and residents in France. A total of 14 children were selected from a sample of 103 and were matched on socio-economic background, age and scholastic attainment. They were allocated to two groups of seven depending on whether they received their early primary education either in Turkey or France. Each child was required {{to have been in}} the French education system {{for at least two years}} as well as attending extracurricular Turkish language classes in France. The stimulus picture names were cognates in Turkish and French with similar pronunciation and spelling in L 1 and L 2 (e. g., light bulb is <b>ampul</b> in Turkish and ampoule in French). In addition, all pictures were rated to have name agreement, familiarity and similar complexity by independent judges. In a counterbalanced design, children were instructed to write the picture names down in French and Turkish. The study was conducted in the children’s schools. An interaction between Turkish and French languages at the lexico-semantic level in bilingual children was predicted in relation to their L 2 spelling proficiency. This is because while the mappings between orthography and phonology in Turkish are totally transparent and consistent, in French they are relatively opaque and inconsistent. An analysis of the spelling error data show that children educated in Turkey in their early years made more errors in French than Turkish but this did not reach statistical significance. On the contrary, children who received their early education in France made three times more errors on average in Turkish than French. The results suggest that acquisition of spelling skills in second orthography is perhaps determined by the complexity of the first orthography children are exposed to. Children who learnt the transparent Turkish orthography first, made an equal number of errors in Turkish and French despite French being more opaque than Turkish. On the other hand, children who acquired the French orthography first, struggled with Turkish despite the simple mappings between its orthography and phonology. This raises a question in relation to transferring of phonological and orthographic skills between orthographies that have distinct mappings between orthography and phonology. The current results raise a further question whether orthographic and phonological overlap are necessary to establish shared lexical entries for cognates in attaining L 1 and L 2 fluency in the bilingual child...|$|E
