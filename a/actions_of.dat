5|$|AMPK {{probably}} {{also plays a}} role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|In another Buddhist text Majjhima Nikāya, the Buddha criticizes Jain {{emphasis}} on the destruction of unobservable and unverifiable types of karma {{as a means to}} end suffering, rather than on eliminating evil mental states such as greed, hatred and delusion, which are observable and verifiable. In the Upālisutta dialogue of this Majjhima Nikāya text, Buddha contends with a Jain monk who asserts that bodily actions are the most criminal, in comparison to the <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> speech and mind. Buddha criticises this view, saying that the <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> mind are most criminal, and not the <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> speech or body. Buddha also criticises the Jain ascetic practice of various austerities, claiming that he, Buddha, is happier when not practising the austerities.|$|E
