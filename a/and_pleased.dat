5|$|The main talking {{point after}} the Test was the {{controversial}} omission of England's leading batsman Hutton for the Third Test. The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the Second Test. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the sidewhich was not in good batting formas it was a poor example from a leading batsman. The omission generated considerable acrimony, <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> the Australians, who felt Hutton was their most formidable opponent with the bat. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, a game in which no other Englishman passed 35, and made 94, 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. Hutton's position was taken by debutant George Emmett, who made only 10 and a duck in a rain-shortened draw, and was subsequently dropped for the Fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, leading English batsman Len Hutton had been dropped. The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the {{previous}} Test, during which he scored 20 and 13. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the sidewhich was not in good batting formas it was a poor example from a key player. According to journalist and retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, Hutton's second innings at Lord's had been the worst of his career and gave the impression he had been scared of the Australian pace attack. The omission generated considerable controversy, <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> the Australians, who felt Hutton was England's best batsman, and thought he had been treated poorly by the selectors. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, and 94, 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. O'Reilly regarded Hutton's omission as punitive and vindictive. He said if Hutton needed to be shielded from the new ball attack, then England should have reshuffled their batting order to place their beleaguered opener down the order. O'Reilly said that as Hutton had a large range of attacking strokes, he was not a stereotypical, defensive opener who was mainly used to wear down the opening bowlers, and could be used in the middle order as an aggressor.|$|E

25|$|For Taoists, sex was {{not just}} about {{pleasing}} the man. The woman also had to be stimulated <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> in order {{to benefit from the}} act of sex. Sex should not happen if one or the other partners desire it more. If sex were performed in this manner, the woman would create more jing, and the man could more easily absorb the jing to increase his own qi. Women were also given a prominent place in the Ishinpō, with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women {{had a great deal of}} strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act. The woman had the power to bring forth life, and did not have to worry about ejaculation or refractory period.|$|E
25|$|Chen Xiu had a {{personality}} which resembled his father's. When he was 19 years old, Sun Quan summoned him and appointed {{him as a}} Major of Separate Command (別部司馬) {{and put him in}} charge of 500 troops. At the time, many newly recruited soldiers were unwilling to serve in the army so they deserted. However, Chen Xiu treated his men well and not a single soldier under him deserted. Sun Quan was surprised <b>and</b> <b>pleased,</b> so he promoted Chen Xiu to Colonel (校尉). In the late 210s, when Sun Quan granted awards to the descendants of his deceased subjects to honour his subjects for their service, Chen Xiu received the title of a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯) in recognition of his father's contributions. He later became a commander in the jiefan (解煩) corps, one of the elite units in Sun Quan's military forces. He died in 229, shortly after Sun Quan proclaimed himself emperor and established the state of Eastern Wu.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he began}} writing the novel, Ainsworth {{suffered}} from {{more of his}} father-in-law's financial problems {{and was unable to}} resume work on it until 1833. During the autumn of that year he managed to complete large portions of the novel while staying in Sussex, near Sergison's home. The novel was published in April 1834 by Richard Bentley and contained illustrations by George Cruikshank. After working five years in the legal profession, Ainsworth gave it up and dedicated himself to writing. Rookwood garnered wide critical and financial success, <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> his associates at Fraser's Magazine. He started to dress as a dandy, and he was introduced to the Salon of Margaret Power, Countess of Blessington. Her Salon was a group of men and literary women, and would include many others but many in London believed that Blessington had a damaged reputation. However, this did not stop Ainsworth from meeting many famous British authors from the Salon. While part of her circle, he wrote for her collection of stories called The Book of Beauty, published in 1835. Ainsworth continued in various literary circles, but his wife and daughters did not; he stayed in Kensal Lodge while they lived with Ebers. During this time, Ainsworth met Charles Dickens and introduced the young writer to the publisher Macrone and to George Cruikshank. Ainsworth also introduced Dickens to John Forster at Kensal Lodge, initiating a close friendship between the two.|$|E

Elaine May met with Henson several months prior to the start of filming in April 1985, and was asked to polish the script.

500|$|The {{nature of}} the fight with Ryan led to a much {{anticipated}} re-match at Cassiobury Park, Hertfordshire on 11February 1789. At stake was prize money of 600guineas, as well as Johnson's title of champion. Humphries again acted as Johnson's second and a man called Jackson was his bottle-holder. The fight consisted of one round of mutually displayed skill, during which Johnson was felled, and thereafter was brutal passion. Egan described it as [...] It was over in 33 minutes, when Ryan gave up the fight. One spectator, a Mr Hollingsworth, who was a corn factor and had at one time employed Johnson, was so impressed <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> with how much he had made from betting on Johnson that he settled a £20 per annum gift for life on the fighter.|$|E

500|$|In 1931, Judge Mellon's son Richard B. Mellon, {{brother of}} Andrew Mellon, and C. C. Macdonald {{acquired}} the park under a partnership {{known as the}} Idlewild Management Company. The first season under the financial support of Mellon and the management of Macdonald and his family brought electricity to the park, allowing for later operating hours and electric-powered rides, including a three-row Philadelphia Toboggan Company carousel. The park also debuted a den of black bears that year. The bears were across the path from a cage of monkeys, who escaped in 1932. Park management offered a reward of $3 each ($ each in [...] ) {{for the return of}} the seven monkeys, believing that they had been set loose. R. Z. Macdonald later said that his father, C. C., was always amused <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> with the publicity that the escape created, though he never formally accused his father.|$|E
500|$|Following his struggles at Lord's, Hutton was {{omitted from}} the team for the third Test. Observers had noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers, which the English {{selectors}} saw as a poor example from a leading batsman. The decision generated considerable acrimony, but surprised <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> the Australians, who felt Hutton was their most formidable opponent with the bat. Press and critics generally judged the omission a mistake, although the Wisden correspondent believed the decision to be correct as Hutton benefited from a break. In later years, Norman Yardley, the England captain, agreed that the choice was a poor one. Hutton, who escaped most of the debate by playing in Scotland for Yorkshire, found the situation unsettling and Patrick Murphy, a sports journalist, writes that it [...] "served to drive a reserved man further in on himself." [...] Meanwhile, Hutton was chosen to captain the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's; he scored 59 and 132 not out.|$|E
500|$|The quark flavors {{were given}} their names for several reasons. The {{up and down}} quarks are named after {{the up and down}} {{components}} of isospin, which they carry. Strange quarks were given their name because they were discovered to be components of the strange particles discovered in cosmic rays years before the quark model was proposed; these particles were deemed [...] "strange" [...] because they had unusually long lifetimes. Glashow, who coproposed charm quark with Bjorken, is quoted as saying, [...] "We called our construct the 'charmed quark', for we were fascinated <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> by the symmetry it brought to the subnuclear world." [...] The names [...] "bottom" [...] and [...] "top", coined by Harari, were chosen because they are [...] "logical partners for up and down quarks". In the past, bottom and top quarks were sometimes referred to as [...] "beauty" [...] and [...] "truth" [...] respectively, but these names have somewhat fallen out of use. While [...] "truth" [...] never did catch on, accelerator complexes devoted to massive production of bottom quarks are sometimes called [...] "beauty factories".|$|E

The Rocky Mountains left a great impression on him, as did the coastal climate which he found [...] "very agreeable". He visited again in the summer of 1894, when he took the Canadian Pacific Railway across the prairies. Upon arriving in South Edmonton, he was excited by its growth potential <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> to find that the dry air relieved his bronchitis. He resolved to settle there, and did so one year later, bringing his reluctant wife and his children, who arrived by train June 10, 1895. Within ten days of their arrival, Rutherford had opened a law office, purchased four lots of land, and contracted local builder Hugh McCurdy to build him a house. In July the family moved into their new four-room house, built on a single storey. In 1896 Rutherford became the town's only lawyer, as his [...] competition, Mervyn Mackenzie, had moved to Toronto.|$|E
500|$|IC in a Sunflower was {{positively}} received by English-language reviewers and readers. The manga ranked eighth on About.com's 2007 Reader Poll {{for the best}} new josei manga, manga targeted towards women. Douresseaux praised the collection as [...] "easily some of [...] best work made available in English." [...] Sparrow highly recommended the manga, describing it as [...] "a darker counterpart to Beautiful People." [...] The art was a frequent source of praise among reviewers, although Grendall wrote {{that some of the}} older stories had art not on the same level of refinement as her later work Doll. Mihara's storytelling also went over well with critics; Oxford commended Mihara's ability to create unrelated short stories, something not commonly seen in manga. Rating the manga two-and-a-half out of four stars, Thompson enjoyed some of the stories, but felt that the occasionally predictable endings or [...] "ideas" [...] that the story failed to expand upon hurt the manga. Upon learning that her illustrations and stories in general had been positively received in the West, Mihara was surprised <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> [...] "that people are overcoming the cultural barrier and just getting the message!" ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2009, Fox {{said that}} the project was a [...] "reboot" [...] of the Alien franchise, and soon {{afterwards}} was reported as an untitled prequel to Alien. Development stopped in June 2009 when Fox clashed with Scott over his selection of former television advertisement director Carl Erik Rinsch as director. Fox was only interested in pursuing the project if Scott directed. By July 2009, Scott was contracted to direct the film, and screenwriter Jon Spaihts was hired to write the script based on his pitched idea for a direct Alien prequel. With the director and writer in place, <b>and</b> <b>pleased</b> with Spaihts's pitch, Fox scheduled a release date for December 2011, but this was eventually canceled. In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and that pre-production would begin, and a filming date was set for January 2011. Fox eventually pushed to develop the project into an original work, and by July 2010, Lindelof had been hired to redevelop Spaihts's screenplay. In October 2010, Lindelof submitted his rewritten screenplay to Fox. Scott had initially requested a $250 million budget and an adult oriented project, but Fox was reluctant to invest this amount of money, and wanted to ensure the film would receive a lower age-rating to broaden the potential audience.|$|E
