5000|$|Escolar is {{commonly}} substituted for tuna in sushi restaurants. Escolar, {{which is much}} less expensive than tuna, is a fish with a diet high in wax esters. Since these wax esters are not digestible, these wax esters have a laxative effect in humans. [...] The laxative effect is not merely an inconvenience, but can be very serious. Although not affecting all people, the wax esters are indigestible in humans and to those susceptible can cause constipation, followed by severe oily diarrhea (keriorrhoea), rapid loose bowel movements, with onset 30 minutes to 36 hours after consumption. [...] In fact, the FDA recommends, [...] "Escolar should not be marketed in interstate commerce" [...] and the Hawaiian Legislature is considering legislation to ban escolar for the same reasons.

Analysis of extracts of the individual organs revealed the alkaline proteolytic activity was present in the intestine and the pyloric caeca, with the pyloric caeca showing the highest activity. The stomach extract demonstrated high protease activity at pH 1. 7 and 3. 5, while the remaining organs had relative activities at least ten times lower at these pH values. The extract obtained from pyloric caeca was studied in more detail.

Cationic discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with a substrate inclusion technique for localization of the separated proteases of the pyloric caeca extract revealed the presence of ten proteolytic enzymes. One was active in acid solution (ca. pH 4) and was inhibited by PMSF and TLCK. The remaining nine proteases were active at pH 8. 0.

Loins abused at 30 oC for 2 h daily contained potentially toxic histamine concentrations (67 – 382 ppm) when stored at low refrigeration temperature (0 - 2 oC), whereas when stored at 6 - 7 oC the loins contained highly toxic histamine concentrations (544. 5 – 4156. 6 ppm).

The eddy detection parameters, maximum/minimum Okubo-Weiss parameter to assign to the eddy core/ring, minimum eddy core area, minimum eddy core area to perimeter ratio, and minimum eddy duration, were set to - 0. 2 / 0. 2 standard deviation, 5 cells (6869 km 2), 0. 4, and 10 images (70 days), respectively. Using these parameters, 635 anticyclonic eddies and 930 cyclonic eddies were detected between October 14, 1992 and December 31, 2005. The eddy structure of the 62103 pelagic longline fishery catch records in The Logbook System maintained by Southeast Fisheries Science Center was sampled.

40|$|The Balearic {{region is}} a highly dynamic area located in the Western Mediterranean, {{straddling}} the transition between the Algerian and Provencal basins and constitutes {{one of the main}} spawning grounds for the large, migratory Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus thynnus) and other medium and small <b>tuna</b> species (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>alalunga,</b> Auxis rochei, Euthynnus alleteratus and Katsuwonus pelamis). In summer, despite been considered an oligotrophic region as the whole Mediterranean Sea, it harbors a relatively abundant and diverse larval fish community (LFC). In this study, we analyze the composition, abundance and the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the horizontal structure of the LFC in the Balearic region, in early summer 2005, during the spawning season of Atlantic bluefin tuna. Hydrographically, 2005 was an unusual year with a summer situation of relatively lack of mesoscale features, weak surface currents and a general situation of high stability. A total of 128 taxa of fish larvae, belonging to 52 families, were identified. The average abundance was 1770 larvae 1000 m- 3. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed LFC to have a strong horizontal structure. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination identified two larval fish assemblages. These assemblages were mainly delineated by depth and, therefore, by the spawning location of adult fish. Our results also suggest that anticyclonic eddy boundaries constitute favourable habitats for fish larvae. Also, the scenario of higher than unusual hydrographic stability found during the cruise would be responsible for the relatively lack of mesoscale features and, consequently, for the lack of influence of these features on the horizontal distribution of fish larvae and on the horizontal structure of the LFC. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Fish weighed from 3. 14 to 11. 62 kg and were 50. 8 - 86. 4 cm long. Total mercury {{content in the}} albacore muscle tissue ranged from 0. 027 ppm (µg/g) to 0. 26 ppm. The average total mer-cury content was 0. 14 ± 0. 05 ppm, which is below the U. S.

Total mer-cury concentrations showed positive correlations with length and weight of albacore (R 2 = 0. 40 and 0. 38, respectively), but there was no correla-tion with date of capture or lipid content.

The size composition of I. argentinus in the diet of their main predators was estimated using regression equations that relate mantle length and body weight to beak size. The short-finned squid {{was found in the}} diet of 32 species and appears {{to play an important role}} in the trophic relations along the upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters, where it was found in the diet of the swordfish Xiphias gladius, the <b>tunas</b> <b>Thunnus</b> obesus, T. <b>alalunga</b> and T. albacares, and the wreckfish Polyprion americanus. These five species stand for more than half of the landings from the upper slope demersal and oceanic pelagic fisheries in the region. On the shelf, where the dominant squid was Loligo sanpaulensis, Illex argentinus was only occasionally found in the diet of a few neritic predators. In southern Brazil, overall predation was more intense on subadults and adults of the winter-spring spawning group on the upper slope and oceanic adjacent waters, differently from its southern range along Uruguay and Argentina waters where the short-finned squid is abundant on the shelf and is preyed upon mainly by the demersal fish assemblage...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the current levels of total mercury and methylmercury in the muscle tissue of <b>albacore</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>alalunga)</b> and bluefin <b>tuna</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> thynnus) caught in the Mediterranean sea {{with the purpose of}} ascertaining whether the concentrations exceeded the maximum level fixed by the European Commission Decision. Total mercury concentrations ranged from 0. 84 to 1. 45 mg kg(- 1) w. w. (av. 1. 17 mg kg(- 1) w. w.) and from 0. 16 to 2. 59 mg kg(- 1) (av. 1. 18 mg kg(- 1) w. w.) in the muscle of <b>albacore</b> and bluefin <b>tuna,</b> respectively. In 78. 6 % of albacore and in 61. 1 % of bluefin tuna analysed, total mercury concentrations exceeded the maximum level fixed by the European Commission Decision (Hg = 1 micro g g(- 1) wet wt). In the two species, mercury was present almost completely in the methylated form, with percentages between 77 and 100 % (av. 91. 3 %) in albacore and between 75 and 100 % (av. 91 %) in bluefin-tuna. In order to assess the potential health impact, the estimated weekly intake was calculated. The estimated weekly intake was far above the established Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake for both species. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|In the Northeast of Brazil, {{the capture}} of tuna and {{swordfish}} using monofilament longline {{is one of the}} most important economic activities. The purpose of this study was to find out length-weight relationships and length-length conversions. The tuna and swordfish landings done by national and leasehold fleets between October 2003 and June 2004 were analyzed. Those fleets operate between the latitude 5 ° 00 ´N and 5 ° 44 ´S and between the longitude 27 ° 01 ´W and 36 ° 40 ´W. The bigeye <b>tuna</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> obesus) contributed with 39, 2 % of the captures in weight, followed by the yellowfin <b>tuna</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> albacares) with 36 % and swordfish (Xiphias gladius) with 23, 3 %. The albacore (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>alalunga)</b> represented only 1, 5 % of the captures in weight. The captures done by leasehold fleets showed the greatest average length. For the species that showed the greatest capture (bigeye tuna), the average length was 126 cm fork length (FL), with highest abundance in the classes between 113 and 143 cm (67, 9 %). There were found weight-length (DWT x OCKL) relationships and conversion equations of length-length (TL x FL; FL x OCKL and TL x OCKL) for some species.
