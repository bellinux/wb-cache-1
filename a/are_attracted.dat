5|$|The {{electrons}} of an atom <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> to the protons in {{an atomic}} nucleus by this electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> {{to each other}} by a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.|$|E

50|$|In The 16 Strivings for God Reiss {{develops}} {{the theory that}} people embrace religion because it provides them with opportunities to satisfy all 16 basic desires both in strong form and in weak form. For example, {{a person with a}} weak basic desire for social contact might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> to religious retreats, while a person with a strong basic desire for Social Contact might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> to religious festivals. A person with a weak basic desire for Vengeance might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> to passages in scriptures that speak of peace and forgiveness, while a person with a strong basic desire for Vengeance might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> to passages that speak of revenge.|$|R

5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam {{is a problem for}} the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> to the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} pollinators have been {{recorded}} visiting the flower spikes, including New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants. The flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> to the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{responses}} of Ips pini (Scolytidae) to multiple-funnel traps baited with the pheromone, ipsdienol, and various monoterpenes were deter-mined in stands of lodgepole pine in southern and central British Columbia. Ips pini <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> to both ipsdienol and P-phellandrene, demonstrating that @-phellandrene is a kairomone for this species. Lasconotus complex (Col-ydiidae) and a Corticeus sp. (Tenebrionidae) <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> to both ipsdienol and @-phellandrene. The Corticeus sp. exhibited a synergistic {{response to the}} combination of ipsdienol and @-phellandrene; the {{responses of}} the other two species to the combination were additive. The predators, Thanasimus unda-tulus, Enoclerus sphegeus, and E. lecontei (Cleridae), <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> to ips-dienol-baited traps, while Monochamus clamator (Cerambycidae) and Dendroctonus ponderosae (Scolytidae) <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> to, 6 -phellandrene. Attraction of all eight species increased with increasing release rates of ips-dienol and/or / 3 -phellandrene...|$|R
5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> to areas where males are calling, {{which they do}} {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles. Bugling {{is often associated with}} an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E

These can have a local impact on dragonfly populations; methods of reducing the attractiveness of structures such as solar panels are under experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which {{are thought to}} be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, making them more liable to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E
5|$|In this way, {{the bucket}} orchid passes its pollen from flower to flower.

5|$|Like all sundews, D. anglica uses stalked {{mucilaginous}} glands called tentacles which cover its laminae to attract, trap, and digest small arthropods, usually insects. These <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> by a sugary scent exuded by the glands, {{and upon}} alighting {{on the plant}} adhere to the sticky drops of mucilage. Although most of its prey consists of small insects such as flies, bulkier insects with large wings are also caught. Small butterflies, damselflies, and even dragonflies can become immobilized by the plant's sticky mucilage.|$|E
5|$|Motile {{bacteria}} <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> or {{repelled by}} certain stimuli in behaviours called taxes: these include chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis. In one peculiar group, the myxobacteria, individual bacteria move {{together to form}} waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores. The myxobacteria move only when on solid surfaces, unlike E. coli, which is motile in liquid or solid media.|$|E
5|$|Numerous nectar-feeding insects <b>are</b> <b>attracted</b> to {{the flower}} spikes, {{which in turn}} attract honeyeaters, {{silvereyes}} and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|E
500|$|In Munster, stress <b>is</b> <b>attracted</b> {{to a long}} vowel or diphthong in {{the second}} or third {{syllable}} of a word, e.g. [...] ('girl'), [...] ('request').
