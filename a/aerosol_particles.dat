Atmospheric <b>aerosol</b> <b>particle</b> {{formation}} is frequently observed throughout the atmosphere, but despite various attempts of explanation, the processes behind it remain unclear. In this study data mining techniques {{were used to}} find the key parameters needed for atmospheric <b>aerosol</b> <b>particle</b> formation to occur. A dataset of 8 years of 80 variables collected at the boreal forest station (SMEAR II) in Southern Finland was used, incorporating variables such as radiation, humidity, SO 2, ozone and present aerosol surface area. This data was analyzed using clustering and classification methods. The aim of this approach was to gain new parameters independent of any subjective interpretation. This resulted in two key parameters, relative humidity and preexisting <b>aerosol</b> <b>particle</b> surface (condensation sink), capable in explaining 88 % of the nucleation events.

40|$|The Smoluchowski {{equation}} {{describes the}} time evolution of an <b>aerosol</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution due to aggregation or coagulation.

25|$|Stability of {{nanoparticle}} agglomerates {{is critical}} for estimating size distribution of aerosolized particles from nano-powders or other sources. At nanotechnology workplaces, workers can be exposed via inhalation to potentially toxic substances during handling and processing of nanomaterials. Nanoparticles in the air often form agglomerates due to attractive inter-particle forces, such as van der Waals force or electrostatic force if the particles are charged. As a result, <b>aerosol</b> <b>particles</b> are usually observed as agglomerates rather than individual particles. For exposure and risk assessments of airborne nanoparticles, {{it is important to}} know about the size distribution of aerosols. When inhaled by humans, particles with different diameters are deposited in varied locations of the central and periphery respiratory system. Particles in nanoscale have been shown to penetrate the air-blood barrier in lungs and be translocated into secondary organs in the human body, such as the brain, heart and liver. Therefore, the knowledge on stability of nanoparticle agglomerates is important for predicting the size of <b>aerosol</b> <b>particles,</b> which helps assess the potential risk of them to human bodies.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{nucleation}} processes. Gases preferentially condense onto surfaces of pre-existing <b>aerosol</b> <b>particles,</b> known as heterogeneous nucleation.

This results in the addition of very small, rapidly growing particles to the particle-size distribution.|$|E

25|$|A {{large-scale}} attack using anthrax {{would require}} the creation of <b>aerosol</b> <b>particles</b> of 1.5 to 5µm: larger particles would not reach the lower respiratory tract, while smaller particles would be exhaled {{back out into the}} atmosphere. At this size, conductive powders tend to aggregate because of electrostatic charges, hindering dispersion. So the material must be treated to insulate and neutralize the charges. The weaponized agent must be resistant to degradation by rain and ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, while retaining the ability to efficiently infect the human lung.

25|$|Particles can deposit in the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx (the head airways region), deeper {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract (from the trachea {{to the terminal}} bronchioles), or in the alveolar region. The location of deposition of <b>aerosol</b> <b>particles</b> within the respiratory system strongly determines {{the health effects of}} exposure to such aerosols. This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>particles</b> that reach certain parts of the respiratory system. Examples of these subsets of the particle-size distribution of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway. The inhalable fraction of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle-size distribution by aerodynamic diameter. The thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region. The respirable fraction is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region. To measure the respirable fraction of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, horizontal elutriators, and large pore membrane filters.|$|E

25|$|A {{review of}} {{evidence}} regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure {{is a risk}} factor for cancer in 2007 found solid data to conclude that long-term exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulates) increases the overall risk of non-accidental mortality by 6% per a 10 microg/m3 increase. Exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung cancer (range: 15% to 21% per 10 microg/m3 increase) and total cardiovascular mortality (range: 12% to 14% per a 10 microg/m3 increase). The review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes --- increase in lung cancer deaths, cardiovascular deaths, and overall non-accidental deaths. The reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to PM2.5 is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to SO2 increases mortality from lung cancer, but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions.
