5|$|After the {{expulsion}} of the Jesuit order from Spanish territories in 1767, most Jesuit reductions in South America were abandoned <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> ruins. The former Jesuit missions of Chiquitos are unique because these settlements and their associated culture have survived largely intact.|$|E
5|$|When British troops left Malta in 1979, {{the fort}} was {{abandoned}} <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> {{a state of}} disrepair. Parts of it were also vandalized. At some point it was also used as a desalination plant.|$|E
5|$|After being decommissioned, Fort Manoel was {{abandoned}} <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> {{a state of}} disrepair. Parts of it were also vandalized. In 1970, the Royal Malta Yacht Club acquired part of the fort as its club house, and the yacht club remained there until it acquired new premises in Ta' Xbiex in 2008.|$|E
50|$|After 1800 {{the castle}} was never {{inhabited}} again, <b>and</b> slowly <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> disrepair.|$|R
50|$|York City, Grimsby Town, Northampton Town <b>and</b> Reading <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the Fourth Division.|$|R
60|$|Orestes started, <b>and</b> then <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> thought. Raphael sat {{watching}} him a while.|$|R
5|$|Before {{leading the}} final sortie by the castle garrison, Zrinski ordered a fuse be lit to the powder magazine. After cutting {{down the last}} of the {{defenders}} the besiegers poured into the fortress. The Ottoman Army entered the remains of Szigetvár <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the booby trap; thousands perished in the blast when the castle's magazine exploded.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{the naturalist}} David Attenborough {{and his wife}} Jane bought a house {{situated}} between the former Mayfield Cottages (which still stand today) and the Hole in the Wall pub. The pub closed in 2007 <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> dereliction but was bought by Attenborough in 2009 to be redeveloped.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, {{the fort}} {{was used for}} storage <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> decline, until {{tourists}} began to come to Dartmouth {{in the second half}} of the 19th century and it was restored. During the Second World War, it was briefly used as a machine-gun post. In the 21st century, it is managed by English Heritage and open to visitors, protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E

25|$|One rocket fell near an Egyptian {{security}} installation near Taba, <b>and</b> another <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the Red Sea.|$|R
50|$|The {{cemetery}} {{was closed}} in 1936 after 57,774 burials <b>and</b> subsequently <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> {{a state of}} disrepair.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} years, the battle site attracted fewer visitors <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> disrepair. It was later {{taken over by}} the Tippecanoe County Historical Association, which now maintains the battleground and the seminary building, housing a museum about the battle. They added an amphitheater to the memorial in 1986. In 1989–90, the amphitheater was used for performances of The Battle of Tippecanoe Outdoor Drama.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1810s and 1850s {{there were}} a series of changes in {{ownership}} and management. These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute, who was {{the manager of the}} Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise.|$|E

5|$|Chip Diller – Landis {{receives}} {{a letter from}} Diller, who is currently serving as a missionary in Africa. He recalls how he was prevented from going to Vietnam as {{his father was a}} prime donor to several right-wing political campaigns. When he learned of Doug Neidermeyer's fragging in Vietnam, he fell into alcoholism and despair. When he began seeing Jesus in his food, he became a born-again Christian <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> his current profession as minister and missionary.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{not without}} incident. In May 1860, a GNR train {{overshot}} the platform at King's Cross <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the workings. Later in 1860, a boiler explosion on an engine pulling contractor's wagons killed the driver and his assistant. In May 1861, the excavation collapsed at Euston causing considerable damage to the neighbouring buildings. The final accident occurred in June 1862 when the Fleet sewer burst following a heavy rainstorm and flooded the excavations. The Met and the Metropolitan Board of Works managed to stem and divert {{the water and the}} construction was delayed by only a few months.|$|E
5|$|Few visible {{signs of}} the company remain. The former extent of the Bolckow, Vaughan {{property}} at the Eston Sheet and Galvanizing Works beside the River Tees Dockyard is still marked by boundary stones on Smiths Dock Road, Middlesbrough. The graves {{of the founding fathers}} of the company and of Middlesbrough, Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan, in St Cuthbert's Churchyard, Marton, were neglected for the whole of the 20th century, <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> disrepair. The neglect was recognised and the graves refurbished in 2009.|$|E

5|$|In 1330 Sir John de Mohun {{inherited}} the castle; John, although a notable knight, was childless <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> considerable debt. His wife Joan {{took over the}} running of their estates, and when John died in 1376 she agreed to sell the castle to Lady Elizabeth Luttrell, the leading member of another major Norman family, for 5,000 marks, with the castle to transfer to Elizabeth on Joan's death. At some point during this period additional stone buildings were constructed along the Lower Ward, {{on the side of}} the current mansion, and records suggest that a ditch, or moat, may have existed around the base of the Tor in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, the castle became {{increasingly}} unfashionable <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> decline. By the mid-16th century, {{it was in}} ruins and unsuitable for royal use. Stone {{was taken from the}} castle to build houses and other buildings in the town. The castle was almost destroyed during the construction of the London and Birmingham Railway in the 1830s. As a result, it became the first building in Britain to receive statutory protection from Parliament. In 1930, the castle passed from the Duchy of Cornwall to the government's control. It is maintained as a tourist attraction by English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|No {{one took}} over as {{paramount}} chief upon Atangana's death. His opulent palace went unoccupied <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> ruins. However, traditional Cameroonian chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, Cameroonian ethnic groups had rejuvenated these dormant traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Thérèse became the new Ewondo paramount chief. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, Yaoundé, a project that would cost an estimated 150,000,000 francsCFA.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{a soccer}} player, Rolle {{did not play}} {{basketball}} until he was 15, when local coach Darrel Sears saw him walking across a basketball court and saw Rolle's great height. Sears asked if {{he knew how to}} play; Rolle said no. Sears asked him to try shooting from the foul line. His first shot, according to Rolle, completely missed the backboard <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the bushes behind it. At the time Rolle was not interested in the game and only attended Sears' practices because free fried chicken was provided.|$|E
5|$|The Eshmun Temple was {{improved}} {{during the}} early Roman Empire with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> oblivion as Christianity replaced paganism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 {{until the beginning of}} the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of Israel from Southern Lebanon, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the World Heritage Site tentative list.|$|E
5|$|The {{translation}} of the myth of Myrrha as it appeared in Ovid's Metamorphoses is suggested as being {{a critique of the}} political settlement that followed the Glorious Revolution. The wife of the leader of this revolution, William of Orange, was Mary, daughter of James II. Mary and William were crowned king and queen of England in 1689, and because Dryden was deeply sympathetic to James he lost his public offices <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> political disfavor under the new reign. Dryden turned to translation and infused these translations with political satire in response - the myth of Myrrha being one of these translations.|$|E
