5|$|Monthly {{rainfall}} {{is greater}} downwind of cities, partially {{due to the}} UHI. Increases in heat within urban centers increases the length of growing seasons, <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> the occurrence of weak tornadoes.

5|$|Lead {{can cause}} severe {{damage to the}} brain and kidneys and, ultimately, death. By {{mimicking}} calcium, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier.

5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule that binds to an enzyme <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of glucose {{may be due}} to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with NIDDM.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorylation: cTnI was {{the first}} sarcomeric protein {{identified}} to be a substrate of PKA. Phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/Ser24 under adrenergic stimulation enhances relaxation of cardiac muscle, which is critical to cardiac function especially at fast heart rate. Whereas PKA phosphorylation of Ser23/Ser24 decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and increases relaxation, phosphorylation of Ser42/Ser44 by PKC increases Ca2+ sensitivity <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> cardiac muscle relaxation. Ser5/Ser6, Tyr26, Thr31, Ser39, Thr51, Ser77, Thr78, Thr129, Thr143 and Ser150 are also phosphorylation sites in human cTnI.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is the {{tendency}} of an atom to attract electrons. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and {{the distance between the}} valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E

5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> the climb gradient.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} round, one {{contestant}} from each team faces {{the same question}} simultaneously. Contestants have their own money countdown, which starts at $1,000 <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> by $50 per second. The other contestant from each team then faces a more difficult question, with an opening value of $2,500 and decreasing by $100 per second. The host usually reads the question to the contestants during this round. After this second question, the team that has more money wins and plays the bonus round for $10,000.|$|E
5|$|Some {{birds have}} also {{demonstrated}} {{the capacity to}} fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative {{to the outside of}} the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals. Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> the risks associated with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.|$|E

5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis. This process {{is known as}} proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling and {{is due to the}} facilitated diffusion of protons into the matrix. The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process is mediated by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found in brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown adipose tissue is found in mammals, and is at its highest levels in early life and in hibernating animals. In humans, brown adipose tissue is present at birth <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> with age.|$|E
5|$|When a {{main-sequence star}} consumes the {{hydrogen}} at its core, {{the loss of}} energy generation causes its gravitational collapse to resume. Stars with less than 0.23 , are predicted to directly become white dwarfs when energy generation by nuclear fusion of hydrogen at their core comes to a halt. In stars between this threshold and 10 , the hydrogen surrounding the helium core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell. In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> in temperature, {{turning it into a}} red giant. At this point the star is evolving off the main sequence and entering the giant branch. The path which the star now follows across the HR diagram, to the upper right of the main sequence, is called an evolutionary track.|$|E
5|$|Common {{responses}} include: {{pupil dilation}} (93%); changes in heart rate (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes {{in blood pressure}} (84%), including hypotension (34%), hypertension (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in stretch reflex (86%), including increases (80%) <b>and</b> <b>decreases</b> (6%); nausea (44%); tremor (25%); and dysmetria (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be {{a risk factor for}} users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.|$|E
