25|$|From October 30 – 31, {{this low}} {{pressure}} system slowly became better organized over Texas, before it ejected north over the Mississippi River Valley. This meridonal trajectory {{of a low}} pressure track (almost due north from the western Gulf) is climatologically favorable to produce very heavy snowfall in the winter months because it allows copious amounts of moisture to flow north where it can interact with colder <b>air.</b> <b>Cooler</b> readings lingered {{at the very end}} of October across the Upper Midwest, and a re-enforcing pool of Arctic air was just beginning to push southeast through the western Canadian Provinces.|$|E

In this paper, we simulate the solidification of 60 t Q 235 huge rectangular ingot with ProCAST in different cooling conditions such as <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and water cooling. The results show that solidification time in forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and water cooling shortened than that in <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> respectively by 0. 9 hours and 2. 2 hours; The primary fine-grain area is large in the forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and water <b>cooling.</b> In forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> we can obtain the largest equiaxial crystal ratio and the minimum columnar crystal ratio; The shrinkage cavity position of the ingot in forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and water cooling is closer to riser {{than it is in}} <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> but the volumes of shrinkage cavities respectively increased {{to a greater extent than}} in <b>air</b> <b>cooling...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} a cold {{production}} process was proposed for inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> in which cryogenic energy from {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) was sufficiently converted to cold energy. The effect of using the cold production process for inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> on the off-design performance of a gas turbine combined cycle was analyzed under different ambient conditions. The cold output of the proposed process was increased by about 38. 1 % to 42. 5 % {{compared to that of}} the conventional cold production process that involves direct LNG evaporation. Furthermore for the inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> the proposed method increased the relative power increment from 2. 2 % to 14. 4 % and the relative efficiency increment from 0. 7 % to 2. 2 %, mainly depending on the variations in the relative humidity, compared to cold production without <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> The relative power and relative efficiency of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> were increased by 0. 6 % to 3. 1 % and 0. 3 % to 0. 5 %, respectively, above those of the traditional <b>air</b> <b>cooling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{high speed}} ball screw system generates more heat {{naturally}} and resultant more thermal expansion, which adversely affects {{the accuracy of}} positioning. Therefore, an <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> system was set in ball screw shaft in this paper to dominate the thermal error and achieve temperature equilibrium faster. In order to estimate the thermal error of ball screw system and effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> system, thermal behavior models of finite element method and modified lumped capacitance method were developed separately which includes the heat generation power of the main heat source of the ball screw system and other boundary conditions. The completed models were used to simulate the temperature distribution, thermal deformation and <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> performance. Compared with experiments, it is shown that these methods can well predict the <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> performance...|$|R

Based on the model, a comprehensive analysis on optimization of <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> tower is conducted for 600 MW indirect air-cooled power generating unit. By using the software VC++, the indirect air-cooled tower optimization program is developed. With the help of optimization of tower structure, a tower with better structure is used to conduct thermal analysis of the influences of ambient temperature, windward air velocity, and saturated exhaust flow rate on back pressure of turbine.
