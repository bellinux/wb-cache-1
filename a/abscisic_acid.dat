5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E
5|$|Overexpression of systemin and HypSys {{has been}} found to improve plants' {{tolerance}} to abiotic stress, including salt stress and UV radiation. When prosystemin was over-expressed in tomato, transgenic plants had lower stomatal conductance than normal plants. When grown in salt solutions, transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductances, lower leaf concentrations of <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> and proline and a higher biomass. These findings suggest that systemin either allowed the plants to adapt to salt stress more efficiently or that they perceived a less stressful environment. Similarly, wounded tomato plants were less susceptible to salt stress than unwounded plants. This may be because wounding decreases the growth of the plant and therefore slows the uptake of toxic ions into the roots. An analysis of salt-induced changes in gene expression found that the differences measured between the transgenic and normal plants could not be accounted for by changes in conventional salt stress-induced pathways. Instead Orsini et al. suggested that the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway determines a physiological state that not only directs resources towards the production of compounds active against pests, but also pre-adapts plants to minimize water loss. These effects are achieved by negatively regulating the production of hormones and metabolites that will force plants to invest additional resources to counteract water loss, a secondary effect of herbivores.|$|E
25|$|Physiological {{dormancy}} {{means the}} embryo, due to physiological causes, cannot generate {{enough power to}} break through the seed coat, endosperm or other covering structures. Dormancy is typically broken at cool wet, warm wet or warm dry conditions. <b>Abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> is usually the growth inhibitor in seeds, and its production can be affected by light.|$|E
25|$|Some live {{seeds are}} dormant and need more time, and/or {{need to be}} {{subjected}} to specific environmental conditions before they will germinate. Seed dormancy can originate {{in different parts of the}} seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. Dormancy breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds. Factors affecting seed dormancy include the presence of certain plant hormones, notably <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid,</b> which inhibits germination, and gibberellin, which ends seed dormancy. In brewing, barley seeds are treated with gibberellin to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of barley malt.|$|E
25|$|The {{hormonal}} {{control of}} growth, differentiation {{and development in}} plants was Osborne's lifelong interest. She is particularly known for her work establishing that the gas ethylene is a natural plant hormone, rather than a by-product or pollutant, and for demonstrating that ethylene, rather than <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid,</b> is the major regulator of senescence (ageing) and abscission (shedding of parts such as leaves). She conducted extensive research into interactions between ethylene and auxin (another key plant hormone) in controlling numerous aspects of plant development. This work led her to develop {{the idea of the}} target cell as a model for how a small number of plant hormones can exert many different effects, a concept she expounded in her 2005 book, Hormones, Signals and Target Cells in Plant Development (co-authored with Michael McManus).|$|E
25|$|When {{the roots}} begin to sense a water {{shortage}} in the soil, <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> (ABA) is released. ABA binds to receptor proteins in the guard cells' plasma membrane and cytosol, which first raises the pH of the cytosol {{of the cells}} and cause the concentration of free Ca2+ to increase in the cytosol due to influx from outside the cell and release of Ca2+ from internal stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum and vacuoles. This causes the chloride (Clâˆ’) and organic ions to exit the cells. Second, this stops the uptake of any further K+ into the cells and, subsequently, the loss of K+. The loss of these solutes causes an increase in water potential, which results in the diffusion of water {{back out of the}} cell by osmosis. This makes the cell plasmolysed, which results in the closing of the stomatal pores.|$|E
500|$|Cytokinins are a {{class of}} plant hormones named for their control of cell {{division}} or cytokinesis. The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts. The gibberelins, such as Gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl CoA via the mevalonate pathway. They {{are involved in the}} promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering. <b>Abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission, and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> (also called ABA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} plant growth regulators. It was discovered and researched under two different names before its chemical properties were fully known, it was called dormin and abscicin II. Once it was determined that the two compounds are the same, it was named <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid.</b> The name [...] "abscisic acid" [...] was given because it was found in high concentrations in newly abscissed or freshly fallen leaves.|$|E
2500|$|One {{irrigation}} technique {{known as}} partial rootzone drying (or PRD) involves [...] "tricking" [...] the grapevine into thinking it is undergoing water stress {{when it is}} actually receiving sufficient water supply. This is accomplished by alternating drip irrigation to where only {{one side of the}} grapevine receives water at a time. The roots on the dry side of the vine produce <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> that triggers some of the vine's physiological responses to water stress - reduced shoot growth, smaller berries size, etc. But because the vine is still receiving water on the other side the stress doesn't become so severe to where vital functions such as photosynthesis is compromised.|$|E
2500|$|WRKY {{transcription}} factors function {{through a}} variety of plant hormone signaling cascades. [...] Over half of Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY transcription factors respond to salicylic acid treatment. [...] At least 25% of WRKY transcription factors from Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) are responsive to jasmonate. [...] Similarly, in grape (Vitis vinifera) 63%, 73%, 76%, and 81% or WRKY transcription factors are responsive to salicylic acid, ethylene, <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid,</b> and jasmonate treatment, respectively. [...] In Arabidopsis thaliana, two important WRKY transcription factors are WRKY57 and WRKY70. [...] WRKY57 mediates crosstalk between jasmonate and auxin signaling cascades, whereas WRKY70 moderates signaling between the jasmonate and salicylic acid pathways. [...] Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY23 functions downstream of auxin signaling to positively activate expression of flavonols, which function as polar auxin transport inhibitors, to negatively feedback and suppress further auxin responses. [...] Several WRKY transcription factors also respond to gibberellin treatment.|$|E
2500|$|At the far extreme is severe {{water stress}} which can have {{detrimental}} effects {{on both the}} vine and on potential wine quality. To conserve water, a vine will try to conserve water by limiting its loss through transpiration. The plant hormone <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> triggers the stomata {{on the underside of}} the plant leaf to stay close in order to reduce the amount of water that is evaporated. While conserving water this also has the consequences of limiting the intake of carbon dioxide needed to sustain photosynthesis. If the vine is continually stressed it will keeps it stomata closed for longer and longer periods of time which can eventually cause photosynthesis to stop all together. When a vine has been so deprived of water it can exceed what is known as its permanent wilting point. At this point, the vine can become permanently damaged beyond recovery even if later watered. Viticulturists will carefully watch the plant for signs of severe water stress. Some of the symptoms include: ...|$|E

It has recently established {{a partnership with the}} Division of Gastroenterology at the Carilion Clinic to launch a joint translational research program in inflammatory bowel diseases.|$|E
2500|$|Water stress (drought {{and salt}} stress) {{is one of}} the major {{environmental}} problems causing severe losses in agriculture and in nature. Drought tolerance of plants is mediated by several mechanisms that work together, including stabilizing and protecting the plant from damage caused by desiccation and also controlling how much water plants lose through the stomatal pores during drought. A plant hormone, <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> (ABA), is produced in response to drought. A major type of ABA receptor has been identified. Future research is needed to test if these receptors can be used to engineer drought tolerance in plants. The plant hormone ABA causes the stomatal pores to close in response to drought, which reduces plant water loss via transpiration to the atmosphere and allows plants to avoid or slow down water loss during droughts. The use of drought tolerant crop plants would lead to a reduction in crop losses during droughts. [...] Since guard cells control water loss of plants, the investigation on how stomatal opening and closure are regulated could lead to the development of plants with improved avoidance or slowing of desiccation and better water use efficiency.|$|E

50|$|There are {{at least}} {{eighteen}} histone deacetylases in Arabidopsis (Hollender et al. 2008). Genome-wide association mapping has shown that deacetylation of histones by Histone Deacetylase 2B negatively affects dormancy. The remodeling of chromatin by histone deacetylase leads to silencing of genes that control plant hormones such as ethylene, <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid,</b> and gibberelin which maintain dormancy. Additionally, Histone Deacetylase A6 and A19 activity contributes to silencing of Cytochrome P450 707A and activation of NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 4, 9. Both of these actions lead to increased <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> (Nonogaki et al. 2014).|$|E

50|$|Park et al. {{created an}} {{orthogonal}} receptor-ligand interface between PYR1 and mandipropamid. PYR1 normally binds to <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> which together then bind and inactivate to PP2C as a drought stress response, which stops PP2C from deactivating SnRK2. This causes a cascade {{that leads to}} the activation of the slow anion channel 1 and closing of the leaf guard cells and stomata. The result is less water loss by the plant. The natural response by the plant using <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> to bind PYR1 in drought conditions is not strong enough and is activated too late to significantly hinder crop yield loss. <b>Abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> is also currently too expensive to synthesize {{to be used as a}} spray to control drought response artificially on a mass scale. The ability to control this externally by spraying the PYR1MANDI (orthogonal receptor) with mandipropamid (orthogonal ligand and fungicide) has the potential to reduce crop yield loss during droughts in plants with these engineered receptors, and has been confirmed to work in canola.|$|E
50|$|Xanthoxin {{is reduced}} at the epoxy group and then {{hydroxylated}} at the aldehyde group, producing <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid.</b> The 8' hydroxylation of abscisate, abscisic acid's conjugate base, produces 8'-hydroxyabscisate. 8'-hydroxyabscisate cyclizes via nucleophilic {{attack of the}} existing ring by the 8' hydroxy group to interconvert with phaseate. The former process {{is known to be}} mediated by 8' <b>abscisic</b> <b>acid</b> hydroxylases, a family of NADPH-dependent enzymes. Saito et al. have demonstrated that, in the case of arabidopsis, these hydroxylases are independent of any regulatory mechanism downstream of translation itself. The latter process is reported to occur without enzymatic intervention, as it has been found to occur spontaneously in vitro.|$|E
