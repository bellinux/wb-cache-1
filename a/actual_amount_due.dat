25|$|A channel {{agreement}} for Virgin Media to keep non-premium Sky channels ended on 1 March 2007. Virgin Media and Sky {{failed to reach}} agreement on the issue, and Sky reacted by posting {{a letter to the}} public in major UK newspapers on 28 February 2007. Despite Sky's letter, Virgin Media blamed Sky for tyrannising them and inciting consumers to switch. The companies failed to resolve their differences, and subsequently after midnight on 1 March 2007, Virgin Media replaced the Sky 1, Sky 2, Sky Travel, Sky Travel Extra, Sky Sports News and Sky News channel content with a standard message. Sky attributed part of the rate rise {{to the fact that the}} new deal would also include Sky 3, Sky Arts and undisclosed high definition and video on demand content. Sky said the deal would cost only 3p per customer per day (roughly £35,000,000 per year), but Virgin said that a minimum payment guarantee included in the contract meant that the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> <b>due</b> would exceed twice the current payment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{standard}} production unit system is the most basic element in our country construction. However, this {{standard production}} unit system shows a large difference in the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> of labor input for works at the Apartment housing construction, Therefore, {{it may be a}} reasonable alternative to estimate the cost of construction by historical cost data, works will be calculated the cost of labor must determine the exact amount and It is necessary to determine the exact amount of labor input for the construction progress management. This study examines the results of comparing the {{standard production unit}} system and the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> of labor counting in apartment housing construction was completed in the metropolitan area since 2000, the following results were obtained. the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> of labor input are looked for 1. 184 person/ 1000 of masonary, 0. 084 persons/ ㎡ of plaster, 0. 039 persons/ ㎡ of Waterproofing, 0. 059 persons/ ㎡ of tile at the Apartment housing construction. in the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> of labor counting Compared with standard production unit system, masonry ratio of 59. 8 %, plaster ratio of 41. 3 %, waterproofing ratio of 31. 5 %, tile ratio of 34. 3 % and The labor rate in the works was the lowest in the plaster. was relatively high in th...|$|R

50|$|The {{publicly}} stated total counts only pledges {{and does}} not indicate the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> donated, which is published on the MDA's Form 990. In 2009, the telethon drew approximately $45,000,000 (three-fourths) of its pledges; in 2010, $48,000,000 (nearly five-sixths). However, despite publicly stating a higher pledge total for the short telethon in 2011, the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> raised by the telethon was much smaller, with only $30,683,816 - slightly less than half - of the publicly stated total coming in, a steep drop-off from the last years under Lewis's stewardship.|$|R
40|$|The micro-satellite TET- 1 carries several {{technology}} experiments. It is {{the first}} in a series offering the possibility of in-orbit verification of new equipment made in Germany by the industrial and scientific aerospace community. TET- 1 was launched 22 nd July 2012 and is operated by the German Space Operations Center. Attitude and attitude control is influenced by several of the experiments. Special attitude control modes are required for a number of experiments in order to point the satellite in a prescribed direction or to a specific location on Earth. These comprise an experiment with three infra-red cameras, a pico thruster and finally a new type S-band transponder. The Li Polymer battery was not expected to have any effect on attitude control. However, it was discovered that charging and discharging the battery disturbs the magnetic field sensors, thus a different approach to attitude control is required when it is in use. implementation of and special demands on the attitude control system for these experiments will be presented. The mission is experimental with high demands on the attitude control system. The envisaged duration was one year only with a possible prolongation of a further year. Components were therefore not chosen for longevity. however, the <b>actual</b> <b>amount</b> of disruptions <b>due</b> to sensor and/or actuator outages and due to idiosyncrasies in the spacecrafts thermal budget was higher than expected. The ensuing challenges for the attitude control system will be discussed. A software upload in May 2013 mitigated several of the issues addressed above. The improvements in the software and autonomous on-board reactions will be presented in the final Section together with some recommendations for the follow-on missions TET- 2 and BIROS...|$|R
