5|$|The present main {{entrance}} to the mosque is the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which opens into the white marble-paved courtyard {{at the opposite end}} of the main prayer hall. To the northeast of the Bab al-Muzayinīn, the courtyard is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya; the southwestern end of the courtyard leads to the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya. Directly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> from the {{entrance to the}} Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay. Through this gate lies the courtyard of the prayer hall.|$|E
25|$|The arcade <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> and its mosaic was {{at first}} {{unaffected}} by the protracted and complicated rebuilding of the main basilica, but in the 17th century the mosaic underwent a complicated series of four moves and restorations or remodellings in 1610, 1618, 1629 and 1674/75 which finally took it to its present size, condition and location above the main door inside the portico of the new church.|$|E

I followed her, more slowly, down <b>the</b> great hall, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyards,</b> to <b>the</b> palace gates. And here she met Antony, riding through them, radiant with smiles and clad in his Roman armour. When he saw her he leapt to the ground, and, all armed as he was, clasped her to his breast.|$|R

Atop the Theatre and Science and Technology Block, sits a rooftop astro turf pitch which offers panoramic views of Dublin city and is mainly used for PE class {{as well as}} training for rugby and soccer teams. Directly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> on the rooftop of the Kerr Wing is the running track; another example of innovative use of limited city centre space.|$|E
25|$|Daisy Coffey, the landlord/owner, would {{testify at}} Frechette's trial that she spent most evenings during the Hellmans' stay {{furnishing}} apartment 310, which {{enabled her to}} observe {{what was happening in}} apartment 303 directly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> On March 30, Coffey went to the FBI's St. Paul field office to file a report, including information about the couple's new Hudson sedan parked in the garage behind the apartments. The building was placed under surveillance by two agents, Rufus Coulter and Rusty Nalls, that night, but they saw nothing unusual, mainly due to the blinds being drawn.|$|E
25|$|The {{courtyard}} {{contains a}} large freestanding belfry towering over {{the graves of}} both Orthodox and Protestant Christians. A tile work plaque inscribed in Armenian {{can be seen by}} the entrance to the cathedral. Graves are also placed along the exterior wall before the entrance, with inscriptions in Armenian. In one corner of the courtyard, there is a raised area with a memorial to the 1915 Armenian Genocide in Turkey. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> and facing the cathedral, there is a building housing a library and museum. Outside of this building are several carved stones showing scenes from the Bible.|$|E

2500|$|The Navicella (literally [...] "little ship") of Old Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome, was a {{large and}} famous mosaic that {{occupied}} {{a large part of}} the wall above the entrance arcade, facing the main facade of the basilica <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> attributed to Giotto di Bondone around 1305–13. It depicted the version from the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 14:24–32) of Christ walking on the water, the only one of the three gospel accounts where Saint Peter is summoned to join him. It was almost entirely destroyed during the construction of the new Saint Peter's Basilica in the 17th century, but fragments were preserved from the sides of the composition, and what is effectively a new work, incorporating some original fragments, was restored to a position at the centre of the portico of the new building in 1675.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> is the Lutyens building, also {{designated}} Benson A-E, {{which was}} built and named after Edwin Lutyens, the architect who planned much of the Village. Due {{to a lack of}} funding, it was the only part of Lutyens's original grandiose plan that was actually built. Part of the building's cost was sponsored by subscriptions raised by Harvard in memory of Henry Dunster, who studied in Magdalene in 1627-30 and later became a founding father of Harvard University. Hence, the crest of Harvard with the inscription Veritas {{can be found at the}} entrance to the D staircase. Each staircase in the building had slightly different banister designs, which Lutyens explained was [...] "to help Magdalene men to feel in the dark whether they were entering the correct staircase". The Lutyens building currently hosts about 60 students and fellows as well as the college launderette.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock {{moved to}} Paramount Pictures and filmed Rear Window (1954), {{starring}} James Stewart and Kelly again, {{as well as}} Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr. Stewart's character is a photographer (based on Robert Capa) who must temporarily use a wheelchair. Out of boredom, he begins observing his neighbours <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> and then becomes convinced {{that one of them}} (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. Stewart tries to convince both his policeman buddy (Wendell Corey) and his glamorous model-girlfriend (Kelly, whom screenwriter John Michael Hayes based on his own wife), and eventually he succeeds. As with Lifeboat and Rope, the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters, in this case to Stewart's small studio apartment overlooking a large courtyard. Hitchcock uses close-ups of Stewart's face to show his character's reactions to all that he sees, [...] "from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbours to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain's apartment".|$|E
50|$|In Round 3, the {{remaining}} four Attackers must race <b>across</b> <b>the</b> obstacle-ridden <b>courtyard,</b> up to <b>the</b> tower where the crown lies in wait. In their path are all 6 Defenders from both rounds taking up various positions around <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> wielding various weapons and devices to impede the Attackers' progress. In the end, only one Attacker will make it past the Defenders and capture the crown, winning this week's episode.|$|R
60|$|I walked swiftly up {{the winding}} ascent, {{straight}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> flagged <b>courtyard</b> and entered <b>the</b> castle by a side-door.

2500|$|It was rectangular, and {{positioned}} {{so that those}} leaving the basilica saw it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> outside the church, and passed under it if they left by the main route. [...] A figure of a man fishing on the shore to the left {{was thought to be}} a self-portrait of Giotto, as Vasari's Life records. [...] The composition was dominated by the fishing boat with its large sail, which represented a metaphor of the [...] "Ship of the Church", whose [...] "captain" [...] on earth was Saint Peter and his successors as Pope. [...] It was commissioned at a very difficult time for the Papacy, who were unable even to control the gangsterish nobility of Rome, and had therefore left the city, but the image promised that both church and Papacy were, with the help of Christ, [...] "unsinkable". [...] Of the eleven figures still in the boat, {{it has been suggested that}} the one holding the tiller is (anachronistically in terms of the Gospels) Saint Paul. In the sky, two almost naked classical style [...] "wind god" [...] figures blow through horns or funnels, one from each side, below pairs of haloed male figures. [...] Giotto would have produced drawings for specialist mosaic workers to recreate on the wall; whether he had any further involvement as the work was created is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Christian IV is {{believed}} to have fathered fifteen children by his second wife, Kirsten Munk, at least three of whom were born before the couple married in 1615, and eight of whom lived to adulthood. The Munks were noble courtiers, and Kirsten's formidable mother, née Ellen Marsvin, obtained the King's signed promise to marry the girl before yielding her to the King's passion. The marriage was morganatic and Leonora Christina was not a princess, sharing rather the title of Countess af Schleswig-Holstein bestowed upon her mother in 1629 (distinct from the title borne by the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein, dynastic kinsmen of the Danish kings who possessed actual domains in the Schleswig and Holstein provinces, some of whom also exercised sovereignty there). Nonetheless, she grew up with her parents in Copenhagen's royal palace (<b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> from the tower where she would eventually be imprisoned) on familiar terms with her three elder half-brothers [...] including the future King Frederick III [...] sons of the late Queen Anne Catherine of Brandenburg. The King accused his wife of betraying him with another man and divorced her in 1630, having already taken a mistress, Vibeke Kruse, his wife's servant. Although she proceeded to bear the King a new brood of children who would become the bitter rivals of Kirsten Munk's children, Leonora Christina seems to have retained her father's favor.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} Niederlauterstein is closely {{connected}} {{with that of}} Lauterstein Castle, built {{in the second half}} of the 12th century and first mentioned in 1304, which was built to protect a medieval trade road between Leipzig and Prague <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Ore mountains. When castle and lordship were divided in 1497 into Nyder Sloß Lauttersteynn ("Lower castle Lauterstein") and zum Lawttersteyn, a dividing wall was erected <b>across</b> <b>the</b> castle <b>courtyard.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} widen the narrow, two-lane street into a 32-meter-wide main road. The proposal met with stiff opposition from Jerusalem residents, as it called for destroying <b>the</b> historic garden <b>courtyards</b> of <b>the</b> buildings lining the street. An alternate plan called for laying <b>the</b> highway <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyards</b> while retaining <b>the</b> outer stone walls to maintain the 19th-century look of the street. Neither plan has come to fruition. In late 2009, during construction on Jaffa Road for the Jerusalem Light Rail, Egged city buses that normally traversed Jaffa Road were diverted onto Street of the Prophets. The street also sees increased traffic as an alternate route for buses traveling to northern Jerusalem neighborhoods (via Road 1) whenever Straus Street is closed due to demonstrations. In recent years, the city has granted permits {{for the development of}} high-rise, luxury apartment projects on and alongside Street of the Prophets. These projects are expected to alter the quiet, exclusive nature of the street.|$|R
50|$|Wassmuss’ {{story of}} his escape is beyond credibility. Wassmuss claimed that he told his guards his horse was sick. Every hour, (he claimed) he was then escorted under guard, to his horse’s stable (where {{he looked at the}} horse?), but in the early morning the guards were sleepy and grown tired of escorting him <b>across</b> <b>the</b> small <b>courtyard</b> to <b>the</b> stable. They {{therefore}} didn't bother escorting him, so he galloped away.|$|R

25|$|In all, 26 {{people were}} {{shot by the}} paratroopers; 13 died on the day and another died four months later.

60|$|An elderly woman, whom I {{had seen}} before {{as one of the}} {{servants}} who lived in <b>the</b> supplementary house <b>across</b> <b>the</b> back <b>courtyard,</b> opened <b>the</b> gate.

5|$|Modern {{visitors}} typically {{enter the}} house from the High Street to the south, passing through <b>the</b> gatehouse, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>courtyard</b> into <b>the</b> hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building {{to be built in}} North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed to show off the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors. Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.|$|R
5000|$|In elevation, {{the brick}} façade {{is made up}} of two storeys with a strip of windows located high above the front door to prevent anyone seeing into the home, so the house cannot be {{understood}} from the street. A flight of splayed stairs from ground level leads to the first floor containing the formal living area, master bedroom, Boyd's study and bathroom. Stairs down to ground floor are situated inside the master bedroom, where furniture has been positioned to take {{on the role of the}} balustrading. On the ground floor is the less formal family, dining and kitchen space - as well as access to <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> Located <b>across</b> from <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> are <b>the</b> children's quarters. <b>The</b> internal <b>courtyard</b> has surrounding glazed walls, which protect it from wind and rain but not light - they also allow for a visual connection between the separate buildings. Corridors along the sides of <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> provide access for the children to their quarters which contain three bedrooms (one with a study) and a bathroom. There is a lane situated behind the children's quarters, used as a carport.|$|R

[...] As he approached the elephant threw up his trunk, opened his mouth, and rushed suddenly at him. The officer fled hastily, shouting loudly to the other mahouts to bring their animals in a circle round the elephant, but the mahout gave him a sudden prod with his pricker and the elephant set off with great strides, his ears out, his trunk in the air, and with every sign of an access of fury, {{at the top of}} his speed. He rushed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> great <b>courtyard,</b> <b>the</b> people flying in all directions with shouts of terror; he made two or three turns up and down, each time getting somewhat nearer to the gate.|$|R
