Her interior was modernised and her boilers {{were converted to}} burn oil rather than coal as it lowered the refuelling time from days to hours; it also gave a steadier engine R.P.M and allowed the engine room personnel to be reduced from 350 to 60 people.

[...] Heisman recalled that, despite his small stature, Strupper had a powerful body: [...] "Stripped down in the dressing rooms Everett was a sight to behold.

500|$|Radcliffe first {{expressed}} a desire to act at the age of five, and in December 1999, aged 10, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield, portraying the title character as a young boy. He was educated at three independent schools for boys: Redcliffe School, a day school in Chelsea's Redcliffe Square, Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square, and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London). Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though he says it was people just trying to [...] "have <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> the kid that plays Harry Potter" [...] rather than jealousy.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{later said}} he was upset at the leak of the {{identity}} of the bassist, alleged to be Alessandro Venturella because of a unique tattoo on his hand. Root told Guitar World the drummer's identity would not be released, and that the bassist and the drummer were not permanent members of the band. On December 3, a former Slipknot road crew member posted a photograph of a touring band personnel list that confirmed bassist Alessandro Venturella and drummer Jay Weinberg were members of the tour. The new musicians had been viewed unfavorably by some of the band members; Shawn Crahan told Kerrang! magazine, [...] "This is Slipknot, fuck both of those guys...hey'll never be in the band. Never." [...] Taylor also said the two [...] "got <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> designing their own masks and they failed miserably", and they were wearing masks given to them by the band.|$|E

So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> him.

500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration.

[...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess."
