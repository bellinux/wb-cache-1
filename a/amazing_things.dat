25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E

Milian was featured on the cover of Rap-Ups 2008 Winter issue, in which she announced that the album's title was Dream in Color (later retitled as Elope). A single was released in October 2008, ballad [...] "Us Against the World". It was written by Milian and produced by Madd Scientist. The single, described by Milian as a [...] "cinematic power ballad", premiered via MySpace on October 6, 2008, and was made available by digital download the next day. Milian felt that Madd Scientist [...] "brought the best out of me" [...] while producing [...] "Us Against the World", and [...] "was really able to do some <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> with my vocals".|$|E

500|$|With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto {{wanted to}} take the idea of a game [...] "world" [...] even further, giving players a [...] "miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer." [...] He drew his {{inspiration}} from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, and through the Zelda titles he always tries to impart to players some of the sense of exploration and limitless wonder he felt. [...] "When I was a child," [...] he said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] The memory of being lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family's home in Sonobe was recreated in Zeldas labyrinth dungeons.|$|E
500|$|According to Greg Forman from The Post and Courier, {{the album}} shows that [...] "There's an {{important}} difference between {{having a great}} voice and being a great singer. Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey can sing circles (and octaves) around the most famous woman on the planet, but Madonna, through sheer force of personality sells her slow numbers with a panache few modern singers can match." [...] John Wirt from The Advocate said that the album shows that Madonna [...] "can craft slow songs as effectively as she knocks out dance numbers" [...] and found [...] "an unaffected simplicity and sincerity" [...] in her ballad singing. Writing for The Baltimore Sun, J. D. Considine believed that with the album [...] "Madonna not only reminds us that there's more to her music than dance tunes, but also demonstrates that her voice is nowhere near as thin and chirpy as her detractors imagine." [...] He further explained, [...] "one of the most <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> about the album is how sultry and assured she sounds... The Madonna on display here not only has a richer, deeper voice than you imagined, but more interpretive insight as well." ...|$|E
500|$|While rejecting this {{thematic}} {{concern as}} unrealized by Argento, McDonagh {{noted that the}} result of the director's experiment is a strange [...] "architectural landscape" [...] that becomes the [...] "key element in differentiating Tenebrae from Argento's earlier gialli." [...] Argento's use of unusual architectural space and so-called visual [...] "hyper-realism" [...] results in an enormously fake looking environment. Seizing on the director's additional comment, [...] "...I dreamed an imaginary city in which the most <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> happen", she notes that the film's [...] "fictive space couldn't be less 'real'", with its [...] "vast unpopulated boulevards, piazzas that look like nothing more than suburban American malls, hard-edged Bauhaus apartment buildings, anonymous clubs and parking garages." [...] The EUR district of Rome, where much of Tenebrae was filmed, was built in preparation for the 1942 World's Fair, and intended by then-Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini to be a celebration of twenty years of fascism. Rostock believes that Argento used this location as an attempt to realize his theme of an imaginary city; the district gives a glimpse of a future Rome that never was, showing the city how it might have looked had fascism not fallen.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from sexual}} themes, Miguel wrote about {{conversational}} and existential topics. When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... So here I am trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, what if we did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these <b>amazing</b> <b>things?</b> Would we have come so far? ... Would we have come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E

[...] George went on to describe the album as [...] "intimate", which according to her gives [...] "the magic of Beyoncé — even when she's speaking to the masses, she's really speaking to you, and you alone." [...] She finished her review saying that the album gives a personal evening with Beyoncé along with [...] "absolute grace and ultimate humility." [...] Sian-Pierre Regis of MTV described the album as a [...] "glitzy doc-style flick" [...] and noted that Beyoncé shows her [...] "softer" [...] side while also calling her a [...] "gift that keeps on giving." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Melissa Maerz wrote that [...] "According to... DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4... finds Beyoncé telling her life story through her songs... has done a whole lot of <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> in her life." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised the romance between Beyoncé and Jay-Z during the DVD, noting that it was interesting to see Beyoncé talking about her love life because she has always kept her private life in secret. J. J. Anisiobi and Donna Mcconnell of Daily Mail praised the fact that the DVD shows Beyoncé [...] "from eager five-year-old music fan to a consummate entertainer".|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Screams of Abel webzine, former Antestor member Morten Mageroy reacted with caution to the proliferation of unblack bands: [...] "I really hope that people (who play Christian black metal) {{know what they are}} doing. I know this sounds very rough, but I have seen people being pulled into something they do not know. I am not saying that I know that these musicians are going to mess their lives up, but I have seen it happen to some people and it frightens me very much." [...] Mageroy, however, defends the unblack metal bands' intentions: [...] "A lot of Christian bands have done <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> being led by God. I know that God is using many types of communication, and it is important that Christians is [...] present in every field, in every genre, privately and in work. God might just as well use heavy metal to bring salvation to people." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Nintendo {{released}} its first home video game console, the Family Computer (rereleased in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System), Miyamoto made {{two of the}} most momentous titles for the console and in the history of video games as a whole: Super Mario Bros. (a sequel to Mario Bros.) and The Legend of Zelda (an entirely original title). In both games, Miyamoto decided to focus more on gameplay than on high scores, unlike many games of the time. Super Mario Bros. largely took a linear approach, with the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. By contrast, Miyamoto employed nonlinear gameplay in The Legend of Zelda, forcing the player to think their way through riddles and puzzles. The world was expansive and seemingly endless, offering [...] "an array of choice and depth never seen before in a video game." [...] With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto sought to make an in-game world that players would identify with, a [...] "miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer." [...] He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves; each Zelda title embodies this sense of exploration. [...] "When I was a child," [...] Miyamoto said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on <b>amazing</b> <b>things</b> as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] He recreated his memories of becoming lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family home in Zeldas labyrinthine dungeons. In February 1986, Nintendo released the game as the launch title for the Nintendo Entertainment System's new Disk System peripheral.|$|E
