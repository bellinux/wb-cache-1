Stream water and solute fluxes from the hillslope and valley-bottom catchments showed contrasting patterns between hydrological transitions and wet periods, especially for bio-reactive solutes. During transition periods, stream water export decreased > 40 % between the hillslope and the valley bottom coinciding with the prevalence of stream-to-aquifer fluxes at the <b>alluvial</b> <b>zone.</b> In contrast, stream water export increased by 20 – 70 % between the hillslope and valley-bottom catchments during wet periods. During transition periods, stream solute export decreased by 34 – 97 % between the hillslope and valley-bottom catchments for chloride, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon. In annual terms, stream nitrate export from the valley-bottom catchment (0. 32 ± 0. 12 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 [average ± standard deviation]) was 30 – 50 % lower than from the hillslope catchment (0. 56 ± 0. 32 kg N ha− 1 yr&minus; 1 ).

In this study, mechanisms governing the transport and retention of three metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) namely Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, and SiO 2 through limestone and quartz sand porous media were firstly investigated.

Water temperature, pH, and EC appear to be unaffected by local land use practices. Temperatures are high in fall and low in spring. pH remains fairly constant near neutrality throughout the year.

Water quality evolves along flow path from a fresh Ca 2 +-Mg 2 +-HCO 3 - type water with TDS around 300 mg/l in the north to a moderately saline Ca 2 + - Mg 2 +-SO 42 - type water with TDS around 8000 mg/ 1 in the southeast near Las Vegas Wash. TDS varies temporally but does not follow a seasonal pattern. Ion ratios remain constant throughout the year. Water samples are generally oversaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite, and quartz, but are undersaturated with respect to gysum and amorphous silica.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{dissolved}} inorganic nitrogen delivered to streams and groundwater has substantially {{increased in the}} last decades due to anthropogenic impacts. This fact has stimulated research on processes related to the nitrogen cycling in order to elucidate the ability of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in controlling nitrogen loads. Some of these studies pointed out during storms streamwater chemistry is significantly altered. However, because of the inherent difficulty of an extensive field experimental setting for dealing with episodic storms, studies focused on hydrological processes or stream solute dynamics during storms rely on a very limited number of events. Hydrobiogeochemical processes have been mainly studied in temperate experimental catchments and {{little attention has been}} paid to Mediterranean catchments. Recent studies have stressed the fragility of Mediterranean regions in front of the global change and because of that Mediterranean regions should become hot spots for present and future studies. The main goal of the present thesis was to study the variability of nutrient dynamics, in particular nitrogen, during stormflow in relation to baseflow conditions in Fuirosos, an intermittent stream draining a small Mediterranean catchment (Part I). As a secondary objective (Part II), solute dynamics in Fuirosos were compared with those measured at one of its main tributaries, the Grimola stream. Biotitic granodiorite was an important fraction of the Fuirosos catchment, whereas the Grimola catchment was underlain by leucogranite. The Fuirosos stream had an <b>alluvial</b> <b>zone</b> and it was flanked by a well developed riparian forest, whereas the Grimola stream had not a significant <b>alluvial</b> <b>zone,</b> neither a well developed riparian area. Thereby, the effect of (i) catchment size, (ii) lithology and (iii) the presence of an alluvial-riparian zone on stream hydrogrochemistry were assessed by comparing the Fuirosos and Grimola streams. The Fuirosos Stream Watershed, a relatively undisturbed Mediterranean ecosystem that can not be considered a N-saturated catchment, leaks to the stream most of the nitrogen loss in the form of nitrate (57 %). This figure contrast with that reported for other pristine tropical and humid catchments where nitrogen export is mainly in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen. In particular, nitrate is mainly mobilized during stormflow conditions (from 52 % to 80 % of the annual yield). Contrastingly, most of the dissolved organic carbon export occurs during baseflow conditions (from 40 to 70 % of the annual yield). These results point to a decoupling between soil nitrification and nutrient uptake by biota, which brings about the leaking of nitrate to the stream. Hydrochemistry in this Mediterranean intermittent stream is highly variable within and in between years. The antecedent moisture conditions and the magnitude of storm events are key factors on shaping the hydrological responses to storm events. However, storm episodes that occur during similar climatological and hydrological conditions produce different streamwater chemistry depending upon the time of the year. This is so, mainly because of the influence of the summer drought period on streamwater chemistry. Both, the mixing model (EMMA) and the spectral analysis approaches, point out that groundwater is the most important contributor to stormflow in Fuirosos. Nonetheless, the EMMA approach emphasizes how stream water and nitrate sources vary throughout the year. Our results stress the importance of sampling storms during all seasons to draw general conclusions about watershed processes. The mixing model shows that nitrate is retained by biota in the Fuirosos <b>alluvial</b> <b>zone</b> only when streamflow is lower than 80 l/s. Above this threshold, the system is not efficient in retaining nitrate arriving from the catchment. This result might be keep on mind when establishing the importance of near- and in-stream processes for regulating catchment nitrate loads since a major fraction of the annual nitrate export usually occurs during stormflow conditions in many catchments. The spectral analysis also shows that the variability of stream nitrate concentrations is more damped in Fuirosos than in Grimola. This is attributed to the buffer effect that biota has on nitrate concentrations in the Fuirosos <b>alluvial</b> <b>zone,</b> which retards its delivery in relation to the Grimola catchment. "Efecte de les pluges en la dinàmica del nitrogen en una riera intermitent i mediterrània" La quantitat de nitrogen dissolt que arriba avui dia als nostres rius i aqüífers és substancialment major a la de fa un parell de dècades a resultes de l'activitat antròpica. Aquest fet ha estimulat força la recerca dels processos relacionats amb el ciclatge del nitrogen, amb la intenció d'esbrinar la capacitat que tenen els ecosistemas terrestres i aquàtics per controlar les càrregues de nitrat que els hi arriben. Alguns d'aquests estudis indiquen que durant les tempestes s'altera de forma substancial la química de l'aigua del riu. Això no obstant, la major part dels treballs realitzats es recolzen en un nombre limitat d'episodis, donada la dificultat inherent al mostreig intensiu de camp a l'hora d'estudiar les respostes hidrològiques i la dinàmica dels soluts durant les crescudes. Tradicionalment, la comunitat científica s'ha dedicat a l'estudi dels processos hidrobiogeoquímics de regions temperades i tropicals, i desafortunadament, les conques Mediterrànies no han estat objecte de la seva atenció. Estudis recents alerten de la fragilitat de les regions Mediterrànies enfront del canvi global, i per tant, urgeixen els estudis focalitzats en aquests ecosistemes. El principal objectiu d'aquesta tesi ha estat l'estudi de la variabilitat de la dinàmica dels nutrients, en particular del nitrogen, durant les crescudes en relació a la seva dinàmica en condicions de cabal basal en una riera intermitent, Fuirosos, en una conca Mediterrània. La hidrologia i la dinàmica dels soluts a la riera de Fuirosos s'ha comparat amb les de la Grimola, un dels seus efluents més importants. Hi ha diferències litològiques notables entre les dues conques. A més la riera de Fuirosos té zona al. luvial i està flanquejada per un bosc de ribera ben desenvolupat, mentre que la riera de Grimola no té zona al. luvial ni tampoc una zona riberenca ben diferenciada. Per tant, els efectes de (i) la mida de la conca, (ii) la litologia, i (iii) la presència d'una zona al. luvial i riberenca sobre la hidrobiogeoquímica d'un riu, van poder ésser contrastats comparant les rieres de Fuirosos i Grimola. L'estudi es va realitzar al Parc Natural del Montnegre-Corredor al Vallès Oriental entre els anys 1998 i 2004. </i...|$|E
40|$|The city of La Plata, Argentina, is {{situated}} in a low <b>alluvial</b> <b>zone,</b> with streams having insufficient drainage into the Río de la Plata estuary. In April 2013, a prodigious storm front caused unprecedented flooding {{in the city and}} environs that resulted in extensive loss of life and property, especially in the Del Gato stream basin. Through an analysis of water quality and the conditions of the habitat {{on the basis of the}} macroinvertebrates present as bioindicators of environmental quality, this work aims to contribute to a reevaluation of the role of the marshes adjacent to the stream as flood-alleviation elements, and then propose alternatives for flooding management in the basin. Consequently, quantitative seasonal samples of vegetation, sediments, and benthic organic matter were taken and limnologic parameters measured in three sectors of the basin having different land uses: rural, periurban, and urban-industrial. The macroinvertebrate assemblages, as analyzed through the application of ecological indices, exhibited a marked decline in richness and in the Pampean Biotic Index towards the low-lying basin. Principal-components analysis associated Site 1 with the dissolved-oxygen concentration, Site 2 with high nitrate values, and Site 3 with oxygen demands. Redundancy analysis indicated a positive relationship between Baetidae and Aeolosomatidae with the dissolved-oxygen concentration and between Enchytraeidae and Stratiomyidae with the conductivity. These marshes are fundamental in maintaining good environmental conditions and attenuating the effects of the flooding that is predicted to become increasingly catastrophic in this region as the climate changes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGroundwater samples {{collected}} {{along the}} flow {{path in the}} North China Plain (NCP) were analyzed for the rare earth elements (REEs), {{as well as other}} elements (Fe, Mn, Ba). Results showed that the concentration of total REEs gradually decreased from alluvia fans (<b>Zone</b> I), through <b>alluvial</b> plain (<b>Zone</b> II), to the coastal area (Zone III), which is likely controlled by contaminants due to human activities. Distribution patterns of REEs are different between Zone I and Zone II, while the distribution pattern of REEs in Zone III {{is similar to that of}} Zone II. The distribution patterns of REEs in the different zones may be affected by redox conditions, pH, hydraulic characteristics in the groundwater, and mineral composition of the aquifer sediments...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the high}} {{sensitivity}} of polar regions {{to climate change}} and the strong influence of temperature upon ecosystem processes, contemporary understanding of water temperature dynamics in Arctic river systems is limited. This research gap was addressed by exploring high-resolution water column thermal regimes for glacier-fed and non-glacial rivers at eight sites across Svalbard during the 2010 melt season. Mean water column temperatures in glacier-fed rivers (0. 3 - 3. 2 °C) were lowest and least variable near the glacier terminus but increased downstream (0. 7 - 2. 3 °C km). Non-glacial rivers, where discharge was sourced primarily from snowmelt runoff, were warmer (mean: 2. 9 - 5. 7 °C) and more variable, indicating increased water residence times in shallow <b>alluvial</b> <b>zones</b> and increased potential for atmospheric influence. Mean summer water temperature and the magnitude of daily thermal variation {{were similar to those}} of some Alaskan Arctic rivers but low at all sites when compared with alpine glacierized environments at lower latitudes. Thermal regimes were correlated strongly (p< 0. 01) with incoming short-wave radiation, air temperature, and river discharge. Principal drivers of thermal variability were inferred to be (i) water source (i. e. glacier melt, snowmelt, groundwater); (ii) exposure time to the atmosphere; (iii) prevailing meteorological conditions; (iv) river discharge; (v) runoff interaction with permafrost and buried ice; and (vi) basin-specific geomorphological features (e. g. channel morphology). These results provide insight into the potential changes in high-latitude river systems in the context of projected warming in polar regions. We hypothesize that warmer and more variable temperature regimes may prevail in the future as the proportion of bulk discharge sourced from glacial meltwater declines and rivers undergo a progressive shift towards snow water and groundwater sources. Importantly, such changes could have implications for aquatic species diversity and abundance and influence rates of ecosystem functioning in high-latitude river systems...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} for using multiple remote sensing techniques to identify archaeological features buried beneath vegetation. The research is carried out on data acquired by the Natural Environmental Research Council (henceforth NERC), who have provided multispectral, LIght Detection and Ranging (henceforth LİDAR) and high resolution colour aerial photographic data. The returns from these techniques are compared with ground-based geophysical survey data {{carried out by the}} Landscape Research Centre (henceforth LRC) on four major projects funded by English Heritage (henceforth EH), as well as aerial photographs collected by the LRC. The methodology adopted for this research uses primarily qualitative techniques, where images from different forms of remote sensing are processed, georeferenced and then compared for their ability to identify archaeological features. A process has been developed where the returns from each form of remote sensing are interpreted and then digitised as vector polygons with individual database entries for each polygon, which allows a direct comparison between the different datasets to be conducted. The timing of the data acquisition is shown to be critical if the data is to be used for small scale anomaly detection, {{as is the case with}} archaeological features. This is particularly true for airborne sensors, although the returns from ground-based geophysical surveys can also be affected if carried out under unfavourable circumstances. It was established that the different underlying drift geologies of the Vale of Pickering also affected the returns from remote sensing sources, with the calcareous and sandy zones of the southern part of the research area generally (though not exclusively) providing better results than the more <b>alluvial</b> <b>zones</b> to the north. The use of different forms of airborne remote sensing and geophysical survey are demonstrated to be complementary, with each form of remote sensing identifying different, though not always exclusively different, archaeological anomalies...|$|R
