25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

Thomas wrote to The Times: [...] "I desire to express my extreme regret at the announcement that Prince Louis of Battenberg has, by his resignation, pandered to the most mean and contemptible slander I have ever known ... I was simply astounded to hear the base suggestions and rumours current, and I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> his action will simply be looked upon as a triumph for the mean and miserable section of people, who, at a time of national trial, is ever ready to pass a foul lie from lip to lip without a tittle of evidence."

500|$|On 8 February, ZANLA cadres at Connemara Barracks in Gwelo {{surprised}} their ZIPRA counterparts, killed over 60 of {{them and}} forced the rest to flee into the bush. When the ZIPRA portion of the 13th Infantry Battalion, based at Glenville Camp near Entumbane, learned of this later in the day, it waited until its instructors from the British Army left in the evening, then attacked its ZANLA comrades, killing 12 {{of them and}} scattering the rest. Charged with restoring order, McKenna sent Devine's armoured cars and D Company, 1RAR, commanded by the American Lieutenant Dave Hill, to Glenville. Arriving late in the evening, the Elands drove into the camp and flattened the ZIPRA tents, killing many of the occupants and {{clearing the way for}} Hill's troops. Taken totally by surprise, the ZIPRA troops put up little resistance; 40 were killed and many more captured, including two officers, Captains Mpofu and Dlamini. On the morning of 9 February, the British instructors were bewildered to find the ZANLA half of their unit gone, and the remaining ZIPRA men squatting in rows in 1RAR captivity. [...] "What happened?" [...] asked the British sergeant. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> while you were away, your battalion fell apart," [...] replied McKenna.|$|E
500|$|Today I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> fish in most {{of those}} rivers are {{virtually}} extinct. Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the Exchange Station and {{looks down at the}} noisome black water which flows beneath him would find it difficult to believe that any fish, or any other living creature, could ever have lived in what the Manchester Guardian has so rightly called that [...] "melancholy stream"... I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should like to read. The first says: [...] "The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal." [...] The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is: [...] "There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold." [...] The full importance of that statement will be realised when I remind hon. Members of the frequency with which residents in Bacup, Ramsbottom, Manchester and Salford are subjected to flooding from the waters of the Irwell.|$|E

It was no secret that he had been having kidney trouble for some time, but I am sure that on top of this, Lester Hunt, a much more sensitive soul than his colleagues realized, just could not bear the thought of having his son's misfortunes become the subject of whispers in his re-election campaign." [...] In private, he confirmed that Hunt had no serious health problem and wrote in his diary that [...] "Unfortunately I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> the morals charge against his son and the experience Hunt suffered was the main factor." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, Morley {{wrote to}} Auberon Herbert, an extreme {{opponent}} of state intervention, that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> I {{do not agree}} with you as to paternal government. I am no partisan of a policy of incessant meddling with individual freedom, but I do strongly believe that in so populous a society as ours now is, you may well have a certain protection thrown over classes {{of men and women who}} are unable to protect themselves". In 1885 Morley spoke out against those Liberals who believed that all state intervention was wrong and proclaimed: [...] "I am not prepared to allow that the Liberty and the Property Defence League are the only people with a real grasp of Liberal principles, that Lord Bramwell and the Earl of Wemyss are the only Abdiels of the Liberal Party". Later that year Morley defined his politics: [...] "I am a cautious Whig by temperament, I am a Liberal by training, and I am a thorough Radical by observation and experience".|$|E
2500|$|After the Second World War, three {{officers}} of the Indian National Army (INA), General Shah Nawaz Khan, Colonel Prem Sahgal and Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon were put on trial at the Red Fort in Delhi for [...] "waging war against the King Emperor", i.e., the British sovereign personifying British rule. The three defendants were defended at the trial by Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai and others. Outside the fort, the trials inspired protests and discontent among the Indian population, many of whom came to view the defendants as revolutionaries who had fought for their country. In January 1946 British airmen stationed in India {{took part in the}} Royal Air Force Revolt of 1946 mainly over the slow speed of their demobilisation, but also in some cases issuing demands against being used in support of continued British colonial rule. The Viceroy at the time, Lord Wavell, noted that the actions of the British airmen had influenced both the RIAF and RIN mutinies, commenting [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> [...] example of the Royal Air Force, who got away with what was really a mutiny, has some responsibility for the present situation." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the next}} few years, Huan largely spent his effort in {{securing}} his power, as he invited many capable people to join his staff, including Xie An, Wang Tanzhi (王坦之), Chi Chao (郗超), Wang Xun (王珣), and Xie Xuan (謝玄). [...] He did not carry out another northern campaign, apparently not willing to face the capable Former Yan general Murong Ke in battle. [...] (Indeed, when Murong Ke's brother, the Former Yan emperor Murong Jun died in 360 and was succeeded by his young son Murong Wei, contrary to the optimism that many Jin officials had that with Murong Jun {{out of the way}} that Former Yan would be weakened, Huan commented, [...] "Murong Ke is still alive, and I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> we have an even greater problem.") [...] In 364, Emperor Ai, who succeeded Emperor Mu in 361, suffered a poisoning after taking pills given to him by magicians in search of immortality, and Huan was initially summoned to the capital to serve as regent, but a second order was then issued him cancelling that summon. [...] Instead, he set up his base at Zheqi (赭圻, in modern Wuhu, Anhui) and monitored the situation at Jiankang remotely.|$|E
2500|$|This {{prohibition}} {{also was}} (and in many circles, still is) commonly understood to disallow operating electrical switches. One reason is that, when actuating electromechanical switches that carry a live current, {{there is always}} the possibility that a small electric spark will be generated. [...] This spark may {{be thought of as a}} kind of fire, although since it is incidental and one does not benefit from it, it may not be a Sabbath violation at all. In any case, as science became more advanced, and the properties of fire and electricity became better understood, the former reasoning broke down: fire is a chemical reaction involving the release of energy; the flow of an electric current is a physical reaction. Therefore, some hold that the proper reason it is forbidden to complete electric circuits is because it involves construction or building (i.e., the building and completion of an electric circuit—see above). Rav Aurbach, a leading and widely accepted ultra-orthodox posek declined this argument comparing it to saying that you cannot shut a door, as it will effectively be completing a wall. He wrote, [...] "In my opinion there is no prohibition [...] on Shabbat or Yom Tov... There is no prohibition of ma'keh bepatish or molid... (However, I [...] <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> the masses will err and turn on incandescent lights on Shabbat, and thus I do not permit electricity absent great need...) ... This matter requires further analysis. ... However, the key point in my opinion is that there is no prohibition to use electricity on Shabbat unless the electricity causes a prohibited act like cooking or starting a flame." ...|$|E

The courier started shouting, [...] "This man destroyed my document!" [...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished your mission, why do you still need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|E

[...] Li Kui {{continued}} to serve as minister of rites, but the powerful chancellor Lu Qi was jealous of his reputation and seniority. [...] In 783, after the emissary of the Tibetan Empire Qujiazan (區頰贊) arrived in Chang'an to negotiate a border realignment treaty with Tang and after the treaty was completed, at Lu's instigation, Emperor Dezong made Li Kui emissary to the Tibetan Empire to escort Qujiazan back to the Tibetan Empire. [...] Li Kui, then 72, stated to Emperor Dezong, [...] "I do not fear going that far a distance, but I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> I would die on the way and not complete my task." [...] Emperor Dezong, who was saddened by the remarks, told Lu, [...] "Li Kui is too old." [...] Lu responded, [...] "An emissary to a far-away foreign state {{needs to have a}} good reputation. [...] Further, if Li Kui, who is this old, is sent as an emissary, then in the future, no official younger than Li Kui would dare to refuse such a task." [...] When Li Kui got to the Tibetan Empire, its king Trisong Detsen asked, [...] "I heard that there is a Li Kui who is the most able of officials in Tang. [...] Are you that person, lord?" [...] Li Kui was afraid that this meant that Trisong Detsen intended to detain him, and therefore responded, [...] "That Li Kui would never be willing to come here." [...] On his way of returning from the Tibetan Empire in 784, he died at Feng Prefecture (鳳州, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi).

[...] Her great-grandfather Yang Shida (楊士達) was a high -level official during Sui and {{had been given the}} title Prince of Zheng (鄭王). [...] Her father Yang Zhiqing (楊知慶) was a general of the imperial guards during Tang. [...] At the time that Consort Yang Guipin was pregnant with Li Sisheng, Li Longji was locked in a power struggle with his aunt, Emperor Ruizong's sister Princess Taiping, and it was said that Princess Taiping had placed many associates in the crown prince's palace to spy on Li Longji and that she did not want him to have many sons. [...] (He already had two by that point—Li Sisheng's older brothers Li Sizhi, later named Li Cong (by Consort Liu) and Li Siqian, later named Li Ying (by Consort Zhao).) [...] Li Longji was worried that, if Princess Taiping found out that Yang Guipin was pregnant, Princess Taiping's associates might harm him, and he spoke to a close associate, Zhang Shuo, stating: [...] "A powerful individual did not want me to have many sons. [...] I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> this woman would become a target. [...] What do you think?" [...] Li Longji began to prepare an herbal stew that, in traditional Chinese medicine, was believed to be able to induce an abortion, but as he did so, fell asleep and had a dream that a god descended and overturned the ding holding the stew. [...] When he told Zhang this as well, Zhang responded, [...] "This is heaven's will. [...] You should not worry."
