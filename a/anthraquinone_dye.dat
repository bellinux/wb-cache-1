40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the understanding of}} natural dyes and the work necessary for analysis of historical textiles. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction into the background of historical dyeing, the methods used to extract these natural dye compounds used and how synthetic dyes overtook natural dyes in the commercial world of dyeing. Chapter 2 introduces and discusses the research undertaken with one particular natural dyeing plant, Rubia tinctorum (common madder). Dyeing studies were all performed on wool, and explore the dyeing properties of the madder plant. Dyeing studies with pre-mordanting and post-mordanting were undertaken. Chapter 3 explores the extraction of natural dyes from Rubia tinctorum and their identification. Extraction and analysis studies were conducted to obtain the ideal method for acquiring glycosidic <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dye</b> molecules {{that could be used}} in the dyeing process. Chapter 4 focuses on identifying new methods to successfully remove glycosidic <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dye</b> compounds from wool fibres dyed with Rubia tinctorum, whilst keeping their chemical structure intact.

In the presented work some copper complexes were prepared by immobilization of Cu (II) on a chitosan matrix. The oxidation of model textile dye ANTD (<b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dye)</b> catalyzed with hydrogen peroxide by these Cu complexes has been investigated. The reactivity of catalysts was dependent on the amount of the copper on the complex and the hydrogen peroxide in the reaction solution. The kinetics of ANTD oxidation was studied. Decolourisation efficiencies of four different complexes prepared were compared. The re-usability will be also study. In the best reaction conditions the <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dye</b> decolourisation was over 95 %. The re-usability of immobilized complexes has also studied.

40|$|Commercial dyes are not uniformly {{susceptible}} to microbial attack in conventional aerobic treatment {{because of their}} unique and stable chemical structures. Three synthetic dyes with typical chromophores (anthraquinone, azo and indigo) were decolorized by a white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor. The responsible enzyme for dye decomposition was laccase, an extracellular oxidase released by the fungus under the conditions of slow growth or in its stationary phase. The mechanism of laccase-catalyzed dye decomposition, however, was different depending on dye structures. <b>Anthraquinone</b> <b>dye</b> was an enzyme substrate that was directly oxidized by laccase while decolorization of azo and indigo dyes involved some small molecule (< 8 kDa) metabolites. It was demonstrated that azo and indigo dyes were not the substrates of laccase and the small molecule metabolites mediated {{the interaction between the}} dyes and the enzyme. The decolorization rate of the nonsubstrate dyes was actually limited by the concentration of mediating compounds rather than laccase activity in the solutions. Some synthetic compounds such as 2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylthiazoline- 6 -sulfonate) or ABTS and <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dye</b> could also mediate the decolorization of azo and indigo dyes. The mediating function of ABTS and <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dye</b> was quantitatively compared in the decomposition of two nonsubstrate dyes. This fact implies that the laccase-substrate dyes in an industrial effluent can promote the decolorization of those nonsubstrate dyes. Effluent decolorization, therefore, may not be limited by the small molecule metabolites which are not produced in large amount by fungus in most industrial effluents. A laccase-catalyzed and mediator-involved dye degradation mechanism is proposed For further kinetic studies. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{burning of}} aerial {{pyrotechnic}} devices poses {{a public health}} risk as chemicals may be released into the water supply from solid fallout and surface water runoff. In the case of colored smoke signals, the risk is especially high because many colored smoke formulations contain highly toxic dyes that are not consumed by the key reduction-oxidation reaction. For the M 194 yellow smoke hand held signal (HHS), the current in-service formulation contains two toxic <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dyes,</b> namely benzanthrone and vat yellow 4 (VY 4). To minimize {{the environmental impact of}} the M 194 yellow smoke formulation, the present study aimed to replace the <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dyes</b> with the more environmentally sustainable solvent yellow 33 (SY 33). SY 33, a quinoline dye that is currently used in colored smoke grenade production, has been deemed admissible by the U. S. Army Public Health Command (PHC).

40|$|Both {{inorganic}} {{and organic}} compounds, such as oxides or salts of metals and polycyclic and azo compounds, are frequently used as colorants in polymeric systems. Bismuth vanadate pigment {{has been used}} as an environmentally friendly alternative for cadmium containing pigments and anthraquinone dyes represent a polycyclic colorant class of wide use in polymers. Besides their coloring properties, both bismuth vanadate and anthraquinone present photocatalytic activity or photochemical properties that can influence the mechanism and the kinetics of the photodegradation of the polymer into which they are incorporated. In this paper the influence of bismuth vanadate pigment and <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dye</b> on the photodegradation of polycarbonate was evaluated. For this purpose, samples of polycarbonate containing the colorants were submitted to photochemical aging following the recommendations of ASTM G 53. Bismuth vanadate accelerates the photodegradation of polycarbonate, causing a faster drop in the mechanical properties and an increase in the hydroperoxide concentration during the aging process. The coloring ability of the pigment is also affected. The photodegradation behavior of polycarbonate in presence of bismuth vanadate may be caused by a possible direct chemical reaction between pigment and polymer, promoted by UV radiation. On the other hand, the presence of <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dye</b> seems to stabilize the polycarbonate against photodegradation through a deactivation mechanism of the excited state...|$|E
40|$|A set of five <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dyes</b> with bis(4 -propylphenyl) {{substituent}} groups, connected via sulfide or amine linkages at the 1, 5 -positions {{or directly}} at the 2, 6 -positions, have been studied in solution by UV-vis spectroscopy and electrochemistry, allied with density functional theory calculations of structures, electronic transitions, and redox potentials. The visible transitions and redox potentials are shown to vary with the HOMO and LUMO energies, with the variation in both color and redox stability between the dyes being attributable principally to variations in the HOMOs located mainly on the substituents and outer anthraquinone rings. The calculated molecular structures and visible transition dipole moments are shown to vary subtly with substituent, giving variations in the molecular aspect ratios, minimum moment of inertia axes, and transition dipole moment vector orientations that can rationalize the alignment trends {{reported in the literature}} for such <b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dyes</b> in liquid crystal hosts, showing why 1, 5 -disulfide and 2, 6 -diphenyl substituents give better designs than 1, 5 -diamine substituents.

40|$|Using sol-gel method, nano {{crystalline}} ZnO particles doped {{with different}} concentrations of molybdenum (Mo) and manganese (Mn) (0. 2 - 1. 0 %) were synthesized. The structural and optical properties were studied with standard analytical {{techniques such as}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-vis spectroscopy. The crystalline nature of undoped and doped ZnO is indicated by XRD analysis. The SEM images of undoped ZnO showed irregular shape while doped ZnO showed fused supramolecular structure with rough surfaces. The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized particles (ZnO doped with Mo and Mn) was tested by studying the decolorization of two different chromophoric dyes namely Direct Yellow 27 (azo dye) and Acid Blue 129 (<b>anthraquinone</b> <b>dye)</b> with a 500 W halogen linear lamp {{in the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen as a function of irradiation time.
