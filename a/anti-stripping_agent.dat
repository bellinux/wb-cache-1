40|$|In this study, the {{moisture}} sensitivity {{of different kinds}} of aggregates and bituminous binders is examined by comparing the performance between five empirical test methods for loose mixtures – static immersion test, rolling bottle test (RBT), boiling water test (BWT), total water immersion test and the ultrasonic method – with more fundamental surface energy-based test data. The RBT and BWT results showed that limestone aggregates perform better than granite aggregates and that, for unmodified binders, stiffer binders provide better moisture resistance compared with softer binder. Both tests were sensitive to aggregate type, binder type and <b>anti-stripping</b> <b>agent</b> type. Ranking of the mixtures by RBT and BWT was in general agreement with the surface energy-based tests, especially for mixtures that performed worst or best in RBT and BWT. The magnitude of the work of debonding in the presence of water was found to be aggregate type dependent which suggests the physico-chemical properties of aggregates may play a fundamental and more significant role in the generation of moisture damage, than bitumen properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{viscosity}} {{of asphalt}} decreased significantly when 0. 5 % of WMA additive was added,but it remained relatively steady as the dosage rate increased up to 3. 0 %. The reduction pattern in viscosity as the dosage rate increases was similar for both CECABASE RT® and LEADCAP at all test temperatures of 120 °C, 125 °C, 130 °C and 135 °C {{and a similar}} pattern was observed for both Sasobit® and Rediset. Based on the ABCD test device, the virgin asphalt binder PG 64 - 34 cracked at - 51. 0 °C and the PG 64 - 28 cracked at - 41. 3 °C. As the WMA additives were increased from 0. 5 %to 3. 0 %, the cracking temperatures increased slightly,but remained steady near the cracking temperature of the virgin asphalt binder. The ABCD test results confirmed that the cracking temperature of asphalt binder was not significantly affected by any of these four WMA additives. The BPN value steadily decreased as the specimen surface was abraded by a rotating rubber although the MTD value did not change significantly. The most significant change in BPN has occurred between 30 and 45 minutes of abrasion whereas no significant change was observed between 45 and 65 minutes of abrasion. The control WMA without additive exhibited the lowest Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) value of 53. 3 %, which increased to 66. 6 % with lime and 83. 5 % with an <b>Anti-stripping</b> <b>agent</b> (ASA). WMA-Sasobit exhibited 73. 7 % but it slightly decreased to 72. 7 % with lime and 72. 3 % with ASA. WMA-LEADCAP exhibited 80. 3 % but it decreased to 78. 5 % with lime and increased to 81. 4 % with ASA. The control HMA exhibited 82. 7 % and it increased to 89. 3 % with lime and 92. 6 % with ASA. It can be concluded that TSR values of both WMA-Sasobit and WMA-LEADCAP were not affected by lime or ASA. A more extensive study should be performed quantifying the temperature-viscosity relationship of asphalt mixed with varying amounts of WMA additives at different temperatures. An additional study should be performed {{on the effect of}} lime and <b>anti-stripping</b> <b>agent</b> on WMA mixtures with various additives. It is recommended that the skid test should be performed on WMA pavements in the field after several years of service...|$|E
40|$|Poisson´s ratio can {{be defined}} as the {{negative}} ratio of strains perpendicular to the load direction to the strains parallel to the loading direction. If elastic or viscoelastic models are used, Poisson´s ratio, together with elastic modulus, is a main input used to predict distresses in flexible pavement structures such as rutting and cracking. In asphalt concrete, Poisson’s ratio is commonly measured using two different testing configurations: indirect tension (IDT) and uniaxial. However, results from these two testing configuration can potentially have differences. Design methodologies such as the Mechanistic Empirical Design Guide (MEPDG, now PavementME) {{have been shown to be}} very sensitive to variations of Poisson’s ratio. The objective of this research is to determine whether or not there are significant differences between the values of Poisson’s ratio measured in indirect tension configuration and uniaxial configuration. This work also aims to investigate the potential variations of values of Poisson’s ratio among a number of asphalt mixture treated with different types of asphalt modifiers: poplyphosphoric acid (PPA) alone and in combination with liquid <b>anti-stripping</b> <b>agent</b> (LAA). Cylindrical shaped samples specified in AASHTO T 342 were used to measure Poisson’s ratio in uniaxial configuration, and disc shaped samples specified in AASHTO T 322 were used to measure Poisson’s ratio in an IDT configuration. Samples were tested at each combination at the following temperatures, - 10 C, 4 C, 21 C, 37 C, and 54 C, and frequencies, 25 Hz, 10 Hz, 5 Hz, 1 Hz, 0. 5 Hz, and 0. 1 Hz. No statistical difference was found in values of Poisson’s ratio measured within each testing configuration. IDT Poisson’s ratio were significantly different to those of uniaxial configuration (3 : 1). This reduction of Poisson’s ratio by about 60 % could lead to an increment of predicted distresses, such as longitudinal cracking, using PavementME by more than 400 % of its design limit...|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of neat asphalt and mixes can be significantly improved {{by the addition}} of polyphosphoric acid at relatively low concentrations. This approach is increasingly being used in North America to meet the high performance requirements for binders in SuperpaveTM applications. This paper discusses the effect of polyphosphoric acid in various neat asphalt binders and mixes with aggregates. Conventional rheological measurements and Superpave parameters were used to evaluate the {{properties of}} various asphalts. It was found that polyphosphoric acid increased the high-temperature Performance Grade (PG) of the neat binders with no loss of low-temperature properties. Further, moisture sensitivity testing has demonstrated superior adherence of the binders to aggregates and a dramatic reduction in the level of rutting. No adverse adhesion effects were found by the use of the polyphosphoric acid together with commercially available <b>anti-strip</b> <b>agents.</b> Another significant finding is that binders treated with polyphosphoric acid show increased resistance to oxidative aging, as measured by the pressure-aging vessel. The results demonstrate that a level of polyphosphoric acid near 0. 5 percent works well for most binders. N/...|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{determined}} that using fly ash as a mineral filler in asphalt pavements can help strengthen and reduce asphalt moisture damage. Also, dynamic shear rheometer tests show that these additives have a stiffening effect on asphalt binder. Moisture related damage {{is considered one of}} the main causes of asphalt pavement failure. As water infiltrates a layer of asphalt, it slowly strips away asphalt binder, weakening the aggregate/binder bond. This process, combined with the cyclic loading of traffic, can lead to several different types of asphalt failure including rutting, raveling, bleeding, and cracking. For several decades, research has been conducted to find a solution to this problem. Currently in practice, hydrated lime and a variety of amine-based chemicals are being used as <b>anti-stripping</b> <b>agents.</b> However, as an emphasis towards sustainability has increased, waste products are now being investigated for this purpose. This thesis investigated the anti-stripping effectiveness of two waste products: fly ash and cement kiln dust (CKD), and compared them with hydrated lime and an amine-based chemical additive. The results indicate that class C fly ash can be used as an asphalt anti-stripping additive; however it is more costly than lime or amine chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{environmental}} and compaction benefits of warm mix asphalt (WMA), several researchers have expressed concerns over laboratory and field performances of WMA mixes. In this study, {{a wide range of}} laboratory tests, namely, dynamic modulus, creep compliance, fatigue, moisture damage, and rutting, was conducted to evaluate the performance of different types of WMA mixes. For this purpose, three WMA mixes, consisting of one mix produced using a zeolite-based WMA additive (containing water), one surface course mix, and one base course mix, the latter two produced with a chemical-based WMA additive with surfactant technology, were collected from different field projects in Texas. In addition, three hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixes with aggregate gradations {{similar to those of the}} collected WMA mixes were produced in the laboratory to compare the performance of WMA and HMA mixes. Overall, the WMA mixes yielded lower stiffness, reduced potential of low-temperature cracking, lower fatigue resistance, and a higher rutting potential compared with their HMA counterparts. However, a mixed trend of moisture-induced damage potential was observed for WMA and HMA mixes, when evaluated using retained tensile strength ratio (TSR) and stripping inflection point (SIP) obtained from the Hamburg wheel tracking (HWT) test. In other words, no correlation was found between TSR and SIP values, indicating that passing a TSR test does not guarantee better performance of a mix when tested using an HWT. The results from this study reveal that performance of a WMA mix widely depends on the technology and the type of other additives (e. g. <b>anti-stripping</b> <b>agent)</b> used. The findings of this study are expected to be useful to pavement professionals to better understand the performance of WMA mixes and to develop a database of input parameters for the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Civil EngineeringMustaque HossainA Superpave asphalt {{mixture with}} 4. 75 -mm nominal maximum {{aggregate}} size (NMAS) is a promising, low-cost pavement preservation treatment for {{agencies such as}} the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT). The objective of this research study is to develop an optimized 4. 75 -mm NMAS Superpave mixture in Kansas. In addition, the study evaluated the residual tack coat application rate for the 4. 75 -mm NMAS mix overlay. Two, hot-in-place recycling (HIPR) projects in Kansas, on US- 160 and K- 25, were overlaid with a 15 - to 19 -mm thick layer of 4. 75 -mm NMAS Superpave mixture in 2007. The field tack coat application rate was measured during construction. Cores were collected from each test section for Hamburg wheel tracking device (HWTD) and laboratory bond tests performed after construction and after one year in service. Test results showed no significant effect of the tack coat application rate on the rutting performance of rehabilitated pavements. The number of wheel passes to rutting failure observed during the HWTD test was dependent on the aggregate source as well as on in-place density of the cores. Laboratory pull-off tests showed that most cores were fully bonded at the interface of the 4. 75 -mm NMAS overlay and the HIPR layer, regardless of the tack application rate. The failure mode during pull-off tests at the HMA interface was highly dependent on the aggregate source and mix design of the existing layer material. This study also confirmed that overlay construction with a high tack coat application rate may result in bond failure at the HMA interface. Twelve different 4. 75 -mm NMAS mix designs were developed using materials from the aforementioned but two binder grades and three different percentages of natural (river) sand. Laboratory performance tests were conducted to assess mixture performance. Results show that rutting and moisture damage potential in the laboratory depend on aggregate type irrespective of binder grade. <b>Anti-stripping</b> <b>agent</b> affects moisture sensitivity test results. Fatigue performance is significantly influenced by river sand content and binder grade. Finally, an optimized 4. 75 -mm NMAS mixture design was developed and verified based on statistical analysis of performance data...|$|E
40|$|Economic, {{environmental}} and engineering benefits promote the rapid implementation of WMA technologies. However, concerns remain based {{on changes in}} the production process {{that may lead to}} moisture susceptibility in the early life as compared to HMA. To evaluate WMA moisture susceptibility during this critical period, standard laboratory tests were used for three field projects each with an HMA control mixtures and multiple WMA mixtures. Different specimen types were also evaluated to capture differences in mix design, quality control/quality assurance, and field performance. Specimens were evaluated for moisture susceptibility by Indirect Tensile (IDT) Strength, Resilient Modulus (MR) and Hamburg Wheel-Track Testing (HWTT). Specimens for IDT and MR were tested dry and then tested wet after conditioning as described in AASHTO T 283 with one freeze-thaw cycle. HWTT was used to assess both moisture susceptibility and rutting potential under repeated loads in the presence of water at elevated temperatures (i. e., 122 ?F [50 ?C]), and the output parameters used for evaluation were the calculated Stripping Inflection Point (SIP) and the rut depth at 5000 load cycles. Based on the results of the laboratory tests performed on PMFC cores acquired at construction and with time, WMA during its early life exhibited inferior moisture resistance when compared to HMA. However, with time, specifically after one summer, the dry and wet properties of WMA became equivalent to those of HMA. For WMA constructed in the fall, the results from this study suggest that the inclusion of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) or an <b>anti-stripping</b> <b>agent</b> may alleviate possible moisture susceptibility issues in the early life during wet, winter weather conditions. While some laboratory test results demonstrated that WMA is more moisture susceptible than HMA, field performance reported to date from the three projects used in this study shows no evidence of moisture damage. Therefore the search for a laboratory test to screen mixtures for moisture susceptibility continues. An alternative approach, applying Griffith crack growth theory and utilizing IDT, MR and air voids% the adhesive bond energy of asphalt mixtures was calculated for Texas field project. This value holds promise for characterizing performance of asphalt mixtures by considering basic properties and grouping into one representative value...|$|E

This study aimed to enhance asphalt quality and improve asphalt-concrete mechanical characteristics, in particular, thermal resistance. The proposed modification was achieved by adding special products and agents. These additives included polymers and <b>anti-stripping</b> <b>agents.</b> By using this new technology, {{we were able to}} enhance the characteristics of asphalt to make it able to withstand the stresses of fatigue. The asphalt was also able to sustain thermal stress resulting from the large margin of difference between maximum and minimum seasonal temperature in that area. The new technology also resulted in the reduction of the permanent deformation and rutting of the asphalt. After many laboratory tests, we decided to use a combination of two different additives at certain percentages. With this new Job Mix Formula, we were able to obtain loss in heating of 0. 3 %, a softening point of 53 °C, loss in penetration of 39 % of the original, and a ductility of more than 100 cm.

40|$|Warm mix asphalt (WMA) {{represents}} a suitable technology to enhance environmental sustainability of road paving. WMA is an asphalt concrete {{that can be}} produced and compacted at lower temperatures than usual. The additional inclusion of recycled aggregates (e. g. steel slags) in substitution of natural ones is a widespread solution effectively leading to further environmental benefits. In this sense, the assessment of moisture susceptibility could delineate an interesting investigation topic since some issues related to bitumen-steel slags chemical affinity were evinced. Given this background, the present paper shows an experimental characterization aimed at investigating moisture susceptibility of WMA containing electric arc furnace steel slags through a multi-scale analysis approach. In particular, a chemical additive containing <b>anti-stripping</b> <b>agents</b> and adhesion promoters was used to obtain warm mixes. To achieve the above-mentioned goal, stripping tests were performed on bitumen-aggregate systems and analyzed with a digital imaging processing method. Moreover, warm asphalt mixes were subjected to freeze-thawing procedures in order to study the water effects on stiffness characteristics and indirect tensile strengths. A reference unmodified binder and traditional natural aggregates (limestone) were also tested for comparison purposes. Experimental results showed analog trends both at bitumen-aggregate and mixture scale, demonstrating that warm modification by chemical additive is a promising technology able to prevent stripping problems mitigating issues related to bitumen-steel slags affinity...|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{damage in}} asphalt {{pavements}} {{is a complex}} phenomenon affected {{by a variety of}} factors, and has not been fully understood, with major knowledge gaps in three areas: major factors contributing to moisture damage in the field, appropriate laboratory test procedures, and the effectiveness of treatments. Both field and laboratory investigations were performed in this study to provide additional information in these three areas. Statewide condition survey and field sampling were conducted to identify factors contributing to moisture damage, other than aggregate source. Statistical analysis revealed that air-void content, pavement structure, cumulative rainfall, mix type (DGAC vs RAC-G), use of anti-strip additive (lime or liquid), and pavement age significantly affect the extent of moisture damage. Laboratory experiments revealed that high air-void contents not only allow more moisture to enter mixes, but also significantly reduce the fatigue resistance of mixes in wet conditions. Less than optimum binder contents also reduce the moisture resistance of asphalt mixes under repeated loading. The effectiveness of the Hamburg Wheel Tracking Device (HWTD) test to determine moisture sensitivity of asphalt mixes was evaluated by testing both laboratory-fabricated specimens and field cores. It was found that the test can correctly identify the effect of anti-strip additives; its results generally correlate with field performance except that the test may sometimes fail mixes that perform well in the field and, in a very few cases, provide false positive results. A fatigue-based test procedure for evaluating moisture sensitivity was explored in this study. A test procedure was developed for comparative evaluation of different mixes. Application of the test procedure for use in pavement analysis/design is suggested for expensive projects.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. With the {{implementation}} of mechanistic-empirical pavement design methods, dynamic modulus (|E*|) has become the predominant characteristic of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) used as the elastic modulus in the computation of stresses and strains in pavement structures. The predictions of |E*| obtained with the Witczak models currently used in the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) do not account for some HMA characteristics such as polymer modified binders, fibers, confinement and aging effects related to climatic conditions. Therefore, development of models more representative of local materials and conditions are desirable. In this study, a predictive model for dynamic modulus of HMA was developed taking into consideration several HMA characteristics and testing conditions. 6821 observations of 257 mix specimens from three different laboratory datasets, two from Hawaii and one from Costa Rica, were used to estimate the model parameters. All three data sets contain information about some variables in common such as air voids, binder content, and gradation; however, some datasets contain mix characteristics and testing conditions not available in other datasets such as confinement level, available only in the Hawaiian datasets, {{and the number of}} freeze-thaw cycles, available only in the Costa Rican dataset. Important characteristics observed from these datasets include confinement, number of freeze-thaw cycles, binder modifiers (SBS polymers) and mixture additives (e. g. fibers and <b>anti-stripping</b> <b>agents),</b> all of which together with other commonly used variables were found to have statistically significant effects. The model was developed by using joint estimation and mixed-effects techniques. Joint estimation allowed the identification of model parameters available from only some of the databases and the determination of bias parameters. It also resulted in more efficient parameter estimates. The mixed-effects approach was used to account for unobserved heterogeneities between samples. Using these approaches, together with proper consideration of heteroscedasticity, allowed the estimation of a comprehensive statistical predictive model that satisfies closely all the regression assumptions and that provides accurate values of |E*| for Hawaiian and Costa Rican conditions for any combination of temperature and frequency. These can be used to generate the |E*| inputs that the MEPDG needs to compute |E*| master curves...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 In 1987, Congress {{authorized}} a 5 year 150 {{million dollar}} research program called the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP). SHRP {{was divided into}} four major areas, including the asphalt research program. The asphalt research program was divided into six major research contracts, one such contract, SHRP- 003 A was called Performance Related Testing and Measuring of Asphalt Aggregate Interaction and Mixtures. Oregon State University performed the portion of this contract related to the development and validation of accelerated test procedures for aging, low temperature cracking, and moisture sensitivity of asphalt-aggreagte mixtures. This thesis contains five independent papers that discuss elements of the development, validation, and or implementation of these accelerated test procedures. In the first paper, the relationship between field performance and laboratory aging properties of asphalt-aggregate mixtures is discussed, including {{the relative importance of}} asphalt binder and aggregate type on the amount of aging experience. Based on this work recommended aging procedures are presented to simulate different environmental conditions and pavement age. The second paper makes use of the large body of resilient modulus data conducted as part of the SHRP research effort to compare data obtain in the diametral and the triaxial mode. It is not possible to give a relationship between triaxial and diametral resilient modulus, without describing specimen geometry and other test conditions. The third paper discusses the effect of aging on the thermal cracking properties of asphalt-aggregate mixtures. The temperature at which aging occurs affects the way cold temperature fracture properties change with time. Low temperatures result in quenching of the aging process, while high temperatures result in continued aging. The fourth paper discusses work conducted in association with the Oregon Department of Transportation to extend the environmental conditioning system (ECS) test procedure for moisture assessment to open graded mixtures. Comparison in the ECS of mixtures with and without <b>anti-strip</b> <b>agents</b> added indicates that they don't always decrease moisture damage potential.

40|$|Performance {{of asphalt}} {{mixtures}} {{depends on the}} properties of its constituent materials, mixture volumetrics, and external factors such as load and environment. An important material property that influences the performance of an asphalt mixture is the surface free energy of the asphalt binder and the aggregate. Surface free energy, which is a thermodynamic material property, {{is directly related to}} the adhesive bond energy between the asphalt binder and the aggregate as well as the cohesive bond energy of the asphalt binder. This thermodynamic material property has been successfully used to select asphalt binders and aggregates that have the necessary compatibility to form strong bonds and resist fracture. Surface free energy, being based on thermodynamics, assumes the asphalt binder is a brittle elastic material. In reality, the asphalt binder is not brittle and dissipates energy during loading and unloading. The total work of fracture is the culmination of all energy inputted into the sample to create two new surfaces of unit area and is dependent on the test geometry and testing conditions (e. g., temperature, loading rate, specimen size, etc.). The magnitude of the bond energy (either adhesive or cohesive) can be much smaller in magnitude when compared to the total work of fracture measured using mechanical tests (i. e., peel test, pull-off test, etc.). Despite the large difference in magnitude, there exists evidence in the literature supporting the use of the bond energy to characterize the resistance of composite systems to cohesive and/or adhesive failures. If the bond energy is to be recognized as a useful screening tool by the paving industry, the relationship between the bond energy and total work of fracture needs to be understood and verified. The effect of different types of modifications (addition of polymers, addition of <b>anti-strip</b> <b>agents,</b> and aging) on the surface free energy components of various asphalt binders was explored in order to understand how changes in the surface free energy components are related to the performance of the asphalt mixtures. After the asphalt binder-aggregate combination was explored, the next step was to study how the surface free energy of water was affected by contact with the asphalt binder-aggregate interface. Aggregates, which have a pH of greater than seven, will cause the pH of water that contacts them to increase. A change in the pH of the contacting water could indicate a change in its overall surface free energy, which might subsequently increase or decrease the water's moisture damage potential. With surface free energy fully explored, the total work of fracture was measured using pull-off tests for asphalt binder-aggregate combinations with known surface free energy components. In order to fully explore the relationship between bond energy and total work of fracture, temperature, loading rate, specimen geometry, and moisture content were varied in the experiments. The results of this work found that modifications made to the asphalt binder can have significant positive or negative effects on its surface free energy components and bond energy. Moreover, the results from the pull-off tests demonstrated that a relationship exists between bond energy (from surface free energy) and total work of fracture (from pull-off tests), and that surface free energy can be used to estimate the performance of asphalt binder-aggregate combinations...|$|R
