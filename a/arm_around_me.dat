500|$|Peel, having {{concluded}} that the suspension would end his Yorkshire career, signed a contract to play for Accrington Cricket Club. He told a newspaper that he regarded his suspension as unfair, {{that he had been}} given no opportunity to explain, and that he had taken the appointment with Accrington to provide for himself and his family. In 1900, he told Cricket magazine that, before his suspension, he had been bedridden for three weeks {{as a result of an}} injury he suffered while batting, that he played against Middlesex with some success and was then suspended without any explanation. He later said of the incident: [...] " [...] put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and escorted me off the field and out of Yorkshire cricket. What a gentleman". The journalist Harry Pearson suggests that this was [...] "either very gracious, or exceedingly sarcastic." [...] Hawke later described Peel's sacking as [...] "the most decisive action of my whole career... It had to be done for the sake of discipline and the good of cricket. Nothing ever gave me so much pain." [...] At the time, Hawke believed these events cost Yorkshire the County Championship, but the team had only two more games to play in that season's competition, and it was mathematically impossible for them to win. Hirst told Thompson that Hawke was always sorry that Peel had to be sacked, and that whenever the pair met afterwards, they remained friends and that neither bore the other any animosity. Although Peel considered himself indispensable, the following year he was replaced by Wilfred Rhodes, who remained in the team until 1930 and took 4,184 first-class wickets. Peel remained popular with the people of Morley in the aftermath of his dismissal, and they supported him rather than believing the reports.|$|E

5000|$|Where {{the hell}} do any of you get off, telling me I sold out? Where do you get off? Where {{do you find the}} nerve, to call me a whore? You think I hate ECW? I love that place. I love that place! But ECW simply didn't love me back. She was like the girl I can't let go off, but the one who makes me sick, upon seeing her. She wanted too much blood, too much of my heart, too much of my life! So I left, and I found fame and fortune in WWE. And Paul Heyman was right. There's only one real {{difference}} between me and Tommy Dreamer. I'm a whore, and he's not. You see, seven years ago, I pulled the sock out of my pants, and made Vince McMahon laugh, and the doors of opportunity open wide for Mick Foley, but not for Tommy Dreamer. All he's got is his heart, his pride and the initials ECW. And I wanted to tell Edge that I went back and I watched our WrestleMania match, the greatest hardcore match of all time, I said. Well the truth is, maybe it wasn't quite as good as I thought. Maybe Edge, you and I are gonna have to be tougher than ever, hungrier than ever, sicker than ever, to walk into that steaming cesspool that is the Hammerstein Ballroom. 2,500 sickening, twisted fans, screaming for our blood, because Tommy Dreamer can do everything I can, and maybe with more passion. He's gonna beat us up, all over New York City. He's gonna bludgeon us. Terry Funk, the greatest wrestler I ever saw. You look at Terry Funk and you see an old man, you're not seeing the real Terry Funk. His slaps are worse than most men's punches. His punches dole out concussions, and when he picks up a weapon, he can use it like no man ever has. He has an excruciating pain waking up every single day, looking for one more chance to have one great last match. I blew {{the son of a bitch}} up in Japan, and he came back and hugged me. I set him up on fire in Philadelphia, and he put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me.</b> He doesn't put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> anymore. I don't want your <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> Terry Funk. Tommy Dreamer, the only difference between me and you, is I have the guts to go to WWE. (At this point, a fan was audibly heard on the telecast telling Foley to shut up.) No, you shut your mouth! (pointing out to said fan) Because when I go to Hammerstein Ballroom, Edge and I are prepared to take the beatings of our lives, and I will do that to exorcise the sick, twisted whore that is ECW. I want her out of my life. Youâ€™ve seen me thrown off cells, you've seen me slammed in tacks, you've seen me go through a burning table at WrestleMania; it is nothing compared to the horrors I will unleash on Dreamer and Funk at (goddamn you) ECW. 'Cause I'm gonna stake the hearts of your heroes, and I'm gonna shove them down their throats for making me fall in love with you to begin with. You stepped on my heart, you stepped on my soul, you took everything I've had faith in, and you just throw it away. And then when I walk to that ring at the Hammerstein Ballroom as a WWE Legend, you Terry Funk and you Tommy Dreamer will learn about loss...Have a nice day.
