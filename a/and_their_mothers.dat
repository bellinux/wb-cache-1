5|$|As {{he served}} his {{sentence}} in the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, friends and family continued to occupy some of Vick's other homes in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, Florida. In June 2008, when Vick's brother, Marcus, was arrested and jailed in Norfolk after a police chase, he listed his residence as a $1.39 million home owned by Vick in an exclusive riverfront community in Suffolk, Virginia. Construction of a new riverfront home took place on land Vick owned in another exclusive section of Suffolk. His attorneys later estimated that he was spending $30,000 a month to support seven friends and relatives, including his mother and brother, three children, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Shashthi came to {{represent}} all goddesses and forces responsible for causing diseases in children <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> {{who needed to}} be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth to prevent these illnesses. Consequently, Shashthi came to personify the sixth day of a child's life. The sixth day of the lunar fortnight is itself called Shashti, a name derived from {{the name of the}} goddess. The Yajnavalkya Smriti, composed during Gupta rule between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, describes the rites of Shashthi Puja in which Shashthi is worshipped on the sixth day after childbirth to ensure the protection of the newborn baby. According to one explanation for the worship of Shashthi on this day, folk belief associates this critical time in an infant's life with great susceptibility to diseases related to childbirth, such as puerperal fever and tetanus, and that worship of Shashthi is performed to help ward off these diseases.|$|E

25|$|Anne married Sunderland on 10 June 1665: {{the groom}} had {{previously}} broken off their long-standing engagement; according to Samuel Pepys {{he told his}} friends that he had reason enough and was resolved never to have her. He soon had second thoughts <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> worked together to produce a reconciliation which resulted in an entirely successful marriage. She was a lady-in-waiting to Mary of Modena {{during the reign of}} James II, and was present at the birth of the Prince of Wales, signalling to the king that his new child was a boy.|$|E
25|$|The Library Foundation {{attempted}} a fundraiser in 2005 where participants {{paid for a}} tour of homes that used a line of paint from Devine Color. An attempt by the city to raise property taxes in November 2006 was defeated by voters, which led to cuts in the hours of the library. The library received a grant in 2008 to expand its out-reach program at the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, a women’s prison in Wilsonville. The $10,000 grant allowed for additional training and books for the program, entitled Book Bridges, designed to build and strength the connection between infants <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> who are serving time in prison. Also in 2008, the library’s Storytime Collection was chosen by the Oregon State Library {{as one of the}} outstanding projects of the year.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{launched a}} voluntary evacuation program in December 1943 which encouraged old people, children <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> {{to move from}} the main cities and stay in the homes of friends and relatives in rural areas. The government provided civilians with little assistance to evacuate, however. Few people evacuated until the first raid by American heavy bombers on Japan, an attack on Yawata, in June 1944 after which the government urged families to evacuate their children. As a result, 459,000 children and their parents moved to stay with friends and relatives. For families without contacts in the countryside, entire school classes evacuated as groups accompanied by their teachers; by August 1944, 333,000 children had been relocated to rural areas where they continued their education in inns, temples and other public buildings. A further 343,000 urban residents were forced to leave their homes when they were destroyed to create firebreaks; these people either moved to the country or lived in temporary accommodation near their workplace.|$|E

25|$|The {{grandmother}} hypothesis {{suggests that}} menopause {{was selected for}} humans because it promotes the survival of grandchildren. According to this hypothesis, post-reproductive women feed and care for children, adult nursing daughters, and grandchildren whose mothers have weaned them. Human babies require large and steady supplies of glucose to feed the growing brain. In infants {{in the first year}} of life, the brain consumes 60% of all calories, so both babies <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> require a dependable food supply. Some evidence suggests that hunters contribute less than half the total food budget of most hunter-gatherer societies, and often much less than half, so that foraging grandmothers can contribute substantially to the survival of grandchildren at times when mothers and fathers are unable to gather enough food for all of their children. In general, selection operates most powerfully during times of famine or other privation. So although grandmothers might not be necessary during good times, many grandchildren cannot survive without them during times of famine. Arguably, however, there is no firm consensus on the supposed evolutionary advantages (or simply neutrality) of menopause to the survival of the species in the evolutionary past.|$|E
25|$|In The Philippines, {{traditional}} large swords {{known as}} the Kampilan and the Panabas were used in combat by the natives. A notable wielder of the kampilan was Lapu-Lapu, the king of Mactan and his warriors who defeated the Spaniards and killed Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan at the Battle of Mactan on 27 April 1521. Traditional swords in the Philippines were immediately banned, but the training in swordsmanship was later hidden from the occupying Spaniards by practices in dances. But because of the banning, Filipinos were forced to use swords that were disguised as farm tools. Bolos and baliswords were used during the revolutions against the colonialists not only because ammunition for guns was scarce, but also for concealability while walking in crowded streets and homes. Bolos were also used by young boys who joined their parents in the revolution and by young girls <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> in defending the town while the men were on the battlefields. During the Philippine–American War in {{events such as the}} Balangiga Massacre, most of an American company was hacked to death or seriously injured by bolo-wielding guerillas in Balangiga, Samar. When the Japanese took control of the country, several American special operations groups stationed in the Philippines were introduced to the Filipino Martial Arts and swordsmanship, leading to this style reaching America despite the fact that natives were reluctant to allow outsiders in on their fighting secrets.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternate}} version {{states the}} legend of Lilith/Lilitu (and a type of spirit of the same name) originally arose from Sumer, where she was described as an infertile [...] "beautiful maiden" [...] and {{was believed to be}} a harlot and vampire who, after having chosen a lover, would never let him go. Lilitu (or the Lilitu spirits) was considered to be an anthropomorphic bird-footed, wind or night demon and was often described as a sexual predator who subsisted on the blood of babies <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Other Mesopotamian demons such as the Babylonian goddess Lamashtu, (Sumer's Dimme) [...] and Gallu of the Uttuke group are mentioned as having vampiric natures.|$|E

500|$|Homosexual {{women were}} more likely to {{describe}} their relationships with their mothers as negative, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> as having been hostile or rejecting. These measures were combined into a single measure, [...] "Hostile-Rejecting Mother", which appeared to have only minimal influence on the development of sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to describe their mothers as having been pleasant people. This and two other connected variables were combined into a composite measure called [...] "Unpleasant Mother", which had a weak and indirect connection with adult homosexuality. Homosexual women identified less strongly with their mothers, though this appeared to have very little influence on adult sexual preference, having only indirect effects, dependent upon its encouragement of childhood gender nonconformity. Homosexual women gave less favorable descriptions of their relationships with their fathers, and {{were more likely to have}} negative feelings toward them, and to describe them as having been hostile or detached. These variables were combined into a measure called [...] "Detached-Hostile Father", which appeared to encourage childhood gender nonconformity and adolescent homosexual involvement. Homosexual women were less likely to identify with their fathers, but the [...] "Identification with Father" [...] variable appeared to be unimportant.|$|E
500|$|Initially both Pikachu and the Pokémon Clefairy {{were chosen}} to be lead {{characters}} for the franchise merchandising, with the latter as the primary mascot to make the early comic book series more [...] "engaging". However, with {{the production of the}} animated series, Pikachu was chosen as the primary mascot, in an attempt to appeal to female viewers <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> and under the belief that the creature presented the image of a recognizable intimate pet for children. Its color was also a deciding factor, as yellow is a primary color and easier for children to recognize from a distance, and with consideration to the fact the only other competing yellow mascot at the time was Winnie-the-Pooh. Though Tajiri acknowledged that the character was relatively popular with both boys and girls, the idea of Pikachu as the mascot was not his own, with the company responsible for the production of the animated series OLM, Inc. giving the suggestion to utilize Pikachu’s potential to Game Freak, and stated he felt the human aspect of the series was overlooked by Japanese children who embraced Pikachu by itself more readily.|$|E
500|$|Many {{cultures}} in ancient Mesopotamia had stories involving blood-drinking demons. The Persians {{were one of}} the first civilizations thought to have tales of such monsters; creatures attempting to drink blood from men are depicted on excavated pottery shards. Ancient Babylonia had tales of the mythical Lilitu, synonymous with and giving rise to Lilith (Hebrew לילית) and her daughters the Lilu from Hebrew demonology. Lilith was considered a demon and was often depicted as subsisting on the blood of babies. [...] The legend of Lilith was originally included in some traditional Jewish texts: according to the medieval folk traditions, she was considered to be Adam's first wife before Eve. In these texts, Lilith left Adam to become the queen of the demons (she actually refused to be Adam's subordinate and thus was banished from Eden by God himself) and, much like the Greek striges, would prey on young babies <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> at night, as well as males. Because Hebrew law absolutely forbade the eating of human flesh or the drinking of any type of blood, Lilith's blood drinking was described as exceptionally evil. To ward off attacks from Lilith, parents used to hang amulets around their child's cradle.|$|E

500|$|Lamashtu is a {{historically}} older image that left {{a mark on}} the figure of Lilith. Many incantations invoke her as a malicious [...] "Daughter of Heaven" [...] or of Anu, and she is often depicted as a terrifying blood-sucking creature with a lion's head and {{the body of a}} donkey. Akin to Lilitu, Lamashtu primarily preyed on newborns <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> She was said to watch pregnant women vigilantly, particularly when they went into labor. Afterwards, she would snatch the newborn from the mother to drink its blood and eat its flesh. In the Labartu texts she is described; [...] "Wherever she comes, wherever she appears, she brings evil and destruction. Men, beasts, trees, rivers, roads, buildings, she brings harm to them all. A flesh-eating, bloodsucking monster is she." [...] Gallu was a demon closely associated with Lilith, though the word (like [...] "Utukku") is also used as a general term for demons, and these are [...] "evil Uttuke" [...] or [...] "evil Galli". One incantation tells of them as spirits that threaten every house, rage at people, eat their flesh, and as they let their blood flow like rain, they never stop drinking blood. Lamashtu, Lilitu, and Gallu are invoked in different amulet texts, with Gallu showing up in Graeco-Byzantine myth as Gello, Gylo, or Gyllo. There she appears as a child-stealing and child-killing female demon, in the manner of Lamia and Lilith.|$|E

2500|$|Marie de Romieu was a 16th-century French poet from Viviers, France. Although her exact date {{of birth}} is unknown, she was most likely born between 1526 and 1545, and died around 1589.

2500|$|In {{countries}} {{occupied by}} Nazi Germany during the war, sexual relations (including rape) between Wehrmacht soldiers and native women {{resulted in the}} birth of significant numbers of children. Couplings of German soldiers and native women were particularly common in countries whose population was not dubbed [...] "inferior" [...] (Untermensch) by the Nazis. After the Wehrmacht's withdrawal, these women and their children of German descent were often ill-treated. Although plans were made in Norway to expel the children <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> to Australia, the plans never materialised. For many war children, the situation would ease only decades after the war.|$|E
