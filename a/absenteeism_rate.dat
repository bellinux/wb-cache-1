We estimated the greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) and fine particulate matter air pollution (PM 2. 5) within 250 m and 1000 m respectively of each public school in Massachusetts during the 2012 – 2013 academic year using satellite-based data. We modeled chronic <b>absenteeism</b> <b>rates</b> {{in the same year}} as a function of PM 2. 5 and NDVI, controlling for race and household income. Among the 1772 public schools in Massachusetts, a 0. 15 increase in NDVI during the academic year was associated with a 2. 6 % (p value < 0. 0001) reduction in chronic <b>absenteeism</b> <b>rates,</b> and a 1 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2. 5 during the academic year was associated with a 1. 58 % (p value < 0. 0001) increase in chronic <b>absenteeism</b> <b>rates.</b> Based on these percentage changes in chronic absenteeism, a 0. 15 increase in NDVI and 1 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2. 5 correspond to 25, 837 fewer students and 15, 852 more students chronically absent each year in Massachusetts respectively.

We report a study of the association between absenteeism and provision of treated water in containers into schools. We undertook a quasi-experimental longitudinal study of <b>absenteeism</b> <b>rates</b> in 8 schools, 4 of which received one 20 L container of treated drinking water per day. The water had been treated by filtration and ultraviolet disinfection. Weekly <b>absenteeism</b> <b>rates</b> were compared across all schools using negative binomial model in generalized estimating equations. There was a strong association with provision of free water and reduced <b>absenteeism</b> (Incidence <b>rate</b> ratio = 0. 39 (95 % Confidence Intervals 0. 27 - 0. 56)). However there was also a strong association with season (wet versus dry) and a significant interaction between receiving free water and season.

In this school we showed a significant association between the number of water containers delivered each week and absenteeism (IRR = 0. 98 95 %CI 0. 96 - 1. 00). There appears to be a strong association between providing free safe drinking water and reduced absenteeism, though only in the dry season.

The first null hypothesis stated that no statistically significant relationships exist among the three subscale scores of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, namely, (a) Emotional Exhaustion, (b) Depersonalization, and (c) Personal Accomplishment and any of the six variables identified on the Occupational Self-Evaluation: (a) Perceived amount of control in decision making, (b) Approximate <b>absenteeism</b> <b>rate,</b> (c) Amount of emotional and social support, (d) Satisfaction with the training and support systems to deal with the clients, (e) Level of anticipation for career advancement, (f) Feelings toward amount of pay received. The first hypothesis was rejected in eight of the eighteen comparisons. When the six variables in the Occupational Self-Evaluation were correlated with the Emotional Exhaustion Subscale, five of the six correlation coefficients were significant: (a) <b>Absenteeism</b> <b>rate,</b> (b) Amount of Emotional and Social Support, (c) Satisfaction with the training and support systems to deal with the clients, (d) Level of anticipation for career advancement, and (e) Feelings toward amount of pay received.

40|$|Abstract Background As many {{respiratory}} viruses {{are responsible}} for influenza like symptoms, accurate measures of the disease burden are not available and estimates are generally based on statistical methods. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate <b>absenteeism</b> <b>rates</b> and hours lost due to seasonal influenza and compare these estimates with estimates of absenteeism attributable to the two H 1 N 1 pandemic waves that occurred in 2009. Methods Key absenteeism variables were extracted from Statistics Canada's monthly labour force survey (LFS). Absenteeism and the proportion of hours lost due to own illness or disability were modelled as a function of trend, seasonality and proxy variables for influenza activity from 1998 to 2009. Results Hours lost due to the H 1 N 1 / 09 pandemic strain were elevated compared to seasonal influenza, accounting for a loss of 0. 2 % of potential hours worked annually. In comparison, an estimated 0. 08 % of hours worked annually were lost due to seasonal influenza illnesses. <b>Absenteeism</b> <b>rates</b> due to influenza were estimated at 12 % per year for seasonal influenza over the 1997 / 98 to 2008 / 09 seasons, and 13 % for the two H 1 N 1 / 09 pandemic waves. Employees who took time off due to a seasonal influenza infection took an average of 14 hours off. For the pandemic strain, the average absence was 25 hours. Conclusions This study confirms that absenteeism due to seasonal influenza has typically ranged from 5 % to 20 %, with higher rates associated with multiple circulating strains. <b>Absenteeism</b> <b>rates</b> for the 2009 pandemic were similar to those occurring for seasonal influenza. Employees took more time off due to the pandemic strain than was typical for seasonal influenza. </p...|$|R

For this thesis I set out to study absenteeism in nursing homes here in my town, Trondheim. I wanted to study the nursing homes with relatively low <b>absenteeism</b> <b>rate</b> and the nursing homes with relatively high <b>absenteeism</b> <b>rate</b> to see if I could find differences that could explain the differences in their absenteeism rates. Interviews were used to gather data from four different nursing homes in Trondheim, and the participants were the manager and two caregivers from each nursing home, a total of twelve participants. A qualitative analysis approach was chosen to analyze the data I had obtained in order to increase my understanding of them, and the findings indicate that the differences between the nursing homes are there. The results indicate that there are individual, leadership and organizational differences. Individually, the employees from the nursing homes with low <b>absenteeism</b> <b>rate</b> handle stressful situations better and they are healthier than those from nursing homes with high absenteeism. On the leadership’s side, the managers from the nursing homes with low absenteeism have more insight into the employees every day work situation; they are more visible, supportive and protective of the employees than the managers of the nursing homes with high absenteeism. Organizationally, the nursing homes with low absenteeism use fewer substitutes and they distribute the available caregivers better on the different shifts.

Aims: To examine the impact on employee health and safety of changes to the roster system in an Aus-tralian coal mine. Methods: Absenteeism and incident frequency rate data were collected over a 33 month period that covered three different roster schedules. Period 1 covered the original 8 -hour/ 7 -day roster. Period 2 covered a 12 -month period under a 12 -hour/ 7 -day schedule, and period 3 covered a 12 -month period during which a roster that scheduled shifts only on weekdays, with uncapped overtime on weekends and days off (12 -hour/ 5 -day) was in place.
