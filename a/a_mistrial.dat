5|$|Declan McCullagh {{asserts that}} during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the {{prosecution}} significant latitude in making negative suggestions about Bell's character, and refused requests for <b>a</b> <b>mistrial.</b> McCullagh also asserts that he was subpoenaed by two Treasury Department agents {{to appear before the}} court, without being notified ahead of time as required by federal regulations regarding subpoenas involving the media. Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E
5|$|Kinne's {{second trial}} {{for the murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, the public was initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were allowed into the courtroom. An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, <b>a</b> <b>mistrial</b> was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Liz drinks {{poisoned}} punch which Julian's ex-wife Rebecca Hotchkiss {{had intended}} for Eve. Liz accuses Eve of deliberately {{giving her the}} punch, and Eve is arrested for attempted murder. T. C. proposes to Liz, but she becomes increasingly paranoid over his romantic feelings for Eve. Liz attempts to force Julian {{to have sex with}} her {{in the middle of an}} earthquake and tsunami, and stabs him in the back when he does not comply.

C. later breaks off his engagement with Liz after reconciling with his ex-wife's past and rebukes all of her efforts to seduce her way back into his life. On the eve of Eve's trial, Liz offers her adoptive sister a deal: she will rescind her accusation and not testify if Eve promises to leave Harmony forever. Eve considers the deal before ultimately refusing it. Near the end of Eve's trial, Julian agrees to give Rebecca anything she wants in exchange for her testimony that she saw Liz with the vial of poison. Tabitha Lenox's daughter Endora Lenox magically casts the jury into a fake flashback, matching Rebecca's testimony, and the judge declares <b>a</b> <b>mistrial.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1925, {{prosecutors}} {{elected to}} dismiss murder {{charges against the}} remaining ten defendants in the famous case of People vs. Ossian Sweet. It involved a black family that had defended its home against a white mob. They were defended by attorney Clarence Darrow, who was retained by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The trial was presided over by Detroit Recorder's Court Judge Frank Murphy, {{who went on to}} become an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. After <b>an</b> initial <b>mistrial,</b> Henry Sweet (Ossian's brother, who admitted he fired the shot) was acquitted by a jury on grounds of self defense; the dismissals of the charges against the ten remaining defendants followed.|$|R

5|$|On June 9, Spivey {{was arrested}} in New York, and was {{released}} pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point shaver, and was upset that the payment {{for his role in}} shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original grand jury testimony, which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told the grand jury that Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal, stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury; Spivey said he learned this from Line. The trial lasted for 13days before the case went to a jury. By a 9‚Äì3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused <b>a</b> <b>mistrial.</b> The grand jury eventually dropped the charges against Spivey.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Liz drinks {{poisoned}} punch which Rebecca {{had intended}} for Eve. Liz accuses Eve of deliberately {{giving her the}} punch, and Eve is arrested for attempted murder. During the arrest and trial, Eve and Julian grow closer together and T. C. ends his relationship with Liz to reconcile with his ex-wife. Julian makes a deal with Rebecca that he would give her anything she wants in exchange for her testimony that she saw Liz with the vial of poison; the judge declares <b>a</b> <b>mistrial.</b> The plot then focuses on Eve's love triangle with T. C. and Julian as she is torn between taking care of T. C. after his stroke and accepting Julian's proposal of marriage. Eve discovers Julian's affair with Valerie Davis, an employee of Crane Industries, leading to her decision to nurse T. C. back to health and renew their relationship to reunite their family. Julian later explains to Eve that he was paying Valerie to search for their son; Eve forgives Valerie, and she and Julian continue their search. In 2007, Eve and Julian discover that Vincent Clarkson (a blackmailer who raped and murdered several people) is their son, and try to support him despite his criminal past. However, Eve cannot accept her son's criminality and incestuous, adulterous affair with Chad Harris-Crane (Vincent's uncle, adoptive cousin and brother-in-law) and begins abusing drugs and alcohol. Her career and reputation suffer, {{and she has a}} breakdown after Vincent's apparent death on August 30, 2007. In the show's final NBC episode on September 7, 2007, Vincent is revealed as intersex; he separates his identity into Vincent and Valerie, an indication of dissociative identity disorder.|$|E
5|$|Logan's retrial {{began in}} June 2007, with the {{prosecution}} unable to use Logan's confession to present its case for conviction, for the judiciary had ruled {{that it had been}} obtained with impropriety. In the retrial, the prosecution used the same argument it had used in the original trial back in 2003, arguing that Logan's insanity defense was illegitimate due to his usage of illegal controlled substances. The state's prosecution argued that Logan himself was solely responsible for any deficiencies in his mental health, saying that they were brought about through his consumption of illegal narcotics, such as cocaine and marijuana, two illegal controlled substances which he had used {{on the day of the}} murders. Ultimately, the first attempt at a retrial ended in June 2007 with <b>a</b> <b>mistrial</b> after jurors couldn't come to a verdict after ten hours of deliberations. On July 1, 2007, Logan's attorney died after being involved in an automobile collision on Route 10 in Glen Burnie, further complicating matters. However, a few months later, Logan was subsequently convicted again after pleading guilty and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment on October 24, 2007, with credit for the five years he had already served, much to the disappointment of the victims' surviving family members, who felt he deserved a lifelong imprisonment for his crime.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Hynes' office filed felony theft {{charges against}} Sandra Roper, {{a lawyer who}} had {{challenged}} Hynes in the 2001 primary race. Prosecutors said that Roper had stolen about $9,000 from a client, whom she allegedly told she was representing for free. Ms. Roper's defense argued that the funds were legal fees that the client had agreed to. Hynes recused himself from the case. Following <b>a</b> 2004 <b>mistrial</b> due to <b>a</b> hung jury, the charges were dismissed in 2005 after Roper repaid the funds to the client. Roper subsequently sued Hynes, alleging that he had acted improperly; the lawsuit was thrown out in 2006, as {{the court found that}} Roper had not proven that Hynes was personally involved in her prosecution.|$|R
