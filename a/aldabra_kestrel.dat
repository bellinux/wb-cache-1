The race from Aldabra is also called <b>Aldabra</b> <b>kestrel</b> (Falco newtoni aldabranus). Its closest living relative is the Seychelles kestrel; they were at one time considered conspecific. Their common ancestors appear to have diverged very recently, probably less than 1 million years ago during the Early or Middle Pleistocene.The Mauritius kestrel is more distantly related.(Groombridge et al. 2002) ...|$|E
