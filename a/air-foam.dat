40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{research}} the blocking effect of air foam, oxidation of oil-air foam and air foam enhanced recovery by experiments. The results show the more injected air foam, {{the stronger the}} sealing capacity, but increment trend changes slow. Beside, high-pressure, low-temperature can enhance the sealing capacity of the air foam. Temperature is the principal factor which can influence crude oil-air-foam oxidizing reaction. The reaction rate increases with increase of temperature. What is more, the rise of pressure can accelerate the oxidation response in a certain extent. The <b>air-foam</b> has the good oil displacement efficiency. In the heterogeneous reservoir, air foam injection can seal of high permeable zones, enhances sweep efficiency and is propitious to achieve the low temperature oxidation...|$|E

The study focused on investigating the effectiveness of functional acrylic polymer (AP) in improving the ability of <b>air-foamed</b> sodium silicate-activated calcium aluminate/Class F fly ash cement (slurry density of 1. 3 g/cm 3) to mitigate the corrosion of carbon steel (CS) after exposure to hydrothermal environment at 200 ˚C or 300 ˚C. Hydrothermally-initi-ated interactions between the AP and cement generated the formation of Ca-, Al-, or Na-complexed carboxylate deriva-tives that improved the AP’s hydrothermal stability. A porous microstructure comprising numerous defect-free, evenly distributed, discrete voids formed {{in the presence of}} this hydrothermally stable AP, resulting in the increase in compres-sive strength of cement. The foamed cement with advanced properties conferred by AP greatly protected the CS against brine-caused corrosion. Four major factors governed this protection by AP-incorporated foamed cements: 1) Reducing the extents of infiltration and transportation of corrosive electrolytes through the cement layer deposited on the under-lying CS surface; 2) Inhibiting the cathodic reactions at the corrosion site of CS; 3) Extending the coverage of CS by the cement; and 4) Improving the adherence of the cement to CS surface...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the formation of}} fingering patterns in a radial Hele-Shaw cell filled with quasi-two-dimensional polydisperse foam of very small liquid content. Air is used as the low-viscosity driving fluid. Using high speed imaging (up to 2000 fps), we directly observe the topological rearrangements on the size scale of single bubbles at the <b>air-foam</b> interface. We find that the growth process of the finger can be discretized as successive elementary T 1 -type edge exchanges between neighboring bubbles at the interface of the advancing finger. Apart from the rate of T 1 events, other statistical quantities can be determined with good spatial resolution using a coordinate system moving with the finger. Measures of local bubble anisotropy (such as the texture tensor) and connectivity are {{used to determine the}} deviatoric stress tensor in the material. The data are compared to continuum results in the viscous liquid and elastic solid limits, shedding light on the continuum behavior of foam as a viscoelastic material...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe 3 rd {{generation}} {{fire truck}} takes use of compressed gas as spraying medium. By {{way of the}} especially designed spraying device in the 3 rd generation fire truck, the extinguishing agents mixed with compressed gas uniformly, are spraying to fire fields in microdots with high speed and high flux. The extinguishing agents’ microdots with high kinematic energy can penetrate into the flame and affront the flame with more interface areas. The extinguishing efficiency is improved significantly consequently. In a fire fighting by the 3 rd generation fire truck, fire can be extinguished more quickly, larger field of fire can be controlled, water damage and environmental pollution is decreased too. The 3 rd generation fire truck can also help positive pressure ventilating, cooling fire, blowing and diluting the toxic smoke, and rescuing persons from the fire. Up to the present, different kinds of the 3 rd generation fire trucks have been successfully developed such as turbojet fire truck, water mist fire truck, compressed <b>air-foam</b> A/B fire truck, aerosol fire truck, compound spraying fire truck and positive pressure ventilating truck etc. They are playing important roles in fighting fire in urban building, petrochemical enterprises, underground facilities, aircrafts and others...|$|E
40|$|The Pahute Mesa- 3 test well is on Pahute Mesa about 3 {{miles west}} of the Nevada Test Site and 20 miles {{northeast}} of Oasis Valley near Beatty, Nevada. The well was drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy Radionuclide Migration Program to monitor conditions near {{the western edge of the}} Nevada Test Site. The well was drilled with conventional rotary methods and an <b>air-foam</b> drilling fluid to a depth of 3, 019 feet. A 10. 75 -inch diameter steel casing was installed to a depth of 1, 473 feet. The test well penetrates thick units of non-welded to partly welded ash-flow and air-fall tuff of Tertiary age with several thin layers of densely welded tuff, rhyolite and basalt flows, and breccia. Geophysical logs indicate that fractures are significant in the Tiva Canyon Tuff of the Paintbrush Group and this was confirmed by high flow in this unit during a borehole-flow survey. The geophysical logs also show that the effective porosity in tuffaceous units ranges from 19 to 38 percent and averages 30 percent, and the total porosity ranges from 33 to 55 percent and averages 42 percent. The measured temperature gradient of 1. 00 degree Celsius per 100 feet is steep, but is similar to that of other nearby wells, one of which penetrates a buried granite intrusion. Injection tests for six intervals of the well yielded transmissivities that ranged from 3. 1 x 10 {sup - 3 } to 25 feet squared per day and hydraulic conductivities that ranged from 6 x 10 {sup - 5 } to 0. 12 foot per day. The sum of the transmissivities is 28 feet squared per day and the geometric mean of hydraulic conductivity is 1. 7 x 10 {sup - 3 } foot per day. Estimates of storage coefficient range from 2. 1 x 10 {sup - 5 } to 3. 8 x 10 {sup - 3 }, indicating that the aquifer responded to the injection tests in a confined manner. An aquifer test produced a drawdown of 78 feet during 31 hours of testing at 169 gallons per minute...|$|E
40|$|Artificially {{recharging}} the Las Vegas Valley (Valley) ground-water {{system with}} treated Colorado River water is one water resource management option {{employed by the}} Las Vegas Valley Water District (District) to help meet future long-term and short-term peak water demands. The District began operation of an artificial ground-water recharge program in 1988 in order to bank water for future use and to slow declining water levels. Artificial recharge occurs in the winter months, typically from October to May, when there is excess capacity in the Southern Nevada Water System (SNWS), currently a 400 Million Gallon per Day (MGD) treatment and transmission system. Treated Colorado River water is recharged into the principal aquifer through the District 2 ̆ 7 s existing distribution system, to a network of production wells or dual -use wells for both recharge and production. The water is then stored until recovered from the wells, during the high demand summer months. The water recovered is injected Colorado River water, however, this water is accounted against the District 2 ̆ 7 s groundwater rights. Credits in the artificial recharge account accrue until needed to cover pumpage in excess of permitted ground-water rights. Wells used in the program were drilled and constructed {{in a variety of}} ways, and have responded differently to artificial recharge operations. The majority of the wells now used for artificial recharge and production were completed prior to 1980, using the cable-tool drilling method, perforated in place and naturally developed. Other wells were installed using the reverse-circulation drilling method with filter packs. The District commenced drilling dedicated injection wells in 1993, to address operational concerns observed in some of the production wells. Several types of installation and drilling methods have been used to optimize injection. The types of drilling methods used for the injection wells include, reverse circulation, <b>air-foam,</b> cable tool and dual-rotary. In 1988, two dual-use wells where used for production and artificial recharge, injecting an annual total of 1, 153 acre feet of water. Since 1988 the artificial recharge program has expanded, using up to 40 wells with eight dedicated injection wells. Total water banked for future use, as of January 1, 1997 is 114, 126 acre feet of water. Static water levels in the principal aquifer have risen from 10 to 40 feet in the main area of artificial recharge. Water levels {{in other areas of the}} Valley also show increases, indicating that the rise is not isolated, but is occurring throughout the principal aquifer. The artificial recharge program is currently expanding to utilize 31 dual use and 19 injection wells, for a potential capacity of 62, 000 gallons per minute of injection or 45, 000 acre feet per year of recharge by the fall of 1999...|$|E
