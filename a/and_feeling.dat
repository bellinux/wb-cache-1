5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged {{to abandon the}} derelict Yorktown <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, {{but he was still}} unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.|$|E
5|$|But the Admiral {{was never}} {{assigned}} another command. Concluding {{that he was}} being held up as a scapegoat, <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> bitter that the country and the Navy had abandoned him suddenly at the moment of the Navy's greatest accomplishment, Murray left Canada for the United Kingdom in September 1945, and officially retired from the Navy on 14 March 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Burnet {{decided that}} {{research}} at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.|$|E

5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones.

5|$|Matsueda {{is noted}} for her jazzy style, which she often {{incorporated}} into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was {{responsible for most of}} the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> are important factors in composition. When asked why she creates music, Matsueda replied that she feels it is an appropriate way to express herself.|$|E
40|$|Working {{with clients}} who show {{challenging}} {{behavior can be}} emotionally demanding and stressful for support staff, because this behavior may cause a range of negative emotional reactions <b>and</b> <b>feelings.</b> These reactions are of negative influence on staff wellbeing and behavior. Research has focused on negative emotions of staff. However, a distinction between emotions <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> has never {{been made in the}} research field of intellectual disabilities. Negative emotions <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> may be regulated by emotional intelligence, a psychological construct that takes into account personal style and individual differences. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence on the one hand <b>and</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> on the other. Participants were 207 support staff serving clients with moderate to borderline intellectual disabilities and challenging behavior. Emotional intelligence, emotions, <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> were measured with questionnaires. The results show that emotional intelligence, emotions, <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> are related. However, found relationships were weak. Most significant relations were found between <b>feelings</b> <b>and</b> stress management and adaptation elements of emotional intelligence. Because the explored variables can change over time they call for a longitudinal research approach. Keywords; Staff, Challenging behavior, Emotions, Feelings, Emotional intelligenc...|$|R

5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by {{the corruption of the}} health system <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> that he could not fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
30|$|Participants {{wanted to}} conceal their moods <b>and</b> <b>feelings,</b> personalities, <b>and</b> {{physical}} attributes. However, personality {{was the most}} frequently mentioned self-defining quality <b>and</b> moods <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> {{were one of the}} top desired functions for tracking the self, knowing about others, and sharing with others. People liked to know about others’ moods <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> but wanted to conceal their own. Information about individuals’ personalities <b>and</b> moods <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> could be used for tracking the self but not always shared with others. Thus, designers could consider how to better protect users’ privacy while still providing the benefits of tracking. For example, data shared with others could use fewer specific words such as “stressed” when tracking moods <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> (Raij et al. 2011). Designers of wearable technology might further consider the use of filters or permission dashboards to give users greater control over how their data is revealed to others and who gets to see it.|$|R

Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.|$|E
5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work {{was going to be}} his masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown many times in the past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along {{the west bank of the}} Bronx River.|$|E
5|$|Historian Matti Moosa {{considered}} Marrash to be {{the first}} truly cosmopolitan Arab intellectual and writer of modern times. Marrash adhered to the principles of the French Revolution and defended them in his own works, implicitly criticizing Ottoman rule in Western Asia and North Africa. He was also influential in introducing French romanticism in the Arab world, especially through his use of poetic prose and prose poetry, of which his writings were the first examples in modern Arabic literature, according to Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Shmuel Moreh. His modes of thinking <b>and</b> <b>feeling,</b> and ways of expressing them, have had a lasting influence on contemporary Arab thought and on the Mahjari poets.|$|E

Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> that the act did not violate separation of powers.

The game was very close going into the second half, and the Steelers were still stinging from a Mathis interception and runback for a touchdown.

Shortly after that, the Steelers ran away with the game and the Jaguars lost 26-21. The Jaguars went on to lose eight of their remaining eleven games in the season.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E

40|$|Aims Training {{has been}} shown to improve the ability of people with {{intellectual}} disabilities (IDs) to perform some cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) tasks. This study used a computerised training paradigm with the aim of improving the ability of people with IDs to: a) discriminate between behaviours, thoughts <b>and</b> <b>feelings,</b> <b>and</b> b) link situations, thoughts <b>and</b> <b>feelings.</b> Methods Fifty-five people with mild-to-moderate IDs were randomly assigned to a training or attention-control condition in a single-blind mixed experimental design. Computerised tasks assessed the participants’ skills in: (a) discriminating between behaviours, thoughts <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> (separately <b>and</b> pooled together), and (b) cognitive mediation by selecting appropriate emotions as consequences to given thoughts, and appropriate thoughts as mediators of given emotions. Results Training significantly improved ability to discriminate between behaviours, thoughts <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> pooled together, compared to the attention-control condition, even when controlling for baseline scores and IQ. Large within-group improvements in the ability to identify behaviours <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> were observed for the training condition, but not the attention-control group. There were no significant between-group differences in ability to identify thoughts, or on cognitive mediation skills. Conclusions A single session of computerised training can improve the ability of people with IDs to understand and practise CBT tasks relating to behaviours <b>and</b> <b>feelings.</b> There is potential for computerised training {{to be used as a}} “primer” for CBT with people with IDs to improve engagement and outcomes, but further development on a specific computerised cognitive mediation task is needed...|$|R

5|$|A {{week after}} the election, Downey {{announced}} that he was resigning for health reasons. Warren appointed Nixon to the short remainder of Downey's term; under the Senate rules at the time, this gave Nixon seniority over the senators sworn in during January. Nixon took office on December 4, 1950. He used little of his seniority, since in November 1952 he was elected vice president as Dwight Eisenhower's running mate, the next step on a path that would lead him to the presidency in 1969. Downey, who as a former senator retained floor privileges, was hired as a lobbyist by oil interests. In 1952, as Republicans took over the White House and control of both houses of Congress, he was fired. An aide stated that the big corporations did not need Downey anymore. Boddy, dispirited by his election defeat <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> let down by the average citizens for whom he had sought to advocate, lapsed into semi-retirement after his primary defeat. In 1952, he sold his interest in the Daily News, which went into bankruptcy in December 1954.|$|E

Mercedes sleeps with Warren once again <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> guilty, proposes marriage to Russ. He agrees, revealing that he was also going to propose. On the night before their wedding, Mercedes becomes intoxicated and has sex with Warren for a third time. On the same night, someone attempts to murder Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) and Warren is arrested. Warren tries to prove his innocence as he was with Mercedes, but she denies it. At the wedding, Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee) interrupts the proceedings and confronts Mercedes. Mercedes' half-sister, Tina (Leah Hackett), lies and gives her an alibi. Mercedes and Russ then marry and Warren is charged with Clare's attempted murder. Mercedes agrees to be a witness at Warren's trial and explains their affair, with Russ listening on.
