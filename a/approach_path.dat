25|$|Since the 1990s areas {{directly}} {{to the north of}} the air base have been demarcated for land development, namely Westercelle, and Altencelle. These areas are situated directly beneath the <b>approach</b> <b>path</b> of runway 26. Even though developers and prospective buyers were previously informed regarding the proximity of the airfield and also benefited from reduced house prices, some did not realise the actual effects of living close to an active airfield, particularly during periods of night flight training, which has led to numerous complaints.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan has}} {{also met with}} stiff {{opposition}} from local residents, who fear that the BMC's forty-year-old Development Plan (DP) that envisaged sports facilities, a recreation ground and two arterial roads would be shelved to accommodate the new airport. The re-aligned runway would also end less than a 100 metres from {{the gate of the}} 500-bed Nanavati Hospital disturbing patients. The extension of the runway is likely to divide the Iconic Juhu Beach that is visited by more than 10,000 tourists daily. The realignment will also require demolition of prime property in JVPD scheme and Vile Parle as some buildings are in conflict with the proposed realignment while other tall structures that will be an obstacle in the <b>approach</b> <b>path</b> will have to be lowered to one or two floors.|$|E
25|$|On 13 January 2007, a Boeing 737-200 {{belonging}} to the Gading Sari Aviation Services Sdn Bhd crash-landed while attempting to land at 5.52 a.m. The aircraft's fuselage was badly damaged, and the landing gears and right engine were torn off during the crash. All four crew members escaped unhurt. The airport was closed for six hours while the plane was towed away from the crash site and debris cleared from the runway. Departures and arrivals of 16 MAS and 14 AirAsia flights were delayed affecting 2,200 passengers – 1,000 passengers of MAS and 1,200 from AirAsia. An earlier flight from Kuala Lumpur had to be diverted to Miri Airport.

25|$|The {{norm for}} landing at Fornebu was to {{rendezvous}} with a radio beacon, Rumba, and conduct a fifteen-degree left turn {{for about half}} a minute. The aircraft would then be aligned with the 06 runway and could glide down following the instrument landing system (ILS). This maneuver would nominally take place {{at an altitude of}} 1,100meters (3,500ft). However, in clear weather the pilots often opted for a short-cut to reach the <b>approach</b> <b>path</b> more quickly. Because of the topography, it was possible that the ILS beams would deviate up to twenty-five degrees, which could cause the pilots to turn the aircraft too early and would cause the aircraft to fly over a range of hills on the wrong heading. This was a known fault with the system and pilots would therefore check the direction of the radio beacon at Asker to ensure they were in the correct position. This short-cut was carried out by Flight 239.|$|E
25|$|As a result, a study {{into the}} risks of bird strikes at KSIA was commissioned, with special {{attention}} being paid to the barn swallows at Mount Moreland. The study showed that the early morning dispersals of swallows generally happen before any scheduled arrivals or departures (earlier than 06:00), and the late afternoon swarms take place below the airport <b>approach</b> <b>path,</b> with only 5% of the birds protruding up into the path for {{a very short time}} (around 10 minutes). It was also noted that larger bird species, flying at higher altitudes, would pose more of a risk to aircraft than the swallows, such species already being a risk at Durban International Airport. The study concluded that it would definitely be possible for the airport and swallows to co-exist. Proposed risk mitigation measures included curtailing flight movements during the afternoon swarm, setting the glide slope approach to Runway 06 to 3.2 or 3.5 degrees rather than the standard 3 degrees (to stay above the birds), and the installation of a radar system that would monitor bird movements and be integrated into the operational plan of the airport.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, {{possibly}} due {{to their}} concerns with passenger comfort (the VOR 1 approach would have required performing the [...] "circle to land" [...] maneuver at a relatively low altitude over the airport to land on runway 19), or possibly by simply being late to {{set up for the}} recommended VOR 1 approach (the flight time was only about 8 minutes from takeoff at Albany to the Glens Falls area, with a significant tailwind component of approximately 50 knots), the crew did not execute the VOR 1 approach. Instead, the crew appeared to select an improvised and unauthorized modified version of the VOR/DME 19 approach, which included flying outbound followed by a course reversal at about [...] north of the airport, over Lake George. As the crew performed what appeared to be an unpublished and unauthorized procedure turn for course reversal on the VOR/DME 19 <b>approach</b> <b>path,</b> they descended prematurely and hit the side of a mountain. It was subsequently determined that a [...] southerly wind created a downdraft effect which, coupled with the aircraft's low altitude over the terrain, contributed to the crash.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} study develops {{a framework of}} indicators to evaluate the ‘institutional capacity’ of a municipality to implement the soft <b>path</b> <b>approach.</b> The soft <b>path</b> <b>approach</b> is a new strategy for water conservation that complements existing supply and demand water management regimes. The soft <b>path</b> <b>approach</b> aims to achieve sustainability by changing how individuals think about water and how water is used. The framework of indicators consists of qualitative descriptions of elements that should be present in a municipality to successfully implement the soft <b>path</b> <b>approach.</b> These indicators fit into eight themes: human resources, information resources, financial resources, policy and legal environment, political environment, community awareness and involvement, technological solutions, and practical considerations. These indicators are also applied to evaluate the institutional capacity of a case study (southern York Region, Ontario, Canada) for its potential to implement the soft <b>path</b> <b>approach.</b> The case study is compatible and equipped to implement the soft <b>path</b> <b>approach,</b> but this can only be accomplished if coordinated with other levels of government and external organizations...|$|R

500|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the trail is a water-powered prayer wheel, set in motion by a flowing stream. The water that is touched by the wheel is said to become blessed and carries its purifying power into all life forms in the oceans and lakes that it feeds into. On the <b>approach</b> <b>path</b> to the monastery, there is a Lakhang (village level monastery) and a temple of Urgyan Tsemo ("U-rgyan rTse-mo") which, like the main monastery, is located on a rocky plateau with a precipitous projection of several hundred feet over the valley. From this location, the monastery’s buildings are on the opposite ravine, which is known by the name “Copper-Colored Mountain Paradise of Padmasambhava”. This is the view point for visitors and there is a cafeteria to provide refreshments. The trek beyond this point is very scenic with the sound of the water fall breaking the silence. Along the trek route blue pine trees, prayer flags and kiosks selling paraphernalia for worship (such as prayer wheels, temple bells and skulls) are seen. The route is scattered with number of temples. On this path, a large water fall, which drops by [...] into a sacred pool, is forded over by a bridge. The track terminates at the main monastery where colorful paintings are displayed. Guru Rinpoche's cave where he meditated is also seen. This cave is opened for public viewing only once a year.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Optimal policy {{recommendations}} from natural resource management models can involve fast-changing management interventions. Actual policies often change more gradually, potentially reflecting {{costs associated with}} policy adjustment. We examine how including policy adjustment costs changes {{policy recommendations}} in models of fishery management. Specifically, we examine cases where policy adjustment costs increase at an increasing rate with {{the rate of change}} of fishing effort levels. We examine how accounting for these costs changes optimal management strategies in static and time-varying environments. Increasing policy adjustment costs results in optimal <b>approach</b> <b>paths</b> to stationary optimal solutions that are more gradual but that rely on oscillatory convergence. In time-varying environments, including policy adjustment costs smoothes optimal management recommendations, resulting in decreased variation in effort levels on the stationary part of the optimal solution, but increased variation in optimal stock sizes. We conclude that accounting for policy adjustment costs in this way leads to management recommendations that in some ways would be simpler for managers to implement (more gradual <b>approach</b> <b>paths),</b> but in other ways more challenging (oscillatory convergence) and that can affect where environmental variability is expressed in model predictions (stock sizes versus effort levels) while not suppressing this variability altogether...|$|R
