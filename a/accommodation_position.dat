40|$|The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) has {{released}} a Specialist Disability <b>Accommodation</b> <b>Position</b> Paper on Draft Pricing and Payments. This is the NDIA’s strategy {{to increase the}} long-term supply of housing for National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) participants. It aims to foster the development of innovative housing solutions. Young people with disability living in nursing homes {{are one of the}} most marginalised and isolated groups of people in our society. More than 6, 200 people under the age of 65 are stuck in nursing homes. Another 200 people under 50 are admitted to nursing homes each year. This is a serious social issue that can and must be fixed. The NDIS will provide crucial funding for the support that these people need to live in the community. However, the NDIS cannot on its own stop the inappropriate placement of young people in nursing homes. More accessible and affordable housing needs to be built. The policy outlined in NDIA Special Disability <b>Accommodation</b> <b>position</b> paper is designed to pay for the cost of housing for 28, 000 NDIS participants with high support needs. The housing payment rates set by the NDIA cover the high costs of development and ongoing maintenance required by people with disability. After decades of underinvestment, governments have made the funding available to replicate and scale a range of innovative housing and support options.  For people with disability who have the highest need for support and accessibility, the NDIS housing payment will bridge the gap between what people with disability can reasonably afford and the cost of building highly accessible housing. This policy lays the foundation for developing the range and scale of housing needed. The NDIS housing payment and policy provides a unique opportunity to trial some innovative, transformative financing models that could be used to fund social housing for other disadvantaged people, including a broader group of people with disability. The next step is for investors and the housing sector to come together and create the revolution in housing that young people in nursing homes have been waiting for...|$|E

40|$|The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 {{requires}} that employers provide 2 ̆ 2 reasonable accommodations 2 ̆ 2 for qualified {{individuals who have}} a disability, provided that doing so does not result in 2 ̆ 2 undue hardship 2 ̆ 2. There are several guidelines that employers {{have been given to}} evaluate the reasonableness of job accommodations.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for training}} the human visual accommodation system is described. Specifically, the apparatus {{is useful for}} training personnel to volitionally control focus to the far point (normally infinity) {{from a position of}} myopia due to functional causes. The functional causes could be due, for example, to a behavioral accommodative spasm or the effects of an empty field. The device may also be used to measure accommodation, the <b>accommodation</b> resting <b>position</b> and the near and far points of vision. The device comprises a number of optical elements arranged on a single optical axis. Several of the elements are arranged in order on a movable stage in fixed relationship to each other: a light source, a lens, a target, an aperture and/or a second lens. On a base and in fixed relationship to each other are eyepiece and third lens. A stage generates an image of the target and the stage is movable with respect to the base by means of a knob. The device is utilized for the various training and test functions by following a series of procedural steps, and interchanging the apertures as necessary for the selected procedure...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the growth of supramolecular columns of polyaromatic {{hydrocarbons}} on Au(111) and Cu(111) single-crystal surfaces. The lateral separation of the columns was found {{to depend on the}} substrate and is determined by the commensurately formed superlattice of the first molecular monolayer. X-ray photoelectron diffraction in combination with low-energy electron diffraction reveals stack growth with small lateral offsets from the column axis but with conservation of the molecular orientation. The mechanism of column growth is explained by simulation results of the intermolecular interaction assuming a Lennard-Jones potential. The size of hexabenzocoronene and its ability to condense into one- dimensional supramolecular structures make it an ideal candidate for the <b>accommodation</b> and the <b>positioning</b> of functional groups to form a functional molecular assembly...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the dynamics of}} accommodative and pupillary responses to random-dot stereograms presented in crossed and uncrossed disparity in six visually normal young adult subjects (mean age= 25. 8 ± 3. 1 years). Accommodation and pupil measures were monitored monocularly with a custom built photorefraction system while subjects fixated {{at the center of}} a random-dot stereogram. On each trial, the stereogram initially depicted a flat plane and then changed to depict a sinusoidal corrugation in depth while fixation remained constant. Increase in disparity specified depth resulted in pupil constriction during both crossed and uncrossed disparity presentations. The change in pupil size between crossed and uncrossed disparity conditions was not significantly different (p> 0. 05). The change in pupil size was also accompanied by a small concomitant increase in accommodation. In addition, the dynamic properties of pupil responses varied as a function of their initial (starting) diameter. The finding that accommodation and pupil responses increased with disparity regardless of the sign of retinal disparity suggests that these responses were driven by apparent depth rather than shifts in mean simulated distance of the stimulus. Presumably the need for the increased depth of focus when viewing stimuli extended in depth results in pupil constriction which also results in a concomitant change in <b>accommodation.</b> Starting <b>position</b> effects in pupil response confirm the non-linearity in the operating range of the pupil...|$|R

40|$|As {{the need}} for robotic {{manipulation}} in fields such as manufacturing and telerobotics increases, so does {{the need for}} effective methods of controlling the interaction forces between the manipulators and their environment. <b>Position</b> <b>Accommodation</b> (PA) {{is a form of}} robotic force control where the nominal path of the manipulator is modified in response to forces and torques sensed at the tool-tip of the manipulator. The response is tailored such that the manipulator emulates a mechanical impedance to its environment. PA falls under the category of position-based robotic force control, and may be viewed as a form of Impedance Control. The practical implementations are explored of PA into an 18 degree-of-freedom robotic testbed consisting of two PUMA 560 arms mounted on two 3 DOF positioning platforms. Single and dual-arm architectures for PA are presented along with some experimental results.

40|$|Three main diffusion-based {{models are}} {{currently}} {{used to study}} grain-size distributions. In this paper, two of these approaches - perfect sorting and imperfect sorting - are compared in a parameter study. First, the numerical solution of the imperfect-sorting model is extensively discussed, and numerical tests are performed. Then, the two sedimentation models are compared for a basin under varying conditions. For some of the imposed variations, predictions of both models differ markedly due to the different approach. The position of the gravel front in the perfect sorting model depends on gravel input and proximal <b>accommodation</b> space. The <b>position</b> of grain-size boundaries in the imperfect-sorting model is strongly controlled by gravel input, {{the position of the}} basin axis and the difference in diffusivities. As a result, those two models may predict gravel progradation for different situations. Both models suggest that gravel progradation should always be coupled with sedimentation rates in order to suggest an explanation of gravel progradation observed in the geological record. Simulations with the imperfect sorting model show that this criterion may also fail, showing that a unique interpretation of gravel progradation may be impossible. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

These devices have become essential for human communication but also include a more comprehensive tool set to support productivity and leisure applications. However, the many applications commonly available are not adapted to people with special needs. Rather, most popular devices are targeted at teenagers or young adults with excellent eyesight and coordination. What is worse, most of the commonly used assistive control interfaces are not available in a mobile environment where user’s <b>position,</b> <b>accommodation</b> and capacities can vary even widely.

40|$|Previous {{academic}} research {{which focused on}} girls’ behaviour tended {{to do so by}} looking at behaviour in terms of the extremes: by either exploring the perceptions and experiences of girls who appear to behave well, or alternatively, by researching girls who are categorised as extreme misbehavers, in institutions such as Pupil Referral Units. This ethnographic study was undertaken in a state secondary school setting over one academic year. The research centred on girls who were in Years 10 and 11, and is an exploration of the micro performances of their behaviour in the school. The ethnographic nature of the research allowed an in depth focus on girls’ micro performances in school. The feminist influenced thesis seeks to explore girls’ constructions of gender, how this is negotiated alongside their wider performances as pupils in the school and is subsequently recognised (by themselves and others), as performances of particular behaviour. The research draws on Goffman’s (1959) conceptualisation of performance and impression management, Butler (1990), theoretical notions of performativity and Foucault’s (19757 : 1978) theories of power, discourse and surveillance, to explore how gender and behaviour are being understood in this context. The study sought to explore the world from the girls’ viewpoint to understand the complexity of their experiences more fully. The research examines not only how the girls were positioned in terms of their perceived behaviour, but also how they responded to this positioning (their resistance and <b>accommodation</b> of these <b>positions,</b> and the shifting nature of these positionings across time) and how these were often perceived in relation to particular gendered expectations. The originality of the research stems from findings about issues of self-harm, panic attacks, authenticity, social media, middle class girls and fighting, which lie in the rich and detailed empirical data arising from the study. The significance of these findings draws these multiple threads together, giving insight into gender positioning and behaviour, and the study privileges the girls’ voices as they discuss their feelings and the effects of these issues on them, complicating previous research...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the world, {{including}} South Africa, various {{approaches have}} been identified and implemented {{in an attempt to}} ensure that employees in physically-demanding positions are properly managed from a physical work capacity point of view, the primary goal always being to return the employee in need of assistance to full working capacity as soon as possible. The burning question has, however, always remained: “What happens to the employee in the meantime?” This study focused on exactly that question, the aim being to develop a comprehensive tool to assist all parties concerned in managing the affected employee through the application of task-specific job accommodation. The predetermined goal {{of the study was to}} develop a task-specific job accommodation tool for a physically-demanding position. This was achieved through a number of steps, which included an extensive literature review, a thorough job analysis, identification of a suitable test battery with related minimum physical requirements and cut scores, interviews, and the eventual development of the tool. Once the task-specific job accommodation tool was completed, the next step was to make use of three case studies to assist in illustrating the way the tool is to be implemented, as well as to show the potential value of its implementation. The information from three actual incapacity cases in the company concerned was used for these case studies. The results from this study are extremely positive and the three case studies have provided a glimpse of the potential value that could be added through the implementation of the job accommodation tool. The final product will greatly assist the company concerned in managing incapacitated employees in a manner that is beneficial to both the company and the individuals involved. Hopefully, this study will contribute to bring about a new era in the way South African companies and their occupational health departments approach the management of their incapacitated employees.

40|$|A policy {{shift in}} {{the last decade or so}} has led to an {{emphasis}} on demand side subsidies in the form of rent assistance and decreasing importance placed on the supply of public housing for low-income people. This initiative has led to an increased need for low-income people to rely on the private rental market for longterm <b>accommodation.</b> This <b>Positioning</b> Paper presents a framework for examining the impact of "security of tenure" on low- and moderate-income renters in the private rental sector in Queensland. While various researchers have applied the term "security of tenure" to interpret findings and located the principle within varying frameworks, usage of the term encompasses a common core of meanings that all refer to the provision for continued occupation of a dwelling. In this context, it has become identified with specific initiatives (such as enhancing access to longer-term leases or reforms oriented to just-cause eviction) aimed at promoting key housing policy outcomes such as stability, independence and choice. The project informed by this paper specifically examines the current demand for various measures associated with legal provisions for security of tenure on the part of low- and moderate-income renters in Queensland. An important context for this examination is the very high levels of mobility displayed by this group in the private rental sector. A key question for policy makers is the extent to which this mobility is due to issues associated with insecurity of tenure, and the strategies that could be employed to provide greater choice with respect to mobility through intervention. Aim Of The Project This study is to investigate the extent to which low- to moderate-income households actively choose to move between dwellings, and what level of importance these households attach to security of tenure. The objectives of the study are to better understand: · The experiences and expectations of security of tenure among low-income and other groups of private renters; · The extent to which security of tenure is regarded as important by private renters vis-à-vis housing flexibility in the private rental market; · For whom, and in what circumstances, increased security of tenure in the private rental market would be attractive; andHow increased security of tenure might alter the housing careers of private renters, including demand for housing assistance. (Housing assistance to include public housing private rental (bond loans) and homeownership assistance). Policy Context The capacity of the private rental market to meet the needs of consumers requiring longer-term accommodation in the sector is a critical policy question. Private renters currently display very high levels of mobility. For those seeking to move to public housing, insecurity of tenure is often cited along with problems of affordability as a motivating factor. In seeking to address the research questions listed above, the study will fill an important knowledge gap by: · Providing data on access - and priorities attached to - security of tenure in selected Queensland regions; · Identifying commonalities and differences in needs of different segments of the private rental market with respect to security of tenure; · Providing information on how renters balance and trade off different aspects of private rental housing (for example, balancing security with affordability); and · Providing indicators that can be used as a benchmark of housing security with a specific focus on the private rental market, including appropriate measures and methodologies. Methodology The major source of data for this study will be gathered through a telephone survey of 1, 000 private rental tenants from inner Brisbane and the city of Ipswich. The current research will build on earlier survey work that has tapped similar concepts (for example, mobility, housing decision compromises) but extend the scope of the survey consistent with the proposed conceptual framework. Interviewees for the current study will be drawn from Queensland’s Rental Tenancy Authority’s bond lodgement database. To inform the construction of the survey instrument, two focus groups were conducted to generate possible meanings of security of tenure amongst low- to moderate-income renters. Combined with the findings from the literature review, the focus group material helps identify the scope of the questions required in the survey so that the complexity of the meanings, value and influence of security of tenure considerations in housing decision-making can be thoroughly canvassed. To enhance the robustness of the researchers’ interpretation of the survey data, a second set of focus group discussions will be undertaken. Focus group participants will be asked to clarify any significant patterns of convergence and divergence, which emerge from the preliminary analysis of the survey responses. Conclusion The research informed by this paper will identify the importance of tenure security in the private rental sector in the context of renters’ needs for flexibility due to labour market, family, income and other constraints. The study will provide information on the expectations and experiences of tenure security on the part of different low- and middle- income renters. It will identify the categories of renters for whom tenure security is a critical issue and explore the likely impact of greater tenure security on their housing careers...|$|R
