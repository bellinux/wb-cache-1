40|$|The {{objective}} of this document is to report and interpret {{the findings of the}} isolation barrier <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> performed in 105 KW/ 100 K. The tests were performed in accordance with the <b>test</b> plan and <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> procedure. The <b>test</b> <b>report</b> contains the <b>test</b> data.

A discussion of the leak rate analytical characterization describes how the flow characteristics flow rate will be determined using the test data from the <b>test</b> <b>report.</b> Two modes of water loss were considered; basin and/or discharge chute leakage, and evaporation. An initial test established baseline leakage data and instrumentation performance. Test 2 evaluated the sealing performance of the isolation barrier by inducing an 11 in. (27. 9 cm) level differential across the barrier. The leak rate at this 11 in. (27. 9 cm) level is extrapolated to the 16 ft. (4. 9 m) level differential postulated in the DBE post seismic event. If the leak rate, adjusted for evaporation and basin leakage (determined from Test 1), is less than the SAR limit of 1, 500 gph (5, 680 lph) at a 16 ft (4. 9 m) level differential, the barriers pass the <b>acceptance</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS: This {{report is}} about the Power Supply onboard the AAU Cubesat, which is a student {{satellite}} designed at Aalborg University. First the space environment is analyzed in order to specify the requirements to the product.

When the module tests have been completed with a satisfying result, the different hardware parts are integrated and tested. After that the product is evaluated and a conclusion on the product is made. Because of time shortages the project has not ended with satisfying results, since work had to be abandoned before the product was brought to an functional level suited for the system <b>acceptance</b> <b>test.</b> Preface This <b>report</b> is written by seven students from the fifth semester of the electronic engineering education of th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In Executable Acceptance Test Driven Development, <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> {{represent}} {{the requirements of}} a software system. As requirements change over time, the <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> have to be updated and maintained.

Refactoring of <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> is used to keep the fixtures and the <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> definitions consistent...|$|R
50|$|The {{customer}} specifies scenarios to test when a user {{story has}} been correctly implemented.

Customers are responsible for verifying the correctness of the <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> and reviewing test scores to decide which failed tests are of highest priority. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> are also used as regression tests prior to a production release. A user story is not considered complete until it has passed its <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests.</b> This means that new <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> must be created for each iteration or the development team will report zero progress.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of good software <b>testing</b> is often <b>reported.</b> Traditionally, <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> {{is the last}} stage of the testing process before release to the customer. Unfortunately, {{it is not always}} appropriate to wait so long for customer feedback. Emerging agile methods recognise this and promote close interaction between the customer and developers for early <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing,</b> often before implementation commences. Indeed, Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) is a process that uses customer interaction to define tests and tool support to automate and execute these. However, with existing tools, tests are usually written from new descriptions or rewritten from existing documentation. Here, the challenge is to allow developers and customers to annotate existing documentation and automatically generate <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> without rewrites or new descriptions.
