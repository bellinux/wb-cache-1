25|$|Andrew and Martha Stewart {{moved to}} Westport, Connecticut, where they {{purchased}} and restored the 1805 farmhouse on Turkey Hill Road {{that would later}} become {{the model for the}} TV studio of Martha Stewart Living. During the project, Stewart's panache for restoring and decorating became apparent. In 1976, Stewart started a catering business in her basement with a friend from her modeling days, Norma Collier. The venture quickly became successful but soured when Collier alleged that Stewart was difficult to work with, and was also taking catering jobs on the side. Stewart soon bought her portion of the business. Stewart was also hired as the manager of a gourmet food store, the Market Basket, but after a disagreement with the owners at the mini-mall she was forced out <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> own store.|$|E

John Walker from MTV felt that throughout the fans' personal struggles [...] "music has helped these individuals persevere and continue to enjoy life.

Charlotte Runcie of The Daily Telegraph also awarded the same show 5 stars <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> positive review with [...] "When it comes to sheer innovation, showmanship and creativity in contemporary pop, Beyoncé has everyone else beaten". Reviewing the first show in London, Lewis Corner of Digital Spy awarded the show 5 stars, noting [...] "Her often formidable and fearsome choreography throughout numbers like [...] "Run The World (Girls)", [...] "Bow Down" [...] and [...] "End Of Time" [...] is powerful and mesmerising, but is then offset by the tenderness of [...] "1+1", [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] and [...] "Runnin (Lose It All)". Beyoncé's dynamic ability to be both vigorous and vulnerable can't be matched by her contemporaries. In fact, we'd go as far to say she's effortlessly proven herself to be this generation's Michael Jackson".|$|E

He then heard a horse galloping towards them and told her, [...] "There comes a man on a horse. If you report this to officers I'll come back and kill you."
