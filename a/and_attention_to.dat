5|$|Released on July 12, 1986 by Random House, Through a Glass Darkly {{landed on}} The New York Times Best Seller list. Critical {{reception}} was largely mixed, with reviewers {{focusing on the}} novel's prose <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> historical detail. It has been translated into more than ten languages.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a milestone of its genre, earning praise from critics for its grandeur <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail. Film scholars have welcomed its portrayal of enduring themes, but question its historical accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was well-received and praised for its {{animation}} <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail. It premiered as a short before Studio Ghibli's Whisper of the Heart {{and has since}} been released on Laserdisc and DVD as part of All Things Ghibli Special Short Short.|$|E

5|$|After {{catching}} {{very few}} passes {{in high school}} and college, Berry was drafted in the 20th round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the Colts and was considered a long shot to even make the team's roster. Diminutive and unassuming, his subsequent rise to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been touted as one of American football's Cinderella stories. He made up for his lack of athleticism through rigorous practice <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail, and was known for his near-perfect route running and sure handedness. Berry was a favorite target of quarterback Johnny Unitas, and the two were regarded as the dominant passing and receiving duo of their era.|$|E
5|$|Angel Beats! {{received}} generally positive reviews by critics. The {{integration of}} various individual elements together, such as musical performances, humor and action, was commended in one review but panned in another, {{saying that the}} story was overloaded with too many elements. P.A.Works was praised for the animation of the action sequences <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail with the weapons used. A major flaw noted by critics, however, is that the anime is too short, which leaves many of the characters with untold back-stories. The anime was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Another survivor, Radomir Krnjajić, {{recalled}} {{that they were}} fed a variety of foods, including pumpkin soup, cucumbers, beets and similar vegetables, and sometimes received a little macaroni or beans, but very little bread. The historian Ivan Fumić concludes that the children were systematically punished for various infractions, and were treated harshly by the Ustaše {{and the majority of}} the nuns. Some of the nuns at the camp, however, did show love <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the children. Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns beat the children with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E

5|$|Chloi Rad (IGN) {{wrote that}} the game was {{theatrical}} and diorama-like in its display <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail. Andrew Reiner (Game Informer) called its graphics among the best-looking smartphone games, from the vibrancy of its environments to the fluidity of its animations. While Rad felt that the game presented little challenge as a minor complaint, Reiner considered its final puzzles disproportionately challenging.|$|E
5|$|During the war the Polish 1st Armoured Division {{had been}} based in Scotland, {{establishing}} {{ties between the}} community and Poland. Joan promoted a special relationship with the Technical University of Lodz, and also devoted care <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the children's hospital of that city.

5|$|The only goal of {{the match}} came in the second half; Arsenal {{substitute}} Gilberto Silva on his debut collected a pass from Dennis Bergkamp and struck the ball through goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek's legs. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger praised the match-winner in his post-match interview, while opposing manager Gérard Houllier felt {{the result showed that}} his team needed more game time <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> passing, in order to improve. The result meant Arsenal was the first team to win the Shield outright 11 times, while it marked Liverpool's first defeat at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E

Still their friendship by no means adequately represented the object she had in view {{when she came to}} Milby, and it had been for some time clear to her that she must suggest a new change of residence to her brother.|$|R
5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and her {{lack of interest in}} producing children's books.|$|E
5|$|With his group, Glicken {{compiled}} a landmark {{study in the}} field of volcanic landslides, establishing the principle that tall volcanoes have a tendency to collapse. The study garnered praise for its unique conclusions <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail, inspiring volcanologists to identify similar deposit mounds at volcanoes around the world. After the findings from his dissertation were published in several shorter articles throughout the 1980s, Glicken earned recognition as the first geologist to explain the creation of hummock fields near tall volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{economic}} development {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became {{a major part of}} the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest, and the United States achieved great power status. These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements. This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> worker conditions.|$|E

5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), <b>and</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E
