25|$|Fischer {{was born}} in Gerabronn in Baden-Württemberg, the third child of a butcher, whose family had lived in Budakeszi, Hungary, for several generations. Fischer's family had to leave Hungary in 1946 after it was {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union, and ethnic Germans were persecuted and expelled by the authorities. His nickname Joschka {{is derived from the}} Hungarian Jóska, diminutive of Joseph (Hungarian József). He was brought up Catholic and served in his childhood as an altar boy in his parish in Oeffingen. Fischer {{dropped out of high school}} in 1965, and started an apprenticeship as a photographer, which he quit in 1966. Because Fischer never gained a school-leaving certificate, he never attended a university or a college. He neither did compulsory military service nor the <b>alternative</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>service</b> for conscientious objectors, because he failed his physical examination due to poor eyesight.|$|E
500|$|The {{conscription}} legislation {{introduced the}} right to refuse military service, allowing for conscientious objectors to be absolutely exempted, to perform <b>alternative</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>service,</b> or {{to serve as a}} non-combatant in the army, according {{to the extent to which}} they could convince a Military Service Tribunal of the quality of their objection. Around 16,500 men were recorded as conscientious objectors, with Quakers playing a large role. 4,500 objectors were sent to work on farms to undertake [...] "work of national importance", 7,000 were ordered non-combatant duties as stretcher bearers, but 6,000 were forced into the army, and when they refused orders, they were sent to prison, as in the case of the Richmond Sixteen.|$|E

In 2000, Agdestein introduced Carlsen to Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen, a former Norwegian junior champion and later International Master (IM) and Grandmaster (GM), as Ringdal served a one-year [...] (an <b>alternative</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>service</b> programme) at the college. Over {{the course of this}} year, Carlsen's rating rose from 904 in June 2000, to 1907. Carlsen's breakthrough occurred in the Norwegian junior teams championship in September 2000, where Carlsen scored 3½/5 against the top junior players of the country, and a performance rating (PR) of about 2000. Apart from chess, which he studied about three to four hours a day, Carlsen's favourite pastimes included playing football and reading Donald Duck comics. Carlsen also practised skiing until the age of ten.|$|E
