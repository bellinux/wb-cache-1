50|$|Simson was a German {{company which}} {{produced}} firearms, automobiles, bicycles and motorcycles, and mopeds. Under the Third Reich, the factory {{was taken from}} the Jewish Simson family, and was renamed several times under Nazi and later Communist control.

50|$|Safely {{riding a}} moped mostly {{requires}} the same considerations as safely riding a motorcycle but the lower speeds, while reducing some dangers, increases others. The biggest {{danger is that}} other traffic may not notice {{the presence of a}} moped - bright clothes and reflective fittings help. Drivers may even see the moped, recognize it as harmless to them and simply forget it's there, pulling out of side-turnings into its path. Similarly, a car approaching a moped from behind will approach it more quickly than the driver expects, and the driver's attention may be more attuned to other automobile traffic rather than the moped, increasing the likelihood of an accident. This is <b>a</b> particular problem <b>for</b> <b>mopeds</b> used on high-speed roads where they may not be intended to travel.|$|R
40|$|In Austria since 1997 15 {{year old}} people instead of 16 year old {{are allowed to}} have <b>a</b> driving licence <b>for</b> <b>mopeds.</b> <b>As</b> this people of this age group are {{frequently}} involved in traffic accidents, the Austrian Ministry of Transport and Science financed this project {{in order to find}} ways to develop better target group oriented communication methods as a part of traffic education programs. This contribution will give an overview about this project (1). A discussion of the results ends with a catalogue of criteria for communication strategies, that should be taken into consideration whenever young people of an age of 15 / 16 are addressed in connection with traffic issues, be it directly or indirectly. This catalogue includes also requirements concerning the trainer or teacher, and it deals extensively with the contents and with the construction of messages...|$|R

Harley is <b>a</b> candidate <b>for</b> his <b>MOPED</b> (Mind Operated PErsonal Dematerialization) technology. This allows people to jump between alternative realities but will only operate on people with certain strands of DNA. The unit is disguised as a pair of training shoes, which Harley finds and tries on. At the same time Laarson is being executed by Mys-Tech's Techno-Wizards and agents were sent to find the MOPED units. In order to save her and the units, Laarson's subordinates activate the technology and send her to another universe.|$|R
