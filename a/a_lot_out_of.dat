The Constitutional Convention met for 43 days debating and writing the first California Constitution. The 1849 Constitution copied (with revisions) <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Ohio and New York Constitutions but had parts that were originally several different state constitutions as well as original material.|$|E

The Intertoto and UEFA Cup expedition took <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the players – but the team started the season sharper than the others, resulting in a comfortable upper-midtable position by the halfway point of the season. Tiredness, loss of form and a build-up of injuries resulted in a slide downwards towards the end of the season, eventually resulting in a ninth-place finish and a third consecutive year in the top half.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the railway}} was {{successful}} in technical and service terms, it is doubtful whether the shareholders got any of their money back and Brogdens had invested <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> 8,678 shares issued (as of August 1866), Alexander had taken 792. By November 1867 £150,000 had been raised by shares and only £2,600 by debentures. In October 1868, shareholders funds were unchanged but debentures stood at £180,000, loans £17,500 and creditors at £65,000. It follows that Alexander's share investment, now lost, had been about £13,700, plus one share of £1,000 in the Mont Cenis Concessionary Company which had been formed earlier to negotiate concessions from the two governments.|$|E

On the first play of the drive, wide receiver Bryan Still {{broke away from the}} Tennessee defense and was wide open for a pass. Maurice DeShazo threw the ball to Still, but Still dropped the pass after it bounced off his chest, thus denying the Hokies a touchdown. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer later cited the dropped pass as a critical turning point in the game, saying, [...] "I think if he could have made that catch, we could have gotten back in the game." [...] Tech player Torrian Gray agreed, saying, [...] "When he dropped the ball, that took <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> us."

She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet.

6000|$|Just {{after he}} had {{finished}} his protest, three or four linnets flew down and were caught. Taking them from the nets, he showed them to me, remarking, with a short laugh, {{that they were all}} young males. Then he thrust them down the stocking-leg which served as an entrance to the covered box he kept his birds in--the black hole in which their captive life begins, where they were now all vainly fluttering to get out. Going back to the previous subject, he said that he knew very well that many persons disliked a bird-catcher, but there was one thing that nobody could say against him--he wasn't cruel; he caught, but didn't kill. He only killed when he caught a great number of female linnets, which were not worth sending up; he pulled their heads off, and took them home to make a linnet pie. Then, by way of contrast to his own merciful temper, he told me of the young nest-destroyer I have writ-ten about. It made him mad to see such things! Something ought to be done, he said, to stop a boy like that; for by destroying so many nestlings he was taking the bread out of the bird-catcher's mouth. Passing to other subjects, he said that so far he had caught nothing but linnets on the common--you couldn't expect to catch other kinds in June. Later on, in August and September, there would be a variety. But he had small hopes of catching goldfinches, they were too scarce now. Greenfinches, yellow-hammers, common buntings, reed sparrows--all such birds were worth only tuppence apiece. Oh, yes, he caught them just the same, and sent them up to London, but that was all they were worth to him. For young male linnets he got eightpence, sometimes tenpence; for hen birds fourpence, or less. I dare say that eightpence was what he hoped to get, seeing that young male linnets are not unfrequently sold by London dealers for sixpence and even fourpence. Goldfinches ran to eighteenpence, sometimes as much as two shillings. Starlings he had made <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of,</b> but that was all past and over. Why? ...|$|E
