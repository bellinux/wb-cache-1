60|$|Chauvelin {{had been}} weak once, had allowed the prize to slip through his fingers; {{it must not}} occur again. He has a {{wonderful}} head for devising plans, but he needs <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> to aid him, so {{that he may not}} fail again.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{immediately}} the slate seemed seized by <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand.</b> It began to slide {{back and forth}} across the table violently, twisting and clattering. The youth put forth his own great strength and stopped it, but a crunching sound announced that the slate was broken.|$|R
5000|$|Even if a cheat deals himself <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand,</b> {{he may not}} win {{much money}} if every other player has nothing, so often the cheat will stack two hands, with one player {{receiving}} a strong hand and the cheater getting an even stronger one. This is called a [...] "double duke".|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the psychic began to toss and writhe and moan pitifully. Her {{suffering}} mounted to a paroxysm at last; then silence fell {{for a minute}} or two--absolute stillness; and in this hush the table took life, rose, and slid away toward us as if shoved by <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> {{fell upon}} Shefford's shoulder, startling him. Nas Ta Bega stood there, looking down upon him and Fay. Never had the Indian seemed so dark, inscrutable of face. But in his {{magnificent}} bearing, {{in the spirit}} that Shefford sensed in him, there were nobility and power and a strange pride.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Dumps {{found his}} muzzle grasped and held tight in <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand.</b> He tried to bark and yell, but could produce {{nothing better than}} a {{scarcely}} audible whine. His sides were {{at the same instant}} grasped by <b>a</b> pair of <b>powerful</b> knees, while <b>a</b> rope was twisted round his neck, and the process of strangulation began.|$|R
5000|$|In Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, Daimyo Date Masamune is {{available}} as a daimyo unit. In the game, he {{is available}} with Shogunate wonder, only for Japanese civilization. Daimyos can receive shipments and train troops, while they are <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> cavalry unit. They also provide an attack boost to nearby troops.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Pill, {{with all}} his seeming levity, was <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> at revivals, as was {{developed}} at the [...] "protracted" [...] meetings at the Grove during December. Indeed, such was the pitiless intensity of his zeal that a gloom was cast over the whole township; the ordinary festivities stopped or did not begin at all.|$|R
60|$|The big cowboy {{seemed to}} vibrate with a shock. All the ruddy warmth left his face; his jaw began to bulge; the corded veins {{in his neck}} stood out in knots. In an instant he had a hard, stern, strange look. He shot out <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> that {{fastened}} {{in the front of}} Duane's blouse.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Pill, {{with all}} his seeming levity, was <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> at revivals, as was {{developed}} at the [...] "protracted" [...] meetings held at the Corners during December.

60|$|There Mr Brassey, the lion, {{promptly}} introduced himself, {{and requested}} the loan {{of her purse}} and watch! The poor girl at once understood her position, and turned to fly, but <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> on her arm prevented her. Then she tried to shriek, but <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> on her mouth prevented that also. Then she fainted. Not wishing {{to be found in}} an awkward position, Mr Brassey and the Slogger searched her pockets hastily, and, finding nothing therein, retired precipitately from the scene, taking her little dog with them. As they did so the young girl recovered, sprang wildly up, and rushing back through the court and alley, dashed into the main thoroughfare. The two thieves saw her attempt to cross, saw a cab-horse knock her down, saw a crowd rush to the spot and then saw no more, owing to pressing engagements requiring their immediate presence elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The film {{features}} {{a conflict between}} a powerless Harlequin and <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>Hand.</b> Harlequin is <b>an</b> artist who makes Sculptures.

30|$|Fuzzy {{set theory}} is <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> set for {{modeling}} uncertainty and vagueness in various problems arising {{in the field}} of science and engineering. It has a large number of application, for instance, in the computer programming [1], engineering problems [2], statistical convergence [3 â€“ 7], nonlinear operator [8], best approximation [9] etc. Particularly, fuzzy differential equation is a strong topic with large application areas, for example, in population models [10], civil engineering [11] and so on.|$|R
50|$|He {{gradually}} {{developed into}} a strong scrum half with <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> off, which assisted him in scoring over a hundred tries for the club. After breaking his leg in the first match of the season, he missed the entire 1935-36 season. Representative honours followed with appearances for Yorkshire, an RL XIII rep side and England in 1937 & 1939. He headed the club's try scoring charts in 1938-39 with 22, before the war affected his Trinity progress.|$|R
60|$|At last pure {{exhaustion}} {{threw him}} into a dreamless and profound slumber. The plunging of the little craft as it flew southward before a stiff breeze did not disturb him, {{and he did not}} awake until some one rudely seized his arm late on the following day. Then, in the firm belief that his dream had come true at last, he uttered a tremendous yell and struggled to rise, but <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> held him down, and a dark lantern revealed a coal-black face gazing at him.|$|R
60|$|He saw {{the first}} {{horseman}} lean sideways and fall. He saw another lurch in his saddle and heard a cry of pain. Then Wrangle, plunging in fright, lifted Venters and nearly threw him. He jerked the horse down with <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> and leaped into the saddle. Wrangle plunged again, dragging his bridle, that Venters had not had time to throw in place. Bending over with a swift movement, he secured it and dropped the loop over the pommel. Then, with grinding teeth, he looked {{to see what the}} issue would be.|$|R
50|$|He played {{representative}} cricket for Canterbury and Northern Districts from 1972-1985 captaining {{both teams}} with {{players such as}} John Wright, Geoff Howarth and Sir Richard Hadlee playing under his captaincy. Roddy Fulton was <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> left <b>handed</b> batsmen and occasionally bowled right arm medium pace.|$|R
40|$|We took an {{individual}} differences approach to explain revenge tendencies in powerholders. Across four experimental studies, chronically powerless individuals sought more revenge than chronically <b>powerful</b> individuals following <b>a</b> high power episode (Studies 1 and 2), when striking <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> pose (Study 3), and when making <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> gesture (Study 4). This relationship vanished when {{participants were not}} exposed to incidental power. A meta-analysis revealed that, relative {{to a lack of}} power or a neutral context, exposure to incidental power increased vengeance among the chronically powerless and reduced vengeance among the chronically powerful. These findings add to previous research on relations between power and aggression, and underscore the role of individual differences as a determinant of powerholders' destructive responses.

"Yes; a reporter; {{they want}} {{information}} in London {{as to the}} real state of the country, and {{this time of the}} year, Parliament not sitting--Ah; I understand, a flying commission and a summer tour. Well, I often wish I were a penman; but I never could do it. I'll read any day as long as you like, but that writing, I could never manage. My friend Morley is <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> at it. His journal circulates a good deal about here; and if as I often tell him he would only sink his high-flying philosophy and stick to old English politics, he might make a property of it.

5000|$|Van Der Luijt {{reflects}} {{a bit of}} a Keith Jarrett influence, particularly when he reaches for some wide gospel chord voicings. Essentially, however, he's his own man, with a muscular, surging swing and <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> left <b>hand.</b> Van Der Luijt doesn't quite sound like anyone else out there, which is certainly an asset. He's also an engaging, witty composer. - Allaboutjazz.com http://www.allaboutjazz.com ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the example}} on the left, South is the dealer {{and because he}} holds 14 high card points (HCP), he must open the bidding. If he were to open 1, his longest suit, he will get a 1 {{response}} from partner and according to Standard American methods, be obliged to rebid 1NT since a bid of 2 would be a reverse and show <b>a</b> more <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> than he has.|$|R
60|$|As Madeline {{shut her}} eyes and, staggering, was about to fall, {{apparently}} right under pounding hoofs, <b>a</b> rude, <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> clapped round her waist, clutched deep and strong, and swung her aloft. She felt a heavy blow when {{the shoulder of the}} horse struck her, and then a wrenching of her arm as she was dragged up. A sudden blighting pain made sight and feeling fade from her.|$|R
60|$|Instantly Tarzan {{realized}} that he was locked with a creature of almost superhuman strength. The sinewy fingers of <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> sought his throat while the other lifted the bludgeon above his head. But if the strength of the hairy attacker was great, great too was that of his smooth-skinned antagonist. Swinging a single terrific blow with clenched fist to the point of the other's chin, Tarzan momentarily staggered his assailant and then his own fingers closed upon the shaggy throat, as with the other hand he seized the wrist of the arm that swung the club. With equal celerity he shot his right leg behind the shaggy brute and throwing his weight forward hurled the thing over his hip heavily to the ground, at the same time precipitating his own body upon the other's chest.|$|R
5000|$|Kyle {{stepped in}} on late notice to fight AntÃ´nio [...] "Bigfoot" [...] Silva at Strikeforce: Henderson vs. Babalu II on December 4 in St. Louis, Missouri in a Heavyweight bout.

Kyle later revealed that he broke his hand during the fight.|$|R
6000|$|Yaqui {{put a hand}} on Gale's knee. It was <b>a</b> bronzed, scarred, <b>powerful</b> <b>hand,</b> always eloquent of meaning. The Indian was listening. His bent head, {{his strange}} dilating eyes, his rigid form, and that close-pressing hand, how these brought back to Gale the terrible lonely night hours on the lava! ...|$|R
60|$|Like a panther {{he leaped}} at her, {{fastened}} <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> {{at the neck}} of her blouse, jerked her to her knees, and began to drag her. Joan fought his iron grasp. The twisting and tightening of her blouse choked her utterance. He did not look down upon her, but she could see him, the rigidity of his body set in violence, the awful shade upon his face, the upstanding hair on his head. He dragged {{her as if she}} had been an empty sack. Like a beast he was seeking a dark place--a hole to hide her. She was strangling; a distorted sight made objects dim; and now she struggled instinctively. Suddenly the clutch at her neck loosened; gaspingly came the intake of air to her lungs; the dark-red veil left her eyes. She was still upon her knees. Cleve stood before her, like a gray-faced demon, holding his gun level, ready to fire.|$|R
50|$|A rematch {{was held}} on March the 1st, 2014, at the Alamodome of San Antonio, Texas. Contrary to what {{happened}} in the first fight, ChÃ¡vez came out more aggressive and proposed the fight. He kept the distance with the jab and landed power punches. In the eleventh round he landed <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> right <b>hand</b> that nearly knocked Vera out. ChÃ¡vez won via unanimous decision claiming the vacant WBC Continental Americas super middleweight title.|$|R
60|$|Lawrence chanced to be nearest to them. He saw at {{a glance}} what had occurred, and dashed down the hill-side at headlong speed. A wave was driving {{in front of the}} couple, who were now {{embedded}} nearly to their armpits, while streams of snow were hissing all round them, and the mass was beginning to rush. One look sufficed to show Lawrence that rescue from the side was impossible, but, with that swift power of perception which is aroused in some natures by the urgent call to act, he observed that some yards lower down--near the place where the ice-slope began-- there was a rock near to the side in the track of the avalanche, which it divided. Leaping down to this, he sprang into the sliding flood a little above it, and, with <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> effort, caught the rock and drew himself upon it. Next moment Emma was borne past out of reach of his hand. Lawrence rushed deep into the snow and held out his alpenstock. Emma caught it. He felt himself turned irresistibly round, and a sick feeling of despair chilled his life-blood. At the same moment <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> grasped his collar.|$|R
30|$|In recent years, {{the fuzzy}} theory {{has emerged as}} the most active area of {{research}} in many branches of mathematics and engineering. Fuzzy set theory is <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> set for modelling uncertainty and vagueness in various problems arising the field of science and engineering. Now a large number of research papers appear by using the concept of fuzzy set/numbers, and fuzzification of many classical theories has also been made. It has also very useful applications in various fields, for example, nonlinear operator [1], stability problem [2, 3], and so forth. The fuzzy topology [4 â€“ 8] proves to be a very useful tool to deal with such situations where the use of classical theories breaks down. One of the most important problems in fuzzy topology is to obtain an appropriate concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy metric space and an intuitionistic fuzzy normed space. These problems have been investigated by Park [9] and Saadati and Park [10], respectively, and they introduced and studied a notion of an intuitionistic fuzzy normed space. The topic of fuzzy topology has important applications as quantum particle physics. On the other hand, these problems are also important in modified fuzzy spaces [11 â€“ 14].|$|R
6000|$|The {{first thing}} that met his eyes was the {{helpless}} and desolate bulk {{of one of the}} Silsbee wagons a hundred rods away, bereft of oxen and pole, standing alone and motionless against the dazzling sky! Near it was the broken frame of another wagon, its fore wheels and axles gone, pitched forward on its knees like an ox under the butcher's sledge. Not far away there were the burnt and blackened ruins of a third, around which the whole party on foot and horseback seemed to be gathered. As the boy ran violently on, the group opened to make way for two men carrying some helpless but awful object between them. A terrible instinct made Clarence swerve from it in his headlong course, but he was at the same moment discovered by the others, and a cry arose of [...] "Go back!" [...] "Stop!" [...] "Keep him back!" [...] Heeding it no more than the wind that whistled by him, Clarence made directly for the foremost wagon--the one in which he and Susy had played. <b>A</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> caught his shoulder; it was Mr. Peyton's.|$|R
50|$|Stego is an evolved Stegosaurus and {{a rather}} dim-witted recruit when {{compared}} {{to the rest of the}} team. He tries to be brave, but is prone to panic attacks and general cowardice. However he often manages to get through this and has come to the rescue of his friends, particularly in the episode Trouble in Paradise. Stego can pull his head inside his Dinosaucers' uniform, much like a turtle. Stego also has an armored space ship similar to his race of Stegosaurs. Stego is <b>a</b> very <b>powerful</b> <b>hand</b> to hand combatant who doesn't realize his own strength. He can Dinovolve into a 30 foot Stegosaurus.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{suggested}} by the authors to be a good candidate for being the transitional species between the southern African ape-man Australopithecus africanus (the Taung Child, Mrs. Ples) and either Homo habilis or even a direct ancestor of Homo erectus (Turkana boy, Java man, Peking man). The species has long arms, like <b>an</b> ape, short <b>powerful</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>a</b> very advanced pelvis and long legs capable of striding and possibly running like a human.|$|R
