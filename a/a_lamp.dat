5|$|The Telugu {{version of}} the Yogatattva Upanishad has 142 verses, while the {{shortest}} surviving manuscript in Sanskrit is just 15 verses.

5|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{stated in}} 2003 {{that the film}} would use {{traditional}} stunt work {{so as to be}} consistent with the previous films. CGI was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts (such as when Indy swings on <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> with his whip). Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through crates. During the take, an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford. It did not go off and he was not injured.|$|E

5|$|This {{case had}} <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> and socket used by Hammer {{for the first}} {{electric}} sign ever made. It lit up the name EDISON letter by letter in sequence when a set of switches were turned on by hand – {{one at a time}} in order. It was constructed in December 1881 and hung up in 1882 at the Crystal Palace in London. The lamp bulbs in this case display were numbered 782 to 1031. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that were in this case.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E

Immediately after, the group believes that they see their old friend, Cleveland, who moved to Virginia, across the bar, but are disappointed when it is revealed to be <b>a</b> <b>lamp.</b> Peter {{then goes on to}} express his desire to finally replace Cleveland, stating that their group is just like the Muppets character Statler without Waldorf. Deciding to hold auditions for a replacement for their entourage, they first audition actor Kevin Connolly, who is discouraged from joining once Quagmire attempts to steal his Lucky Charms cereal.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> solar <b>lamp</b> {{also known}} as solar light or solar lantern, is a {{lighting}} system composed of <b>an</b> LED <b>lamp,</b> solar panels, battery, charge controller and {{there may also be}} <b>an</b> inverter.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of the fifth day, the Pokémon News Flash reports on a {{breaking}} news story: a disc containing the unaired fifth episode of Pichu Bros. was dropped and lost by the delivery Magnemite {{on their way to the}} show's broadcasting studio. After obtaining <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> from a friendly Duskull in the front lawn, the player takes a bus back to Mt. Snowfall, where the disc was presumed lost. Eastward are the Ruins of Truth, where the stubborn Ghost-type Pokémon Gengar blocks the player's path until it is scared away by the lamp. Inside the Ruins, Pikachu gets stuck inside a statue of the bat-like Pokémon Golbat. Upon being shaken free, the missing disc pops out. The player hands it back to Magnemite, who is waiting sheepishly outside, and heads home to watch the last episode, along with a video called Meowth's Party.|$|E
5|$|Reubens {{was born}} Paul Rubenfeld in Peekskill, New York, {{and grew up}} in Sarasota, Florida, where his parents, Judy (Rosen) and Milton Rubenfeld, owned <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> store.

5|$|Schumacher {{was born}} in Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, to Rolf Schumacher, a bricklayer, and his wife Elisabeth. When Schumacher was four, his father {{modified}} his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. When Schumacher crashed it into <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> post in Kerpen, his parents {{took him to the}} karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club. His father soon built him a kart from discarded parts and at the age of six Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf Schumacher took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} rock {{inscriptions}} near the temple. The discovery of three granite pillars with inscriptions of grants {{made to the}} shrine led {{to the discovery of}} the temple itself.

The third pillar has an inscription by Raja Raja Chola I. Apart from these, there are five other pillars with inscriptions by the Pallava kings Dantivarman I, Nandivarman III and Kambavarman, the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III and the Chola king Rajendra Chola III.|$|E
5|$|The agents {{track down}} Weems, a {{handyman}} at an apartment building. He refuses {{to testify against}} Cutrona. Weems has a fascination with Rube Goldberg machines. As such, his apartment is filled with them. After meeting with Weems, Scully concludes {{that there is no}} X-File, but Mulder believes that his luck is the X-File in question. As the agents begin to leave the complex, one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems. However, the assassin dies in an improbable cascade of events reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine: after being distracted when Mulder buzzes the intercom (when he forgot the car keys), he accidentally shoots <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> that knocks over an ironing board, then trips over the ironing board and ends up getting strangled in a fan. The two agents rush back up stairs and find Weems unscathed. Mulder notes that Weems was the sole survivor of a commuter jet crash that killed 20 people in December 1989, where he was placed in Seat 13 of Flight 7: lucky numbers.|$|E

50|$|The {{appropriately}} coloured lens, {{depending on}} the arm's position, is illuminated from behind by either <b>an</b> oil <b>lamp,</b> <b>a</b> gas <b>lamp,</b> or <b>an</b> incandescent <b>lamp</b> run at <b>a</b> low voltage (white LED clusters have also been tested for this purpose). Where a green light was required, a blue lens would usually be used. When combined with the mainly yellow-emitting flame of <b>an</b> oil <b>lamp,</b> this produced <b>a</b> green colour; {{it was important that}} the resultant colour was not even yellow-green in appearance, as this could have been confused for a distant signal at caution. Later signals using electric lamps used green lenses. Some signals converted to electric lamps from oil used a yellow-tinted bulb with the original blue lens to maintain the correct colour.|$|R
