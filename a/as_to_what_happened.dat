The drama focused on a British married couple, whose son goes missing while they are on holiday in France, and the subsequent years of enquiry trying to find answers <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to their son and why. Incidentally, Nesbitt and Karyo had appeared previously together in the Martin Sheen film The Way (2010).|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Dutch (Adam Baldwin), Romeo (Nolan North), and Mickey (Alan Tudyk) {{discussing}} the Covenant ship above New Mombasa, with the Rookie asleep nearby. Buck (Nathan Fillion) arrives and introduces Dare (Tricia Helfer). Romeo wakes the Rookie {{and the team}} enter their HEVs and drop through the atmosphere; at the last minute, Dare changes their trajectory to miss the ship. The Covenant ship enters slipspace, sending a shockwave toward the ODSTs; the Rookie's pod collides with Mickey's and crashes into a building on the ground, knocking him unconscious for six hours. He awakens and proceeds to find clues <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to his squadmates.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, Chappell toured South Africa with Richie Benaud's International Wanderers team, {{released}} his autobiography Chappelli {{and was named}} as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He was hired to spend the summer of 1976–77 as a guest professional in the Melbourne district competition where he was paid {{more than he had}} been as Australian captain. During the season, he was involved in a famous altercation with a young English all-rounder who was in Victoria on a cricketing scholarship, Ian Botham. Both men have put forward vastly different versions <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> during the physical confrontation in a Melbourne pub. The animosity between them continues and Channel Nine used it as a marketing ploy when Botham temporarily partnered Chappell as a television commentator during the 1998–99 season. Botham again revived the feud in his 2007 autobiography with another version of the incident.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} arose after Earp {{learned that}} one of his prize horses, stolen more than a year before, was in the possession of Ike Clanton and his brother Billy. Earp and Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Behan, who was riding in a wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton. Accounts differ <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> next. Earp later testified that {{when he arrived at the}} Clanton ranch, Billy Clanton gave up the horse even before being presented with ownership papers. According to Behan's testimony, however, Earp had told the Clantons that Behan was on his way to arrest them for horse theft. After the incident, which embarrassed both the Clantons and Behan, Behan testified that he did not want to work with Earp and chose Woods instead.|$|E

25|$|Accounts differ <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> next. According to one version, he {{was sentenced}} to death, but his penalty was {{commuted}} to hard labor. Others, however, suggests that he was in fact sentenced just once, with a total penalty of five years. The verdict came despite favorable testimonies in his favor from Călinescu and his colleagues in the Union of Patriots.

25|$|The early {{flight of}} Soviet {{officials}} {{who were supposed}} to manage the evacuation was roundly condemned by Soviet leaders, but often their retreat resulted from a realisation that evacuation procedures had started too late, {{and that there was no}} way to effectively execute it.

Avoiding that, the officials knew that they would be subject to intense interrogation <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> by suspicious Soviets upon returning to the fold.|$|E

25|$|At {{some time}} between 109AD and 122AD the {{garrison}} of the Ninth Legion {{was replaced by}} the Sixth Legion. There is no documented trace of the Ninth Legion after 117AD, and various theories have been proposed <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to it. The Sixth Legion remained in York until the end of Roman occupation about 400AD. The Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held court in York during their various campaigns. During his stay, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of Britannia Inferior, and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a colonia or city. Constantius I died during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress.|$|E
25|$|Accounts differ <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> next. Historians record that, {{following}} {{the destruction of}} the OP tanks, Wittmann dueled briefly without success with a Sherman Firefly before withdrawing. The Tiger is then reported to have continued eastwards to the outskirts of the town before being disabled by an anti-tank gun. However, Wittmann's own account contradicts this; he states that his tank was disabled by an anti-tank gun in the town centre. In less than fifteen minutes, thirteen or fourteen tanks, two anti-tank guns, and thirteen to fifteen transport vehicles had been destroyed by the Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, the vast majority attributed to Wittmann. He played no further role in the Battle of Villers-Bocage. For his actions during the battle, Wittmann was promoted to SS-Hauptsturmführer, and awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the history}} {{published}} by Omala Caldron on its website, the Daughters of Mokanna formed in 1919, in Rock Island, Illinois. This coincides with the secession of Amoo from Chicago and the founding of their own Supreme Caldron. They go one to describe how the ritual was decided upon and list the first four Daughters of Mokanna Caldrons – Amoo No. 1, Mohassan No. 2, Ankara, No. 3, and Zal No. 4. This would lead one to believe that Hapac was No. 5 as listed in the newspaper accounts. However, no account is given <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Koom Caldron No. 3, except that it shows up as participating in the Daughters of Mokanna national Convention in 1922. What remains unclear is when the Illinois group officially dropped the Witches and became Daughters; {{this has to be}} somewhere between 1920 and 1922.|$|E

25|$|As {{the first}} of the fleeing Highlanders {{approached}} Inverness they were met by a battalion of Frasers led by the Master of Lovat. Tradition states that the Master of Lovat immediately about-turned his men and marched down the road back towards Inverness, with pipes playing and colours flying. There are however varying traditions <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> at the bridge which spans the River Ness. One tradition is that the Master of Lovat intended to hold the bridge until he was persuaded against it. Another is that the bridge was seized by a party of Argyll Militia who were involved in a skirmish when blocking the crossing of retreating Jacobites. While it is almost certain there was a skirmish upon the bridge, it has been proposed that the Master of Lovat shrewdly switched sides and turned upon the fleeing Jacobites. Such an act would explain his remarkable rise in fortune in the years that followed.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} entered Genoa on 17 October and Bedford ranged alongside Modeste. Accounts then differ <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> next. A later French account {{stated that}} the British ship had moored alongside, and her master had civilly requested the French ship remove a boat that was hampering the British manoeuvres. The French readily agreed, but {{half an hour later}} the British captain asked the French to hoist the white flag, saying {{that he did not know}} what the tricolour was. Offended, the French refused, whereupon the British suddenly attacked the unprepared French, and captured the frigate. One British account states that Bedford came alongside and after warning the French not to resist, captured her after a short struggle, while another stated that while the fort was saluting the arrival of Rear-Admiral Gell, the French on Modeste came up on deck and behaved with such insolent gestures and language that the British attacked them. The British reported that two Frenchmen had been killed during the fighting on the tartanes, while French sources alternately reported five dead, thirty wounded, or between 30 and 40 killed. The attack outraged the Genoese, who were being threatened both by Drake and by representatives of the French republic, and created a diplomatic incident. The Genoes finally bowed to French pressure and ordered the expulsion of all foreigners, with the exception of the French. The Genoese broke all diplomatic ties; in response Gell's squadron began to blockade Genoa, capturing neutral merchants bound for the city.|$|E
500|$|Cromwell's body, {{hidden in}} {{the wall of the}} middle aisle of Henry VII Lady Chapel, took effort to exhume because the wood and cloth were {{difficult}} to shift. On 28 January 1661, the bodies of Cromwell and Ireton were taken to the Red Lion Inn in Holborn, joined the following day by the body of John Bradshaw, before being taken to Tyburn for execution. On the morning of 30 January 1661, the anniversary of the execution of King Charles I, the shrouded bodies in open coffins were dragged on a sledge through the streets of London to the gallows, where each body was hanged in full public view until around four o'clock that afternoon. After being taken down, Cromwell's head was severed with eight blows, placed on a wooden spike on a [...] pole, and raised above Westminster Hall. Various conspiracy theories exist <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to the body, including a rumour that Cromwell's daughter Mary had it rescued from the pit and interred at her husband's home at Newburgh Priory. A sealed stone vault was claimed to contain the remains of the headless Cromwell, but generations of the family have refused requests, including one from King Edward VII, to open it. Biographer John Morrill stated that it was more likely that Cromwell's body was thrown into the pit at Tyburn, where it remained.|$|E

500|$|On September 24 the Secret Service {{said they}} were {{investigating}} how Gonzalez was able to penetrate the White House grounds to such an extent. Director Julia Pierson said {{that in addition to}} an investigation, there would be an increase in security patrols and surveillance. District of Columbia representative Eleanor Holmes Norton sent a letter to Pierson requesting a meeting to discuss the Gonzalez incident as well as other security breaches at the White House, saying: [...] "Before any action is taken, the first step must be to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the White House breach. The next step is to recognize that the area in front of the White House, including Lafayette Park, is a First Amendment area, which must not be taken away from District of Columbia residents and the millions of other Americans who visit each year." [...] New York representative Peter T. King said the incident was [...] "absolutely inexcusable", adding: [...] "This demands a full investigation, an investigation <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> why it happened and what's being done to make sure it never happens again". Utah representative Jason Chaffetz said the incident was [...] "totally unacceptable" [...] and was just one of several security failings at the White House.

500|$|The Germans {{credited}} Richthofen with {{shooting down}} Ball, {{but there is}} some doubt <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> especially as Richthofen's claim was for a Sopwith Triplane, not an S.E.5, which was a biplane. Given the amount of propaganda the German High Command generated touting the younger Richthofen, a high-level decision may have been taken to attribute Ball's death to him. It is probable that Ball was not shot down at all, but had become disoriented and lost control during his final combat, the victim of a form of temporary vertigo that has claimed other pilots. [...] Ball's squadron harboured hopes that he was a prisoner of war, and the British government officially listed him as [...] "missing" [...] on 18 May. There was much speculation in the press; in France, the Havas news agency reported: [...] "Albert Ball, the star of aviators... has been missing since the 7th May. Is he a prisoner or has he been killed? If he is dead, he died fighting for his forty-fifth victory." [...] It was only {{at the end of the}} month that the Germans dropped messages behind Allied lines announcing that Ball was dead, and had been buried in Annoeullin with full military honours two days after he crashed. Over the grave of the man they dubbed [...] "the English Richthofen", the Germans erected a cross bearing the inscription In Luftkampf gefallen für sein Vaterland Engl. Flieger Hauptmann Albert Ball, Royal Flying Corps ("Fallen in air combat for his fatherland English pilot Captain Albert Ball").|$|E
