2500|$|Former Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd vocalist John Lydon {{alluded to}} sordid conduct by Savile, {{as well as}} {{suppression}} of widely held knowledge about such activity, in an October 1978 interview recorded for BBC Radio 1. Lydon stated: [...] "I'd like to kill Jimmy Savile; I think he's a hypocrite. I bet he's into all kinds of seediness that we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>about,</b> but {{are not allowed to}} talk about. I know some rumours." [...] He added: [...] "I bet none of this will be allowed out." [...] As predicted, the comment was edited out by the BBC prior to broadcasting, but the complete interview was included as a bonus track on a re-release of Public Image Ltd's 1978 debut album [...] in 2013, after Savile's death. In October 2014, Lydon expanded on his original quote, saying: [...] "By killed I meant locking him up and stopping him assaulting young children... I'm disgusted at the media pretending they weren't aware." ...|$|E

60|$|I am {{not going}} to enter here into the real {{doctrine}} of original sin, or into that probably false version of it which the New Theology writer calls the doctrine of depravity. But whatever else the worst doctrine of depravity may have been, it was a product of spiritual conviction; {{it had nothing to do}} with remote physical origins. Men thought mankind wicked because they felt wicked themselves. If a man feels wicked, I cannot see why he should suddenly feel good because somebody tells him that his ancestors once had tails. Man's primary purity and innocence may have dropped off with his tail, for all anybody knows. The only thing we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> that primary purity and innocence is that we have not got it. Nothing can be, in the strictest sense of the word, more comic than to set so shadowy a thing as the conjectures made by the vaguer anthropologists about primitive man against so solid a thing as the human sense of sin. By its nature the evidence of Eden is something that one cannot find. By its nature the evidence of sin is something that one cannot help finding.|$|E
6000|$|We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Father Damien, the French {{priest who}} voluntarily forsook {{the world and}} went to the leper island of Molokai to labor among its {{population}} of sorrowful exiles who wait there, in slow-consuming misery, for death to come and release them from their troubles; and we know that the thing which he knew beforehand would happen, did happen: that he became a leper himself, and died of that horrible disease. There was still another case of self-sacrifice, it appears. I asked after [...] "Billy" [...] Ragsdale, interpreter to the Parliament in my time--a half-white. He was a brilliant young fellow, and very popular. As an interpreter he would have been hard to match anywhere. He used to stand up in the Parliament and turn the English speeches into Hawaiian and the Hawaiian speeches into English with a readiness and a volubility that were astonishing. I asked after him, and was told that his prosperous career was cut short in a sudden and unexpected way, just {{as he was about to}} marry a beautiful half-caste girl. He discovered, by some nearly invisible sign about his skin, that the poison of leprosy was in him. The secret was his own, and might be kept concealed for years; but he would not be treacherous to the girl that loved him; he would not marry her to a doom like his. And so he put his affairs in order, and went around to all his friends and bade them good-bye, and sailed in the leper ship to Molokai. There he died the loathsome and lingering death that all lepers die.|$|E
