40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the determinants of female part-time employment in 18 European countries. The distinction between short <b>and</b> long <b>part-time</b> allowed us to highlight some differences. Female part-timers are often married mothers and hold less secure jobs within the public sector. In addition, long part-time seems to stand out by economic conditions more favorable in terms of security. Our decomposition of the working time suggests that the differences between long <b>part-time</b> <b>and</b> short <b>part-time</b> appear to be stronger than differences between full-time <b>and</b> short <b>part-time</b> <b>and</b> working conditions of both long <b>part-time</b> <b>and</b> full-time may justify these differences. ...|$|R
