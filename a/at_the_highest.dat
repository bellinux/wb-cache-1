30|$|The {{small number}} of blades allows the turbine to operate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> {{rotational}} speed; in contrast, {{it is impossible for}} <b>the</b> turbine with <b>high</b> blade number to operate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> rotation. One of the factors responsible is the inability of the high-bladed turbine to generate <b>the</b> power <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> rotational speed. This is because <b>the</b> attack angle <b>at</b> corresponding rotational speed is very low, resulting in low lift coefficient. In contrary, for the turbine with less blade number, it is possible to obtain a relatively more moderate attack angle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> rotational speed, to allow the turbine obtaining <b>the</b> <b>high</b> lift coefficient <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> rotation speed.|$|R
