5|$|At {{the end of}} Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> {{fly over}} the ocean in Tails' biplane, the Tornado, after {{defeating}} Doctor Eggman. Beginning from this point, After the Sequel depicts Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> noticing a forested island and deciding to make a landing and explore. After completing the first zone, Sonic finds a robot resembling Tails—a trap sprung by Eggman. The robot ensnares Sonic in a forcefield while Eggman steals Sonic's Chaos Emeralds. Sonic escapes and sets out with Tails to recover the Emeralds.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's space station, the Death Egg, crash-lands on {{a mystical}} {{floating}} landmass called Angel Island after Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> defeat {{him at the}} end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. As Robotnik begins to repair the damaged station, he meets Knuckles the Echidna, the last surviving member of an ancient echidna civilization that once inhabited the island, as well as the guardian of the Master Emerald, which grants the island its levitation powers. Realizing Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> will try to track him down, Robotnik dupes Knuckles into believing Sonic is trying to steal the Master Emerald, turning the two against each other while Robotnik tries to repair his space station.|$|E
5|$|In Parhelion Peak, the game's snow zone, Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> {{notice a}} feather float {{down from the}} sky. They board another of Eggman's {{airships}} and complete another zone, whereupon they find another feather. They trace the feathers to Eggman's bird-like robot, which is guarding the Emeralds. Sonic retrieves the Emeralds and uses them to become Super Sonic. He fights the robot as the game's final boss. After its defeat, Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> fly aboard the Tornado once more—the segue into the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 3.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the game's events, Doctor Eggman {{builds a}} robotic {{assistant}} named Gemerl, using parts from the robot Emerl who {{was destroyed in}} Sonic Battle. Eggman attempts an experiment using the Chaos Emeralds to perform the Chaos Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} Sonic games, Knuckles' Chaotix was not {{developed}} by Sonic Team, but rather another internal development team at Sega. Development {{on the game}} {{can be traced back}} to a 1994 internal prototype for the Sega Genesis. Titled Sonic Crackers, it featured Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails,</b> and the developers experimented with the ring force bond physics. This core concept was carried over to the more powerful 32X add-on, where development continued under the working title Knuckles' Ringstar. Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> were removed from the game and replaced by Knuckles and four other characters. Among these was Mighty the Armadillo, who featured previously in SegaSonic the Hedgehog (1993).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{examined}} the resectability, operative morbidity mortality, and survival {{of patients with}} pancreatic adenocarcinoma of the body <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> compared with lesions in the head. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Adenocarcinoma of the body <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> of the pancreas is characteristically {{thought of as a}} disease that presents late and rarely is operable or resectable. METHODS: In an 11 -year period, 1981 patients were admitted and entered into a prospective database at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center with a diagnosis of peripancreatic cancer, 1363 of whom had adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, 75 % with lesions in the head and 25 % with lesions in the body <b>and</b> <b>tail.</b> RESULTS: Of 271 patients resected, 237 (23 %) had lesions in the head and 34 (10 %) had body <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> lesions. Perioperative mortality was 4 % for patients with pancreatic lesions in the head and 0 % for patients with pancreatic lesions in the body <b>and</b> <b>tail.</b> Five-year actuarial survival for body <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> lesions was projected at 14 % for 5 years. Actual survival was 19 %, with three patients alive for more than 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Adenocarcinoma of the body <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> of the pancreas, although less likely to be resectable at presentation than lesions in the pancreatic head, have similar postresection survival...|$|R

5|$|Modern Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> {{eventually}} {{meet their}} Classic counterparts, and form an alliance to restore their world. The two travel through locations from their past they find in White Space, restoring them to normal. They rescue {{many of their}} friends, including Knuckles, Amy, Rouge, Cream, Blaze and the Chaotix, while battling old enemies for the Chaos Emeralds. The two eventually confront Classic and Modern Eggman, who overpower them using the Time Eater. However, the two Sonics use the Chaos Emeralds to transform into their super forms and defeat the Time Eater, restoring the timeline to normal. Everyone resumes celebrating Modern Sonic's birthday while Classic Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> bid farewell and return to their time. Meanwhile, both Classic and Modern Eggman are left trapped in White Space.|$|E
5|$|The jacamars {{are near}} {{passerine}} birds from tropical South America {{with a range}} that extends up to Mexico.

5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers <b>and</b> <b>tails.</b> Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to Sonic is useful to Cream and Blaze the Cat in Sonic Rush, since they are also looking for him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, who has not returned. In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists on helping him. When Silver attacks Sonic, Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who also likes Sonic, although Amy does not know this at the time) from confinement. In Sonic Lost World, Amy and Knuckles care for forest animals while Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; Amy and Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> replenish it.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{is a major}} {{character}} in the Sonic the Hedgehog manga. She is the girlfriend of protagonist Nicky, whose alter ego is Sonic, and is unaware that they are identical. Antagonist Anton Brooke is also attracted to her; he kidnaps her a number of times, forcing Nicky to become Sonic and rescue her. In Sonic Adventures, a 1994 two-issue French comic book published by Sirène, Doctor Robotnik (Eggman) uses Amy as bait to lure Sonic. When Sonic, Amy <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> fall into a pit of lava, they are saved by a giant ring which transports them to a different location.|$|E

5|$|An older feast, {{held by the}} {{fishermen}} {{towards the end of}} December, included a pie cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve in the coming year. There is a possibility that Tom Bawcock's Eve is an evolution of this festival. Since 1963, the festival has been run {{against the backdrop of the}} Mousehole village illuminations, where the entire harbour is lit up, along with many other displays. One set of lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads <b>and</b> <b>tails</b> protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with most}} sauropods, a {{relatively}} large amount of juvenile material is known from Apatosaurus. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of Apatosaurus; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish Apatosaurus from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks <b>and</b> <b>tails,</b> and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus is {{both the}} type genus of, and gives its name to, the Diplodocidae, the family to which it belongs. Members of this family, while still massive, are of a {{markedly}} more slender build than other sauropods, such as the titanosaurs and brachiosaurs. All are characterised by long necks <b>and</b> <b>tails</b> and a horizontal posture, with fore limbs shorter than hind limbs. Diplodocids flourished in the Late Jurassic of North America and possibly Africa.|$|E

Barack Obama wore a new tuxedo made by Hart Schaffner Marx, a Chicago-based menswear company. He also wore a white bow tie, instead of the conventional black. Traditionalists considered this a fashion faux pas, as a white tie is conventionally only worn with a white waistcoat <b>and</b> <b>tails.</b> Michelle Obama wore a white, one-shouldered, sleeveless gown designed by 26-year-old NewYork-based designer JasonWu, breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, who showcased designers from their hometowns.|$|E
5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is a {{platform}} video game developed by Sonic Team {{and published by}} Sega. The fourth main game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, it was released for the Sega Genesis worldwide in February 1994, and in Japan three months later. Following the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Dr. Robotnik's spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island.
