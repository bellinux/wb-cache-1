40|$|A {{sophisticated}} long-term {{monitoring system}} is devised by the Hong Kong SAR government authorities {{to monitor the}} structural health and performance of the suspension Tsing Ma Bridge and the cable-stayed Kap Shui Mun Bridge and Ting Kau Bridge. The sensing system comprises about 900 permanently installed sensors including accelerometers, strain gauges, displacement transducers, <b>anemometers,</b> <b>level</b> sensors, temperature sensors and weigh-in-motion sensors. Based on this system, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University is devoted to developing a neural network based damage alarming system by use of the measurement data of modal properties, strain and fatigue properties, static displacement and deflection, and cable static force respectively. This paper describes how to establish a neural network novelty filter for anomaly detection of Tsing Ma Bridge cables from the measured multi-mode frequencies of the cables. An auto-associative neural network is developed for this purpose. Only a series of measured modal data in structural healthy state are required in training the neural network. Another series of measured modal data in testing phase are fed into the trained network to obtain a novelty index sequence that signals whether anomaly occurs. A salient feature {{of this approach is}} that it needs neither structural model nor damage model in both training and testing phases. Moreover, it is intrinsically tolerant of measurement noise and uncertainty in ambient conditions. Numerical simulation using noise-corrupted analytical data of the Tsing Ma Bridge cables is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed novelty filter and its robustness to measurement and structural uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Field {{measurements}} of wind velocity and direction {{carried out at}} the University of Minnesota Health Science Complex from July 1 to November 30, 1994, are reported. Two anemometers and one wind direction vane {{were used in the}} measurements, One anemometer was located outside the Unit B/C door, 4. 3 m above the sidewalk and 0. 5 m out from the wall. The other anemometer and a wind direction vane were installed atop the north-west corner of the Unit A building to provide information on the wind conditions above the buildings. Conditional sampling using the ground <b>level</b> <b>anemometer</b> to provide minimum threshold wind speeds was used to identify critical wind directions.

40|$|Coherent Doppler LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) {{has been}} widely used to provide {{measurements}} of several boundary layer parameters such as profiles of wind speed, wind direction, vertical velocity statistics, mixing layer heights and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). An important aspect of providing this wide range of meteorological data is to properly characterize the uncertainty associated with these measurements. With the above intent in mind, the Lidar Uncertainty Measurement Experiment (LUMEX) was conducted at Erie, Colorado during the period June 23 rd to July 13 th, 2014. The major goals of this experiment were the following: Characterize sampling error for vertical velocity statistics Analyze sensitivities of different Doppler lidar systems Compare various single and dual Doppler retrieval techniques Characterize error of spatial representativeness for separation distances up to 3 km Validate turbulence analysis techniques and retrievals from Doppler lidars This experiment brought together 5 Doppler lidars, both commercial and research grade, {{for a period of}} three weeks for a comprehensive intercomparison study. The Doppler lidars were deployed at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) site in Erie, site of a 300 m meteorological tower. This tower was instrumented with six sonic <b>anemometers</b> at <b>levels</b> from 50 m to 300 m with 50 m vertical spacing. A brief overview of the experiment outline and deployment will be presented. Results from the sampling error analysis and its implications on scanning strategy will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} observations and model simulations {{of wind and}} temperature in a subway station. The measurements are taken from an experiment with three ultrasonic <b>anemometers</b> at different <b>levels</b> in the underground facility. The available observations indicate a wind regime with a continuous background flow and train-induced ventilation with very effective air exchange between the platform level and the street level. Model simulations with a resolution of less than 1 [*]m were performed with running trains in accordance with a regular timetable. The results demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} model to the complex underground geometry. Calculated time series of wind and temperature are very comparable to the observations. The findings of a parameter study indicate the necessity to record all details of train movements in order to define appropriate initial and boundary conditions for the model and to explain the observations correctly...|$|R
40|$|Data from SABLES 98 {{experimental}} campaign {{have been}} used in order to study the influence of stability (from weak to strong stratification) on the flux-profile relationships for momentum and heat: fm and fh. Standard instrumentation, 14 thermocouples and 3 sonic <b>anemometers</b> at three <b>levels</b> (5. 8, 13. 5 and 32 m) were available from 10 to 28 September 1998 and calculations are done in order to extract structure functions and intermittency. The results show increasing values of fm and fh with increasing stability parameter and then values remain constant. As a consequence of these constant, but different values of fm and fh for strong stability, when linear similarity functions (Businger et al., 1971) are used to calculate surface fluxes of momentum and heat an important underestimation of the turbulent mixing is produced. The differences in structure and higher order moments between stable and neutral turbulence is studied in terms of turbulent intermittent mixing and velocity PDF’s. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceData from SABLES 98 {{experimental}} campaign {{have been}} used in order to study the influence of stability (from weak to strong stratification) on the flux-profile relationships for momentum, ? m, and heat, ? h. Measurements from 14 thermocouples and 3 sonic <b>anemometers</b> at three <b>levels</b> (5. 8, 13. 5 and 32 m) for the period from 10 to 28 September 1998 were analysed using the framework of the local-scaling approach (Nieuwstadt, 1984 a; 1984 b), which can be interpreted {{as an extension of the}} Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (Obukhov, 1946). The results show increasing values of ? m and ? h with increasing stability parameter ?=z/?, up to a value of ?? 1 ? 2, above which the values remain constant. As a consequence of this levelling off in ? m and ? h for strong stability, the turbulent mixing is underestimated when linear similarity functions (Businger et al., 1971) are used to calculate surface fluxes of momentum and heat. On the other hand when ? m and ? h are related to the gradient Richardson number, R i, a different behaviour is found, which could indicate that the transfer of momentum is greater than that of heat for high R i. The range of validity of these linear functions is discussed in terms of the physical aspects of turbulent intermittent mixing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGust wind speeds in {{high wind}} speed {{conditions}} {{are important for}} load estimation on large structures in exposed locations, like a multi-megawatt wind turbine. Modern wind turbines operate at wind speeds up to 25 m/s so {{it is important to}} know the expected amplitude, acceleration and relevant scale of typical wind gusts under operating conditions. The wind measurement station at Frøya is located near the village of Titran on the western tip of the island. The site (Fig. 1) is well suited for measuring coastal and marine wind conditions relevant for offshore and coastal wind farms. The database contains several hundred hours of wind data from high wind speed conditions (> 15 m/s). A 100 meter high meteorological mast with 2 D ultrasonic <b>anemometers</b> at 6 <b>levels</b> have been used to collect wind data over a time period of 5 years from 2009 to 2014. Gust factors (G) measured at Frøya have been studied and correlated with height, wind speed, turbulence intensity (TI) and atmospheric stability, and compared to existing models. The gust factor mainly depends on turbulence intensity and gust averaging time. This indicates that the “peak factor” (kP) is a better measure for gustiness when turbulence values are available. kP decreases with increasing turbulence intensity and averaging time, but is less dependent on atmospheric stability. Its pdf follows a Gumbel distribution. An asymmetry of the measured gusts could be observed, showing a higher fall time compared to rise time...|$|R
40|$|A {{wind and}} {{structural}} health monitoring system (WASHMS) {{was installed in}} the Tsing Ma suspension bridge in Hong Kong in 1997. On September 16, 1999, Typhoon York, which was the strongest typhoon since 1983 and the typhoon of the longest duration on record, crossed over Hong Kong. All vehicles, except trains, were prohibited from running on the bridge for 2. 5 h. This event provided a distinctive opportunity to examine the existing analytical models for predicting dynamic response of long suspension bridges to high winds and running trains. The field measurement data recorded by the WASHMS during this event were therefore analyzed and the four particular cases were identified and discussed in this paper. The four particular cases identified included: (1) the bridge without any vehicles; (2) the bridge with one train; (3) the bridge with two trains running in opposite directions; and (4) the bridge with three running trains. The mean wind speed was almost perpendicular to the bridge alignment in the four cases to facilitate the comparison with analytical results. For each case, wind characteristics, bridge acceleration responses, and bridge displacement responses were analyzed using the measurement data from <b>anemometers,</b> accelerometers, and <b>level</b> sensing systems, respectively. The number of trains running on the bridge, train speed, and train location were also identified using the measurement data from strain gauges. The measurement results clearly demonstrated the dynamic behavior of the bridge with running trains during high winds. The measurement results obtained will {{also be used to}} verify the analytical model developed by the authors in the companion paper. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Meteorological {{variables}} such as surface friction velocity and heat flux are critical inputs to {{the current generation of}} dispersion models such as AERMOD. This paper examines methods to estimate these variables by applying Monin-Obukhov (M-O) similarity to measurements made on towers located in urban areas. The inputs to these methods are restricted to the wind speed and the standard deviation of temperature fluctuations data measured at a single level on a tower. The performance of these methods are evaluated with data collected at one urban and two suburban towers in Riverside, California during two months in 2007, The data consisted of mean winds and temperatures as well as heat and momentum fluxes using a sonic <b>anemometer</b> at one <b>level</b> on each tower. The major conclusions of this study are that during unstable conditions: 1) M-O theory provides adequate estimates of micrometeorological variables using urban measurements of mean winds and temperatures at one level when the standard deviation of temperature fluctuations is used to estimate heat flux, 2) the simple free convection estimate provides estimates of the heat flux that compare well with those from methods that account for stability effects through the M-O length, 3) all the methods overestimate heat flux close to neutral conditions, 4) the overestimation of heat flux does not appear to affect estimates of surface friction velocity, but results in overestimation of the vertical turbulent velocity. During stable conditions, 1) vertical and horizontal velocity fluctuations are related to friction velocity through similarity relationships derived in flat terrain, 2) estimates of the surface friction velocity based on temperature fluctuations do not improve upon those based on a constant value o...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to {{study the effects of}} environmental factors i. e. heat stress, thermal comfort, and occupational noise and individual factors of the workers i. e. age, work duration (expressed in months), and nutrition status on occupational fatigue and stress. Occupational fatigue was measured using Reaction Timer L- 77 Lakassidaya. Occupational stress was measured using questionnaire adapted from Wambrauw (2010). Heat stress and thermal comfort were measured using Questemp 34 Thermal Environment Meter and Lutron AM- 4200 <b>Anemometer.</b> Occupational noise <b>level</b> was measured using Lutron SL- 4022 Sound Level Meter. Nutrition status was measured using microtoise and body weight scale. Age and work duration was obtained using a personal profile form filled in by each worker. This research employed Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) consisted of direct and indirect effects of exogenous and endogenous variables on endogenous variables. Data analysis was conducted using AMOS 19 software. Data analysis showed that (1) different level of fatigue was indicated on workers working in different work shifts, (2) there was no direct effects of heat stress and thermal comfort on occupational fatigue, (3) there was a positive direct effect of occupational noise on workers stress but there was no indication that the stress itself has a direct effect on occupational fatigue, thus preventing the indirect effect of occupational noise on occupational fatigue, (4) there was no direct effect of the age of the workers on occupational fatigue, (5) there was a positive direct effect of the workers age on work duration, but the work duration itself did not exhibit any effect on occupational fatigue so therefore no indirect effect of workers age on occupational fatigue was found in this research, (6) and finally, there was a positive direct effect of nutrition status on occupational fatigue...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{offshore}} wind climatology in the Northern European seas is analysed from {{ten years of}} Envisat synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using a total of 9256 scenes, ten years of QuikSCAT and two years of ASCAT gridded ocean surface vector wind products and high-quality wind observations from four meteorological masts in the North Sea. The traditional method for assessment of the wind resource for wind energy application is through analysis of wind speed and wind direction observed during one or more years at a meteorological mast equipped with well-calibrated <b>anemometers</b> at several <b>levels.</b> The cost of such measurements is very high and therefore they are only sparsely available. An alternative method is the application of satellite remote sensing. Comparison of wind resource statistics from satellite products is presented and discussed including the uncertainty on the wind resource. The diurnal wind variability {{is found to be}} negligible at some location but up to 0. 5 ms− 1 at two sites. Synergetic use of observations from multiple satellites in different orbits provides wind observations at six times in the diurnal cycle and increases the number of observations. At Horns Rev M 2, FINO 1 and Greater Gabbard satellite and in situ collocated samples show differences in mean wind speed of − 2 %, − 1 % and 3 %, respectively. At Egmond aan Zee the difference is 10 %. It is most likely due to scatterometer data sampled further offshore than at the meteorological mast. Comparing energy density with all samples at Horns Rev M 2 shows overestimation 7 – 19 % and at FINO 1 underestimation 2 – 5 % but no clear conclusion can be drawn as the comparison data are not collocated. At eight new {{offshore wind}} farm areas in Denmark, the variability in mean energy density observed by SAR ranges from 347 Wm− 2 in Sejerøbugten to 514 Wm− 2 at Horns Rev 3. The spatial variability in the near-shore areas is much higher than at areas located further offshore...|$|R
40|$|The eXperimental Planetary {{boundary}} layer Instrumentation Assessment (XPIA) field campaign {{took place in}} March through May 2015 at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory, utilizing its 300  m meteorological tower, instrumented with two sonic anemometers mounted {{on opposite sides of}} the tower at six heights. This allowed for at least one sonic <b>anemometer</b> at each <b>level</b> to be upstream of the tower at all times and for identification of the times when a sonic anemometer is in the wake of the tower frame. Other instrumentation, including profiling and scanning lidars aided in the identification of the tower wake. Here we compare pairs of sonic anemometers at the same heights to identify the range of directions that are affected by the tower for each of the opposing booms. The mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy are used to quantify the wake impact on these first- and second-order wind measurements, showing up to a 50  % reduction in wind speed and an order of magnitude increase in turbulent kinetic energy. Comparisons of wind speeds from profiling and scanning lidars confirmed the extent of the tower wake, with the same reduction in wind speed observed in the tower wake, and a speed-up effect around the wake boundaries. Wind direction differences between pairs of sonic anemometers and between sonic anemometers and lidars can also be significant, as the flow is deflected by the tower structure. Comparisons of lengths of averaging intervals showed a decrease in wind speed deficit with longer averages, but the flow deflection remains constant over longer averages. Furthermore, asymmetry exists in the tower effects due to the geometry and placement of the booms on the triangular tower. An analysis of the percentage of observations in the wake that must be removed from 2  min mean wind speed and 20  min turbulent values showed that removing even small portions of the time interval due to wakes impacts these two quantities. However, a vast majority of intervals have no observations in the tower wake, so removing the full 2 or 20  min intervals does not diminish the XPIA dataset...|$|R
