40|$|Bridging fault {{extraction}} {{and analysis}} {{are crucial to}} deriving high quality bridging fault test generation. <b>As</b> <b>state-of-the-art</b> designs integrate millions of logic gates into a VLSI circuit, a run-time and memory efficient bridging fault extraction approach must be developed {{to cope with the}} design complexity. In this paper, a hierarchical bridging fault analyzer - FAULTAN is described. In FAULTAN, the design hierarchy is followed while performing fault extraction resulting in both computation time and memory savings compared to the traditional flat approach. As part of the hierarchical extraction strategy, a cell fault library is built a priori to help accelerate the bridging fault extraction process. Through the fully hierarchical extraction techniques, FAULTAN achieves on the average 5 times speedup and 1 / 10 memory usage as compared with an existing flat fault extractor. The superior accuracy of FAULTAN is also demonstrated in this paper. 1 Introduction <b>As</b> <b>state-of-the-art</b> designs [...] ...|$|R

Although Edward Blore had <b>a</b> <b>state-of-the-art</b> drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide.

5|$|In November 1957, the Arthur Kill {{swing bridge}} was damaged by an Esso oil tanker, and was {{replaced}} by <b>a</b> <b>state-of-the-art,</b> single track, 558 foot vertical lift bridge in 1959. The 2,000 ton lift span was prefabricated, then floated into place. The new bridge was raised 135 feet and since the new bridge aided navigation on the Arthur Kill, the United States government assumed 90 percent of the $11 million cost of the project. Freight trains started crossing the bridge when it opened on August 25, 1959.|$|E

5|$|In early 1988, Butthole Surfers {{were ready}} to record a new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, {{choosing}} <b>a</b> <b>state-of-the-art</b> facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years. The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the club's owners {{announced}} a modernisation of Stamford Bridge {{with plans for}} <b>a</b> <b>state-of-the-art</b> 50,000 all-seater stadium. Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the freehold being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, {{it was not until}} the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed. The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001.|$|E

Queen Alia International Airport expansion was completed in 2013 with new terminals costing $700 million, to handle over 16 million passengers annually.

5|$|The {{sale of the}} {{training}} ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club.

Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{had been}} {{planning}} {{to build a new}} theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the Savoy Theatre in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the Savoy Palace, which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by Peter, Count of Savoy. It later passed to John of Gaunt but was destroyed in the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The Savoy Theatre was <b>a</b> <b>state-of-the-art</b> facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor.
