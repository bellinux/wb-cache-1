40|$|Abstract. In virtual {{training}} scenarios, agent {{technology can}} be used to build a <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor</b> that assists a student during training. In a dialogue using argumentation schemes, the <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor</b> provides reasons to the students to explain why a particular action is the most sensible. The tutor determines the best action using practical reasoning. The justification of this action is selected based on the personality type of the student. This paper studies how agent technology could be used to make a <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor</b> that assists the student during the training. In particular, we study how the tutor can generate persuasive arguments for what the student should do. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In recent years, several <b>virtual</b> <b>tutoring</b> {{assistant}} systems {{had been}} proposed based on question-answering systems. These <b>virtual</b> <b>tutoring</b> assistant systems are very helpful {{for the students}} to get instant helps when the teachers are not available. Pedagogic scholars think that when a student is stuck on a certain problem while learning, an instant tutoring assistant is very helpful to promote his/her study. Therefore, the qualities (precision) of the answers of <b>virtual</b> <b>tutoring</b> assistant systems are very important. It determines the effectiveness of these systems. In practices, some students are suffered from not being able to properly express their need; some may not even know exactly what information they need. As a result, some problems do not match any existing solutions, even if they do contain some clues for finding solutions. That makes the effectiveness of the <b>virtual</b> <b>tutoring</b> assistant systems not being acceptable. In the literatures, researchers found that relevance feedback information are quite useful for information retrieval systems to improve their effectiveness. Among them, the Rocchio’s Relevance Feedback (RRF) algorithm is the most well-known and have been employed in several information retrieval systems. In this paper, we proposed a novel pseudo relevance feedback algorithm, called Hierarchical Relevance Feedback (HRF) algorithm. The HRF algorithm is used for improving the precision of <b>virtual</b> <b>tutoring</b> assistant systems. After a query is submitted by some student, the new <b>virtual</b> <b>tutoring</b> assistant system will automatically modify the student’s query according to the HRF algorithm and re-submit it to the system. Experimental results showed that the effectiveness of the system is improved by automatically modifying user’s query using the HRF algorithm. Moreover, the HRF algorithm is also outperformed the famous RRF algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{learning}} environments (VLEs) may possess many advantages over traditional teaching methods in skills training that offer empowerment of constructing the skills by freely exploring a VLE. However, {{a conflict between}} the free exploration and ensuring the learning tasks tackled emerges in the learning process. A strategy to balance the conflict is to employ <b>virtual</b> <b>tutoring</b> agents to scaffold the learning tasks. This research {{has been carried out}} to investigate the issues of design and utility of a <b>virtual</b> <b>tutoring</b> agent system in a VLE to allow higher education (university based) students to practise immunology laboratory experiments, which simulates a well known immunochemical assay in the Life Sciences area, namely a Radio Immunoassay. This paper discusses the classification of category of the virtual agents in a VLE and focuses on the design of tutoring agents. Three types of the tutoring agents have been selected and implemented in the Radio Immunoassay simulation. The considered points in programming the <b>virtual</b> <b>tutoring</b> agents and their tasks are presented in this paper.

40|$|Purpose: The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) is an {{established}} communication intervention for non-verbal children with autism. This paper presents {{an evaluation of}} a computer based PECS approach, in which young non-verbal children with autism respond to an on-screen ‘virtual tutor’ through the manipulation of picture/symbol cards. The paper presents research to investigate how the <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor’s</b> voice influences the children’s participation and performance. Design/Methodology/Approach: Eight non-verbal children between 6 and 9 years old and with a diagnosis of autism were each presented {{with a series of}} computer-based activities, using a <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor</b> with either a natural or synthetic voice, in two separate sessions. Data was gathered using a within-participants counterbalanced design to control against variations between individuals and effects of presentation order. Findings: Analysis of the children’s responses suggest they were able to use the system more effectively when the <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor</b> had a synthetic voice, rather than a human voice. The findings demonstrate that a computer-based <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor</b> can provide an engaging method of supporting symbol-based communication for non-verbal children with autism, and that a synthetic voice type was preferable for the sessions undertaken. Value: Investigations of voice type and its influence on non-verbal children’s participation and performance have so far provided inconclusive results (Ramdoss 2013). This research suggests that voice type is an important feature of the learning experience of non-verbal children with autism, and can have a significant influence on their participation and performance in virtual tutor-led learning...|$|R

40|$|In education, it is {{important}} to have good communication and interaction between educators and learners to promote a conducive learning environment. However, this is rather difficult for the children with motor impairments, such as children with Cerebral Palsy and Autism. Their learning problems arise due to their motor impairment coupled with speech and intellectual impairments. As a result, children with motor disabilities require more time and attention in learning. To assist the children's learning, this chapter proposes an affective computer-mediated learning model which adapts to learners' emotions where it has an educator representation (i. e. a <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor)</b> to deliver the learning materials and interact with a child in one-to-one learning. The <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor</b> communicates with the child by responding to his/ her facial expressions.

40|$|Autism is a neuro-developmental {{disorder}} {{estimated to}} affect 1 in 100 {{children in the}} United Kingdom (NAS, 2008). Children with autism have specific difficulties developing verbal and non-verbal communication. A diagnosis of autism is typically given at around {{three to four years}} of age. Research suggests that interventions using for example, a symbol-based form of communication as in the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), is most effective when undertaken as early as practical, but this requires the extensive use of limited specialist resources and the training of parents and carers. Interventions using Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) have shown considerable promise in promoting the development of communication skills for children with autism. Being able to present key tasks with consistency and without tutor fatigue (Cromby, 1996) has been shown as beneficial for teaching children with autism. Combining these features with a tangible interface has been indicated as a promising avenue for those children with autism who have more severe learning difficulties (Sitdhisanguan, 2008). The use of CAL in this way might address the problem of accessing currently limited specialist resources. In particular the use of a <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor</b> has been noted as having potential in this context (Sheridan and Raffield, 2008). To understand how effectively a CAL based PECS system could support and promote symbol-based communication, and support the generalisation of skills necessary for symbol-based communication, our study has adopted a <b>virtual</b> <b>tutor</b> led teaching system that exploits Radio Freqeuncy Identification (RFID) enabled tokens, similar in look and feel to those used in traditional PECS user-system interactions.

However, simply having access to knowledge without experience {{does not seem to be}} sufficient for the development of problem solving expertise and metacognitive control.

In the paper we deal with such factors as student’s personality and qualities – particularly learning style and motivation.
