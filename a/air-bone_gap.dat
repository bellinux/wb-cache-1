50|$|Pure tone {{audiometry}} (PTA) {{is the key}} hearing test used to identify hearing threshold levels of an individual, enabling determination of the degree, type and configuration of a hearing loss. Thus, providing the basis for diagnosis and management. PTA is a subjective, behavioural measurement of hearing threshold, as it relies on patient response to pure tone stimuli. Therefore, PTA is used on adults and children old enough {{to cooperate with the}} test procedure. As with most clinical tests, calibration of the test environment, the equipment and the stimuli to ISO standards is needed before testing proceeds. PTA only measures audibility thresholds, rather than other aspects of hearing such as sound localization and speech recognition. However, there are benefits of using PTA over other forms of hearing test, such as click auditory brainstem response (ABR). PTA provides ear specific thresholds, and uses frequency specific pure tones to give place specific responses, so that the configuration of a hearing loss can be identified. As PTA uses both air and bone conduction audiometry, the type of loss can also be identified via the <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap.</b> Although PTA has many clinical benefits, it is not perfect at identifying all losses, such as ‘dead regions’ of the cochlea and neuropathies such as auditory processing disorder (APD). This {{raises the question of whether}} or not audiograms accurately predict someone’s perceived degree of disability.|$|E

DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. METHODS A systematic search was conducted. Studies comparing the effect of different crimping methods on pure-tone audiometric results in patients undergoing stapes surgery for otosclerosis were included. Relevance and risk of bias were assessed. Absolute risks and risk differences, means and mean differences, and 95 % confidence intervals were extracted or calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes, which were <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> closure to 10 dB or less, mean postoperative <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap,</b> and postoperative sensorineural hearing loss. RESULTS Twenty-two studies with moderate or high risk of bias were included for data extraction. <b>Air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> closure to 10 dB or less was assessed in 17 studies and mean postoperative <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> in 20 studies. The hearing outcomes did not consistently favor one crimping method. However, the differences that were statistically significant were consistently in favor of heat crimping over manual and no crimping (difference in <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> closure to 10 dB or less ranged between 22 % and 42 % in these studies and difference in mean postoperative <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> between 2. 8 dB and 7. 4 dB) and in favor of manual crimping over no crimping (30 % difference in <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> closure to 10 dB or less and difference in mean postoperative <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> between 2. 6 dB and 6. 0 dB).

50|$|Fixation of the stapes {{within the}} oval window causes a {{conductive}} hearing loss. In pure-tone audiometry, this manifests as <b>air-bone</b> <b>gaps</b> on the audiogram (i.e. {{a difference of}} more than 10 dB between the air-conduction and bone-conduction thresholds at a given test frequency). However, medial fixation of the ossicular chain impairs both the inertial and osseotympanic modes of bone conduction, increasing the bone-conduction thresholds between 500 Hz and 4 kHz, and reducing the size of <b>air-bone</b> <b>gaps.</b> As 2 kHz is the resonant frequency of the ossicular chain, the largest increase in bone-conduction threshold (around 15 dB) occurs at this frequency - the resultant notch is called Carhart's notch and is a useful clinical marker for medial ossicular-chain fixation.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A study {{performed}} in the 1990 s with analogue linear hearing aids showed that in patients with mixed hearing loss and an <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> that exceeded 25 to 30 dB, speech perception was better with a bone-anchored hearing aid (Baha) than with a conventional behind-the-ear (BTE) device. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether this conclusion applies to today's digital BTEs with feedback cancellation and whether the crossover point still occurs at an <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> of 25 to 30 dB. STUDY DESIGN: Case control. METHODS: Experienced unilateral Baha users with the latest digital Baha processors were fitted with a powerful BTE with feedback cancellation. After an acclimatization period of 4 weeks, aided thresholds and speech recognition scores were determined and compared to those recorded previously with the Baha. To obtain patients' opinions, a disability-specific questionnaire was used. Participants comprised 16 subjects with bilateral mixed hearing loss participated RESULTS: Audiometric and speech recognition data showed similar trends to those described previously, but the crossover point had shifted to an <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> of 30 to 35 dB. In the questionnaire, the BTE was rated higher than the Baha, except by the patients with an <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> that exceeded an average of 45 dB. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mixed hearing loss whose <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> exceeded 35 dB, speech recognition is likely to be better with a Baha than with a BTE. Therefore, the Baha should receive greater consideration when mixed hearing loss is combined with a significant <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap,</b> even when there are no contraindications for BTEs...|$|E

40|$|Otosclerosis is {{the most}} {{frequent}} cause of conductive hearing loss in patients with intact tympanic membrane. It can be treated by surgery with various techniques. Because of limited manipulation and comparably similar results, stapedotomy at present is preferred over other surgical techniques by most surgeons.

40|$|Objective—The {{goals of}} the study are to {{determine}} how well stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) identify hearing loss, classify hearing loss as mild or moderate-severe, and correlate with pure-tone thresholds in a population of adults with normal middle-ear function. Other goals are to determine if middle-ear function as assessed by wideband acoustic transfer function (ATF) measurements in the ear canal account for the variability in normal thresholds, and if the inclusion of ATFs improves the ability of SFOAEs to identify hearing loss and predict pure-tone thresholds. Design—The total suppressed SFOAE signal and its corresponding noise were recorded in 85 ears (22 normal ears and 63 ears with sensorineural hearing loss) at octave frequencies from 0. 5 – 8 kHz using a nonlinear residual method. SFOAEs were recorded a second time in three impaired ears to assess repeatability.

STUDY DESIGN: A nonrandomized, open, prospective case series. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-five consecutive patients who underwent 32 primary stapedotomies for osteogenesis imperfecta with evidence of stapes fixation and available postoperative pure-tone audiometry. INTERVENTION: Primary stapedotomy with vein graft interposition and reconstruction with a regular Teflon piston or bucket handle-type piston. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluation using conventional 4 -frequency (0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) audiometry. Air-conduction thresholds, bone-conduction thresholds, and <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> were measured. The overall audiometric results {{as well as the}} results of audiometric evaluation at 3 months and at least 1 year after surgery were used. RESULTS: Overall, postoperative <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> closure to within 10 dB was achieved in 88 % of cases.

METHODS : This cross-sectional study assessed the auditory profile of 10 participants with sclerosteosis. An auditory test battery was used and results for each ear were recorded using descriptive and comparative analyses. RESULTS : All participants presented with bilateral, mixed hearing losses. Of the 20 ears, hearing loss was moderate in 5 per cent (n = 1), severe in 55 per cent (n = 11) and profound in 40 per cent (n = 8). <b>Air–bone</b> <b>gaps</b> were smaller in older participants, although {{the difference was}} not statistically significant (p > 0. 05).

Objective: To perform a retrospective outcomes analysis of our experience with a skin-preserving canalplasty technique with temporoparietal fascia grafting and use of bone wax for skin flap protection. Study Design: Retrospective review. Subjects and Methods: Thirty-four patients (41 ears) underwent canalplasty from 2008 to 2014 at a tertiary referral center. Primary outcome measures included rates of prolonged healing and restenosis, need for revision surgery, and audiometric results. Rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications were also tabulated. Results: No patient experienced recurrent stenosis or required a revision surgery within the follow-up period.

Materials and Methods: All the patients diagnosed to have otosclerosis {{were included in the}} study. A total of 52 patients were studied ranging in age from 18 to 50 years. The subjects were randomized into two groups, that is, 0. 4 mm piston (group A) and 0. 6 mm piston (group B). The subjects were taken up for small fenestra stapedotomy using either a 0. 4 or 0. 6 mm piston. The main outcome measures were hearing improvement, <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> closure, and overclosure of <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap.</b> Results: There was no statistical difference in hearing improvement in two different piston diameters, 0. 4 and 0. 6 mm at speech frequencies. In group A, the <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> improvement in the third follow-up was not significant (P > 0. 05), whereas group B showed a statistically significant improvement (P = 0. 003). The mean overclosure of <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> was better in patients with 0. 4 mm piston at speech frequencies and also at 250 Hz.

In 79 ears, this was combined with ossiculoplasty in a single-stage procedure. In > 71 % of ears, the results of audiometric testing were monitored for more than 2 years. The results suggested there was a significant gain in hearing following surgery, with respect to the postoperative change in both air-conduction thresholds and <b>air-bone</b> <b>gaps</b> (P< 0. 001). Linear regression analyses of pure-tone averages at different frequencies, before and after surgery, demonstrated that patients benefitted from a postoperative hearing gain at low and middle frequencies, but their hearing often deteriorated at frequencies of 8000 [*]Hz. As for the impact of the type of tympanoplasty on hearing outcomes, type III-interposition markedly increased hearing gain. The overall rate of postoperative adverse events was 8. 8 %.

Post operative audiograms at 25 months demonstrated hearing thresholds of 29 ± 10 dB, with an <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> of 14 ± 6 dB. No prosthesis extrusion was observed, which compares favourably to other commercially available prostheses. Conclusions. Tutoplast processed allografts restore conductive hearing loss in patients undergoing mastoidectomy and provide an excellent alternative when there is insufficient material suitable for autograft ossiculoplasty. 1...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the causes and the audiometric results of revision surgery following stapedotomies and stapedectomies. Patients and methodsWe retrospectively reviewed a series of 89 revisions after surgery for otosclerosis between 1993 and 2008. Intraoperative findings, causes of failure, and pre- and postoperative audiometric results were noted retrospectively. ResultsThe leading causes of failure found intraoperatively included dislocated prosthesis and necrosis of the long process of the incus. The average postoperative <b>air–bone</b> <b>gap</b> was 13 dB. Closure of the <b>air–bone</b> <b>gap</b> to within 10 dB was achieved in 52 % of patients. ConclusionStapes revisions had less satisfactory results compared with primary procedures in this series. However, certain precautions during initial surgery should decrease the number of stapes surgery revisions...|$|E
40|$|Objective—This study compares {{measurements}} of ear-canal reflectance (ECR) to other objective {{measurements of}} middle-ear function including, audiometry, umbo velocity (VU), and tympanometry {{in a population}} of strictly defined normal hearing ears. Design—Data were prospectively gathered from 58 ears of 29 normal hearing subjects, 16 female and 13 male, aged 22 – 64 years. Subjects met all of the following criteria to be considered as having normal hearing. (1) No history of significant middle-ear disease. (2) No history of otologic surgery. (3) Normal tympanic membrane (TM) on otoscopy. (4) Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of 20 dB HL or better for 0. 25 – 8 kHz. (5) <b>Air-bone</b> <b>gaps</b> no greater than 15 dB at 0. 25 kHz and 10 dB for 0. 5 – 4 kHz. (6) Normal, type-A peaked tympanograms. (7) All subjects had two “normal ” ears (as defined by these criteria). Measurements included pure-tone audiometry for 0. 25 – 8 kHz, standard 226 Hz tympanometry, Ear canal reflectance(ECR) for 0. 2 – 6 kHz at 60 dB SPL using the Mimosa Acoustics HearID system, and Umbo Velocity (VU) for 0. 3 – 6 kHz at 70 – 90 dB SPL using the HLV- 1000 laser Doppler vibrometer (Polytec Inc). Results—Mean power reflectance (|ECR| 2) was near 1. 0 at 0. 2 – 0. 3 kHz, decreased to a broa...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{clinical and}} radiologic features, results of ear surgery, and genetic analysis in three families with Teunissen-Cremers syndrome. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. BACKGROUND: The NOG gene encodes the protein noggin, which has antagonist action in osteogenesis. Malformation of bones and joints {{may result from}} defects in noggin. Teunissen-Cremers syndrome is caused by mutations in the NOG gene. Two mutations in this gene were reported previously. The proximal symphalangism-hearing impairment syndrome, also caused by mutations in the NOG gene, is characterized by proximal symphalangism, conductive hearing loss, and occasionally synostoses. METHODS: We examined nine affected members of three Dutch families. Reconstructive middle ear surgery was performed in five patients (nine ears), and we sequenced the NOG gene in these families. RESULTS: Affected members had conductive hearing impairment, hyperopia, and broad thumbs and first toes with brachytelephalangia. Surgery manifested stapes ankylosis with additional incudal fixation frequently in the fossa incudis. <b>Air-bone</b> <b>gaps</b> decreased to less than 10 dB in six ears. Genetic analysis revealed three new mutations in the NOG gene. CONCLUSION: The Teunissen-Cremers syndrome is an entity in its clinical presentation, distinct from other syndromes with proximal symphalangism and hearing impairment. So far, in five families with Teunissen-Cremers syndrome, four truncating mutations and one amino acid substitution {{were found in the}} NOG gene. The majority of other mutations found in this gene are missense mutations, which might result in some residual protein activity. Reconstructive middle ear surgery is an option for treatment...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze and}} compare the {{preoperative}} factors that potentially influence the outcome of stapedotomy in our study group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 161 cases were enrolled. Clinical variables considered to influence functional results - air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) pure-tone average (PTA), <b>air-bone</b> <b>gaps</b> (ABG), sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), ABG gain and DeltaSNHL - were gender, age, case type (unilateral vs. bilateral), ear side (right vs. left), pregnancy, vascular disease and family history of otosclerosis. The audiometric variables were preoperative AC- and BC-PTA, SNHL and ABG. RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the probability of obtaining a > or = 10 dB gain is significantly affected by the following factors: age or = 50 dB and preoperative ABG > or = 30 dB. All the other factors included into the registration (gender, familiarity, side, bilateral vs. unilateral, pregnancy, vascular diseases and preoperative BC-PTA) were not found to significantly affect postoperative gain (p > 0. 05). Nevertheless, {{multivariate logistic regression analysis}} maintained a statistically significant correlation only between gain > or = 10 dB and both preoperative ABG > or = 30 dB and age < 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: The accurate knowledge of predictive factors is a valuable tool that permits the surgeon to plan surgery with a better case selection as well as assisting in counseling the patient with regard to the likelihood of success of the procedure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the hearing results of stapes surgery with two different titanium stapes prostheses. A crimping and a non-crimping prosthesis. METHODS: Retrospective analyses {{were carried out}} on the pre- and postoperative hearing results obtained after 126 primary stapedotomies with two different prostheses in patients with otosclerosis. Sixty-three patients had a stapedotomy with a K-piston Titanium (No. 1006107) type and 63 patients received a CliP-piston àWengen Titanium (No. 1006807) type after stapedotomy. The results were compared according to mean audiometrical parameters. A Chi-square Test analysis (a contingency table) was performed with odds ratio to analyze this retrospective case-control study. RESULTS: The hearing results of both titanium stapes prostheses were comparable. There {{was no difference in}} the final hearing results between the two pistons studied. No statistically significant difference between the postoperative <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> closures by the two titanium stapes prostheses studied could be demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the different properties of the two titanium piston studied (CliP-piston àWengen Titanium type, no crimping and K-piston Titanium crimping necessary) a difference in the closure of the <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> could be suspected. This comparative study could not demonstrate a statistical better <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> closure for one of the titanium pistons. Both stapes prostheses showed good results in reconstruction of the hearing loss due to otosclerosi...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} success results rates and {{complications}} of stapedotomy compared to stapedectomy in the operative management of otosclerosis. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 50 {{patients who were}} treated surgically for otosclerosis. The medical records of these patients were reviewed {{for the type of}} operation performed, complications and the serial pure tune audiometries pre- and postoperatively for at least one year. Patients with conductive hearing loss not due to otosclerosis were excluded from this study. The medical records of equal number of patients (25 patients with stapedotomy and 25 patients with stapedectomy) were analyzed for hearing improvement or loss, postoperative nausea, vomiting, vertigo, nystagmus, perilymph fistula, reparative granuloma, labyrinthitis, tinnitus and perforation of the tympanic membrane. All operations were performed by the senior consultant-otologists of our department. Stapes superstructures were removed by crural scissors and stapes footplate was perforated by microdrill. Results: Out of 25 patients with stapedotomy, 22 (88 %) developed complete closure (≤ 10 dB) of the <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> on pure tune audiometry; in two patients (8 %), the <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> improved to less 20 dB, and recurrent conductive hearing loss (due piston slipping) in one patient (4 %). On the other hand, in patients with stapedectomy, only 16 patients (64 %) developed complete closure of the <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> (≤ 10 dB) on pure tune audiometry, and in four patients (16 %) the <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> improved to less 20 dB, while recurrent conductive hearing loss occured in three patients (12 %), one patient developed complete sensorineural hearing loss (4 %), there was one case of fluctuating hearing loss due to reparative granuloma (4 %), perilymph fistula was reported in one case (4 %) and no cases of facial palsy or perforation of the tympanic membrane were recorded. Conclusion: The results of this study clearly show that stapedotomy gives better hearing results and fewer complications than stapedectomy...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{efficacy}} of stapedotomies performed on patients with small air-bone gaps (< 25 dB, sABG) {{was compared to}} the {{efficacy of}} the operation in patients who had otosclerosis with high air-bone gaps (≥ 25 dB, hABG). Methods: This retrospective study evaluates the short-term postoperative air and bone conduction thresholds and air-bone gaps after 181 CO 2 laser stapedotomies. Results: A significantly smaller <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> (ABG) and lower air conduction thresholds after surgery were observed in the group of patients who underwent surgery with preoperative ABGs of less than 25 dB. Bone conduction thresholds improve in sABG group after surgery. Conclusions: The results after stapedotomies are good even if the preoperative <b>air-bone</b> <b>gap</b> is small and that the overall risk of hearing deterioration due to stapes surgery remains low.

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Tight {{fixation}} of stapes prostheses yields better functional results because {{sound transmission}} from the incus to the prosthesis is improved. BACKGROUND: The optimal prosthesis {{to use for}} otosclerosis surgery is still a matter of debate. It has been proposed that using prostheses made of Nitinol, a shape-memory metal, produces better functional results with less variability and reduced risk for middle and inner ear damage. This {{is thought to be}} because heat activation rather than manual crimping of the prosthesis loop forms a tighter fixation. METHODS: Functional results of two groups were compared 1 year after surgery. In one group were 75 cases of stapedotomy performed using Nitinol prostheses. Results were analyzed prospectively and compared with 75 retrospectively analyzed matched controls with conventional stapes prostheses. Crimping quality was measured in 23 patients by intraoperative laser Doppler interferometry (LDI). Causality was assessed by correlating results of intraoperative LDI and postoperative pure-tone thresholds. RESULTS: Nitinol and conventional prostheses yielded postoperative <b>air-bone</b> <b>gaps</b> (ABGs) of 8. 0 and 11. 6 dB with 71 and 43 % ABG closure within 10 dB, respectively. Intraoperatively, sound transmission was improved by 2. 5 dB with the Nitinol prostheses as compared with conventional prostheses. These differences were statistically significant. Intraoperative fixation quality was positively correlated to functional outcome, but results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Tight fixation, as provided by Nitinol prostheses leads to improved functional results because of better sound transmission properties at the incus-prosthesis interface. The improvement in ABG closure is in the range of 3 dB pure-tone average and more pronounced at higher frequencies. Nitinol prostheses provide an effective treatment option in otosclerosis surgery...|$|R
40|$|A new implantable hearing system, {{the direct}} {{acoustic}} cochlear stimulator (DACS) is presented. This system {{is based on}} the principle of a power-driven stapes prosthesis and intended for the treatment of severe mixed hearing loss due to advanced otosclerosis. It consists of an implantable electromagnetic transducer, which transfers acoustic energy directly to the inner ear, and an audio processor worn externally behind the implanted ear. The device is implanted using a specially developed retromeatal microsurgical approach. After removal of the stapes, a conventional stapes prosthesis is attached to the transducer and placed in the oval window to allow direct acoustical coupling to the perilymph of the inner ear. In order to restore the natural sound transmission of the ossicular chain, a second stapes prosthesis is placed in parallel to the first one into the oval window and attached to the patient's own incus, as in a conventional stapedectomy. Four patients were implanted with an investigational DACS device. The hearing threshold of the implanted ears before implantation ranged from 78 to 101 dB (air conduction, pure tone average, 0. 5 - 4 kHz) with <b>air-bone</b> <b>gaps</b> of 33 - 44 dB in the same frequency range. Postoperatively, substantial improvements in sound field thresholds, speech intelligibility {{as well as in the}} subjective assessment of everyday situations were found in all patients. Two years after the implantations, monosyllabic word recognition scores in quiet at 75 dB improved by 45 - 100 percent points when using the DACS. Furthermore, hearing thresholds were already improved by the second stapes prosthesis alone by 14 - 28 dB (pure tone average 0. 5 - 4 kHz, DACS switched off). No device-related serious medical complications occurred and all patients have continued to use their device on a daily basis for over 2 years. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: : As {{prostheses}} {{and techniques}} related to stapes surgery develop and improve, {{there is a}} need to assess the functional outcomes of the surgery objectively. This study provides a bench test method to assess the functional results of stapes surgery by measuring volume displacement at the round window (RW), which is closely related to pressure propagation of the travelling wave inside the cochlea and thus to hearing. DESIGN: : Motion of the RW membrane in fresh temporal bones was measured using a scanning laser Doppler interferometry system for normal and reconstructed conditions, and the performance of the reconstruction with stapes surgery was quantitatively assessed by comparison of the volume displacements at the RW between the two conditions. To obtain optimal measurements, reflectivity of the laser beam of the scanning laser Doppler interferometry system was improved by retroreflective beads coated onto the surface of the RW, and orientation of the RW membrane relative to the laser beam was obtained using micro-computed tomography imaging. RESULTS: : From measurements in 12 temporal bones, difference in the RW volume displacement between normal ears and ears reconstructed with stapes surgery was approximately 15 dB below 2 kHz and approximately 10 dB above 4 kHz, which was comparable with <b>air-bone</b> <b>gaps</b> in patients after stapes surgery. Two different sizes of the stapes prostheses were also tested (n = 3), and a tendency toward a better outcome with a larger diameter was found. CONCLUSION: : The method developed in this study can be used to assess various prostheses and surgical conditions objectively in controlled laboratory environments. It may also have potential for providing ways to assess other middle- and inner-ear surgeries, and to study other aspects of hearing science...|$|R
