500|$|On October 2, detectives put Bundy in {{a lineup}} before DaRonch, who {{immediately}} {{identified him as}} [...] "Officer Roseland". Witnesses from Bountiful picked him from the same lineup as the stranger lurking about the high school auditorium. There was insufficient evidence linking him to Debra Kent (whose body was never found), but {{more than enough to}} charge him with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in the DaRonch case. He was freed on $15,000 bail, paid by his parents, and spent most of the time between indictment and trial in Seattle, living in Kloepfer's house. Seattle police had insufficient evidence to charge him in the Pacific Northwest murders, but kept him under close surveillance. [...] "When Ted <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out on the porch to go somewhere," [...] Kloepfer wrote, [...] "so many unmarked police cars started up that it sounded like the beginning of the Indy 500." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{complied}} with my wish, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> down to Steele {{and gave him}} a little shake. He awoke instantly.|$|E
60|$|As {{they drew}} near I thought {{for many reasons}} {{that it would not}} be {{advisable}} to show myself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> behind a tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right,--as soon as Parliament meets {{and a new}} writ can be issued, Clavering retires, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>step</b> {{into his}} shoes," [...] says Pen.|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{four in the}} {{afternoon}} a soldier in red trousers brings a paper round to the jail, and they unlocks the door <b>and</b> <b>I</b> walks out. The guard at the door bows <b>and</b> <b>I</b> bows, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>steps</b> into the grass and wades around to Doc Millikin's shack.|$|R
60|$|I {{set out to}} see the lumber-camp, <b>and</b> {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> forth boldly, {{the truth}} was that with all my love for the Wild West I would have liked to be at home. But here <b>I</b> was, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> determined not to show the white feather.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do," [...] I {{said in the}} {{language}} of Ahm, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out into the firelight before them. Lys gave a little cry of joy and started toward me, but Tsa grasped her arm and dragged her back.|$|E
60|$|I {{disengaged}} {{myself from}} Sally, who was clinging to my hands, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> forward {{out of the}} corner. Steele had been running. Why did he hold his coat like that? I sensed action, and the cold thrill animated me.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the silence}} closed upon me till They put new {{clothing}} on me [...] Of whiter, weaker {{flesh and bone}} more frail; [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> beneath Time's finger, once again a tribal singer [...] [And a minor poet certified by Tr--ll].|$|E
60|$|Each {{nodded in}} turn <b>and</b> Pasquini <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{prepared}} to <b>step</b> aside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Doctor, I'm no coward; no, not I--not so much!" [...] and {{he snapped}} his fingers. [...] "If I was I wouldn't say it. But I'll own up fairly, I've the shakes upon {{me for the}} gallows. You're a good man <b>and</b> a true; <b>I</b> never seen a better man! And you'll not forget what I done good, not any more than you'll forget the bad, <b>I</b> know. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>step</b> aside--see here--and leave you and Jim alone. And you'll put that down for me too, for it's a long stretch, is that!" ...|$|R
50|$|There {{certainly}} are passages of stark horror, but 'Gun Buster' {{does not make}} them too long. His is a book In which discomfort, tragedy <b>and</b> brutality <b>Is</b> <b>stepped</b> down, <b>and</b> the' spirit of the troope shines through the brighter.|$|R
6000|$|... “I see {{it clearly}} now that Madame has no friends,” she {{declared}} {{with such a}} force of restrained bitterness that it nearly made me pause. But the very obscurity of actuating motives drove me on <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out through the doorway muttering: “Everything is as Madame wishes it.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had shown}} myself thick-headed many a time before; but never so dull as now when I would have begun {{pulling out the}} rubbish without means of hiding it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back in despair, not {{understanding}} how we might {{at the same time}} remove and keep it hidden from view.|$|E
6000|$|... "A lemon-loving lot!" [...] thought I, and as I {{approached}} the porch I {{saw that the}} lady {{who had gone to}} school at Walford was standing there. I did not believe she had been eating lemons, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> forward quickly for fear that she should depart before I reached her.|$|E
60|$|He {{sprang up}} at the same moment. All the suspicions I had ever heard whispered against his sanity flashed over my mind in an instant, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> involuntarily <b>stepped</b> back a pace or two.|$|R
60|$|He {{did not see}} me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> at once <b>stepped</b> out {{of sight}} behind him.|$|R
6000|$|... “Just go {{home and}} think over what I said by yourself,” {{continued}} Archie, “whether it’s reasonable, or whether it’s really offensive or not; and let’s meet at dinner as though nothing had happened, I’ll put it this way, if you like—that I know my own character, that I’m looking forward (with great pleasure, I assure you) to a long visit from you, and that I’m taking precautions at the first. I see the thing that we—that I, if you like—might fall out upon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>step</b> in <b>and</b> obsto principiis. <b>I</b> wager you five pounds you’ll end by seeing that <b>I</b> mean friendliness, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> assure you, Francie, I do,” he added, relenting.|$|R
60|$|The craft {{had drifted}} across the chasm which held the corpses of Matai Shang, Thurid, and Phaidor, and now hung above a low hill. Opening the {{buoyancy}} escape valves I permitted {{her to come}} slowly to the ground, and as she touched, Dejah Thoris <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> from her deck and, hand in hand, turned back across the frozen waste toward the city of Kadabra.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a long}} walk; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> in at a sort of grocery to get a {{drink of}} water, where some six or eight rough looking fellows were playing dominoes upon the counter, seated upon cheese boxes. They winked, and asked what sort of sport I had had gunning on such a rainy day, but I only gulped down my water and stalked off.|$|E
6000|$|Just then a dim figure {{approached}} {{me from the}} direction of Virginia--a man, evidently. He came straight at me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> aside to let him pass; he stepped in the way and confronted me again. Then I saw that he had a mask on and was holding something in my face--I heard a click-click and recognized a revolver in dim outline. I pushed the barrel aside with my hand and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] cried Mr. Weston, [...] "as I took Miss Taylor away, it is {{incumbent}} on me to supply her place, if <b>I</b> can; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>step</b> to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw {{then that}} the {{scattered}} branches about it had been forcibly smashed <b>and</b> trampled. <b>I</b> hesitated, <b>stepped</b> forward, <b>and</b> picked it up.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it," [...] he assented. [...] "Odd sort {{of life in}} a way, {{because it}} sends us round seeking {{sometimes}} for the most trivial information. For instance, your uncle had a dinner-party to-night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>stepped</b> round for a list of the guests." ...|$|R
60|$|I heard Don bark. Turning {{the corner}} of the cliff wall I saw him on a narrow shelf. He was coming toward me and when he reached me he faced again to the wall and barked fiercely. The hair on his neck bristled. I knew he did not fancy that narrow strip of rock, nor did I. But a sudden, grim, cold {{something}} had taken possession of me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> forward.|$|E
60|$|Concentrating my mind {{upon the}} massive lock I hurled the nine thought waves against it. In breathless {{expectancy}} I waited, when finally the great door moved softly {{toward me and}} slid quietly to one side. One after the other the remaining mighty portals opened at my command and Woola <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> forth into the darkness, free, but little better off than we had been before, other than that we had full stomachs.|$|E
60|$|I {{went forward}} {{between the two}} great beasts, across a {{whitewashed}} court, till I came to a flat-headed arch guarded by the lame, the blind, the leper, and the deformed. These plucked at my clothes as I passed, and moaned and whined: but the stream that disappeared up the gentle slope of the stairway took no notice of them. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> into the semi-darkness of a long, long corridor flanked by booths, and floored with stones worn very smooth by human feet.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} that Lakor quickly unslung a belt from his harness, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back to parry a wicked thrust he lashed one end of it about my left ankle so that it wound there for an instant, while he jerked {{suddenly}} upon the other end, throwing me heavily upon my back.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Reading?’ repeats Edwin Drood, with a {{touch of}} contempt. ‘No. Doing, working, engineering. My small {{patrimony}} was left a part of the capital of the Firm I am with, by my father, a former partner; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am a charge upon the Firm until I come of age; <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>step</b> into my modest share in the concern. Jack—you met him at dinner—is, until then, my guardian and trustee.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Grewgious touched {{himself on}} the breast, and said: ‘I mean us. Therefore, let them have their little discussions and councils together, when Mr. Edwin Drood comes back here at Christmas; and then you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>step</b> in, <b>and</b> put the final touches to the business.’ ...|$|R
60|$|The church-door {{was open}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> in. There hung the chaplet {{of flowers and}} the gloves, as {{on the day of}} the funeral: the flowers were withered, it is true, but care seemed to have been taken that no dust should soil their whiteness. I have seen many monuments where art has {{exhausted}} its powers to awaken the sympathy of the spectator, but I have met with none that spoke more touchingly to my heart than this simple but delicate memento of departed innocence.|$|E
60|$|She {{had so far}} {{improved}} me, for the time, {{that though}} I was angry with her, I felt ashamed, and with a short 'Goori!' (which I intended for 'Good night!') {{got up and went}} away. They followed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> at once out of the box-door into my bedroom, where only Steerforth was with me, helping me to undress, and where I was by turns telling him that Agnes was my sister, and adjuring him to bring the corkscrew, that I might open another bottle of wine.|$|E
60|$|It was {{too early}} to go on shore, for nothing could be done at that bleak, unearthly hour; but I was in that state of nervous disquietude when any change is a relief, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> ashore. I was glad to put my feet upon the pier. Now I felt that I was my own master. It was too soon to go on board the yacht, but I could {{regulate}} my movements as I pleased, and was very willing to be alone during the hour or two in which I must remain inactive.|$|E
6000|$|... "You did {{not quite}} miss, <b>and</b> had <b>I</b> not <b>stepped</b> to the left, you would have blown my head off. Say your prayers, you dog!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{secret was}} out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{wondered}} no more. At once {{the stream and}} wet bars of sand took on a different color. I removed my boots, and waded out to a little bar. The sand seemed quite firm, but water oozed out around my feet; <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>stepped,</b> the whole bar shook like jelly. I pushed my foot through the crust, and the cold, wet sand took hold, and tried to suck me down.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was not yet}} {{comfortable}} {{photographing the}} full figure. As I became more comfortable <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back with the camera and started seeing more of the environment, I realized right away that color was very important … that color was all around and balancing color became very important for me, and it also became a source of inspiration. Every new series starts with me imagining a palette; <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> grow from there." ...|$|R
