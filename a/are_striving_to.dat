It is predominantly those nationals located in the United States who <b>are</b> <b>striving</b> <b>to</b> outsource work to other-than-US-based transcriptionists. In outsourcing work to sometimes lesser-qualified and lower-paid non-US MTs, the nationals unfortunately can force US transcriptionists to accept lower rates, {{at the risk of}} losing business altogether to the cheaper outsourcing providers. [...] In addition to the low line rates forced on US transcriptionists, US MTs are often paid as ICs (independent contractors); thus, the nationals save on employee insurance and benefits offered, etc. Unfortunately, for the state of healthcare-related administrative costs in the United States, in outsourcing, the nationals still charge the hospitals the same rate {{as they did in the}} past for highly qualified US transcriptionists but subcontract the work to non-US MTs, keeping the difference as profit.|$|E
2500|$|In Echlin's {{article in}} The Guardian, six reasons for {{choosing}} polyamory are identified: a drive towards female independence and equality driven by feminism; disillusionment with monogamy; a yearning for community; honesty and realism {{in respect of}} relational nature of human beings; human nature; and individual non-matching of the traditional monogamous stereotype. Jim Fleckenstein, director of the Institute for 21st-Century Relationships, is quoted as stating that the polyamory movement has been driven not only by science fiction, but also by feminism: [...] "Increased financial independence means that women can build relationships {{the way they want}} to." [...] The disillusionment with monogamy is said to be [...] "because of widespread cheating and divorce". The longing for community is associated with a felt need for the richness of [...] "complex and deep relationships through extended networks" [...] in response to the replacement and fragmentation of the extended family by nuclear families. [...] "For many", Echlin writes, [...] "it is a hankering for community... we have become increasingly alienated, partly because of the 20th century's replacement of the extended family with the nuclear family. As a result, many of us <b>are</b> <b>striving</b> <b>to</b> create complex and deep relationships through extended networks of multiple lovers and extended families... Polys agree that some people are monogamous by nature. But some of us are not, and more and more are refusing to be shoehorned into monogamy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the diverse}} {{accounts}} in Tovarășe de drum, Burța-Cernat singles out those of Babeți, who recalls the importance tote bags had {{for her family}} during two decades of communism, and Bittel, who speaks about the ideal female cook, as [...] "the queen of sarmale". She is however critical {{of the fact that}} such a contribution was initiated by men, arguing that this impinges on its merits: [...] "given {{the way in which they}} write here, the ladies invited to partake in this collective project leave the impression that they <b>are</b> <b>striving</b> <b>to</b> fall in line with the rules of a game, [...] to confirm [...] the already consolidated idea about them: the idea of difference—much too essentialist (and it is biological essentialism that is involved here)—, the idea that [...] they see the world, politics included, different from humanity's masculine majority." [...] As part of this comment, she also argues that the book is excessively indebted to concrete economic aspects which women found especially challenging, whereas the [...] "generically human" [...] intellectual needs are [...] "placed in brackets". Chivu, who saw the work as fluctuating between the seriousness of Ruști's account and Babeți's humorous recollection, believed Simona Popescu's contribution, which describes communist experience as [...] "laughing out of pity", to be [...] "the most balanced". In reference to the entire text, and in particular accounts of the ban on abortion, he argues: [...] "all [...] female authors fundamentally speak about the same thing: the torment of being a woman, between the frustration of having one's intimacy forbidden and the efforts of illicit femininity." [...] Babeți's account was also viewed with interest by journalist Florentina Ciuverca, who also drew attention to Ruști's story about how, despite the official campaign against abortion, a doctor preemptively subjected her to curettage over a case of vaginal bleeding.|$|E
