In this paper putting a new implemented work which is comparison with texton co-occurrence matrix to describe image features. Maximum work done successfully using texton co-occurrence matrix. A new class of texture features based on the co-occurrence of gray levels at points. These features are compared with previous types of co-occurrence based features, and experimental results are presented indicating that the new features should be useful for texture.

40|$|When a seismic record {{containing}} multiple sets of world-circling {{surface waves}} {{generated by a}} major earthquake is auto-correlated, the resulting time function is composed of groups of correlated waves whose phase delay functions are proportional {{to the difference between}} the corres-ponding epicentral distances. Phase information sufficient to calculate the dispersion of waves which travelled exactly one Earth circumference is available from that portion of the <b>auto-correlogram</b> related to the differential distance of interest. This new method also features an enhanced signal to noise ratio because of the superposition of these corre-lated waves and the simultaneous cancellation of uncorrelated random noise. The auto-correlation method has been applied to the measurement of phase and group velocities of Rayleigh and Love waves for two great circle paths characterized by similar oceanic and continental portions (two-thirds and one-third, respectively) and by negligible tectonic seg...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a global descriptor from the compressed video domain (H. 264) for near duplicate video copy detection tasks. The proposed descriptor uses a spatial-temporal feature structure in an ordinal pattern distribution format. The proposed descriptor is constructed from Intra-Prediction Modes (IPM) of key frames (IDR & I slices) and {{extracted from the}} compressed video files, using the MPEG 4 /AVC (H. 264) codec. Intra-prediction is the compression technique used in the key frames of the H. 264 codec. As the proposed feature describes pictures globally, this research compares the feature with the two other well-known global image descriptors, ordinal intensity/colour Histograms and ordinal <b>Auto-correlograms,</b> as baselines. Our experiments show how the proposed feature outperforms the baseline features in non-geometric transformations T 3, T 4 and T 5 in effectiveness as well as efficiency. It is due to better representation of the image content and smaller feature vector size. The core competency of the proposed feature is in non-linear brightness and contrast changes (Gamma expansion and compression) in which the intensity/colour Histograms and <b>Auto-correlograms</b> are deficient...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the user's access to a movie film the scene structure should be constructed. A general framework for constructing scenes consists in clustering the shots into groups and then merging overlapped groups to extract scenes. The clustering of shots represents the most challenging task and should be done correctly. This paper presents a mixed approach to cluster shots using both features computed on key-frames and the corresponding localized moving objects. Two shots are matched {{on the basis of}} color-metric histograms, color-metric <b>auto-correlograms</b> and the number of similar objects localized into them. Using the hierarchical classification technique, a partition of shots is identified for each feature separately. From all these partitions a unified partition is deduced based on a proposed distance between their components (clusters). The components of the resulted partition are then linked together using the temporal relations of Allen in order to construct [...] ...|$|R

It {{was the first}} experience of RMIT University in TRECVID and {{with respect to the}} team background in image processing and using global features in this field of research we preferred to follow the same technique in video copy detection task in this year. Our presented method is based on extracting frames from video stream. Before extracting features from the images, we perform some preprocessing phases on the extracted images to reduce the complexity. To build the multidimensional feature vector structure, global features such as <b>Auto-Correlogram</b> and Intensity Histogram are used on two different regions of the images. The same method is used in four different runs submitted by RMIT and each run was varied with other runs in their threshold (V) value. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel image feature representation method, called multi-texton histogram (MTH), for image retrieval. MTH integrates {{the advantages of}} co-occurrence matrix and histogram by representing the attribute of co-occurrence matrix using histogram. It {{can be considered as}} a generalized visual attribute descriptor but without any image segmentation or model training. The proposed MTH method is based on Julesz's textons theory, and it works directly on natural images as a shape descriptor. Meanwhile, it {{can be used as a}} color texture descriptor and leads to good performance. The proposed MTH method is extensively tested on the Corel dataset with 15 000 natural images. The results demonstrate that it is much more efficient than representative image feature descriptors, such as the edge orientation <b>auto-correlogram</b> and the texton co-occurrence matrix. It has good discrimination power of color, texture and shape features. Department of Computin...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{factors that}} shape {{patterns}} of kinship in sedentary species {{is important for}} evolutionary ecologists as well as conservation biologists. Yet, how patterns of relatedness are hierarchically structured in space remains poorly known, even in common species. Here, we use information from 16 polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers to study how small-scale kinship structure varies among house sparrows (Passer domesticus) along an urban-rural gradient. Average levels of relatedness were higher among urban individuals than among individuals from rural areas, suggesting lower rates of dispersal in more built-up habitats. Comparison of observed levels of relatedness with simulated distributions of known kinship values showed that central urban individuals had the highest proportion of closely related conspecifics in their immediate neighbourhood. Spatial <b>auto-correlograms</b> supported this small-scale genetic structure and further indicated stronger effects of genetic drift and/or limited dispersal in urban populations. Results of this study underscore the importance of individual-level analyses as a complementary approach to traditional population-level analyses when studying genetic population structure over small spatial scales. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Power spectra, {{transfer}} functions, and auto- and cross-correlograms {{were computed}} in MATLAB 7. 0. 1 (The MathWorks, www. mathworks. com). Power spectra were calculated using Welch’s method. All correlations were normalized so that autocorrelations would be 1 at zero lag. Shufflegrams were computed by correlating each UP state segment with a randomly selected UP state segment {{in either the}} same cell (<b>auto-correlograms)</b> or the second cell (cross-correlograms), without replacement. Continuous transfer functions were estimated using Welch’s averaged periodogram method. Discrete transfer functions were estimated using Wiener’s method. For calculation of power spectra and correlations during UP states, 200 - 300 millisecond periods of network activity were selected randomly by the computer program; the spectrum or correlation was calculated for each period, and the correlations or spectra were averaged together to get the estimated correlation or spectrum for each cell. All error bars were calculated as the standard error of the mean. To measure gamma modulation of synaptic barrage or spike rate, the extracellular recording was band-pass filtered at 30 - 80 Hz. Large troughs (at least half {{as large as the}} largest troughs present) in the resulting waveform were identified in Spike 2, and trough-triggered averages of the gamma-band extracellular recording, extracellularly recorded spike rate (for figure 5), and intracellularly recorded membrane potential (for figure 6), were constructed.

This study attempts three kinds of analysis of acoustic data in the far-field of two C-D nozzles at under, ideal and over expanded conditions and an aerospike nozzle at identical conditions. Firstly, the angular variation of spatial correlation with the reference microphone being placed at 900 and 150 ° to the jet inlet axis, secondly, <b>auto-correlograms</b> at the two reference locations and thirdly, cross-correlograms of the reference microphone with those at other angular locations. The effect of spike truncation on the correlation was also investigated. The results of the spatial correlation exhibits a broadening of the correlation distribution from under to over expansion for C-D nozzles, but no such trend is observed for aerospike nozzles where the condition at the cowl lip {{seems to be the}} criteria. The autocorrelogram results for the aerospike reflect the shock associated noise when the flow changes from open to closed wake regimes for microphones locations near nozzle exit. The frequencies of the wriggles in cross-correlograms match the screech tones for C-D nozzles but fail to match the tones seen at off-design conditions of the aerospike nozzles. The results show the significant acoustic differences due to the aerospike nozzle configuration despite operating at conditions identical to C-D nozzles which are captured in the correlation analysis of far-field acoustic data. ...|$|R

40|$|Classifying Remote Sensing Images (RSI) {{is a hard}} task. There are {{automatic}} approaches whose results normally need to be revised. The {{identification and}} polygon extraction tasks usually rely on applying classification strategies that exploit visual aspects related to spectral and texture patterns identified in RSI regions. There {{are a lot of}} image descriptors proposed in the literature for content-based image retrieval purposes that can be useful for RSI classification. This paper presents a comparative study to evaluate the potential of using successful color and texture image descriptors for remote sensing retrieval and classification. Seven descriptors that encode texture information and twelve color descriptors {{that can be used to}} encode spectral information were selected. We highlight the main characteristics and perform experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of these descriptors. To evaluate descriptors in classification tasks, we also proposed a methodology based on KNN classifier. Experiments demonstrate that Joint <b>Auto-Correlogram</b> (JAC), Color Bitmap, Invariant Steerable Pyramid Decomposition (SID) and Quantized Compound Change Histogram (QCCH) yield the best results. ...|$|E
40|$|All {{people with}} {{diabetes}} have {{the risk of developing}} diabetic retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication. Early detection and timely treatment can reduce the occurrence of blindness due to DR. Computer-aided diagnosis has the potential benefit of improving the accuracy and speed in DR detection. This study is concerned with automatic classification of images with microaneurysm (MA) and neovascularization (NV), two important DR clinical findings. Together with normal images, this presents a 3 -class classification problem. We propose a modified color <b>auto-correlogram</b> feature (AutoCC) with low dimensionality that is spectrally tuned towards DR images. Recognizing the fact that the images with or without MA or NV are generally different only in small, localized regions, we propose to employ a multi-class, multiple-instance learning framework for performing the classification task using the proposed feature. Extensive experiments including comparison with a few state-of-art image classification approaches have been performed and the results suggest that the proposed approach is promising as it outperforms other methods by a large margin.

40|$|Our shot {{boundary}} determination system {{consists of}} three components, including a FOI detector, a generalized CUT detector, and a long gradual transition detector. One support vector machine, taking score vector calculated with graph partition model as input, is used to detect CUT. Long gradual transition is determined by another three support vector machines with multi-resolution score vectors as input. After these detectors make decision successively, the locations of shot boundaries and the corresponding types are obtained. It {{is found in the}} experiments on development data that by tuning penalty ratio of loss of misclassifying the positive and the negative samples, it is possible to control the trade-off between precision and recall. 31 runs are generated from the same system with the 4 support vector machines being trained with different parameters. Among them, 10 runs are submitted for evaluation. And the results show that our system is among the best. In our system for low level feature extraction, some spatial features of motion vectors are proposed to select the motion vectors which describe the camera motion in deed. The four-parameter affine model is used to describe the camera motion, and the ILSE technique is used to calculate the parameters. Then camera motion will be classified into three classes: pan, tilt and zoom with an accurate classification method based on finite-state automata. Our system achieves best results in this task of TRECVID 2005. Our systems for high level feature extraction rely heavily on the visual information.

The former is very similar to the frequency of the natural walk. 2) The repetitive action is a sort of a consecutive reaction time and is regarded as a conditional reflex in mechanism on the ground of the experiment (2). 3) When the conditioning phone of physically regular and uniform interval was applied, time series formed in the brain or central nervous system was organized subjectively and the effect was expressed to the performance which showed periodic rhythm at higher frequency in the view of <b>auto-correlogram.</b> 4) Fluctuation of the performance rhythm is about 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of that of heart rhythm...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a reflection}} based imaging technique, with numerous applications, initially in medical diagnostics. Unlike ultrasound, another reflection imaging technique, OCT relies on light scattering in samples, low coherence near- infrared interferometry, and graphical image construction, to acquire 2 D and 3 D reflectogram images. OCT has resolution {{an order of magnitude}} greater than ultrasound, but its depth penetration is less than a few millimetres. Axial resolution is a critical parameter in determining whether OCT can be used to resolve specific features in a sample image. Typically, measures of resolution have been attributed only to the light source’s characteristics, including its coherence length and the FWHM of its frequency spectrum’s inverse FT, or <b>auto-correlogram.</b> The need to cost effectively visualize the OCT-system-generated auto-correlograms, and OCT cross-correlograms (A-scan) (produced using many different OCT light sources), has necessitated the extrinsic-evolution of an OCT simulation model, presented in this thesis. This research indicated that empirical resolution in vivo is also strongly dependent on the optical characteristics of the tissue, including surface reflection. When the surface reflection is removed from the A-scan, the minimum stratum depth that can be resolved for the sub-surface strata, is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, this subtraction enhances the stratum depth resolution, so that it approaches more closely the light source’s resolution limit, compared to A-scans without the subtraction. The time domain OCT’s optical delay line (ODL) and light source components were also reviewed to determine their affordability and functionality for engineering a portable, high resolution, but simple OCT modality. To this end, a stationary ODL, using a transmissive optical light valve array and a stepped mirrored structure (SMS), was characterised in ‘proof of principle’ experiments. Unfortunately, fabrication of the SMS, using four affordable techniques, proved unsuccessful; however, more promising techniques, based on the theoretical developments in this thesis, are envisaged. A stochastic pseudo-genetic algorithm (GAM), similar, but not exactly analogous to theoretical genetic intrinsic-evolution, was characterised and used to backwards-fit the solution set of strata depths and reflectivities of a selected OCT A-scan. Unfortunately, its speed in Matlab was not timely enough for e-medical application – though in c this GAM could run faster. This slowness is due to the GAM’s stochastic nature, prompting future investigation of other GAMs, which will eliminate the stochastic element so that more timely results can be achieved...|$|E
