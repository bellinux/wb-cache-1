Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in [...] "Sorry her lot".

[...] He continues, [...] "the bassoon and basses... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore... in the improbable key of <b>A</b> <b>flat</b> <b>minor....</b> Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed.

5000|$|The {{brothers}} Contiguglia have rediscovered, {{performed and}} recorded {{a number of}} unusual and forgotten works from the duo-piano repertoire, including all the Schubert duets and duos.

50|$|The first {{movement}} starts softly, {{with the}} clarinets introducing the theme. The full orchestra later plays the theme in a grandioso manner, {{leading to a}} horn solo which introduces the secondary, lyrical theme. The first theme is played throughout the movement and during {{the last part of}} the third movement, giving the concerto a cyclic structure. The solo cello begins with a quasi improvisando section stating the theme in B major followed by triple-stopped chords. The cello then plays the theme again in E major. This concerto requires a lot of technical ability, especially in the coda, where the cello plays octaves and many double stops. After the resolution by the solo cello, there is a modulation in which the winds play <b>an</b> e <b>flat</b> <b>minor</b> chord, changing the key. The solo cello ends with trills on a high B. The movement ends tutti with the restatement of the first theme marked grandioso and fortissimo.|$|R

50|$|In March 1894 the Philharmonic Society {{opened its}} season, {{moving to the}} Queen's Hall. Borwick played the Beethoven Emperor Concerto.

50|$|Each {{degree of}} the scale, {{starting}} with the tonic (the first, lowest note of the scale), is represented by a number. Their difference from the major scale is shown. Thus a number without <b>a</b> sharp or <b>flat</b> represents <b>a</b> major (or perfect) interval. A number with <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> represents <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> interval, and a number with a sharp (though there are none in this example) represents an augmented interval. In this example, the numbers mean: 1=unison, 2=major second, 3=minor third, 4=perfect fourth, 5=perfect fifth, 6=minor sixth, 7=minor seventh, 8=octave. So, the natural minor scale consists of: 1, the tonic, followed by 2, a note a major second above the tonic, 3, a note a minor third above the tonic, and so forth, up to 8, a note an octave above the tonic.|$|R
