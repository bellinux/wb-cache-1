40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} {{the idea}} of “robot ergonomics ” in which robotic tasks are evaluated according to ergonomics criteria. Robot performance is continuously reeorded in terms of total motion for each robotic link, the load applied on each joint, and the accuracy of each motion. Evaluating robot motion can assist {{in the design of}} a robotic cell, where robot position and layout of peripheral equipment are determined. In previous work, the main measure has been AJU (<b>Arm</b> <b>Joint</b> Utilization). Two new measures are developed here: AJA (<b>Arm</b> <b>Joint</b> Accuracy) and AJL (<b>Arm</b> <b>Joint</b> Load). A test case of an articulated industrial robot, performing a kiting task is presented. Robot performance is evaluated for various bin positions, and based on these results, the bin position relative to the robot is determined based on all three measures, AJA, AJL and AJU. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a model of an impaired human arm performing a reaching motion, which will be used to predict hand path trajectories for people with reduced <b>arm</b> <b>joint</b> mobility. Assuming that the arm was in contact with a surface during the entire movement, the contact conditions at the initial and final task locations were determined and used to generate the entire trajectory. The model was validated by comparing it to experimental data, which simulated an <b>arm</b> <b>joint</b> impairment by physically constraining the joint motion with a brace. Future research will include using the model in the development of physical training protocols that avoid early recruitment of "healthy" Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOF) for reaching motions, thus facilitating an Active Range-Of-Motion Recovery (AROM) for a particular impaired joint...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of {{end-effector}} position control of a mobile manipulator with only <b>arm</b> <b>joint</b> inputs being manipulated, as {{it is assumed that}} the wheeled platform actuation may be out of direct control. Even though such problem may be found in situations such as pointing of a robotic camera on a human-driven vehicle or platform disturbance rejection, much of the research reported in the literature assumed either fully coupled or fully decoupled control for arm and platform. We develop a fully coupled dynamic model of the mobile manipulator system, properly dealing with non-holonomic constraints, and, based on a time dependent feedback linearization scheme, we obtain a nonlinear optimal control law with <b>arm</b> <b>joint</b> inputs only. Results are illustrated by a simulated pointing control of a two degrees-of-freedom manipulator sitting on a differential drive platform...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of the extent of}} involvement of the distal and proximal joints in a complex arm tremor is important clinically, as tremor generated around the distal and proximal <b>arm</b> <b>joints</b> can be differentially alleviated by surgical intervention to the thalamic and subthalamic targets, respectively. We observed that the tremor present in spiral drawings shows a diagonal directional preference. We hypothesized that the directional preference of tremor within spiral drawings could be related to the involvement of different <b>arm</b> <b>joints.</b> In this study, we tested this hypothesis by: (1) studying simulated tremulous drawings performed by healthy subjects with the joints selectively restrained; (2) recording surface EMGs from the forearm extensor and deltoid muscles during drawing; and (3) mathematical modelling the kinematics of the arm in 2 D drawings. Our data showed that a "main diagonal" axis of orientation of the tremor along the orientation of the forearm indicates a predominantly proximal tremor driven by the shoulder, and a "cross diagonal" axis of orientation of tremor (i. e. perpendicular to the forearm) indicates that the tremor is predominantly distal and driven by the elbow or wrist. We conclude that the spiral drawing task can be used as an objective and quantitative method for differentiating the involvement of the proximal and distal <b>arm</b> <b>joints</b> in complex <b>arm</b> tremors...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} the hand orientation for grasping (azimuth) is strongly coupled to arm movement direction in the horizontal plane. The question is whether this coupling is directly controlled or secondary to a regulation of the arm angular configuration. To this purpose, we quantified hand orientation and <b>arm</b> <b>joint</b> rotations during unconstrained reaching movements in healthy subjects and in patients with hemiparesis due to stroke since they use altered joint rotation patterns for reaching. Seven healthy subjects and eight patients with a right hemiparesis participated (four had a moderate and four had a mild disorder). Four electromagnetic sensors were used to measure hand orientation and to compute the wrist, elbow and shoulder joint angles. Hand azimuth {{at the time of}} grasping was correlated to arm movement direction in all the healthy and hemiparetic individuals. In healthy subjects, a regression analysis of the <b>arm</b> <b>joint</b> rotations suggested that the coupling between hand azimuth and movement direction was not due to a correlation with a particular degree of freedom. Patients used different hand orientations for grasping and different joint rotation patterns that varied according to their level of disability and the use of compensatory strategies. The findings observed in both healthy subjects and patients with stroke show that the coupling of hand azimuth for grasping to movement direction was controlled independently of the set of joint rotations used for reaching. This suggests that it is a basic synergy directly controlled by the motor system...|$|E

The model has three rigid planar links with rotational joints imitating an upper arm, forearm and hand with shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. The kinematics of the shooting arm is solved to calculate the joint angles, and the velocity and angular velocity of links at release. There are many angular displacement and velocity combinations of shoulder, elbow and wrist joints to produce the optimal release speed, angle and backspin of the ball at release. Shoulder rotation contributes to the vertical component of release velocity of the ball and elbow and wrist actions mostly produce the horizontal component of release velocity and backspin of the ball when the forearm and hand are nearly vertical at release...|$|E
