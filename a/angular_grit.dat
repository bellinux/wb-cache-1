40|$|Mild steel {{surfaces}} {{that are}} to be protected by aluminium or zinc spray coatings are generally prepared by blasting with chilled iron <b>angular</b> <b>grit.</b> Previous work 1 had shown that a relationship exists between the grit blasting conditions (at least in terms of blasting angle and grit condition), the reflectivity of the blasted surface and the bond strength of a spray coating of aluminium on the blasted surface. An instrument has been developed that assesses the suitability of a blasted surface for subsequent spraying by measuring the reflectivity and has proved reasonably successful under laboratory conditions. The present need is to ascertain the performance of this reflectivity meter under shop and site conditions. The opportunity to carry out such tests at H. M. Dockyard, Devonport, was offered by the Ministry of Defence and a series of tests was made on 16 th June, 1965...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} samples have been {{characterized}} by 3 D image analysis (using X-Ray microtomography). The samples consist of blends of metallic particles: steel shot abrasives (“balls”), steel fibres and <b>angular</b> steel <b>grit</b> particles. The blends were systematically prepared in different proportions of the raw products. Various shape and size parameters were measured on the particles: equivalent volume diameter (dV), maximum inscribed sphere diameter (dIN), particle length (maximum Feret diameter), particle elongation (El), particle flatness (Fl) etc. The results are expressed as statistical shape and size parameters, expressed both as volume and number weighted distributions. The blends have been tested for compaction using a cylindrical container which experiences a series of 500 free falls over a height of 3 mm. The compaction dynamics was monitored using a sensor that measures {{the evolution of the}} solid volume fraction {{as a function of the}} tap number. From the obtained compaction curve, the Hausner ratio and a flowability index were extracted. The same blends have also been analysed using a rotating drum at different rotation speeds to analyze the evolution of the flowing angle. As the system is based on the analysis of a time sequence of 50 images (separated by 0. 5 sec) it is possible to measure the intermittent character of the powder flow. The resulting measure is a cohesive index of the powder. The results obtained from physical testing were systematically plotted as a function of various statistical indices of the shape and size distributions in order to reveal correlations between particle shape properties and physical behaviour. Some clear trends appeared, demonstrating the influence of particle shape on powder physical properties...|$|R
