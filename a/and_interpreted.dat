5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations <b>and</b> <b>interpreted</b> the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
5|$|Doro Pesch {{was cast}} as the warrior Meha in the prehistoric action movie Anuk-Der Weg des Kriegers (Anuk-The Way of the Warrior), written, {{directed}} <b>and</b> <b>interpreted</b> by Luke Gasser and shot in Switzerland in 2005. The film was released in 2006 and features also Marc Storace, lead singer of the Swiss hard rock band Krokus. During the period of shooting, she wrote and recorded new songs in Switzerland with local session musicians {{and the production of}} Gasser, who used three of those songs for the soundtrack of the movie. More songs were recorded in Germany in the spare time between tours with her band and usual collaborators, and released in 2006 in the album Warrior Soul. The screenplay for a second movie with the same cast was written in the following years and Gasser finally found the funding to start production in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{official}} view was increasingly questioned. The aristocratic Ancien Régime had been weakened severely during the Napoleonic Wars, when the Confederacy {{had been a}} French satellite state. The episode of the Helvetic Republic, short-lived as it had been, had instilled democratic ideals in the population. The restauration of the Ancien Régime {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic era proved to be only temporary, until Switzerland became a federal state in 1848 when its first democratic constitution was passed. During the restoration, democratic publishers instrumented <b>and</b> <b>interpreted</b> the history of the peasant war as an allegory on the then current struggle for democracy, seeing the peasant war of 1653 as an early precursor of their own efforts to overcome the authoritarian regime. Well-known examples are the illustrations by Martin Disteli from 1839/40, who used scenes from the peasant war in such allegoric ways.|$|E

5|$|Since its premiere, 2001: A Space Odyssey {{has been}} {{analyzed}} <b>and</b> <b>interpreted</b> by professional film critics, amateur writers and science fiction fans, {{virtually all of}} whom have mentioned its deliberate ambiguity. Questions about 2001 range from uncertainty about its deeper philosophical implications about humanity's origins and final destiny in the universe, to interpreting elements of the film's more enigmatic scenes such as the meaning of the monolith, or the final fate of astronaut David Bowman. There are also simpler and more mundane questions about what drives the plot, in particular the causes of Hal's breakdown (explained in earlier drafts but kept mysterious in the film).|$|E
5|$|The Cottingley Fairies {{appear in}} a series of five {{photographs}} taken by Elsie Wright (1901–88) and Frances Griffiths (1907–86), two young cousins who lived in Cottingley, near Bradford in England. In 1917, when the first two photographs were taken, Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 9. The pictures {{came to the attention of}} writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who used them to illustrate an article on fairies he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of The Strand Magazine. Doyle, as a spiritualist, was enthusiastic about the photographs, <b>and</b> <b>interpreted</b> them as clear and visible evidence of psychic phenomena. Public reaction was mixed; some accepted the images as genuine, but others believed they had been faked.|$|E
5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, <b>and</b> <b>interpreted</b> is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} on the {{assessment}} of translation <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> skills we will briefly outline the origins of translation and interpretation testing and we will review current assessment practices in the educational {{as well as the}} professional domain along reliability and validity criteria. In view of the scope of this volume, we will focus on the relationship between language testing and {{the assessment of}} translation <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> skills. Both translation assessment <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> assessment have an obvious link with the measurement of foreign language competence since knowledge of the target language (understanding the source language and mastering the target language) is prerequisite for delivering a successful translation or interpreting performance. However, both translation competence <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> competence encompass more than foreign language competence as is evidenced by the definitions of translation <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> competence in the literature and the test constructs that have been proposed in reported assessment practices. A sound assessment practice within this domain should therefore take the different dimensions of translation <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> competence into account...|$|R

40|$|Considering that Brazilian {{researches}} on translation <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> from/into/between sign languages can {{be combined}} into {{what is known as}} Sign Language Translation <b>and</b> <b>Interpreting</b> Studies (SLTIS), we carry out a reflection on the emergence of this new academic field and its direct connection to Translation Studies (TS) <b>and</b> <b>Interpreting</b> Studies (IS). Hence, we shall present the interdependence and fundamental distinction between TS and IS, search for references in the <b>interpreting</b> <b>and</b> translation of sign languages in major TS and IS writings, and reflect on the SLTIS in Brazil. This reflection is based on sign language translation <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> research carried out in graduate school and on the four editions of the National Conference on Sign Language Translation <b>and</b> <b>Interpreting</b> Research. We have observed that while the SLTIS stand out for involving a visual-gestural language, they also maintain an undeniable and necessary link to their origins, since they have no existence beyond the TS and IS academic fields...|$|R
5|$|Within a {{month of}} the cabal's formation, the other team members started {{detailed}} game development, and within another month, began playtesting through Sierra. The cabal were intimately involved with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting, as to take the player's feedback, including any confusion or inability to solve a game's puzzle, into action items to be fixed on the next iteration of a game. Later, {{with most of the}} main adjustments made, the team included means to benchmark players' actions which they then collected <b>and</b> <b>interpreted</b> statistically to further fine-tune levels. Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for Half-Lifes success, and was reused for Team Fortress 2 from the start.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause and colleagues suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson and colleagues added the presence of an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They also share the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: presence of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad and colleagues who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth <b>and</b> <b>interpreted</b> this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.|$|E
5|$|The low foot {{to lower}} leg ratio in Deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short {{metatarsus}} (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom {{suggested that the}} short metatarsus {{may be related to}} the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features– the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.– as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, <b>and</b> <b>interpreted</b> the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of Deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.|$|E
