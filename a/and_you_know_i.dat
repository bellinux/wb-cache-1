500|$|Despite this, the duo {{have not}} staged a {{full-scale}} tour or performed shows since 2010. Garfunkel confirmed to Rolling Stone in 2014 {{that he believes}} they will tour in the future, although Simon had been too [...] "busy" [...] in recent years. [...] "I know that audiences {{all over the world}} like Simon and Garfunkel. I'm with them. But I don't think Paul Simon's with them," [...] he remarked. In a 2016 interview with NPR's David Greene, when asked about the possibility of reuniting, Simon stated; [...] "Well, I don't think most people do [...] The fact is, is, like, we did do two big reunions, and we're done. There's nothing really much to say. You know, the music essentially stopped in 1970. [...] <b>And,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> mean, quite honestly, we don't get along. So it's not like it's fun. If it was fun, I'd say, OK, sometimes we'll go out and sing old songs in harmony. That's cool. But when it's not fun, you know, and you're {{going to be in a}} tense situation, well, then I have a lot of musical areas that I like to play in. So that'll never happen again. That's that." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who was also in attendance, said in a 1992 interview, [...] "After I saw Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me at Cannes, David Lynch had {{disappeared}} so far up his own ass that I {{have no desire to}} see another David Lynch movie until I hear something different. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> loved him.

[...] Rico Love commented on the recording sessions of the song {{in an interview with}} magazine Rap-Up, saying that [...] "it was a really interesting situation because of the history that was in the room and the energy was so positive. It was electric. I really wanted to try my best to pull the most explosive vocals out of them. ´ It kinda carried on the next part of the story, just showing their growth and their maturity, and making it real and true to both singers. It was an amazing energy, an amazing vibe. The girls were all positive. It was just fun. We had a great time and I learned so much from both of them during the session." [...] Love also revealed that they did alternate versions of the song for both Monica and Brandy's albums. He noted that the changes were minimal.|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Bowdoin with a B.A. in Government and a minor in Asian Studies in 2004, Kondabolu had no {{intention}} of pursuing a stand-up comedy career. He moved to Seattle and took the LSAT preparatory to applying to law school, and worked as an immigrant rights organizer in Seattle for the organization Hate Free Zone (later renamed as OneAmerica) from 2005 to 2007. As part of Hate Free Zone's [...] "Liberty and Justice for All", he led a monthly conversation project focusing on immigration and human rights, saying, [...] "Grassroots organizers know; intimate meetings and real dialogue can cut through the cacophony like nothing else." [...] He found his organizing work fulfilling:I loved organizing, <b>and,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> was working with victims of hate crimes, I was doing some work in detention centers and meeting families whose - you know, who had family members who were going to be deported, and, you know, it was really powerful, workplace discrimination cases...Although his stand-up comedy career was gaining traction in 2007, he was accepted to the Masters in Human Rights program at the London School of Economics in 2007, and thus took a hiatus year from stand-up to earn his MSc.|$|E

2500|$|Although he left Apple {{midway through}} 1971, {{as a result}} of {{business}} issues related to the Beatles' break-up, Preston continued to work with Harrison throughout the 1970s. In response to a request from the former Beatle, Preston agreed to play at the Concert for Bangladesh on 1 August 1971, to raise funds and awareness for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Preston joined a large band that included Harrison, Clapton, Ringo Starr, Leon Russell and backing singers such as Claudia Linnear and Jo Green, the last of whom co-wrote some of the songs on Preston's first A album, I Wrote a Simple Song. Two shows were held that day, at Madison Square Garden in New York, at each of which Preston performed a rousing version of [...] "That's the Way God Planned It". The performance from the evening show, which appeared on the live album of the event and in the 1972 concert film, ended with Preston leaving his seat behind the Hammond organ and dancing across the front of the stage, delighting the New York audience. Preston later recalled of this spontaneous act: [...] "I got happy … The band was jamming and it was pumping, the people were with us – <b>and,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> just had to rejoice!" ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{slowed down}} his {{feelings}} about the album after that saying [...] "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That {{was one of those}} instances where I got in a zone, like, [...] "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.|$|E
