40|$|Introducing a {{technology}} push to stimulate entrepreneurship {{in remote areas}} in developing countries can be examined {{in the context of}} <b>a</b> <b>franchising</b> model (social or commercial franchising). The results of this study (fieldwork in Kalimantan, Indonesia) point to a high feasibility of introducing {{a technology}} push by <b>a</b> <b>franchising</b> model. The results indicate that the smallholder rubber farmers (community level) and the head of villages, head of district and the government departments (low, middle and high institutional level) support a technology push and are willing to participate. Furthermore almost all stakeholders prefer <b>a</b> <b>franchising</b> model to introduce a technology push with social franchising elements. Additionally, empirical evidence confirmed the main theoretical argument of this research: a technology push carried out by <b>a</b> <b>franchising</b> model can stimulate (social) entrepreneurship in remote villages. This study thus concluded that in order to stimulate (social) entrepreneurship in local communities and with that local economic development, <b>a</b> hybrid <b>franchising</b> (<b>a</b> combination of both commercial and social franchising) model should be used to carry a technology push...|$|R
