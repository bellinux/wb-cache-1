40|$|SummaryEosinophilic nasosinusal {{polyposis}} is a chronic inflammatory infection with elevated infiltration of eosinophils, which presents {{high rate of}} recurrence after surgical treatment. The continuous inflammatory process {{that leads to the}} formation of polyps requires constant clinical treatment. Contributing to the maintenance of eosinophilia are cytokines IL 5 (interleukin- 5) and GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophages colony-stimulating factor), which show up in elevated concentrations. These oligoproteins diminish the rate of apoptosis and prolong the survival of eosinophils. AimBy diminishing these cytokines, the action of Mitomycin C (MMC), an <b>antineoplasic</b> <b>drug</b> which inhibits the synthesis of DNA, was studied. In a recent study the power of this drug to cause apoptosis in eosinophils, in vitro, of nasal polyps was verified. MethodologyA biopsy of the nasal polyps was undertaken in 15 patients carriers of eosinophilic {{nasosinusal polyposis}} 24 hours after applying 0. 5 mg/ml of MMC during five minutes. RT-PCR (reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction) for IL 5 and GM-CSF was the method used to obtain the results. ResultsThe comparison of the results of GM-CSF pre- and post-application of MMC, when the paired T-test was used, showed p= 0. 041 and for IL 5 we found p< 0. 001. ConclusionTopic use of MMC in patients with eosinophilic nasosinusal polyposis shows statistically significant reduction for GM-CSF and significant and important reduction for IL 5...|$|E
40|$|A mini-library of star-shaped thermoresponsive {{polymers}} having six arms {{was prepared}} using a hexafunctional xanthate by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Star polymers with homopolymeric arms of poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL), copolymeric arms of poly(N-vinylcaprolactam-co-N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PNVCL-co-PNVP) and also arms of block copolymers of PNVCL-b-PVAc, (PNVCL-co-PNVP) -b-PVAc, and combinations of them changing {{the order of}} the block was achieved exploiting the R-RAFT synthetic methodology (or R-group approach), wherein the thiocarbonyl group is transferred to the polymeric chain end. Taking advantage of the RAFT benefits, the molecular weight of the star polymers was controlled (Mn = 11, 880 – 153, 400 g/mol) to yield star polymers of different sizes and lower critical solution temperature (LCST) values. Removing the xanthate group of the star polymers allowed for the introduction of specific functional groups at the ends of the star arms and resulted in an increase of the LCST values. Star PNVCL-b-PVAc diblock copolymers with PVAc contents of 5 – 26 mol % were prepared; the hydrophobic segment (PVAc) is located {{at the end of the}} star arms. Interestingly, when the PVAc content was 5 – 7 mol %, the hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) value of the aggregates formed in water was almost the same sa the Dh of the corresponding PNVCL star homopolymers. It is proposed that these star block copolymers self-assemble into single flowerlike micelles, showing great stability in aqueous solution. Star block copolymers with the PVAc hydrophobic block in the core of the star, such as PVAc-b-(PNVCL-co-PNVP), form micellar aggregates in aqueous solution with Dh values in the range from ~ 115 to 245 nm while maintaining a thermoresponsive behavior. Micellar aggregates of selected star polymers were used to encapsulate methotrexate (MTX) showing their potential in the temperature controlled release of this <b>antineoplasic</b> <b>drug.</b> The importance of the order in which each block constituent is introduced in the arms of the star polymers for their solution/aggregation behavior is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Testicular {{germ cell}} cancer affects mainly young men. It {{is the most}} {{frequent}} type of cancer in 20 – 35 year old men. Since cancer treatment using <b>antineoplasic</b> <b>drugs</b> and ionizing radiation has {{a negative effect on}} the function of the gonads, testicular cancer patients are offered the opportunity to cryopreserve their semen samples before the beginning of therapy. For this reason it would be of interest to know whether there is chromosome instability in their spermatozoa prior to any treatment. Using the interspecific human–hamster fertilization system, we have analysed a total of 340 chromosome complements from spermatozoa of control donors and 320 chromosome com-plements from testicular cancer patients.

40|$|Search of new {{activity}} substances {{starting from}} chemotherapeutic agents, continously appears in international literature. Perhaps this search {{has been done}} more frequently {{in the field of}} anti-tumor chemotherapy on account of the unsuccess in saving advanced stage patients. The new point in this matter during the last decade was computer aid in planning more rational drugs. In near future "the accessibility of supercomputers and emergence of computer net systems, willopen new avenues to rational drug design" (Portoghese, P. S. J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32, 1). Unknown pharmacological active compounds synthetized by plants can be found even without this eletronic devices, as tradicional medicine has pointed out in many contries, and give rise to a new drug. These compounds used as found in nature or after chemical modifications have produced successful experimental medicaments as FAA, "flavone acetic acid" with good results as inibitors of slow growing animal tumors currently in preclinical evaluation for human treatment.

40|$|NF-κB {{interferes with}} the effect of most {{anti-cancer}} drugs through induction of anti-apoptotic genes. Targeting NF-κB is therefore expected to potentiate conventional treatments in adjuvant strategies. Here we used a pharmacological inhibitor of the IKK 2 kinase (AS 602868) to block NF-κB activation. In human colon cancer cells, inhibition of NF-κB using 10 [*]μM AS 602868 induced a 30 – 50 % growth inhibitory effect and strongly enhanced the action of SN- 38, the topoisomerase I inhibitor and CPT- 11 active metabolite. AS 602868 also potentiated the cytotoxic effect of two other antineoplasic drugs: 5 -fluorouracil and etoposide. In xenografts experiments, inhibition of NF-κB potentiated the antitumoural effect of CPT- 11 in a dose-dependent manner. Eighty-five and 75 % decreases in tumour size were observed when mice were treated with, respectively, 20 or 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 AS 602868 associated with 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 CPT- 11 compared to 47 % with CPT- 11 alone. Ex vivo tumour analyses {{as well as in}} vitro studies showed that AS 602868 impaired CPT- 11 -induced NF-κB activation, and enhanced tumour cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. AS 602868 also enhanced the apoptotic potential of TNFα on HT- 29 cells.

40|$|Several <b>antineoplasic</b> <b>drugs</b> {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to be carcinogenic or to have mutagenic and teratogenic effects. The greatest protection is achieved {{with the implementation of}} administrative and engineering controls and safety procedures. Objective: to evaluate the improvements on pharmacy technicians' work practices, after the implementation of operational procedures related to individual protection, biologic safety cabinet disinfection and cytotoxic drug preparation. Method: case-study in a hospital pharmacy undergoing a certification process. Six pharmacy technicians were observed during their daily activities. Characterization of the work practices was made using a checklist based on ISOPP and PIC guidelines. The variables studied concerning cleaning/disinfection procedures, personal protective equipment and procedures for preparing cytotoxic drugs. The same work practices were evaluated after four months of operational procedures implementation. Concordance between work practices and guidelines was considered to be a quality indicator (guidelines concordance practices number/total number of practices x 100). Results: improvements were observed after operational procedures implementation. An improvement of 6, 25 % in personal protective equipment practice was achieved by changing second pair of gloves every thirty minutes. The major progress, 10 %, was obtained in disinfection procedure, where 80 % of tasks are now realized according to guidelines. By now, we hot an improvement of only 1 % at drug preparation procedure by placing one cytotoxic drug at a time inside the biological safety cabinet. Then, 85 % of practices are according to guidelines. Conclusion: before operational procedures implementation 80, 3 % of practices were according to the guidelines, while now is 84, 4 %.

40|$|Oral mucositis (OM) {{induced by}} <b>antineoplasic</b> <b>drugs</b> is an important, dose-limiting, and costly {{side effect of}} cancer therapy. Calotropis procera is a plant plant constitutively {{produces}} abundant latex that is reported to possess anti-inflammatory, bacteriolytic, insecticidal, analgesic properties. The present work aimed to describe the effect of laticifer proteins of Calotropis procera (LP) in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inducible enzymes, such as, cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the model of OM in Hamsters. OM was induced by two intraperitoneal (i. p.) administrations of 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) on the 1 st and 2 nd days (60 and 40 mg/kg, respectively) in hamsters (n= 5). LP (0, 25; 1; 5 E 25 mg / kg) was injected i. p. 24 h before and 24 h after mechanical trauma of the cheek pouches. Control group received only saline. On the 10 th day, the animals were sacrificed and tissues from the cheek pouches were harvested. Macroscopical and histopathological (inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, hemorrhage {{and the formation of}} ulcerations and abscess) analysis as well as immunohistochemistry for TNF-&# 61537;, IL- 1 &# 946;, iNOS and COX- 2 was performed in the cheek pouch tissue. Kruskal Wallis/Dunn was used as statistical tests. P< 0. 05 was accepted. Ethics Committee 036 / 10. The LP significantly inhibited macroscopical and histopathological parameters when compared to control group with maximum effect in macroscopic scores reaching 75 % and 66 % of maximum effect at the histopathological evaluation. The MPO activity was also significantly inhibited by LP in 91 % at the same dose (p< 0, 001) and also inhibited the lost weight of 5 - FU induced-oral mucositis. The cheek pouches of hamsters submitted to OM showed marked immunostaining for TNF-&# 61537;, IL- 1 &# 946;, iNOS and COX- 2 on inflamed conjunctive (Cj) and epithelial (Ep) tissue compared with the cheek pouches of the normal control group. LP caused considerable reduction in the immunostaining for TNF-&# 61537; (62 %,Cj; 70 %,Ep), IL- 1 &# 946; (87 %,Cj; 80 %,Ep), iNOS (82 %Cj; 52 %Ep) and COX- 2 (70 %,Cj; 100 %,Ep) in the check pouches tissue when compared with the group of animals subjected to experimental mucositis that received saline instead of LP. These findings show anti-inflammatory effects of LP in 5 -FU-induced OM. The protective effect could be supported by the reduction of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&# 61537; and IL- 1 &# 946; and the enzymes iNOS and COX- 2. The protective mechanism appears to involve inhibition of the expression of iNOS, COX- 2, TNF-&# 61537;, and IL- 1 &# 946;. Mucosite oral (MO) induzida por drogas antineoplÃsicas Ã um importante fator limitante da dose e efeitos colaterais da terapia do cÃncer.

No 10 Â dia, os animais foram sacrificados e os tecidos da mucosa jugal foram colhidos. Foram realizadas no tecido mucosa jugal as anÃlises macroscÃpicas e histopatolÃgicas (infiltraÃÃo de cÃlulas inflamatÃrias, edema, hemorragia e Ã formaÃÃo de ulceraÃÃes e abscessos), bem como a imunohistoquÃmica para TNF-&# 945;, IL- 1 &# 946;, NOSi e COX- 2. Foram utilizados Kruskal Wallis / Dunn como testes estatÃsticos, onde P < 0, 05 foi aceito. O estudo foi submetido ao ComitÃ de Ãtica sob o protocolo 036 / 10. Observou-se que a LP inibiu significativamente parÃmetros macroscÃpicos e histopatolÃgicos, quando comparado ao grupo controle, com efeito mÃximo nos escores macroscÃpicos atingindo 75 % e 66 % do efeito mÃximo na avaliaÃÃo histopatolÃgica. A atividade de Mieloperoxidase (MPO) tambÃm foi significativamente inibida por LP em 91 % com a mesma dose (p < 0, 001) quando comparado ao grupo controle e tambÃm inibiu a perda de peso em animais submetidos a mucosite oral e tratados com LP. A mucosa jugal dos animais submetidos a MO mostrou imunomarcaÃÃo para TNF-&# 945;, IL- 1 &# 946;, NOSi e COX- 2 na conjuntiva inflamada (Cj) e tecido epitelial (Ep) em comparaÃÃo com o tecido jugal do grupo normal. LP causou reduÃÃo considerÃvel na imunomarcaÃÃo para TNF-&# 945; (62 %, Cj, 70 %, Ep), IL- 1 &# 946; (87 %, Cj, 80 %, Ep), NOSi (82 % Cj; Ep 52 %) e COX - 2 (70 %, Cj, 100 %, Ep) no tecido jugal quando comparado com o grupo de animais submetidos Ã mucosite experimental que receberam salina, em vez de LP. Esses achados demonstram efeitos anti-inflamatÃrios de LP em MO induzida por 5 -FU.
