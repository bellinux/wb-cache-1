5000|$|A case of <b>artificial</b> <b>anus</b> {{treated by}} {{resection}} {{of the small}} intestine. St Thos. Hosp. Rep. 1884, 13, 181.|$|E
5000|$|He was an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, a Fellow of the Society of Apothecaries, {{surgeon to}} the 1st {{battalion}} of the Shropshire Rifle Volunteers, and in actual {{practice as a}} surgeon. He authored Observations in Surgery and Pathology and in 1834 was awarded the Fothergillian Gold Medal of the Medical Society of London. [...] In writing An Account of Two Cases of Intestinal Obstruction, in which the operation {{for the formation of}} an <b>artificial</b> <b>anus</b> was performed; one in the ascending, the other in the descending colon he claimed to have been the first surgeon in Great Britain who successfully opened the ascending colon for intestinal obstruction.|$|E
50|$|He {{visited the}} Hôtel-Dieu morning and evening, {{performing}} at each time several operations, lectured to vast throngs of students, gave advice to his outpatients, and fulfilled the duties consequent upon {{one of the}} largest practices of modern times. By his indefatigable activity he amassed a fortune, the bulk of which he bequeathed to his daughter, with the deduction of considerable sums for the endowment of the anatomical chair in the École de Médecine, and the establishment of a benevolent institution for distressed physicians. The most important of Dupuytren's writings is his Treatise on <b>Artificial</b> <b>Anus,</b> in which he applied the principles laid down by John Hunter. In his operations he was remarkable for his skill and dexterity, and for his great readiness of resource.|$|E

40|$|A 78 -year-old man visited our {{department}} for macroscopic hematuria in June, 1989. On {{the basis of}} the diagnosis of tumor of the bladder and right afunctional kidney, total right nephro-uretero-cystectomy and skin grafting of the left ureter were performed on August 2. The patient continued to have fever of unknown origin postoperatively. Repeat laparotomy, which was performed for rectal fistula on August 25, revealed that the abdominal wall, colon, small intestine and mesenterium adhered to one another, producing a mass and that two sites in the rectum were perforated. A part of the small intestine was excised, the perforated sites were sutured, and an <b>artificial</b> <b>anus</b> was created at the transverse colon. Since the patient had intermittent fever and continued to complain of abdominal pain after creation of the <b>artificial</b> <b>anus,</b> nosotropic therapy was continued. However, the patient died from cardiac insufficiency on October 10. Erosion and ulcer were histologically observed over a wide range in the excised small intestine. In addition there was a defect in one area of the small intestine, penetrating the tunca muscularis propria, in which many cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusion bodies were observed. CMV inclusion bodies were also detected in the bladder with re-examination of specimens from the excised bladder. From these findings, it appears that endogenetic CMV may have been reactivated in the present case...|$|E
40|$|Psychic {{preparation}} of the patient for the necessity of colostomy is a long first step toward his adjustment to living with an <b>artificial</b> <b>anus.</b> Proper surgical placement of the outlet will ease care of the bowel. Control of fecal consistency and peristaltic rate should ideally produce constipation responsive only to habit or enemata. The object of the enema is to produce an evacuation thorough enough to prevent soiling {{for a day or}} two. The object of dietary variations is to produce a manageable volume and consistency of fecal stream. The technique of enemas and choice of diet can be individualized when the underlying principles are understood...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a 75 -year-old man with undifferentiated prostate cancer that {{was treated with}} radiation therapy. He presented at a nearby general hospital with dysuria and pain upon micturition. He was diagnosed with undifferentiated prostate cancer by a needle biopsy and referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. Enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance images showed prostate cancer and right obturator lymph node metastasis measuring 2. 5 cm. Cystoscopy and colonoscopy revealed direct invasion of the urinary bladder and rectum. We constructed a vesical fistula and an <b>artificial</b> <b>anus,</b> and then treated the primary tumor and lymph node metastasis with radiation. Undifferentiated prostate cancer is extremely rare and to our knowledge only a few cases have been reported. We suggest that radiation might be effective for treating undifferentiated prostate cancer with or without local invasion and/or metastasis along with total body control...|$|E
40|$|The {{patient was}} a 12 -year-old male with Down's syndrome, who {{underwent}} an <b>artificial</b> <b>anus</b> procedure on the 2 nd day of life because of atresia ani, and a radical operation for atresia ani {{at the age}} of 2 years. Frequent vomiting was often noted from immediately after birth and became severe from about the age of 10. Esophagogram and esophagoscopy revealed a marked stenosis extending from the midportion of the thoracic esophagus to its distal portion, and congenital esophageal stenosis was diagnosed. Since the stenosis was both long and severe, dilatation with a bougie was judged to be impossible and resection of the stenotic portion was performed. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed that the cause of the stenosis was musculofibrotic thickening. Congenital esophageal stenosis due to musculofibrotic thickening is frequently associated with other congenital anomalies, but association with both Down's syndrome and atresia ani has not previously been reported in Japan. Concerning the treatment of mild stenosis, dilatation with a bougie or incision of the extramucosal muscles is indicated, but for severe stenosis (as in our case) resection of the stenotic portion is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} sarcoma botryoides of the bladder in {{children}} have been reported. In the first case, one year and a month old boy, {{the construction of an}} <b>artificial</b> <b>anus</b> and the bilateral ureterocutaneostomies were made at the first stage of operation because of poor general condition probably due to disturbance of urination, urinary infection and renal insufficiency. He died of ileus twenty-one days after the operation. In the second case, four years and a month old boy, the to t al cystectomy with bilateral ureterocutaneostomies were performed, and he left the hospital eight monthes after the operation with good recovery. He is still healthy without any sign of the recurrance or metastasis of the tumor. Review of Japane s e literatures on the sarcoma botryoides of the bladder was done, and these cases reported here were found to be the 20 th and 21 st case in Japan. Sarcoma botryoides is a mesodermal mixed tumor in the submucous t issue, and the characteristic histological findings of this tumor are the followings : (1) the main histological change is the fibromyxoma mixed with the tissue of the hemangioma and/or the rhabdomyoma etc., (2) atypical sarcomatous cell infiltration is found in some part of the tumor. It is very important for the treatment of this disease that radical total resection of the tumor should be performed as early as possible...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Despite {{improved}} surgical {{techniques and}} optimized perioperative regimes, anastomotic leakage {{is still a}} serious complication in colorectal surgery, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. This prospective study was initiated to test a hypothesis, that preexisting disorders in the metabolism of collagen in the extracellular matrix (ECM) {{may be one of}} the factors promoting the onset of anastomotic wound healing complications. Moreover clinical variables were registered. Material and Methods: In this prospective study 119 patients were included, on whom anastomoses were performed with participation of the colon or rectum. On the one hand 30 clinical parameters with possible influence on anastomotic complications were evaluated on the other hand samples of macroscopically intact colonic tissue were obtained at the index operation. With theses samples we performed crosspolarisation microscopy for the analysis of collagen type I/III ratio and immunohistochemical studies to determine the expression of matrix matalloproteinases 1, 2, 9 and 13. A semiquantative score was used, with whom the two layers mucosa and submucosa were analysed separately. The patients with uncomplicated postoperative healing were compared to those developing anastomotic leakage in the further course. First of all a univariate analysis was performed as well for the clinical parameters as for the histological facts. In addition we performed a multivariat analysis for each of the histological parameters. Results: Patients with impaired anastomotic healing showed a significantly lowered collagen type I/III ratio compared to the controls. Moreover a significant higher expression of MMP- 1 and MMP- 2 in the mucosal and of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 in the submucosal layers was found in the normal bowel wall of the leakage group. These findings were statistically independent from the clinical parameters, which was shown in a logistic regression. Discussion: On the one hand this study confirms in many points the results of other studies as to clinical risk factors anastomotic healing. In this study perioperativ blood transfusions are linked to a higher rate of anastomotic leakages. Besides a significant higher rate of anastomotic leakages is found in patients who had already undergone operations of the intestine. On the other hand the present study confirms the tested hypothesis, that disturbances of the metabolism of collagen in the ECM play a role in the pathogenesis of anastomotic leakage after large bowel surgery. A clinical use of these results could be a peroperative classification, because of which one would chose an other procedure in the riskgroup, for example an operation with creation of an <b>artificial</b> <b>anus...</b>|$|E
