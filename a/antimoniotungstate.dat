40|$|Human T-lymphotropic virus type III is {{susceptible}} to attack at various sites during its replicative cycle. Inhibitors of reverse transcriptase activity, including suramin, <b>antimoniotungstate</b> (HPA- 23), and trisodium phosphonoformate, have shown in-vitro activity against the virus in early clinical trials. Other significant antiviral agents are recombinant interferon alpha-A, ribavirin, and ansamycin. Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of interferon alpha, which inhibits viral replication at easily achievable serum levels, are underway. The development of optimal therapeutic regimens will require carefully controlled, multicenter collaborative trials with standardized criteria for evaluating responses. Prolonged treatment with combinations of antiviral and immunomodulating agents may be necessary for contro...|$|E
40|$|The current {{epidemic}} of {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS) poses {{a major threat to}} our population. Urgently needed are both a vaccine to prevent infection with the etiologic retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and safe, effective an-tiviral agents to treat those individuals already infected. The elucidation of viral replica-tive mechanisms has allowed the development and testing of several agents active against HIV in vitro. Inhibitors of reverse transcriptase that have demonstrated activity include azidothymidine, phosphonoformate, <b>antimoniotungstate</b> (HPA- 23), and suramin. Ribavirin and recombinant interferon alpha-A (IFN-a-A) also inhibit HIV replication, although their mechanisms of action are less clear. All of these compounds are undergoing early clinical trials in patients with HIV infection. The identification of immunogenic viral proteins may allow the development of one or more subunit vaccines against HIV. Studies are underway to clone appropriate viral genes and incorporate the expressed proteins into vectors for administration. Laboratory models, e. g., chimpanzees, will be inoculated with candidate vaccines and, if successful, this will be followed by clinical trials for safety and efficacy in appropriate human populations seronegative for HIV. Although importan...|$|E
