By suddenly reducing the pressure in the device, the liquid could be placed into a temporary superheated state, which would boil along the disturbed track of a particle passing through. Glaser was able to maintain the superheated state {{for a few seconds}} before spontaneous boiling took place. The Alvarez team built chambers of 1.5in, 2.5in, 4in, 10in, and 15in using liquid hydrogen, and constructed of metal with glass windows, so that the tracks could be photographed.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} an accelerator-based Be(p,n) neutron {{source for the}} boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) which can be {{installed}} near a hospital and can treat a deeply placed tumour. With higher proton energy, <b>accelerator</b> <b>beam</b> power becomes lower because efficiency for generating neutrons per proton increases. However, the generation efficiency for epithermal neutrons may decrease because {{the energy of the}} generated neutrons becomes higher. We have, therefore, calculated the proton energy dependence of the required <b>accelerator</b> <b>beam</b> power and the epithermal neutron generation efficiencies for several proton energies from 8 to 30 MeV. We found that the required beam power of the accelerator for the proton energy of 30 MeV is one third of that of 8 MeV and that the epithermal neutron generation efficiency at 8 MeV is twice as that at 30 MeV...|$|E
