40|$|Remarkable {{experimental}} {{advances in}} quantum computing are exemplified by recent announcements of impressive <b>average</b> <b>gate</b> fidelities exceeding 99. 9 % for single-qubit gates and 99 % for two-qubit gates. Although these high numbers engender optimism that fault-tolerant quantum computing is within reach, {{the connection of}} <b>average</b> <b>gate</b> fidelity with fault-tolerance requirements is not direct. Here we use reported <b>average</b> <b>gate</b> fidelity to determine an upper bound on the quantum-gate error rate, which is the appropriate metric for assessing progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computation, and we demonstrate that this bound is asymptotically tight for general noise. Although this bound {{is unlikely to be}} saturated by experimental noise, we demonstrate using explicit examples that the bound indicates a realistic deviation between the true error rate and the reported average fidelity. We introduce the Pauli distance as a measure of this deviation, and we show that knowledge of the Pauli distance enables tighter estimates of the error rate of quantum gates. 13 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Rigorously {{establishing}} {{that the}} error in an experimental quantum operation is beneath the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation currently requires considering the worst-case error, {{which can be}} orders of magnitude smaller than the <b>average</b> <b>gate</b> infidelities routinely reported in experiments. We show that an improved bound on the worst-case error {{can be obtained by}} also considering the recently-introduced unitarity of the noise where the upper and lower bounds differ by a factor of ≈ 2. 45 for unital qubit channels. We prove that the contribution from the nonunital part of any noise map is at most on the order of the <b>average</b> <b>gate</b> infidelity and so is negligible relative to any coherent contribution. We also show that the "average" error rate when measurements are not restricted to an eigenbasis containing the state of the system exhibits the same scaling as the worst-case error, which, for coherent noise, is the square-root of the infidelity. We also obtain improved bounds for the diamond distance when the noise map is known (or approximately known). Comment: 12 pages, comments welcome.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{technology}} {{moving into the}} deep sub- 100 -nm region, the increase of leakage power consumption necessitates more aggressive power reduction techniques. <b>Power</b> <b>gating</b> is a promising technique. Our research emphasizes that with the latest and future technologies, <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> operates frequently in its transition mode, especially for aggressive leakage reduction. The dynamic characteristics of <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> during its mode transition is critical for making design decision. Hence we derive a fast, accurate, and temperature-aware model to characterize the dynamic behavior of <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> during mode transition. The applications of this model include the estimation of several key design parameters for <b>power</b> <b>gating,</b> such as dynamic virtual ground voltage, dynamic leakage variation and energy break-even time. It provides an efficient estimation engine for <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> design optimization. The accuracy of the model has been verified by extensive HSPICE experiments. The model is computationally efficient due to the usage of various approximation methods.

40|$|Abstract—In mobile systems, the {{problems}} of short battery life and increased temperature are exacerbated by wasted leakage power. Leakage power waste can be reduced by power-gating a core while it is stalled waiting for a resource. In this work, we propose and model memory access <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> (MAPG), a low-overhead technique to enable <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> of an active core when it stalls during a long memory access. We describe a programmable two-stage <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> switch design that can vary a core’s wake-up delay while maintaining voltage noise limits and leakage power savings. We also model the processor power distribution network {{and the effect of}} memory access <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> on neighboring cores. Last, we apply our <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> technique to actual benchmarks, and examine energy savings and overheads from <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> stalled cores during long memory accesses. Our analyses show the potential for over 38 % energy savings given “perfect ” <b>power</b> <b>gating</b> on memory accesses; we achieve energy savings exceeding 20 % for a practical, counter-based implementation.
