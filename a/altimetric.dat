5000|$|Prior to {{improved}} satellite imagery from the Magellan spacecraft mapping mission to Venus in 1994, the topography of Venus was interpreted from lower quality images received from radio telescopes and <b>altimetric</b> data. This data {{allowed for a}} misinterpretation of the crater; however, {{it is important to}} understand what was seen geometrically to explain why certain hypotheses withstood many years. It was found that the topographic elevation on Maxwell Montes resulted from a combination of horizontal compression and vertical crustal thickening, which in combination allowed for the lower crust to be partially melted, so long as the crustal thickness exceeds 40 km. [...] Significant crustal thickening occurs in terrestrial orogenic belts either through obduction or isostatic subsidence as the mountain grows in height. Based on the model and the information pertinent to understanding the tectonic environment surrounding the patera, crustal anatexis is a viable model for the origin of magmatism at Cleopatra Patera. This process could be associated with other high mountain belts on Venus and with melting of pre-existing rock in the Himalayan granites. This results in the melting of the lower levels of the thickened crust and potential magmatic activity, volcanism, and caldera formation at the surface.|$|E
50|$|The LIDAR system {{consisted}} of a 180 mJ, 1064 nm wavelength Nd-YAG (Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet) laser transmitter which transmitted pulses to the lunar surface. The laser produced a pulse with a width less than 10 ns. At 1064 nm wavelength, the pulse had an energy of 171 mJ with a divergence less than 500 microrad. At 532 nm, it had a 9 mJ pulse with a 4 millirad divergence. The reflected pulse travelled through the High-Resolution Camera telescope, where it was split off by a dichroic filter to a silicon avalanche photodiode detector. The detector was a single 0.5 &times; 0.5 mm cell SiAPD receiver with a field of view of 0.057 square degrees. The laser had a mass of 1250 g, the receiver was housed in the 1120 g HIRES camera. The travel time of a pulse gave the range to the surface. The LIDAR memory could save up to six return detections per laser firing, with a threshold set for the best compromise between missed detections and false alarms. The returns were stored in 39.972 m range bins, equal to {{the resolution of the}} 14-bit clock counter. The LIDAR has a nominal range of 500 km, but <b>altimetric</b> data was gathered for altitudes up to 640 km, which allowed coverage from 60 degrees south to 60 degrees north {{by the end of the}} lunar phase of the mission. The vertical resolution is 40 m, and the horizontal spot resolution is about 100 m. The across track spacing of the measurements at the equator was about 40 km. One measurement was made each second over a 45-minute period during each orbit, giving an along track spacing of 1 - 2 km.|$|E

A modified orthogonal response analysis is used to derive the annual cycle while simultaneously removing the residual tides and other dynamical processes at the appropriate T/P alias periods. An evaluation of the M 2 and K 1 alias variations is carried out, suggesting notable tidal correction errors off Cape Cod and over Georges Bank. The along-track sea surface slopes, which represent surface geostrophic current components normal to the track, are estimated on selected T/P ascending and descending ground tracks. The annual <b>altimetric</b> sea level harmonic is compared with steric height anomalies and wind-driven setup. The comparison indicates that the <b>altimetric</b> sea surface elevation variability {{is dominated by the}} baroclinic (and associated barotropic) component and supplemented by the wind-driven and remotely forced components. <b>Altimetric</b> elevations agree favorably with tide-gauge data at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and well with those at St. John's, Newfoundland.

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been recently devoted {{to the analysis of}} coastal <b>altimetric</b> waveforms. When approaching the coast, <b>altimetric</b> waveforms are sometimes corrupted by peaks caused by high reflective areas inside the illuminated land surfaces or by the modification of the sea state close to the shoreline. This paper introduces a new parametric model for these peaky <b>altimetric</b> waveforms. This model assumes that the received <b>altimetric</b> waveform is the sum of a Brown echo and an asymmetric Gaussian peak. The asymmetric Gaussian peak is parameterized by a location, an amplitude, a width, and an asymmetry coefficient. A maximum-likelihood estimator is studied to estimate the Brown plus peak model parameters. The Cramér–Rao lower bounds of the model parameters are then derived providing minimum variances for any unbiased estimator, i. e., a reference in terms of estimation error. The performance of the proposed model and the resulting estimation strategy are evaluated via many simulations conducted on synthetic and real data. Results obtained in this paper show that the proposed model can be used to retrack efficiently standard oceanic Brown echoes as well as coastal echoes corrupted by symmetric or asymmetric Gaussian peaks. Thus, the Brown with Gaussian peak model is useful for analyzing <b>altimetric</b> easurements closer to the coast...|$|E
