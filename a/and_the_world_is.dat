5|$|Timmy {{wakes up}} in what looks like his bedroom; in reality he is still inside The Darkness, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> merely an {{illusion}} to him. Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The Darkness successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead Eliminator uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family away into The Darkness. Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military weapons at the Eliminator, but he absorbs the ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator. He surrounds the Earth with a steel casing, which transforms the M.E.R.F. agents into his henchmen. They plant explosives inside Earth and give the Destructinator a detonation remote.|$|E
5|$|Choosing {{to support}} a Reason {{will result in a}} {{different}} ending depending on who is chosen, but in each the world is reborn {{in the image of the}} chosen Reason after the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi to prove his resolve. Chiaki and Isamu die before the Demi-fiend begins and give him their blessing in spirit form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is until another Conception can happen. If the Demi-fiend fulfills Lucifer's request of collecting the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate weapon in the upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E
5|$|The Drakengard games {{take place}} in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the {{predominant}} species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals, which act to keep the world in balance: should the seals be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all the seals are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links their souls and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait (their voice, singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off negative emotions, but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene.|$|E

25|$|Components of {{the game}} world go through a {{leveling}} up process after each selection is made. Because previously engaged components {{of the game}} world remain on the screen, later button pushes will often allow new areas of the environment to interact with previous areas. These interactions may cause the environmental component to level up, level down, or remain the same. By keeping track of which buttons have which effects on {{the other parts of}} the game world, the player can home in on the good ending by maximizing the visual reward. Once all components have been maximized <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> fully developed, the player wins.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{surviving}} mythology centers on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings, such as humanity and the jötnar, beings who may be friends, lovers, foes or {{family members of the}} gods. The cosmos in Norse mythology consists of Nine Worlds that flank a central cosmological tree, Yggdrasil. Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings. Various forms of a creation myth are recounted, where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir, and the first two humans are Ask and Embla. These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of Ragnarök, when an immense battle occurs between the gods and their enemies, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> enveloped in flames, only to be reborn anew. There {{the surviving}} gods will meet, and the land will be fertile and green, and two humans will repopulate the world.|$|E

25|$|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is an action-adventure, stealth game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. The game features three main cities; Havana, Kingston, and Nassau, which reside under Spanish, British, and pirate influence, respectively. It also features 50 other individual locations to explore, including atolls, sea forts, Mayan ruins, sugar plantations, and underwater shipwrecks, with a 60/40 balance between land and naval exploration. It has a more open world feel, with missions {{similar to those found}} in Assassin's Creed, as well as fewer restrictions for the player. The world opens up sooner in the game, as opposed to Assassin's Creed III, which had very scripted missions and did not give players freedom to explore until the game was well into its first act. The player will encounter jungles, forts, ruins, and small villages <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> built to allow players much more freedom, such as allowing players to engage, board, and capture passing ships and swimming to nearby beaches in a seamless fashion. In addition, the hunting system has been retained from Assassin's Creed III, allowing the player to hunt on land, and fish in the water, with resources gathered used to upgrade equipment.|$|E
25|$|The James Bond {{films are}} also {{known to have}} plots {{surrounding}} nuclear weapons. Films like Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Octopussy (1983), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> Not Enough (1999) involve nuclear weapons. Some are based around their threatened use or theft, others in a showdown between the superpowers. The threat is prevented by Bond {{in the nick of}} time, although weapons are detonated in The Spy Who Loved Me when two Polaris missiles each destroy a stolen nuclear submarine out at sea, British and Russian respectively. However, these do not harm the world's population or land, killing only the villain's crews in each stolen submarine. In Goldfinger (1964) the titular antagonist (with assistance from Chinese and North Korean agents who want economic collapse in the West) attempts to irradiate the US's national gold reserves stored at Fort Knox with an atomic bomb in order to increase the value of his own stockpile. The villain in Octopussy (1983) was a power-mad renegade Soviet general opposed to disarmament talks with NATO, who hatches an elaborate plot to invade Western Europe after the clandestine placement and detonation of a nuclear weapon on a US Air Force base in West Germany. GoldenEye (1995) focuses on a nuclear satellite weapon that unleashes a powerful electromagnetic pulse attack upon whatever area it is detonated over, destroying anything with an electronic circuit.|$|E
500|$|These lines, {{described}} by West as [...] "the finest passage of poetry yet {{known from the}} Catalogue", might parallel Calchas' prophecy in Iliad 2, which presages the first nine fruitless years of the Trojan War via {{the image of a}} snake devouring nine sparrows. Here the [...] "hairless one," [...] a kenning for a snake, gives birth to {{what appears to be the}} first of three sets of triplets, and as the remains of the papyrus become more meager, the snake sloughs its skin, representing the regeneration that will come once the heroic age comes to an end <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> given over to mortals.|$|E

500|$|Journalist Ignacio Ramonet has {{cited the}} film as an early example of mass media {{manipulation}} of public opinion and the power that media conglomerates have on influencing the democratic process. Ramonet believes that this early example of a media mogul influencing politics is outdated and that [...] "today Citizen Kane would be a dwarf. He owned a few papers in one country. The forces that dominate today have integrated image with text and sound <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> their market.

500|$|It also {{incorporates}} a Queen-referencing chorus: [...] "I {{want you to}} rock me, yeah, I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care." [...] The track's lyricism regards a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a blatant double entendre for sexual intercourse. In the regard to its double entendre, Grigg noted, [...] "but at the same time, there's a vulnerability in it that's, like, so sweet for girls. It's a little self-deprecating. There's {{not a lot of}} overt machismo in the song". [...] "I approached it like high school," [...] said [...] Hollander: [...] "On the first record, they were freshmen, innocent and wide-eyed. Now it's sophomore year, there are parties and driver’s licenses, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> theirs for the taking. That's what I wanted to capture".|$|E
500|$|U.S. {{television}} networks devoted much air {{time to the}} search for Holloway, the investigation of her disappearance, and rumors surrounding the case. Greta Van Susteren, host of Fox News' On the Record, and Nancy Grace on her eponymous Headline News program were among the most prominent television personalities to devote time to the incident. Van Susteren's almost continuous coverage of the story caused On the Record to get its best ratings to date, while Grace's show became the cornerstone of the new [...] "Headline Prime" [...] block on Headline News, which ran two episodes (a live show and a repeat) every night during prime-time.

30|$|Two {{aspects of}} the {{correspondence}} between topographic maps <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> notable. First, <b>the</b> correspondence between elevation values <b>and</b> elevation in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> hard to grasp. Elevation relative to sea level is a challenging concept {{in the absence of}} a visible sea. Second, the correspondence between patterns of contour lines on <b>the</b> map <b>and</b> surfaces in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> difficult to grasp because there are no visible feature boundaries in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> that align to single contours on a topographic map (e.g., a line that shows where a hill starts or stops). Rather, the shape of three-dimensional structures can be inferred from <b>the</b> relative shape <b>and</b> location of <b>the</b> contour lines (e.g., closely spaced contours represent steep slopes, and widely spaced contours represent shallow slopes).|$|R
25|$|In various {{contexts}} of the epic, several contemporary social issues relevant to India <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> raised. <b>The</b> issues are {{brought up in}} soliloquies by or dialogues between {{the characters in the}} epic.

500|$|The {{dictator}} novel {{came back}} into fashion in the 1970s, {{towards the end of}} the Boom. As Sharon Keefe Ugalde remarks, [...] "the 1970s mark a new stage in the evolution of the Latin American dictator novel, characterized by at least two developments: a change in the perspective from which the dictator is viewed and a new focus on the nature of language." [...] By this she means that the dictator novels of the 1970s, such as The Autumn of the Patriarch or I, the Supreme, offer the reader a more intimate view of their subject: [...] "the dictator becomes protagonist" [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> often seen from his point of view. With the new focus on language, Keefe Ugalde points to the realisation on the part of many authors that [...] "the tyrant's power is derived from and defeated by language." [...] For example, in Jorge Zalamea's El Gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto the dictator bans all forms of language.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer's Body is the {{follow-up}} to writer and producer Diablo Cody's and Jason Reitman's collaboration efforts on Juno. In October 2007, Fox Atomic pre-emptively purchased {{the rights to}} Cody's script with Megan Fox to star. Peter Rice, {{who at the time}} oversaw Fox Searchlight and Fox Atomic, brought in the project as Fox Searchlight had previously distributed Cody's film Juno. Mason Novick and Reitman's producing partner Dan Dubiecki signed as producers in November 2007 with plans to produce the film under Hard C, which is housed at Fox Searchlight. Reitman commented, [...] "We want to make unusual films, and anything that turns a genre on its ear interests Dan and I." [...] Karyn Kusama was announced as director in January 2008. Kusama said she signed on to the project because of the script. [...] "I was blessed to read this script at a moment where the producers were meeting with directors and it just knocked me out. It was just so original, so imaginative", she stated. [...] "That's what it is about this script <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> that it feels like a fairy tale gone psycho and I think that's what most fairy tales actually started as." [...] Additionally, Cody, Reitman and Kusama knew the film would be R rated because of the language.|$|E
