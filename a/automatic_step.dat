40|$|Modern {{numerical}} methods allowing {{to solve}} contrast structure {{problems in the}} most efficient way are described. These methods include explicit-implicit Rosenbrock schemes with complex coefficients and fully implicit backward optimal Runge–Kutta schemes. As an integration argument, it is recommended to choose the length of the integral curve arc. This argument provides high reliability of the calculation and sufficiently decreases the complexity of computations for low-order systems. In order to increase the efficiency, we propose an <b>automatic</b> <b>step</b> selection algorithm based on curvature of the integral curve. This algorithm is as efficient as standard algorithms and has sufficiently larger reliability. We show that along with such an <b>automatic</b> <b>step</b> selection it is possible to calculate a posteriori asymptotically precise error estimation. Standard algorithms do not provide such estimations and their actual error quite often exceeds the user-defined tolerance by several orders. The applicability limitations of numerical methods are investigated. In solving superstiff problems, they sometimes do not provide satisfactory results. In such cases, it is recommended to imply approximate analytical methods. Consequently, numerical and analytical methods are complementary...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{entity-relationship}} model {{is considered to}} be the standard for conceptual design of data in information systems and relational databases. Extended {{entity-relationship model}}s provide extra concepts such as generalization, dependency and classification. In the context of objectoriented software development, such models are able to represent part of the functionality whereas more operational functionality is implemented in the object-oriented language. In the resulting object-oriented program, however, the original data model is often lost and the relationship and dependency constraints are not enforced. We propose an approach which consists of an active modeling phase and an interactive prototyping phase. The overall result is a model in which the elements have active links to fully operational implementation objects, which in turn are actively constrained by the model. We have developed a system that supports the manual steps in these two phases and fully implements the (semi-) <b>automatic</b> <b>steps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hierarchical {{clustering}} algorithms {{are typically}} {{more effective in}} detecting the true clustering structure of a data set than partitioning algorithms. However, hierarchical clustering algorithms do not actually create clusters, but compute only a hierarchical representation of the data set. This makes them unsuitable as an <b>automatic</b> pre-processing <b>step</b> for other algorithms that operate on detected clusters. This is true for both dendrograms and reachability plots, which have been proposed as hierarchical clustering representations, and which have different advantages and disadvantages. In this paper we first investigate the relation between dendrograms and reachability plots and introduce methods to convert them into each other showing that they essentially contain the same information. Based on reachability plots, we then introduce a technique that automatically determines the significant clusters in a hierarchical cluster representation. This makes {{it for the first}} time possible to use hierarchical clustering as an <b>automatic</b> pre-processing <b>step</b> that requires no user interaction to select clusters from a hierarchical cluster representation...|$|R
40|$|Clustering is {{the task}} of categorizing objects into {{different}} classes in an unsupervised way. Hierarchical clustering algorithms are usually very effective in detecting the dataset underlying structure. However, they do not create clusters, but compute only a hierarchical representation of the dataset. It is then desirable to make them a suitable automatic pre-processing step for the algorithms operating on the selected clusters. To this purpose, {{in this paper we}} present an algorithm that finds the best clustering partition according to clustering validity indexes. In particular, our automatic approach performs a validity index-driven search through a clustering tree. The best partition is then selected cutting the tree in a non-horizontal way. The algorithm was implemented in a software tool and then tested on different datasets.
