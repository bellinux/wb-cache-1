30|$|Among {{employed}} immigrant women, {{the monthly}} wage upon arrival was 30 % lower {{than for the}} local women, irrespective {{of the time of}} <b>arrival.</b> <b>Note</b> that for women immigrating during 1990 s there is no significant gap in hourly wage, which apparently means that immigrant women who managed to find a job got the same hourly wage rate but worked fewer hours than local women. There is evidence of assimilation both in terms of employment and wage that is revealed in the positive coefficients on years-since-migration variable. However, the assimilation is quite slow: it would take 14 – 17 years for an average immigrant woman to reach the level of employment and wage that local women have. For the female internal migrants there are strong negative unemployment effects irrespective of the time of migration, with slow assimilation over time. At the same time, there are no significant wage gaps with local women.|$|E

For example, in one radar system, pulses of electromagnetic radiation are sent {{out by the}} vehicle (interrogating pulses) and trigger a response from a responder beacon. The time interval between the sending and the receiving of a pulse is monitored and used to determine a distance. In the global positioning system a code of ones and zeros is emitted at a known time from multiple satellites, and their times of <b>arrival</b> are <b>noted</b> at a receiver along with {{the time they were}} sent (encoded in the messages).

Money for this purpose was raised in Jewish communities around the world for distribution among the various kollelim that were correspondingly established (by country or community of origin) in the Old Yishuv, especially in Jerusalem. From the thirteenth through the turn-of-the 20th century, Jewish communities living in the Old Yishuv dispatched travelling emissaries (shlihim or Meshullahim) to raise money in the diaspora for sustenance.

2500|$|Clayton {{played for}} Lancashire's second eleven in 1956 and 1957, but made his {{first-class}} cricket {{debut in the}} 1957 for the Combined Services cricket team while on National Service.

In his first innings for the county side, he top-scored with 43. In his third County Championship match, against Middlesex at Liverpool, he scored an unbeaten 74. The batting was a bonus: Lancashire's previous first-choice wicketkeeper, Alan Wilson, had a career batting average of less than six runs per innings. But Clayton in his first full season averaged more than 24, and though he did not sustain this, and the 74* remained his highest score until 1963, he batted for most of his career at No 7 or No 8.

The significant difference is noted regarding the type of used accommodation, where an absolute domination of hostels is noted. Several figures indicate the transit character of the visit and the general satisfaction with the stay in Belgrade. In average, this tourist segment accounts for larger number of overnight stays than Belgrade's overall average of overnight stays.
