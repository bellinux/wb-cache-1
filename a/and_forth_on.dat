5|$|At {{this point}} in the campaign, the Austrian command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack's command style and decisions, {{charging}} that the latter spent his days writing contradictory orders that left the Austrian army marching back <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> <b>On</b> 13 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery. Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. Ney led Loison's division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube to begin the attack. Malher's division crossed the river farther east and moved west toward Riesch's position. The field was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view. The French cleared the Austrian pickets from a bridge, then a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey {{at the top of the}} hill at bayonet point. During the Battle of Elchingen, the Austrian cavalry was also defeated and Reisch's infantry fled toward Ulm. Ney was given the title Duke of Elchingen for his impressive victory.|$|E

Also, Hester was invited to throw the ceremonial opening pitch and sing Take Me Out to the Ball Game at the Chicago Cubs' 2007 home opener. Along with teammates Rex Grossman and Tommie Harris, Hester appeared on the February 2007 issue of Sports Illustrated for Kids. His reputation {{has also been}} bolstered by EA Sports' Madden NFL 08, where Hester's perfect 100 speed rating made him the fastest player in the game's history. Hester also appeared in a promotional video for the game. He appeared in commercials for Under Armour in 2008 and 2009. In 2013, Hester outran a cheetah in a race sponsored by National Geographic at Busch Gardens Tampa. The competition consisted of Hester running back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> a straight track to simulate laps, while the cheetah ran in a similar but separate track.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, the Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini cast Callas in {{her only}} non-operatic acting role, as the Greek mythological {{character}} of Medea, in his film by that name.

The film was not a commercial success, but as Callas's only film appearance, it documents her stage presence.|$|E
25|$|Power factor {{correction}} brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act {{to cancel the}} inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power {{to meet the demand}} of the inductive loads. This will keep that reactive power from having to flow {{all the way from the}} utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy moving back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> each AC cycle.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Technics {{started making}} their SL-1200 {{turntable}}, {{which became the}} most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque direct drive design. The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable direct drive enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. Hip hop DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with turntablism techniques such as scratching and beat juggling rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by DJ Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Afrika Bambaataa, as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> the platter. Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.|$|E

25|$|Moonlighting {{was unusual}} {{at the time}} for being {{one of only three}} shows, due to FCC regulations, to be owned and {{produced}} in-house by a broadcast network (NBC’s Punky Brewster and CBS’s Twilight Zone revival being the others). This allowed the network greater flexibility in budgeting the show since the “back-end potential” for profits was so much greater with not having to pay a licensing fee to the film studio or independent production company. As a result, ABC gave Caron a lot of control over production. Caron, however, was a perfectionist and viewed Moonlighting as the filming of a one-hour movie every week, using techniques usually reserved for big budget films. To capture the cinematic feel of the films of the 1940s, for example, he would prohibit the use of a zoom lens, opting instead to use more time-consuming moving master cameras that move back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> a track and require constant resetting of the lights. Diffusion disks were used to soften Cybill Shepherd’s features, and a special lens needed to be employed so that in a two shot, Maddie would be diffused and David would not.|$|E
500|$|The first trailer for {{the game}} made its début at the Namco Bandai Global Gamer Day in Las Vegas in April 2012 and showed {{gameplay}} footage in 3D. In order to promote the new video game in 2013, a trailer was produced which featured William Shatner and {{a man in a}} Gorn suit playing it on a console. The idea had come from an idea by Brian Miller and Gene Augusto, who initially went back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> the idea in an attempt to create something that would go viral. They joked about using the line [...] "not your father's Star Trek", and sought to recreate the fight between Shatner and the Gorn from the episode [...] "Arena".|$|E

"Great Big World" [...] was sung by Anne Hathaway and {{replaced}} another song called [...] "Woods Go-Round", which Edwards considered too childish and {{described as being}} [...] "in the vein of Saturday morning cartoons." [...] This change required the scene to be re-animated and re-cut. [...] "Be Prepared" [...] was sung by Benjy Gaither and developed out of a practicality; the filmmakers wanted to introduce Japeth while the character is rocking back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> his horns, as though the horns are a rocking chair. However, they realized that this would make the horns too big to fit in a minecart {{later on in the}} film. As a solution, they came up with the gag of having the character switch his horns several times, and this led to the song's concept.|$|E

To provide for quick turnaround of the shuttle trains, there is an operator {{at each end of the}} train. Depending on which direction the train is traveling the operators swap jobs when the train gets to one end; one acts as the operator in the front and the other acts as conductor in the rear. Trains run every 2 to 4 minutes during rush hours, 5 minutes during the midday, and 10 minutes on evenings and weekends.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{completion}} of Jaws in 1975, Fields was hired by Universal Studios as an executive consultant. Some insight into Universal's reasons for hiring her can be gleaned from the fact that during the filming of Jaws, in addition to her editing, Fields had been [...] "omnipresent...at Spielberg's beck and call by means of a walkie-talkie. Often she would shuttle back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> her bike between the producers in town and Spielberg at the dock for last-minute decisions". The producers of Jaws were David Brown and Richard Zanuck. Along with Brown, Zanuck, and Peter Benchley (the book's author), Fields helped promote Jaws on the [...] "talk show circuit" [...] in the eight months before its saturation release to 464 theaters on 20 June 1975. Fields had plainly earned the confidence of the producers and of the studio executives at Universal.|$|E

I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars {{could be seen in}} the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} pre-booked {{stops on the}} tour {{suffered}} from lack of attendance. Cochran was very bitter about it. NEA sports editor, Harry Grayson indicated that the game was in general decline, and said that Cochran [...] "traces the decline of championship and exhibition billiards to manufacturers taking the stars off the payroll during the depression." [...] In a previous exhibition tour by Cochran and Hoppe in 1945, they had sold out in 13 cities. Despite some lackluster stops, upon her return to California, Katsura continued to play exhibition matches with the game's greats. Katsura and Kilgore put on a week-long exhibition in San Francisco in January 1953, where they seesawed back <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> <b>On</b> January 12, Katsura beat Kilgore in their first match with runs of seven and ten, but lost to him in their second.

500|$|For Victor, Entity FX {{tried to}} create digital imagery of the character's inner {{workings}} to give the audience {{the chance to see}} how his robotic side operates. For instance, Entity FX visually walked the audience through the process of how Victor's CPU downloads the schematics and diagrams to Lex's Level 33.1 facility, as well as disarming the security. Creating abilities for Arthur posed their own challenges, as there were not a lot of opportunities to put the character in the water {{when he was in the}} Mid-West. Using the technology they had when Arthur first came to Smallville, as well as the effects used in the unaired pilot for Aquaman, Entity FX was able to digitally create both Arthur and the water he swims in for the character's arrival shot at Level 33.1. When creating Arthur's super swimming speed, the team attempted to give the imagery a look similar to that of a torpedo gliding through the water. The team battled back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>on</b> how to illustrate Arthur's movements, deciding between having the character leave a trail of bubbles like a torpedo, or [...] "maneuvering around the water and...actually traveling with the bubbles".|$|E
