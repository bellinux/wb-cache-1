40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the perceived discomfort and user preferences associated with the wearing of earplugs. Fifty subjects were tested under five different type 8 of earplugs. Subject responses to a series of 7 -interval, bi-polar scales and rankings were obtained. The bi-polar scales were reduced to a a single-number rating, or Comfort Index (CI). Nonparametric analysis of the CI indicated that pre-formed, plastic earplugs were perceived as causing more discomfort than user-molded earplugs. Nonparametric analyses differences among earplug designs insertion, and preferences. I NTRODUCT I ON Hearing protection devices (HPDs), especially earplugs, are a widely-used method of reducing the harmful effects of noise exposure. Unfortunate 1 y, workers who must use earplugs sometimes complain of discomfort, caused by the stretching of the ear canal or the hardness of the earplug material (Berger, 1982). Industrial hearing <b>audiometrists,</b> OSHA inspectors, and industrial nurses) typically identify general discomfort as a major problem associated with earplugs (Royster and Holder, 1981). Quite simply, if earplugs cause discomfort, workers may wear them incorrectly or not at all, thereby eliminating o r reducing the potential protective benefit. Even though the earplug discomfort issue is prominent, very little research has been aimed at evaluating discomfort associated with earplugs or other types of HPDs (Flugrath and Tuberville, 1972; Damongeot, et al, 1981). Virtually no research has addressed the possible association between earplug besian and discomfort. conservation professionals (e. s., Research Pbiective The main research objective was to evaluate five different industrial earplug designs based on subjective, user-reported discomfort.

5000|$|The word [...] "Audiometrist" [...] {{is derived}} from the word Audiometry, as {{distinct}} from Audiology. However, the title <b>audiometrist</b> is often used interchangeably with the role of audiologists, thereby making a precise definition of the word more difficult. Audiologists can therefore refer to themselves as audiometrists, although they still perform the tasks of audiologists. The origin of this cross-attribution is unclear, but may stem from the fact that many audiometrists also receive subsequent training in audiology, thereby making them both audiometrists and audiologists. Additionally, preferences for definitions of audiometrists are more varied worldwide, mainly because Audiometry education and licensing requirements vary from country to country, and the use or mis-use of the word in this fashion continues worldwide. A further role confusion arises because many audiometrists are involved directly in the hearing aid industry in an assistive capacity when they get in-house training for hearing aid audiometry, while others apply audiometry purely to Occupational Health. [...] Since audiologists are more qualified, they can do the work of audiometrists, but not the other way round. This may often lead to the assumption that audiometrists are audiologists.|$|E

Methods: Fifty type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic patients aged 40 &ndash; 50 years and attending the Tabriz Medical University outpatient clinics were recruited for this study during 2009 &ndash; 2010. All ABR and OAE procedures were implemented by an <b>audiometrist.</b> The relationship between ABR and OAE findings and demographic, laboratory, and clinical characteristics was investigated. Results: Fifty patients (34 female and 16 male) of average age 45. 7 &plusmn; 3. 0 years were entered into the study. In the type 2 diabetic group, disordered ABR was found in at least one ear in 8 % of cases and disordered OAE was recorded in at least one ear in 16 % of cases, with no significant difference between the diabetic and nondiabetic groups. Mean age, duration of diabetes, serum HbA 1 c levels, and prevalence of female gender were higher in the diabetic group. Conclusion: According to our findings, the prevalence of ABR and OAE is not significantly different between type 2 diabetics and nondiabetics.

40|$|Manual {{pure tone}} {{audiometry}} {{is considered to}} be the gold standard for the assessment of hearing thresholds and has been in consistent use {{for a long period of}} time. An increased legislative requirement to monitor and screen workers, and an increasing amount of legislation relating to hearing loss is putting greater reliance on this as a tool. There are a number of questions regarding the degree of accuracy of pure tone audiometry when undertaken in field conditions, particularly relating to the difference in conditions between laboratory calibration and clinical or industrial screening use. This study analyzed the output sound pressure level of four different commercial audiometers, all using TDH 39 headphones and each of which had recently undergone calibration at an appropriate laboratory. Levels were measured using a Bruël and Kjaer Head and Torso simulator, which accurately replicates the size and shape of a human head, including the ears. A clinical environment was simulated by a trained <b>audiometrist</b> replacing the headphones for each test. Tests were undertaken at three presentation levels, and at the frequencies of 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz and 6 kHz. The results showed a high level of test-retest variability, both between different audiometers and within the same audiometer. Maximum variation of sound pressure level at the ear for the same tone presentation was 21 decibels, with a particularly high level of variation at 6 kHz for all meters. An audiometer with attenuating cups exhibited significantly higher variation than ones using supral-aural headphones. Overall the variation exhibited suggests that there is a higher degree of potential error with screening pure tone audiometry than is commonly assumed and that results particularly at the 6 kHz frequency need to be assessed carefully alongside other methods such as speech audiometry...|$|E
40|$|UNLABELLED: A 19 -year-old {{woman was}} {{diagnosed}} with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). She had sustained numerous low-trauma fractures throughout her childhood, including a recent pelvic fracture (superior and inferior ramus) following a low-impact fall. She had the classical blue sclerae, and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) bone scanning confirmed low bone mass for her age in the lumbar spine (Z-score was - 2. 6). However, despite these classical clinical features, the diagnosis of OI had not been entertained throughout the whole of her childhood. Sequencing of her genomic DNA revealed that she was heterozygous for the c. 3880 _ 3883 dup mutation in exon 50 of the COL 1 A 1 gene. This mutation is predicted {{to result in a}} frameshift at p. Thr 1295, and truncating stop codon 3 amino acids downstream. To our knowledge, this mutation has not previously been reported in OI. LEARNING POINTS: OI is a rare but important genetic metabolic bone and connective tissue disorder that manifests a diverse clinical phenotype that includes recurrent low-impact fractures. Most mutations that underlie OI occur within exon 50 of the COL 1 A 1 gene (coding for protein constituents of type 1 pro-collagen). The diagnosis of OI is easily missed in its mild form. Early diagnosis is important, and {{there is a need for}} improved awareness of OI among health care professionals. OI is a diagnosis of exclusion, although the key diagnostic criterion is through genetic testing for mutations within the COL 1 A 1 gene. Effective management of OI should be instituted through a multidisciplinary team approach that includes a bone specialist (usually an endocrinologist or rheumatologist), a geneticist, an <b>audiometrist</b> and a genetic counsellor. Physiotherapy and orthopaedic surgery may also be required...|$|E
