5|$|The {{intersection}} of 7th Street NW and H Street NW {{is the heart}} of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood today, but prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants. Before the American Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above. Lincoln conspirator Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses a Chinese restaurant), but it may also house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, occupants of the building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling <b>and</b> <b>whispers,</b> footsteps, muffled sobs, and creaking floorboards which have unnerved them.|$|E

Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more than anyone else in the universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot <b>and</b> <b>whispers</b> something in her ear, declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E

25|$|Ullmann {{began her}} acting {{career as a}} stage actress in Norway during the mid-1950s. She {{continued}} to act in theatre {{for most of her}} career, and became noted for her portrayal of Nora in Henrik Ibsen's play A Doll's House, but became better known once she started to work with Swedish movie director Ingmar Bergman. She later acted, with acclaim, in 10 of his movies, including Persona (1966), The Passion of Anna (1969), Cries <b>and</b> <b>Whispers</b> (1972) and Autumn Sonata (1978), in which her co-actress, Ingrid Bergman, resumed her Swedish cinema career.

Ullmann acted with Laurence Olivier in A Bridge Too Far (1977), directed by Richard Attenborough.|$|E
25|$|As {{time went}} by, Bradbury tended to dismiss {{censorship}} as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually {{claimed that the}} real messages of Fahrenheit 451 were {{about the dangers of}} an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451, I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds <b>and</b> <b>whispers</b> and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there.

Vincent takes the cue, his reverence obvious, <b>and</b> <b>whispers</b> [...] "A Balabushka..." [...] After this, Balabushka's name became associated {{by the general public}} with highly valued and rare cues. The cue actually used in the film was, however, not a genuine Balabushka, but a Joss Cues model J-18 (renamed the N-07), custom-made to look like a Balabushka. The filmmakers feared that any cue used might get damaged during filming; especially in light of a scene set in a pool room where Cruise's character rapidly whirls the cue around in time to the song Werewolves of London. An original Balabushka was thus considered too valuable to be risked in the production.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing {{the track}} for AOL Radio Blog, Voerding wrote [...] "Michele's voice {{is among the}} cast's most versatile, striding {{confidently}} through growls <b>and</b> <b>whispers,</b> proclamations and wavering cries.

[...] Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called Michele's voice on the song [...] "phenomenal," [...] and commented [...] "I love how her vocals are reined in, and then build up to that wonderful glory note. I seriously got chills while listening to it." [...] She also commented how the song's narrative fit Michele's storyline on the show.

[...] Jarret Wieselman of The New York Post said [...] "Lea Michele's voice was on point throughout this soaring ballad, but without that secret ingredient, lyrics like [...] "my best intentions keep making a mess of things" [...] are best left to Rachel's diary." [...] Although she called it [...] "boring" [...] and said it was like every other reflection-ballad performed by Michele, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone said that the song would fit in on Top 40 radio.
