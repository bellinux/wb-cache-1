5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the <b>atrioventricular</b> node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the <b>atrioventricular</b> septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the <b>atrioventricular</b> node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the <b>atrioventricular</b> valves, {{present in the}} <b>atrioventricular</b> septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E
5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} {{the bundle of}} His were {{discovered}} {{as early as the}} 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the <b>atrioventricular</b> node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by <b>atrioventricular</b> valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the <b>atrioventricular</b> septum which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|E
5|$|The valves {{between the}} atria and {{ventricle}}s {{are called the}} <b>atrioventricular</b> valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve has three cusps, which connect to chordae tendinae and three papillary muscles named the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, after their relative positions. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. It {{is also known as}} the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>atrioventricular</b> valves (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during {{blood flow}} to the ventricles, the aortic and {{pulmonary}} valves are closed to prevent backflow into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure is greater than the atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the aortic and pulmonary valves open. As the ventricles relax, the aortic and pulmonary valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E
5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath each of {{the three}} layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the <b>atrioventricular</b> groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} uses calcium {{to cause a}} depolarising signal {{transduction}} pathway from the atrium through right and left <b>atrioventricular</b> bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that {{are made up of}} thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and <b>atrioventricular</b> nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E
5|$|The heart pumps blood with {{a rhythm}} {{determined}} {{by a group of}} pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the <b>atrioventricular</b> node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.|$|E
25|$|The {{bundle of}} Kent is eponymously named for British {{physiologist}} Albert Frank Stanley Kent (18631958), who described lateral branches in the <b>atrioventricular</b> groove of the monkey heart (erroneously believing these constituted the normal <b>atrioventricular</b> conduction system).|$|E
25|$|In case of type A {{pre-excitation}} (left <b>atrioventricular</b> connections), {{a positive}} R wave {{is seen in}} V1 ("positive delta") on the precordial leads of the electrocardiogram, while in type B pre-excitation (right <b>atrioventricular</b> connections), a predominantly negative delta wave is seen in lead V1 ("negative delta").|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fourth}} week, two <b>atrioventricular</b> endocardial {{cushions}} appear. Initially the <b>atrioventricular</b> canal gives access to the primitive left ventricle, and is separated from arterial bulb by the edge of the ventricular bulb. In the fifth week, the posterior end terminates in the center part of the upper endocardial cushion. Because of this, blood can access both the left primitive ventricle and the right primitive ventricle. As the anterior and posterior pads project inwardly, they merge to form a right and left <b>atrioventricular</b> orifice.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{has several}} {{cardiovascular}} adverse effects, including {{risk of heart}} attacks, pulmonary hypertension, and changes in heart rhythm including syncope, bradycardia and <b>atrioventricular</b> block.|$|E
25|$|The <b>atrioventricular</b> node {{position}} {{differs from}} other fowl. It {{is located in}} the endocardium of the atrial surface of the right <b>atrioventricular</b> valve. It is not covered by connective tissue, which is characteristic of vertebrate heart anatomy. It also contains fewer myofibrils than usual myocardial cells. The AV node connects the atrial and ventricular chambers. It functions to carry the electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricle. Upon view, the myocardial cells are observed to have large densely packed chromosomes within the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Pacemaker {{syndrome}} {{is a disease}} that represents the clinical consequences of suboptimal <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) synchrony or AV dyssynchrony, regardless of the pacing mode, after pacemaker implantation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{contraindicated}} {{in individuals}} with sinus nodal bradycardia, <b>atrioventricular</b> block, and {{second or third}} degree heart block {{who do not have}} an artificial pacemaker.|$|E
25|$|SCN5A {{is mainly}} {{expressed}} in the heart, where expression is abundant in working myocardium and conduction tissue. In contrast, expression is low in the sinoatrial node and <b>atrioventricular</b> node.|$|E
25|$|CCB {{toxicity}} {{can cause}} a number of electrocardiogram abnormalities with a low sinus rhythm being the most common. Others include: QT prolongation, bundle branch block, first-degree <b>atrioventricular</b> block, and even sinus tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhibition}} of the sodium pump may also improve baroreceptor sensitivity in HF and may {{explain some of}} the neurohormonal effects of digoxin. Digoxin also has important parasympathetic effects, particularly on the <b>atrioventricular</b> node.|$|E
25|$|In cardiac uses, {{it works}} as a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholinergic antagonist, {{increasing}} firing of the sinoatrial node (SA) and conduction through the <b>atrioventricular</b> node (AV) of the heart, opposes {{the actions of the}} vagus nerve, blocks acetylcholine receptor sites, and decreases bronchial secretions.|$|E
25|$|A {{defect in}} the ostium primum is {{occasionally}} classified as an atrial septal defect, {{but it is more}} commonly classified as an <b>atrioventricular</b> septal defect. Ostium primum defects are less common than ostium secundum defects. This type of defect is usually associated with Down syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Heart valve {{dysplasia}} (including mitral and {{tricuspid valve}} dysplasia) is a congenital heart abnormality in dogs. Dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves - {{also known as}} the <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) valves - can appear as thickened, shortened, or notched valves. Chordae tendineae are also usually abnormal.|$|E
25|$|Sick sinus syndrome* is most {{commonly}} seen in female Miniature Schnauzers. It {{is characterized by}} sinoatrial node dysfunction and may include <b>atrioventricular</b> node disease and bundle branch block. Electrocardiogram findings include sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial heart block, and atrial tachycardia. The major clinical sign is fainting (syncope).|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{complication of}} dual-chamber artificial pacemakers is 'pacemaker-mediated tachycardia' (PMT), {{a form of}} reentrant tachycardia. In PMT, the artificial pacemaker forms the anterograde (atrium to ventricle) limb of the circuit and the <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) node forms the retrograde limb (ventricle to atrium) of the circuit. Treatment of PMT typically involves reprogramming the pacemaker.|$|E
25|$|Notch {{signaling}} can {{regulate the}} <b>atrioventricular</b> boundary formation between the AV canal and the chamber myocardium. Studies {{have revealed that}} both loss- and gain-of-function of the Notch pathway results in defects in AV canal development. In addition, the Notch target genes HEY1 and HEY2 are involved in restricting the expression of two critical developmental regulator proteins, BMP2 and Tbx2, to the AV canal.|$|E
25|$|Expression of QSER1 is seen {{at levels}} lower than 50% in many tissues. However, notable {{expression}} {{is seen in}} skeletal muscle, the appendix, trigeminal ganglia, cerebellum peduncles, pons, spinal cord, ciliary ganglion, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, dorsal root ganglion, fetal liver, adrenal gland, ovary, uterus corpus, cardiac myocytes, the <b>atrioventricular</b> node, skin, pituitary gland, tongue, early erythroid progenitors, and tonsil.|$|E
25|$|The vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that {{innervate}} {{the heart}} release acetylcholine (ACh) {{as their primary}} neurotransmitter. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors (M2) that are found principally on cells comprising the sinoatrial (SA) and <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) nodes. Muscarinic receptors are coupled to the Gi-protein; therefore, vagal activation decreases cAMP. Gi-protein activation also leads to the activation of KACh channels that increase potassium efflux and hyperpolarizes the cells.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac {{toxicity}} {{associated with}} overdose of intravascular injection of local anesthetic {{is characterized by}} hypotension, <b>atrioventricular</b> conduction delay, idioventricular rhythms, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. Although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period, bupivacaine avidly blocks the cardiac sodium channels, thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias. Even levobupivacaine and ropivacaine (single-enantiomer derivatives), developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects, still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|The diving reflex {{is used in}} {{clinical}} practice {{as a means to}} treat supraventricular tachycardia. This {{is an example of a}} vagal maneuver, whereby the vagus nerve is stimulated in order to block the <b>atrioventricular</b> node, which interrupts the abnormal electrical circuit taking place in a supraventricular tachycardia. This is especially useful in infants in whom the diving reflex is well-preserved, allowing the valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage to be more appropriate.|$|E
25|$|An esophogeal lead can be {{inserted}} to {{a part of}} the esophagus where the distance to the posterior wall of the left atrium is only approximately 5–6mm (remaining constant in people of different age and weight). An esophageal lead avails for a more accurate differentiation between certain cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial flutter, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and orthodromic <b>atrioventricular</b> reentrant tachycardia. It can also evaluate the risk in people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as well as terminate supraventricular tachycardia caused by re-entry.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{activity}} in the normal human heart begins when a cardiac action potential arises in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which {{is located in the}} right atrium. From there, the electrical stimulus is transmitted via internodal pathways to the <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) node. After a brief delay at the AV node, the stimulus travels through the bundle of His to the left and right bundle branches and then to the Purkinje fibers and the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular myocardium.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{electrical}} impulses of AF occur {{at a high}} rate, {{most of them do}} not result in a heart beat. A heart beat results when an electrical impulse from the atria passes through the <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) node to the ventricles and causes them to contract. During AF, if all of the impulses from the atria passed through the AV node, there would be severe ventricular tachycardia, resulting in a severe reduction of cardiac output. This dangerous situation is prevented by the AV node since its limited conduction velocity reduces the rate at which impulses reach the ventricles during AF.|$|E
25|$|Trazodone {{appears to}} be {{relatively}} safer than TCAs, MAOIs, {{and a few of}} the other second-generation antidepressants in overdose situations, especially when it is the only agent taken. Fatalities are rare, and uneventful recoveries have been reported after ingestion of doses as high as 6,000–9,200mg. In one report, 9 of 294 cases of overdose were fatal, and all nine patients had also taken other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. When trazodone overdoses occur, clinicians should carefully monitor for hypotension, a potentially serious toxic effect. In a report of a fatal trazodone overdose, torsades de pointes and complete <b>atrioventricular</b> block developed, along with subsequent multiple organ failure, with a trazodone plasma concentration of 25.4mg/L on admission.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{mechanism}} {{is likely to}} be high pulmonary vascular pressures with concurrent negative airway pressures, causing extreme stress across the pulmonary capillary membrane (the fragile membrane separating blood in the pulmonary capillaries from the air-filled alveoli) and consequent hemorrhage into the air spaces of the lung. Other contributing factors may include upper airway obstruction, increased blood viscosity, abnormalities of cardiac origin (small cross-sectional area of <b>atrioventricular</b> valves, stiff valves, slow left ventricular relaxation time, right tricuspid valve regurgitation), preferential distribution of blood flow to the dorsocaudal lung regions, mechanical trauma, lower airway obstruction, inflammation, abnormalities of blood coagulation, inhomogeneity of ventilation and locomotory trauma. EIPH begins in the dorso-caudal region of the lung and progresses in a cranioventral direction over time.|$|E
