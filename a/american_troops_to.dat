5|$|In 1900 the United States {{dispatched}} <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> China {{as part of}} {{a multinational}} force to quell a rebellion that was endangering the lives of citizens from several countries. The conflict would become known as the Battle of Peking, or as the Boxer rebellion. After the battle, 59 Medals of Honor were presented for actions throughout the event. William Zion from Indiana was the only American Jew to receive the medal during this conflict.|$|E
5|$|The Matoika {{had been}} {{in the service of the}} U.S. Army as a {{transport}} ship since September 1919, and, until the time of her selection, had been returning American soldiers from Europe and repatriating the remains of Americans killed during the war. Before World War I, the Matoika had been a passenger liner for North German Lloyd by the name of Princess Alice. After the United States joined the conflict in 1917, the liner had been pressed into service for the U.S. Navy carrying <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> Europe; she was renamed Princess Matoika, after one of the given names for Pocahontas, as part of an order to replace Germanic names of seized ships with American names.|$|E
5|$|Washington and the American {{command in}} Saigon {{considered}} the operation a great success, {{both as a}} test of the new American policy of Vietnamization and in setting back any communist offensives planned against the Saigon area during the next year. The logistical haul overrun and captured by the allied forces in the Base Areas was indeed impressive. 20,000 individual and 2,500 crew-served weapons; 7,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of munitions; 140,000 rockets and artillery shells; 435 vehicles; 29 tons of communications equipment; 55 tons of medical supplies; and 199,552 anti-aircraft rounds. The incursion was, however, limited in its scale and scope. Nixon had limited the depth of penetration by U.S. forces to 35 kilometers and placed a 30 June deadline for the withdrawal of <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> South Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, U.S. ground forces were {{introduced}} into combat roles in large numbers, {{and the first}} US Marines came ashore at Da Nang in Thi's I Corps. The flamboyant Thi organized for the <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> be greeted by military bands, welcoming banners and teenage girls who garlanded them with flowers. This caused embarrassment to US military officials who felt the introduction of combat troops and resultant American casualties would not be received well by the public when contrasted with Thi's celebratory fanfare. Soon after the Americans were in position, Thi tipped off Marine Lieutenant General Lewis W. Walt about a major movement of Việt Cộng insurgents near Chu Lai in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam. This resulted in Operation Starlite, generally regarded as the first offensive action undertaken by the Americans in the Vietnam War. Occurring between 18–24 August, it resulted in the 1st Việt Cộng Regiment being pushed to the coast.|$|E
5|$|The Ojo de Agua Raid was {{the last}} {{important}} military engagement between Mexican Seditionistas and the United States Army. It took place at Ojo de Agua, Texas. As part of the Plan of San Diego, the rebels launched a raid across the Rio Grande into Texas on October 21, 1915 aimed at harassing the American outposts along the Mexican border and disrupting the local economy. After moving across the border, the Seditionistas began an assault against the United States Army Signal Corps station at Ojo de Agua. The small group of American defenders was cornered into a single building and suffered heavy casualties before reinforcements arrived driving the Seditionist force back into Mexico. The raid {{proved to be the}} tipping point in the American conflict with the Seditionistas, as its severity convinced American officials to send large numbers of <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> the area in order to deter any further serious border raids by the Mexican force.|$|E

25|$|The {{withdrawal}} had {{catastrophic effects}} on the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN). Shortly after the Paris Peace Accords, the United States Congress made major budget cuts in military aid to the South Vietnamese. The ARVN, which had been trained by <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> use American tactics, quickly fell into disarray. Although it remained an effective fighting force throughout 1973 and 1974, by January 1975 it had disintegrated. The North Vietnamese hurriedly attacked the much weakened South, and met with little resistance.|$|E
25|$|In the end, Operation Bluebat sent nearly 15,000 <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> Lebanon from {{commands}} in Europe and {{the continental}} United States, including 6,100 Marines and 3,100 Army airborne troops armed with nuclear artillery; the 76 ships of the Sixth Fleet; and a 200-plane Composite Air Task Force based out of Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. The intervention forces remained in Lebanon for 102 days, {{at a cost}} of over $200 million, acting as an urban security force and losing only one American soldier to hostile fire.|$|E

25|$|On March 13, 2002, Operation Harpoon was {{launched}} in parallel of Operation Anaconda, {{with the goal of}} eliminating a small pocket of Taliban fighters.

The next day, a reconnaissance platoon from 3PPCLI led the <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> a network of caves and bunkers used by Al-Qaeda resisters.

25|$|The First Battle at Adobe Walls {{would be}} the last time the Comanche and Kiowa forced <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> retreat from a battlefield, and marked the {{beginning}} of the end of the plains tribes and their way of life. A decade later the Second Battle of Adobe Walls was fought on June 27, 1874, between 250-700 Comanche and a group of 28 hunters defending the settlement of Adobe Walls. After a four-day siege, the Indians withdrew. The Second Battle is historically significant because it led to the Red River War of 1874-75, resulting in the final relocation of the Southern Plains Indians to reservations in what is now Oklahoma.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, a once U.S.-supportive {{leader who}} was later accused of spying for Fidel Castro and using Panama to traffic drugs into the United States, {{was one of}} the most {{recognizable}} names in America and was constantly in the press. The struggle to remove him from power began in the Reagan administration, when economic sanctions were imposed on the country; this included prohibiting American companies and government from making payments to Panama and freezing $56million in Panamanian funds in American banks. Reagan sent more than 2,000 <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>to</b> Panama as well. Unlike Reagan, Bush was able to remove Noriega from power, but his administration's unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government.|$|E
