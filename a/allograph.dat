Patients regain their range of motion and leg strength on the newly repaired ACL leg much quicker. The graft also allows for a bone-to-bone fixation which allows for more aggressive rehabilitation. The patient also eliminates the chance of any potential complications such as disease transmission that would be present if an <b>allograph</b> was chosen. The dis{{advantages of}} the graft include infection at this site, anterior knee pain, quadriceps muscle weakness, loss of motion, patella fracture, patellofemoral crepitus, patellar tendonitis, and patellofemoral joint pain. Also, {{it is not uncommon}} in certain patient populations to rupture the contralateral ACL following return to their sport. By harvesting the patellar tendon from the opposite knee, the orthopedic surgeon no longer has the option of using that patellar tendon for the reconstruction. It has been noted that a low percentage of patients have suffered a patellar tendon rupture in the first few weeks after surgery due to the increased stress to the area. In addition to a longer operating time the patient will have two scars instead of one.|$|E
2500|$|The vowel graphemes in Bengali {{can take}} two forms: the {{independent}} form {{found in the}} basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, <b>allograph</b> form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in [...] "ladder" [...] and in [...] "Hilsa fish", the independent form of the vowel [...] is used (cf. the dependent form.

2500|$|An {{individual}} grapheme may {{be represented}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways, where each variation is visually distinct in some regard, but all are interpreted as representing the [...] "same" [...] grapheme. These individual variations are known as allographs of a grapheme (compare with the term allophone used in linguistic study). For example, the minuscule letter a has different allographs when written as a cursive, block, or typed letter. The choice of a particular <b>allograph</b> may be influenced by the medium used, the writing instrument, the stylistic choice of the writer, the preceding and following graphemes in the text, the time available for writing, the intended audience, and the largely unconscious features of an individual's handwriting.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{deals with}} the role of <b>allographs</b> in the general {{framework}} of the study of writing. It explains why <b>allographs</b> are important (writer individuality), how they can be measured (frequency and contexts (graphic, semantic, non-graphic)) and what applications to expect from them (biometrics, script restoration, artistic creation, cultural history). One of the common elements used to identify a typeface or a handwriting is the shape of the script. Sometimes, however, individual characters may have alternate forms — in those cases the rules and habits governing their usage characterize the behavior of the typesetter or writer in a more subtle way than shape does. <b>Allographs</b> provide inconspicuous signatures to a text...|$|R
2500|$|A {{consonant}} sound {{followed by}} some vowel sound {{other than the}} inherent [...] is orthographically realized by {{using a variety of}} vowel allographs above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel typographic ligatures. These allographs, called [...] kar, are diacritical vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph [...] represents the consonant [...] followed by the vowel , where [...] is represented as the diacritical <b>allograph</b> (called [...] i-kar) and is placed before the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs [...] , [...] , [...] , [...] , [...] , [...] , [...] , [...] and [...] represent the same consonant [...] combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. It should be noted that in these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called [...] "inherent" [...] vowel [...] is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign [...]|$|E
