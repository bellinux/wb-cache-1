5|$|As of 17 August 2017 (Update 2.7), {{there are}} 34 hero options. The {{developers}} {{of the game}} continually add new heroes, each with different skills but balanced for fair play. For example, a hero may have high damage but poor mobility, or strong melee abilities but no ranged option. Players choose between three abilities that upgrade via a common technology tree. There is a set number of heroes that <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> play, with the free to play roster being renewed every week.|$|E
5|$|Aviary {{experiments}} {{conducted with}} captive flocks of scaly-breasted munia have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (see Evolutionarily stable strategy) when individuals <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> choose either behavior. The numbers choosing either producers and scrounger strategies {{have been shown}} to converge on stable frequencies while demonstrating that variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay-offs from the choice of different feeding strategies.|$|E

5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which to mate. Females <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions {{spend much of their}} time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{health care}} is {{provided}} by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> select the physicians or facilities of their choice.|$|E
5|$|Intramural {{sports are}} offered to {{students}} in group five and interscholastic sports are available in groups five through eight. ACS competes in the West DuPage Elementary School Association (WDESA) Conference.

5|$|Metallic bonding can be {{classified}} {{as a type of}} covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> move as well as the ions. For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.|$|E
5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, {{which states that}} the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the player}} grows the Star Plant to 2000 metres and returns a seed to M.O.M., the main {{objective}} is completed, and the player {{is given the}} choice of collecting eight more seeds. Completing this final objective unlocks a special suit that allows the player to jump twice as high, and finishes the game. Players <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> explore the world after completion.|$|E

5|$|Right {{to freedom}} of religion, covered in Articles 25, 26, 27 and 28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens of India. The objective of this right is to sustain the principle of secularism in India. According to the Constitution, all religions are equal before the State and no religion shall be given preference over the other. Citizens <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice.|$|E
5|$|Seekers of Adoulin {{concerns}} the western continent archipelago of Adoulin, and the Sacred City of Adoulin. The city was {{a focal point}} for colonization 200 years before the present game, but when colonization efforts failed in the main continent of Ulbuka, the nation fell in population and shifted to trade as a focus. Now colonization has begun once again, and players <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> explore the region.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the fictional}} Pacific City, the player {{controls}} a biologically enhanced Agent, tasked with defeating three crime lords and their organized crime syndicates. The Agent's abilities improve by defeating both crime lords and their supporters, {{as well as}} by completing optional activities, such as street races and scavenger hunts. The gameplay is nonlinear: instead of following a rigid mission sequence, players <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> select the approach to completing their missions and activities. The game features a two-player cooperative play mode via Xbox Live.|$|E
50|$|When calculating thermal {{expansion}} {{it is necessary}} to consider whether the body <b>is</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> expand or <b>is</b> constrained. If the body <b>is</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> expand, the expansion or strain resulting from an increase in temperature can be simply calculated by using the applicable coefficient of {{thermal expansion}}.|$|R
