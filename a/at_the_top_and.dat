5|$|A {{triangular}} banner {{appearing to}} depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse {{are a series of}} five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by {{what appears to be a}} cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Naval Caps {{were made}} of steel gray cloth. They {{were not to be}} less than three inches and a half, nor more than four inches in height. They were also not to be more than ten, or less than nine inches and a half, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> had a patent leather visor, to be worn by all {{officers}} in their service dress.|$|E
5|$|In July 1984, Raiford guards {{found two}} hacksaw blades hidden in Bundy's cell. A steel bar {{in one of}} its windows had been sawed {{completely}} through <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> bottom and glued back in place with a homemade soap-based adhesive. Several months later his cell was changed again after guards found an unauthorized mirror hidden in it.|$|E

5|$|New {{home and}} away kits were brought in {{for the first time}} in two years. The home kit {{included}} red shirts with a white collar and white trims on the sleeves, white shorts and red socks. The away kit comprised light blue shirts with a white collar, a white double-chevron decoration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> white sleeves, light blue shirts and light blue socks. Benenden Health continued as shirt sponsors for the third successive season.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is surrounded}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter {{and the lower}} esophageal sphincter. These sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being swallowed. The esophageal sphincters are functional but not anatomical, meaning that they act as sphincters but do not have distinct thickenings like other sphincters.|$|E
5|$|The {{glans penis}} is rounded, short, and small and is superficially divided into {{left and right}} halves by a trough <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> a ridge at the bottom. Most of the glans is covered with penile spines, except for an area near the tip.|$|E
50|$|All canons {{have been}} removed and {{replaced}} with bolted iron joists for ringing. The 16th-century oak frame with pits for three bells still exists: the posts have moulded corbelling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>and</b> are strengthened by curved struts. It has been altered to take four bells, the treble and second being hung {{to the north of}} it.|$|R

5|$|Three {{months after}} {{receiving}} the All-Star Game, the Hurricanes unveiled the logo for the 2011 game. The logo was designed with some homage to the host team and city hidden within it. The shape of the logo {{is similar to the}} Hurricanes primary logo, along with the team colors of red, black and silver. The banners <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> bottom of the logo are inspired by the state flag of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{was originally}} in the highway median at the Toronto terminus of the highway, {{dedicated to the}} 1939 visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and known as the Lucky Lion. The column, with a crown <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> a lion at the base, was designed by W. L. Somerville and sculptors Frances Loring and Florence Wyle for C$12,000 (in 1940, $ adjusted for inflation). The monument was removed in 1972 {{in order to accommodate}} widening of the original QEW, and relocated in August 1975 to the nearby Sir Casimir Gzowski Park along Lake Ontario, {{on the east side of}} the Humber River.|$|E
5|$|Considered one of {{the symbols}} of Tiruchirappalli, the Rockfort is a {{fortress}} which stands atop a 273-foot-high rock. It consists {{of a set of}} monolithic rocks accommodating many rock-cut cave temples. Originally built by the Pallavas, it was later reconstructed by the Madurai Nayaks and Vijayanagara rulers. The temple complex has three shrines, two of which are dedicated to Lord Ganesha, one at the foot and the Ucchi Pillayar Temple <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> the Thayumanavar Temple between them. The Thayumanavar temple, the largest of the three, houses a shrine for Pārvatī as well as the main deity. The Rockfort is visible from almost every part of the city's north. The Teppakulam {{at the foot of the}} Rockfort is surrounded by bazaars. It has a mandapa at its centre and has facilities for boat riding.|$|E

5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating {{about the dangers of}} shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
5|$|Gossip, {{with his}} long, flowing beard, {{looks like one}} of the old-time monks. He has a good-shaped cranium, bald <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> is a little above the medium height.... He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of the}} greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E
5|$|Grove Church Cemetery {{is located}} at 1132 46th Street in North Bergen, New Jersey. The {{cemetery}} also fronts Kennedy Boulevard which in the 19thcentury was known as Dallytown Road, or Bergenwood Road. Overlooking into the Secaucus, it starts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> extends onto {{the middle of the}} western face of the Hudson Palisades. Grove Church Cemetery is one of several burial sites on the western slope, along with Machpelah Cemetery, Hoboken Cemetery and Weehawken Cemetery, which is only a few blocks away from Grove Church along with Palisades Cemetery. These grounds constitute a string of green open spaces in North Hudson County. The gated entrance is across the street, east of the Bergenline Avenue station of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail in Union City, New Jersey.|$|E
50|$|The legionaries {{carried a}} long and oval-shaped shield (the scutum) that curved both <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>and</b> sides. It usually {{consisted}} {{of two or three}} glued together layers of wood, with a canvas and hide cover and an iron or copper alloy boss <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center. The purpose of the scutum was both to deflect attacks as well as to bash against the opponent’s shield or body to create an opening in the formation.|$|R

60|$|Buckingham only sneered at her explanation, and {{a moment}} later gave the command that started us all off toward the west. We marched for a matter of an hour or so, coming at last to a {{collection}} of rude huts, fashioned from branches of trees covered with skins and grasses and sometimes plastered with mud. All about the camp they had erected a wall of saplings pointed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>and</b> fire hardened.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, 20 albums reached {{number one}} on the chart, {{including}} Primera Fila, a live album recorded by Vicente Fernández that spent seven non-consecutive weeks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Ranchero Album. Lines, Vines and Trying Times by Jonas Brothers and No Line on the Horizon by U2 peaked at number one in the Billboard 200 in the United States and also reached the top position of the Mexican chart. Shakira's seventh studio album Loba debuted at number one and was certified platinum {{in the first week of}} sales.|$|E
5|$|On March 11 Thieu {{convened a}} meeting with Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm, Chief of the ARVN General Staff General Cao Văn Viên, and Lieutenant General Dang Van Quang to discuss the {{military}} situation in the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In this meeting, Thieu decided to withdraw {{what was left of}} his army from the northern provinces to defend the Mekong region, where most of the nation’s population and vital economic resources were located. Thieu justified his decision on the basis that the South Vietnamese military could not defend every inch of South Vietnam’s territory, so the military had to be ‘lightened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> heavy at the bottom’.|$|E
5|$|The Puerta de Palmas {{was built}} in 1551. It has two {{cylindrical}} towers flanking the entrance door. Prince Philip II and Emperor Charles V and date of construction are mentioned on the outer side of the tower. The towers are fortified with battlements and they have two decorative cords <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> bottom levels. Its entrance is east-facing, and is double-arched and is decorated with medallions of the shield of the Emperor Charles V. It was once used as a prison, but has since undergone many renovations and has been an entrance point to the city.|$|E

When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church-tower, jump out of the turrets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E
5|$|Today {{only the}} base of the motte survives at Bedford Castle, 7.5 m (25 feet) high and 49 m (161 feet) wide <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> is a {{scheduled}} monument. Archaeological work has been conducted to develop {{a better understanding of the}} history of the castle, although excavations are difficult because of the urban nature of the site. Excavations between 1969 and 1972 established the broad form of the castle; this was supplemented by further work in 1995–6 and another phase of excavations in 2007. Following the 2007 investigations, an archaeological park was built on part of the castle site between 2007 and 2009, forming the centre of a mixed-use development of restaurants and apartments. The park incorporated one of the castle's lime kilns, first rediscovered in 1973, and the foundations of a hall discovered at the castle.|$|E
5|$|Variations of this flag {{were used}} during the Belarusian People's Republic in 1918–1919. The white-red-white flag is still used by the Republic's government-in-exile. Lasting from 1919 until 1925, {{the flag of the}} BPR {{retained}} the white, red, white design, but with the addition of black stripes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> bottom of the red stripe. Between 1921 and 1939 the white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus (part of the Second Polish Republic), both by political organizations like the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union or the Belarusian Christian Democracy, and non-political organizations like the Belarusian Schools Society. The flag was also used by the Belarusian Special Battalion in the army of the Republic of Lithuania. After the invasion of Poland and the annexation of modern-day West Belarus in 1939 the flag was forbidden by the Soviet administration in the newly acquired territories as well.|$|E
