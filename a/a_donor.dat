5|$|EK Trianguli Australis, a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris type, {{was first}} noticed in 1978 and officially {{described}} in 1980. It {{consists of a}} white dwarf and <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> star which orbit each other every 1.5 hours. The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star onto an accretion disc and periodically erupts, reaching magnitude 11.2 in superoutbursts, 12.1 in normal outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.7 when quiet. Nova Trianguli Australis 2008 was a slow nova which peaked at magnitude 8.4 in April 2008, before fading to magnitude 12.4 by September of that year.|$|E
5|$|In later life, {{he became}} a {{resident}} of Wailuku and Makawao and was <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> and attendant of the church at Makawao, founded by Reverend Green, after developing a rift with the Wailuku Congregational Church. Falling ill {{while he was in}} Honolulu, Kaʻauwai returned to his native Maui for a change of climate which did nothing to improve his health. He died at Makawao, on August 8, 1856. In a letter dated to October 6, 1856, Reverend Jonathan Smith Green, who had befriended him during his lifetime as a parishioner of the Makawao church, wrote a short biography of Kaʻauwai which was published in The American Missionary.|$|E

5|$|Less {{expensive}} cloth paintings (tüchlein) {{were more}} common in middle-class households, and records show {{a strong interest in}} domestically owned religious panel paintings. Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter. Alterations varied from having individualised panels added to a prefabricated pattern, to the inclusion of <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> portrait. The addition of coats-of-arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, which exists in several variations.|$|E
5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before <b>a</b> <b>donor,</b> who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes becomes {{jealous of}} Malachy {{and his new}} girlfriend, Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan). Mercedes lies to Lynsey and tells her that she is HIV-positive. Mercedes tells Malachy and they {{secretly}} plan to reconcile. Lynsey learns of this and discovers Mercedes has lied. Lynsey tells Malachy, who punches Mercedes. Mercedes and Malachy reconcile. However, Malachy is badly injured in an explosion and Mercedes is forced to turn off his life support, and he subsequently dies. Malachy's family are forced by Myra to invite Mercedes to his funeral despite discovering her infidelity. Mercedes gets into an argument with Billy Alexander (Richard Graham) at her aunt Kathleen McQueen's (Alison Burrows) fundraising event, after she accuses him of touching her. Carmel apologises for Mercedes' behaviour and agrees {{to have lunch with}} Billy. When Billy visits Carmel, Myra slaps him and reveals that he is the father of Mercedes and Jacqui. He tells Mercedes and Jacqui that he needs a kidney transplant and that they are the only likely donors. When Mercedes and Jacqui refuse to be donors, Kathleen tells Billy that he is the father of her daughter Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), confirming that Theresa is actually Mercedes and Jacqui's half-sister. Billy is later revealed to not be needing a kidney, and that it is actually Mercedes, Jacqui and Theresa's secret half-sister, Emily Alexander (Elizabeth Henstridge). However, Mercedes is not interested in Billy nor Emily and declines to be <b>a</b> <b>donor,</b> although Jacqui later agrees to be <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> but is revealed not to be a match, so Billy and Emily disown her and leave.|$|E

5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|SX Leonis Minoris is a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris {{type that}} was {{identified}} in 1994. It {{consists of a}} white dwarf and <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> star, which orbit each other every 97minutes. The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star onto an accretion disc and heats up to between 6000 and 10000 K. The dwarf star erupts every 34 to 64days, reaching magnitude 13.4 in these outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.8 when quiet. Leo Minor contains another dwarf nova, RZ Leonis Minoris, which brightens to magnitude 14.2 from a baseline magnitude of around 17 but does so at shorter intervals than other dwarf novae.|$|E
5|$|Two near-contemporary copies, usually {{attributed}} to the Ghent Master of 1499 and Jan Gossaert, were completed while the original was {{in the collection of}} Margaret of Austria, great-granddaughter of Philip the Good. Both present variants of the Madonna panel as the left wing of a devotional diptych, with <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> portrait as the right wing. However, the two donor panels have very different settings. The 1499 version shows the Cistercian abbot Christiaan de Hondt praying in his luxurious quarters, while Gossaert presents the donor Antonio Siciliano, accompanied by Saint Anthony, in a panoramic landscape setting. It is not known if either work is based on an original left-hand panel painted by van Eyck.|$|E

In the early days, Holden considered adopting the Omega as is, save for the engines and transmissions, and even investigated reskinning the existing VR/VS architecture. Later on, the VT bodywork spawned a new generation of Statesman and Caprice (again based on the long-wheelbase wagons), and even went as far as resurrecting the iconic Monaro coupé of the 1960s and 1970s via a prototype presented at the 1998 Sydney Motor Show.|$|E
5|$|Blair is {{pregnant}} with Patrick's baby, {{who has been}} identified as <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> match for Starr. She gives birth to his stillborn son in 1997. Todd blames Patrick for the miscarriage and frames him for the murder of billionaire and Llanview newcomer Guy Armitage. Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry him so he can keep custody of Starr. When Blair awakens, he allows Blair visitation. In 1998, while Todd and Téa grow closer, Todd is again accused of rape; Blair and Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), a lawyer and father-figure to Todd, help prove his innocence. Back in town upon Todd's request, he also intends to help Todd save his tempestuous marriage to Téa. In the interim, Todd and Blair grow closer, and Blair and Téa vie for Todd's affections. As Todd and Téa fall in love, Blair moves on with Sam. When Todd is about to be arrested for the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips, he takes the other fourteen suspects hostage at the Buchanan family cabin with fake dynamite strapped to his chest. Rachel Gannon admits to the murder, but Todd is arrested for the hostage incident. He fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid conviction and keep Téa in his life. Téa divorces him as part of his defense strategy, but they remarry in November. During the reception, a tape on which Todd confesses to faking his split personalities is accidentally played at Starr's request. Téa refuses his offer of another five million to stay married to him. He leaves town in December, and Tea has the marriage annulled in 1999.|$|E
