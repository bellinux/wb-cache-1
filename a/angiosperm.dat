5|$|In {{addition}} to rich dinosaur fossils, {{there are also}} plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–Pg boundary. In the sediments below the K–Pg boundary the dominant plant remains are <b>angiosperm</b> pollen grains, but the boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores. More usual pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger <b>angiosperm</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics.

Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the <b>Angiosperm</b> Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering {{many of the questions}} about relationships among <b>angiosperm</b> families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E

50|$|This {{hypothesized}} {{relationship of}} the extant seed plants places Amborella as the sister taxon to all other <b>angiosperms,</b> and shows the gymnosperms as a monophyletic group sister to the <b>angiosperms.</b> It supports the theory that Amborella branched off from the main lineage of <b>angiosperms</b> before the ancestors of any other living <b>angiosperms.</b> There is however some uncertainty {{about the relationship between}} the Amborellaceae and the Nymphaeales: one theory is that the Amborellaceae alone are the monophyletic sister to the extant angiosperms; another proposes that the Amborellaceae and Nymphaeales form a clade that is the sister group to all other extant <b>angiosperms.</b>|$|R

Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others have suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down <b>angiosperm</b> trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae s.l., many {{attempts have been made to}} form suprageneric classifications, e.g. subfamilies and tribes. Classifications published since the use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (Liliaceae s.s.). The <b>Angiosperm</b> Phylogeny Website (APweb) recognizes three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Angiosperm</b> Phylogeny Group (APG) made rapid {{progress}} {{in establishing a}} modern monophyletic classification of the flowering plants by 2009. Despite establishing this relative degree of monophyly (genetic homogeneity) for the Liliaceae family, their morphology remains diverse and there exists within the Liliaceae clade or grouping, a number of subclades (subgroups). Particularly enigmatic were Clintonia, Medeola, Scoliopus, and Tricyrtis.|$|E
40|$|<b>Angiosperms</b> (flowering plants) are {{the most}} diverse of all major {{lineages}} of land plants and the dominant autotrophs in most terrestrial ecosystems. Their evolutionary and ecological appearance is therefore of considerable interest and has significant implications for understanding patterns of diversification in other lineages, including insects and other animals. More {{than half a century}} ago, influential reviews showed that while <b>angiosperms</b> are richly represented in sediments of Late Cretaceous and younger ages, there are no reliable records of <b>angiosperms</b> from pre-Cretaceous rocks. The extensive new macrofossil, mesofossil, and microfossil data that have accumulated since have confirmed and reinforced this pattern. Recently, however, molecular dating methods have raised the possibility that <b>angiosperms</b> may have existed much earlier, and there have been scattered reports of putative <b>angiosperms</b> from Triassic and Jurassic rocks. Critical assessment of these reports shows that, so far, none provide unequivocal evidence of pre-Cretaceous <b>angiosperms.</b> <b>Angiosperms</b> may ultimately be recognized from Jurassic or earlier rocks, but credible palaeobotanical evidence will require unambiguous documentation of the diagnostic structural features that separate <b>angiosperms</b> from other groups of extant and extinct seed plants.

40|$|Appearing in {{the fossil}} record only 130 Ma, <b>angiosperms</b> (flowering plants) quickly grew to {{dominance}} in the terrestrial realm, and remain the dominant group of land plants today. High productivity among <b>angiosperms</b> {{has been attributed to}} key innovations in the evolution of leaf veins, which transport water to the leaves. Leaf vein density has been shown to limit water availability in the leaf when evaporation rates are high. The hypothesis that high vein density in <b>angiosperms</b> provides a physiological advantage rests on the ability of <b>angiosperms</b> to fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere faster than non-angiosperms under variable water availability. Carbon isotope abundance ratios (δ 13 C) measured from plant matter indicate the magnitude to which a plant discriminates against heavier 13 CO 2 during photosynthesis. Initially for this study, it was hypothesized that plants that produce leaves with higher vein densities (i. e. <b>angiosperms)</b> would be more depleted in 13 C, compared against plants with lower leaf vein density (i. e. ferns). By comparing characters of modern <b>angiosperms</b> against some of the earliest <b>angiosperms</b> from the same family, this study is an attempt to observe the evolution of leaf vein density in <b>angiosperms</b> over time, and to observe differences in carbon isotope fractionation betwee...|$|R
5|$|The {{eventual}} {{position of}} Narcissus within the Amaryllidaceae family only became {{settled in the}} twenty-first century with the advent of phylogenetic analysis and the <b>Angiosperm</b> Phylogeny Group system. The genus Narcissus belongs to the Narcisseae tribe, one of 13 within the Amaryllidoideae subfamily of the Amaryllidaceae. It is one of two sister clades corresponding to genera in the Narcisseae, being distinguished from Sternbergia by the presence of a paraperigonium, and is monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} need for a {{thorough}} revision of the taxonomy of the flowering plants (angiosperms), systematists formed the <b>Angiosperm</b> Phylogeny Group (APG), resulting in a new classification published in 1998.

5|$|With about 750 species, Ficus (Moraceae) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} <b>angiosperm</b> genera (David Frodin of Chelsea Physic Garden ranked it as the 31st largest genus). Ficus aurea is {{classified}} in the subgenus Urostigma (the strangler figs) and the section Americana. Recent molecular phylogenies have shown that subgenus Urostigma is polyphyletic, but have strongly supported the validity of section Americana as a discrete group (although its exact relationship to section Galoglychia is unclear).|$|E

5000|$|The Caytoniales (Figs. 1-2) are an extinct {{order of}} seed plants known from fossils {{collected}} throughout the Mesozoic Era, {{specifically in the}} late Triassic to Maastrichtian period, around [...] They are regarded as seed ferns because they are seed-bearing plants with fern-like leaves. Although at one time considered <b>angiosperms</b> because of their berry-like cupules, that hypothesis was later disproven. Nevertheless, some authorities consider them likely ancestors of <b>angiosperms,</b> whereas others consider <b>angiosperms</b> more likely derived from Glossopteridales.

5|$|The fossil {{material}} of A. longicervia {{was subjected to}} chemical analysis for oleanane, considered a key marker differentiating <b>angiosperms</b> from gymnosperms. Oleanane was detected in these specimens, suggesting that they belong to the <b>angiosperms.</b>|$|R
5|$|Also enigmatic were Clintonia, Medeola, Scoliopus, and Tricyrtis. Clintonia, with a disjunct {{distribution}} involving East Asia and North America, and the {{closely related}} Medeola form a subclades {{and are now}} considered a separate tribe (Medeoleae) within the Lilioideae, although at different times they have been considered a separate subfamily (Medeoloideae) or family (Medeolaceae). Sequencing of the rbcL and matK chloroplast genes established monophyly for Clintonia, but with separate clades corresponding to the two areas of distribution. The <b>Angiosperm</b> Phylogeny Website (APWeb) includes four of Takhtajan's families in Liliaceae, recognizing three subfamilies, {{one of which is}} divided into two tribes and referred to as Liliaceae sensu APG III.|$|E
5|$|Many other botanists echoed Lindley's earlier {{concerns}} about the phylogeny of the Liliaceae, but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction. Dahlgren (1985) suggested there were in fact forty – not one – families distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales). In {{the context of a}} general review of the classification of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. Considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants, as elaborated by the <b>Angiosperm</b> Phylogeny Group (1998).|$|E
5|$|Archaeamphora longicervia H. Q. Li was {{described}} as an herbaceous, Sarraceniaceae-like pitcher plant from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, northeastern China. Here, a re-investigation of A. longicervia specimens from the Yixian Formation provides new insights into its identity and the morphology of pitcher plants claimed by Li. We demonstrate that putative pitchers of Archaeamphora are insect-induced leaf galls that consist of three components: (1) an innermost larval chamber; (2) an intermediate zone of nutritive tissue; and (3) an outermost wall of sclerenchyma. Archaeamphora is not a carnivorous, Sarraceniaceae-like <b>angiosperm,</b> but represents insect-galled leaves of the previously reported gymnosperm Liaoningocladus boii G. Sun et al. from the Yixian Formation.|$|E
40|$|Major {{progress}} has been made during the last twenty years towards {{a better understanding of the}} evolution of <b>angiosperms.</b> Early molecular-phylogenetic analyses revealed three major groups, with eudicots as well as monocots being monophyletic, arisen from a paraphyletic group of dicotyledonous <b>angiosperms</b> (= basal <b>angiosperms).</b> Consistently, numerous phylogenetic studies based on sequence data have recovered the eudicot-clade and increased confidence in its existence.

50|$|<b>Angiosperms</b> {{differ from}} other seed plants in several ways, {{described}} in the table. These distinguishing characteristics taken together have made the <b>angiosperms</b> the most diverse and numerous land plants and the most commercially important group to humans.|$|R
40|$|Producing {{leaves with}} closely spaced veins {{is a key}} {{innovation}} linked to high rates of photosynthesis in <b>angiosperms.</b> A close geometric link between veins and stomata in <b>angiosperms</b> ensures that investment in enhanced venous water transport provides the strongest net carbon return to the plant. This link is underpinned by "passive dilution" via expansion of surrounding cells. However, {{it is not known}} whether this 'passive dilution' mechanism is present in plant lineages other than <b>angiosperms</b> and is another key feature of the angiosperms' evolutionary success. Consequently, we sought to determine whether the 'passive dilution' mechanism is; (i) exclusive to the <b>angiosperms,</b> (ii) a conserved mechanism that evolved in the common ancestor of ferns and <b>angiosperms,</b> or (iii) has evolved continuously over time. To do this we first we assessed the plasticity of vein and stomatal density and epidermal cell size in ferns in response to light environment. We then compared the relationships between these traits found among ferns with modelled relationships that assume vein and stomatal density respond passively to epidermal cell expansion, and with those previously observed in <b>angiosperms.</b> Vein density, stomatal density and epidermal cell size were linked in ferns with remarkably similar relationships to those observed in <b>angiosperms,</b> except that fern leaves had fewer veins per stomata. However, plasticity was limited in ferns and stomatal spacing was dependent on active stomatal differentiation as well as passive cell expansion. Thus, ferns (like <b>angiosperms)</b> appear to coordinate vein and stomatal density with epidermal cell expansion to some extent to maintain a constant ratio between veins and stomata in the leaf. The different general relationships between vein density and stomatal density in ferns and <b>angiosperms</b> suggests the groups have different optimum balances between the production of vein tissue dedicated to water supply and stomatal tissue for gas exchange...|$|R
5|$|In 1998 the <b>Angiosperm</b> Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for flowering plants {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve the {{apparent}} differences between morphological and molecularly defined trees, a combined analysis was undertaken which confirmed superorder Liliiflorae as monophyletic, provided that a few modifications were undertaken. These included the removal of two tribes of Melanthiaceae (Melanthiales) and the inclusion of three additional families (Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae and Velloziaceae) from other superorders. This newly and more narrowly redefined Lilianae/Liliiflorae contained three orders, Aparagales, Liliales and Dioscoreales (which now included the stemonoids). This analysis also allowed {{for the establishment of}} a single synapomorphy, although this time by the presence of an inferior ovary. Significantly, the authors noted that it was no wonder the authors of <b>angiosperm</b> classifications had been exasperated by the Lilianae.|$|E
5|$|These findings, {{presented}} at the first Monocot Conference in 1993, {{with the addition of}} several studies that had become available in the interim, formed the basis of the 1998 consensus <b>Angiosperm</b> Phylogeny Group (APG) ordinal scheme. Among other things, the Alismatales were expanded and new orders such as Acorales (a placement for Acorus) and Pandanales (which now represented the stemonoids as well as new families) added. While not formally assigning any supraordinal ranks, the classification did recognize an informal grouping of monocot orders as the commelinoids. Otherwise the APG recognized only six monocot orders (Acorales, Alismatales, Asparagales, Dioscoreales, Liliales and Pandanales). The last four were however grouped together in the resulting cladogram and most closely represent the concept of lilioids, although this left some unplaced monocot families, including Corsiaceae and Petrosaviaceae.|$|E
40|$|The Coleoptera (beetles) {{constitute}} almost {{one-fourth of}} all known life-forms on earth. They are {{also among the}} most important pollinators of flowering plants, especially basal <b>angiosperms.</b> Beetle fossils are abundant, almost spanning the entire Early Cretaceous, and thus provide important clues to explore the co-evolutionary processes between beetles and <b>angiosperms.</b> We review the fossil record of some Early Cretaceous polyphagan beetles including Tenebrionoidea, Scarabaeoidea, Curculionoidea, and Chrysomeloidea. Both the fossil record and molecular analyses reveal that these four groups had already diversified during or before the Early Cretaceous, clearly before the initial rise of <b>angiosperms</b> to widespread floristic dominance. These four beetle groups are important pollinators of basal <b>angiosperms</b> today, suggesting that their ecological association with <b>angiosperms</b> probably formed as early as in the Early Cretaceous.

30|$|Differences in stomatal control among {{species and}} higher taxa {{may also be}} {{important}} for determining the effects of fire plumes. Sperry (2004) suggests that <b>angiosperms</b> rely on tighter stomatal control than gymnosperms; that is, the difference in water potential at which stomatal control begins and hydraulic failure occurs is small in <b>angiosperms</b> relative to conifers. Where this generalization holds, and if rates of stomatal control are similar, <b>angiosperms</b> would be more vulnerable {{to the effects of}} plumes than gymnosperms.|$|R

5|$|Conflicting {{reports have}} been made as to its {{preferred}} habitat; two papers suggest it preferred channels to floodplains, but another suggests it preferred the opposite. The possible preference for channels {{is based on the}} relative abundance of thescelosaur fossils in sandstones, representing channel environments, in comparison to mudstones, representing floodplain environments. No bonebeds or accumulations of multiple individuals have yet been reported. Dale Russell, in a popular work, noted that Thescelosaurus was the most common small herbivore in the Hell Creek Formation of the Fort Peck area. He described the environment of the time as a flat floodplain, with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from <b>angiosperm</b> trees, to bald cypress, to ferns and ginkgos. Although most dinosaur skeletons from this area are incomplete, possibly due to the low preservation potential of forests, Thescelosaurus skeletons are much more complete, suggesting that this genus frequented stream channels. Thus when a Thescelosaurus died, it may have been in or near a river, making it easier to bury and preserve for later fossilization. Russell tentatively compared it to the capybaras and tapirs. Other dinosaurs that shared its time and place include the ceratopsids Triceratops and Torosaurus, hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus, ankylosaurid Ankylosaurus, pachycephalosaurian Pachycephalosaurus, and the theropods Ornithomimus, Troodon, and Tyrannosaurus. Thescelosaurus was also abundant in the Lance Formation. Toe bones from this genus are the most common finds after fossils of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, and {{it may have been the}} most common dinosaur there in life, if the Lance Formation had a preservational bias against small animals.|$|E
5|$|The typical prey {{consists}} of surface organisms such as small fish, squid, crustaceans and jellyfish. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, {{more than half}} the food items are zooplankton and the fish caught include small herring and sprats; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in vitamin A, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly Mediterranean sand eels. Petrels also catch opossum shrimps from waters close to the colony. Bluefin tuna farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including <b>angiosperm</b> seeds and sorrel, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.|$|E
