5|$|At 13:30 Gay {{ordered the}} 8th Cavalry Regiment to {{withdraw}} its men off Ka-san. Gay {{believed he had}} insufficient forces to secure <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> and that the North Koreans had insufficient ammunition to exploit its possession as an observation point for directing artillery and mortar fire. However, Holley could not reach anyone in D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor security screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the Washington Monument {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it.</b> Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E
5|$|As Corporal Bill Taylor of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, {{the player}} starts off by playing {{a part in}} D-Day, at the assault of Pointe du Hoc, to destroy a German {{artillery}} battery, <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> against a massive German counter-offensive in the following mission. Soon after, the player captures a nearby town {{and serves as a}} sniper against mortar crews until reinforcements arrive. The second objective is focused on Hill 400, involving the capture of Bergstein, a disastrous charge at Hill 400's bunkers and the defense against the German counterattack, with the player again performing sniper work against German mortar teams, destroying enemy armor, and generally holding the hill against the counter-offensive, all the while burdened by artillery and overwhelming numbers of German soldiers. The final mission is set amongst the Americans in the Rhine River crossing into Germany. It begins {{as one of the few}} missions with the player immediately under fire, providing cover fire against the Germans until reaching the river banks and then fighting through most of the town. The final fight has the player defeat two German Tiger I's.|$|E

5|$|Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00, E Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment, {{arrived on}} top of Hill 755 and came into D Company's perimeter. North Korean fire, killing several of the porters, turned it back. Shortly after the E Company platoon joined Vandygriff, the North Koreans {{attacked}} again unsuccessfully. The American units, out of ammunition, relied on captured North Korean equipment. At 13:30 Gay ordered the 8th Cavalry Regiment to withdraw its men off Ka-san. Gay believed he had insufficient forces to secure <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> and that the North Koreans had insufficient ammunition to exploit its possession as an observation point for directing artillery and mortar fire. Rain started falling again and heavy fog closed in on the mountain top and severely reduced visibility there. Again the North Koreans attacked as the final units began their withdrawal. When all remaining members of D Company had been assembled, Holley found {{that the company had}} suffered 50 percent casualties; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action.|$|E

25|$|Another technology, {{which was}} designed, proven mathematically, peer-reviewed, and patented, but is, as of May 2015, unbuilt, is magnetodynamic {{suspension}} (MDS).

25|$|While hunting boar or bears, the Englische Dogge was a catch dog used {{after the}} other hunting dogs to seize the bear or boar <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> in place until the huntsman was able to kill it. When the hunting customs changed, {{particularly}} because {{of the use of}} firearms, many of the involved dog types disappeared. The Englische Dogge became rare, and was kept only as a dog of hobby or luxury.|$|E

25|$|Borzois {{are born}} with {{specialized}} coursing skills, but these are {{quite different from the}} dog-fighting instincts seen in some breeds. It is quite common for borzois at play to course (i.e., run down) another dog, seize it by the neck <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> immobile. Young pups do this with their littermates, trading off as to who is the prey. It is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Günzburg on 9 October 1805 saw General of Division Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher's French {{division}} {{attempt to}} seize a crossing over the Danube River at Günzburg {{in the face}} of a Habsburg Austrian army led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Mack von Lieberich. Malher's division managed to capture a bridge <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> against Austrian counterattacks. The battle occurred during the War of the Third Coalition, part of the larger Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack consists of strips of either metal or plastic that mold to one's back {{to provide a}} good fit, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. Usually a complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> in place. The close fitting of the back section to the wearer's back allows the pack to be closely attached to the body, and gives a predictable movement of the load. The {{internal frame}} backpack was invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, the founder of Lowepro.|$|E

25|$|Even at Second Ypres, Germany, still {{unsure of}} the weapon's effectiveness, only issued {{breathing}} masks to the engineers handling the gas. At Ypres a Canadian medical officer, {{who was also a}} chemist, quickly identified the gas as chlorine and recommended that the troops urinate on a cloth <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> over their mouth and nose. The first official equipment issued was similarly crude; a pad of material, usually impregnated with a chemical, tied over the lower face. To protect the eyes from tear gas, soldiers were issued with gas goggles.|$|E
25|$|The Boxer {{is part of}} the Molosser dog group, {{developed}} in Germany in the late 19th century from the now extinct Bullenbeisser, a dog of Mastiff descent, and Bulldogs brought in from Great Britain. The Bullenbeisser had been working as a hunting dog for centuries, employed in the pursuit of bear, wild boar, and deer. Its task was to seize the prey <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> until the hunters arrived. In later years, faster dogs were favored and a smaller Bullenbeisser was bred in Brabant, in northern Belgium. It is generally accepted that the Brabanter Bullenbeisser was a direct ancestor of today's Boxer.|$|E
25|$|Rescue {{requires}} a competent diver on site {{to recover the}} unconscious diver to the surface, or prevent them from sinking {{in the case of}} a surface blackout. This requires that the safety diver is aware of the status of the diver in time to react effectively. The unconscious freediver should be brought to the surface with minimum delay. There is no risk of lung over-pressure injury, and the airway should be secured if possible to prevent aspiration. The mask is adequate protection of the nasal passages if in place, and a hand can be used to cover the mouth <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> closed.|$|E

25|$|Acoma pottery {{dates back}} to more than 1,000 years ago. Dense local clay, dug up at a nearby site, is {{essential}} to Acoma pottery. The clay is dried and strengthened {{by the addition of}} pulverized pottery shards. The pieces then are shaped, painted, and fired. Geometric patterns, thunderbirds, and rainbows are traditional designs, which are applied with the spike of a yucca. Upon completion, a potter would lightly strike the side of the pot, <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> to their ear. If the pot does not ring, then the pot will crack during firing. If this was found, the piece would be destroyed and ground into shards for future use.|$|E
25|$|At about 1530 hours, Company Commander Lt. Timmermann {{was ordered}} to assault the bridge with his company {{in an effort to}} seize <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it.</b> Within five minutes Timmermann was leading his under-strength company dashing onto the bridge. Timmermann had {{designated}} half of his men to rush directly {{to the other side of}} the bridge to secure the east side of the bridge and to provide covering fire to the rest of the men. The other half swarmed the bridge and as they dodged machine gun fire, moving from bridge girder to girder, they cut wires and removed as many of the explosive charges as possible.|$|E
25|$|A {{person can}} have a high {{self-esteem}} <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> confidently where {{they do not need}} reassurance from others to maintain their positive self view, whereas others with defensive, high self-esteem may still report positive self-evaluations on the Rosenberg Scale, as all high self-esteem individuals do; however, their positive self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism. Defensive high self-esteem individuals internalize subconscious self-doubts and insecurities, causing them to react very negatively to any criticism they may receive. There is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth. The necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful, arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual's self-worth, an example of threatened egotism.|$|E
