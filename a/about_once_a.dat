5|$|Tolerance to {{psilocybin}} builds and dissipates quickly; ingesting psilocybin {{more than}} <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> week {{can lead to}} diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid the effect. A cross-tolerance can develop between psilocybin and the pharmacologically similar LSD, and between psilocybin and phenethylamines such as mescaline and DOM.|$|E
5|$|Safeties are {{the least}} common method of scoring in American {{football}} but are not rare occurrences– since 1932, a safety has occurred once every 14.31 games in the National Football League (NFL), or <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> week under current scheduling rules. On October 21, 1973, Fred Dryer, playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers, became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game. A much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety, which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt; those have occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996, most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. No conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the NFL. A conversion safety by the defense is also possible, though highly unlikely; although this has never occurred, {{it is the only}} possible way a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.|$|E

On March 30, 2011, Tuff TV has all but been dropped from WKOB. The PSIP still identified 42.4 as Tuff TV through late June, and <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> hour, a technical issue still exists where the Tuff TV audio can be heard for about two seconds when the new programming service briefly interrupts for station ID.|$|R

50|$|Ferries {{have run}} from Lymington to Yarmouth since the 19th century. Since 1990 {{they have been}} {{operated}} by Wightlink, successor to the once nationalised Sealink, on this route. The current fleet comprises three car ferries, which entered service in 2009: Wight Light, Wight Sky and Wight Sun. The service runs <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> hour from a dock south-east of the old town {{on the far side}} of the Lymington River.|$|R
50|$|The cave has {{scheduled}} tours <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> hour, conducted in Mandarin Chinese, usually with a megaphone, irrespective of group size, explaining {{in detail the}} origins of various formation names, such as a dragon eating a bear, or a bear catching a tiger. The tour cannot easily be walked independently of groups, since the lights inside the cave are closed behind the groups as they walk away. Signs are posted in both Chinese and English and takes typically 30-60 minutes.|$|R
50|$|In {{the age of}} steam, {{almost all}} trains had to be pushed up the ramp, which {{required}} good logistics at the station for the bank operation and the handling of faster and slower trains. The east-west operations on the line were always very busy for freight and passenger trains. After the electrification, the operations at the station were reduced {{by the loss of}} the bank engines. There was a train operation through the station <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> hour and the freight traffic towards Freiberg was still quite considerable until 1989.|$|R

In those early days, all of us depended upon the DUR as our transportation to and from Meadowbrook. The line ran from Detroit, out Grand River to Farmington, thence down Farmington Road to Base Line Road and out to Northville and Plymouth, where it turned around and retraced its tracks. The fare from Farmington to Northville (Meadowbrook) was five cents each way. The cars ran <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> hour. I lived just outside of Farmington.|$|R

Such events would seem to be spectacularly obvious, but they generally go unnoticed for a number of reasons: the majority of the Earth's surface is covered by water; a good portion of the land surface is uninhabited; and the explosions generally occur at relatively high altitude, resulting in a huge flash and thunderclap but no real damage.|$|E

The {{main road}} {{through the village}} is the B1348, which has been replaced as a trunk road by the parallel A12. The nearest railway station at Melton (2 miles; 3.2 km) offers trains between Ipswich and Lowestoft <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> hour on weekdays and once in two hours on Sundays. Passing through Ufford there are five daytime buses a day between Woodbridge and Framlingham on Mondays to Fridays, and regular daytime services between Aldeburgh and Ipswich on Mondays to Saturdays.|$|R

The men stopped <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> hour to smoke, drink cider, or rest. The woman worked steadily from morning till night, only pausing at noon {{for a bit of}} bread and the soup good Coste sent out to her. The men got two francs a day, the woman half a franc; and as nothing was taken out of it for wine or tobacco, her ten cents probably went further than their forty.|$|R
25|$|Playa Escobilla is {{considered}} to the sanctuary of the Olive Ridley turtle as {{a large number of}} these creatures arrive here to lay their eggs. It is a large green area where forest meets a lagoon. Canoe and guided tours are available to see the areas flora and fauna. The area also has a large organic farm which grows crops such as hibiscus flowers for sale, as well as a restaurant and cabins for rent. Tours generally end with visiting the turtle nests located on the beach. <b>About</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> month, up to thousands of turtles will arrive on these beaches to lay their eggs. After this occurs, there are releases of large numbers of baby turtles which have been guarded and incubated by the sanctuary volunteers.|$|E
25|$|When {{the project}} Norsk Data was without orders. Sales representatives were not {{appreciated}} {{in the company}} and were typically fired <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> year. The company's strategy was to create excellent products which could sell themselves. As the twenty-five {{people involved in the}} Nordic project were not required elsewhere, they were moved to the marketing department. It was first with this move that the company's management started realizing the importance of marketing. However, other non-technical departments, especially finances, had also not been keeping up with the company's growth. Kolbjørn Johansen was therefore hired as chief financial officer in 1969. The board decided on 18 October 1972 to replace Monrad-Krohn with Johansen as CEO, with the former becoming chair of the board. He would within a few years leave Norsk Data and establish Mycron and Tiki Data.|$|E
25|$|Fidler also {{submitted}} regular {{reports on}} {{the activity of the}} Radiation Laboratory to the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., and briefed him, on his visits to Berkeley, which were made <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> month between October 1942 and November 1943. As part of his role in coordinating the electromagnetic process, Fidler occasionally visited Chicago, which was more convenient for contractors like Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis Chalmers; Boston, where the offices of Stone & Webster, the main engineering contractor were located; and the production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He attained the rank of major. After World War II ended in August 1945, Fidler was transferred to Tennessee, where he worked on the declassification of Manhattan Project documents. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work on the Manhattan Project, which was presented by Groves at a ceremony at Lawrence's home on October 21, 1945.|$|E

50|$|Even in a free-flight area, {{air traffic}} control still {{requires}} <b>a</b> position report <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> hour. Flight planning systems organise this by inserting geographic waypoints at suitable intervals. For a jet aircraft, these intervals are 10 degrees of longitude for eastbound or westbound flights and 5 degrees of latitude for northbound or southbound flights. In free-flight areas, commercial aircraft normally follow a least-time-track so as to use as little time and fuel as possible. A great circle route would have the shortest ground distance, but is unlikely to have the shortest air distance, due {{to the effect of}} head or tail winds. A flight planning system may have to perform significant analysis to determine a good free-flight route.|$|R
25|$|After 1950 {{the country}} {{suffered}} economic disruptions <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> decade; {{the most serious}} crisis occurred in the late 1970s. In each case, an industry-led period of rapid expansion, marked by {{a sharp increase in}} imports, resulted in a balance of payments crisis. Devaluations of the Turkish lira and austerity programs designed to dampen domestic demand for foreign goods were implemented in accordance with International Monetary Fund guidelines. These measures usually led to sufficient improvement in the country's external accounts to make possible the resumption of loans to Turkey by foreign creditors. Although the military interventions of 1960 and 1971 were prompted in part by economic difficulties, after each intervention Turkish politicians boosted government spending, causing the economy to overheat. In the absence of serious structural reforms, Turkey ran chronic current account deficits usually financed by external borrowing that made the country's external debt rise from decade to decade, reaching by 1980 about US$16.2 billion, or more than one-quarter of annual gross domestic product. Debt-servicing costs in that year equaled 33 percent of exports of goods and services.|$|E

500|$|The {{line was}} {{recommended}} for closure by Dr. Richard Beeching in the 1963 Beeching Report, as {{in addition to}} its inconvenient location, it maintained fully manned staff at all stations despite low passenger numbers. Like several other lines threatened with closure, there was strong opposition, and the route survived because the nearby road network made it impractical to run a replacement bus service. The parallel main road from Hastings to Brenzett, the A259, had several level crossings over the line and a hairpin bend at Winchelsea, all of which remain as of the 21st century. At {{the same time as the}} Beeching Report was published, Arthur Irvine complained that a bus took an hour to travel the [...] between Rye and Ashford. The branch to New Romney closed on 6 March 1967, although since 1975 freight traffic has used the line as far as a nuclear flask loading and unloading point just outside Dungeness. This branch now sees flask trains <b>about</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> week. Very occasional passenger services are run for rail enthuasists; as of 2008 the former Lydd station was beginning to fall into disrepair. The branch to Rye Harbour was lifted at around the same time as the New Romney Branch's closure.|$|E
