One of the differences between an ES44AC and an ES44C4 are the air cylinders and linkages on the truck sideframes of the ES44C4; these are part of the traction control system. Every time a variation in grade, traction, or wheel slip occurs, the computer will <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> in these cylinders to maintain sufficient adhesion, by varying the weight on the drive axles.|$|E

50|$|A clothes-pin style clamp {{works like}} a common {{household}} clothes-pin — two short lengths of metal, joined by a spring to keep one end closed. This type often comes with screws to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure,</b> screwing in to release it.|$|E
40|$|We are {{developing}} new electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic systems for operating at non-atmospheric conditions. The first generation is a compact pressure chamber {{with an electric}} feed-through, enabling EWOD operation within a gaseous medium of well-controlled pressure and composition. EWOD performance is insensitive to chamber <b>pressure</b> because <b>the</b> chip is of open-channel architecture. We demonstrate {{two different types of}} previously unachievable processes – (i) controlling evaporation rates of common solvents (water, methanol, acetonitrile) by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of an inert gaseous medium (N 2), and (ii) controlling the reaction rate of a solid-liquid-gas-phase reaction by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of a gas-phase reagent (H 2) ...|$|R

50|$|Nitrogen, in {{the form}} of air, has been used in flashtubes in home made dye lasers, but the {{nitrogen}} and oxygen present form chemical reactions with the electrodes, and themselves, causing premature wear and the need to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> for each flash.|$|E
50|$|An Isoteniscope is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} the vapor {{pressure}} of liquids.

50|$|Hydrogen {{is used in}} tubes {{used for}} very fast switching, e.g. some thyratrons, dekatrons, and krytrons, where very steep edges are required. The {{build-up}} and recovery times of hydrogen are much shorter than in other gases. Hydrogen thyratrons are usually hot-cathode. Hydrogen (and deuterium) {{can be stored in}} the tube {{in the form of a}} metal hydride, heated with an auxiliary filament; hydrogen by heating such storage element can be used to replenish cleaned-up gas, and even to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> as needed for a thyratron operation at a given voltage.|$|E
50|$|An {{abrasive}} flow machine normally {{includes two}} medium chambers equipped with hydraulic rams, a fixture for holding the workpiece, and a clamping system that holds {{all the components}} tightly together. Most machines allow for the loading {{of different types of}} abrasive medium, and include the capacity to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> used in extruding the medium through the workpiece. They may be manually operated, or automated using CNC. For machines designed to accommodate high production volumes, accessories such as part-cleaning stations, unloading and reloading stations, media refeed devices, and media heat exchangers may be included.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} to insert this device is a technically straightforward endoscopic surgery {{with a low}} mortality rate (essentially 0% mortality since the 1970s). If the shunt has an adjustable valve the current method of setting the valve pressure is to choose one setting, observe the patient to see if CSF flow improves and the symptoms lessen over time, and <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> setting as needed if improvement isn't seen. For example, {{if there is not}} enough CSF flow, another surgery is performed to lower the valve pressure so that less force needs to be applied to open the valve and thereby drain more CSF.|$|E

50|$|Tubing with {{multiple}} lumens (holes) {{must be made}} for specialty applications. For these applications, the tooling is made by placing more than one mandrel {{in the center of}} the die, to produce the number of lumens necessary. In most cases, these mandrels are supplied with air pressure from different sources. In this way, the individual lumen sizes can be <b>adjusted</b> by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> to <b>the</b> individual mandrels.|$|R
50|$|Adaptive airbag {{systems may}} utilize {{multi-stage}} airbags to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> within the airbag. The greater the pressure within the airbag, the more force the airbag will exert on the occupants {{as they come}} in contact with it. These adjustments allow the system to deploy the airbag with a moderate force for most collisions; reserving the maximum force airbag only for the severest of collisions. Additional sensors to determine the location, weight or relative size of the occupants may also be used. Information regarding the occupants and the severity of the crash are used by the airbag control unit, to determine whether airbags should be suppressed or deployed, and if so, at various output levels.|$|E
5000|$|Air {{compressors}} {{are used}} in industrial, commercial, and home workshop environments to perform an assortment of jobs including blowing things clean; running air powered tools; and inflating things like tires, balls, etc. Regulators are often used to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> coming out of an air receiver (tank) to match what is needed for the task. Often, when one large compressor is used to supply compressed air for multiple uses (often referred to as [...] "shop air" [...] if built as a permanent installation of pipes throughout a building), additional regulators {{will be used to}} ensure that each separate tool or function receives the appropriate pressure it needs. This is important because some air tools, or uses for compressed air, require pressures that may cause damage to other tools or materials.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "cat's whisker", a springy {{piece of}} thin metal wire, formed the metal {{side of the}} junction. Phosphor bronze wire of about 30 gauge was {{commonly}} used because it had the optimal amount of springiness. It was mounted on an adjustable arm with an insulated handle so that the entire exposed surface of the crystal could be probed from many directions {{to find the most}} sensitive spot. Cat's whiskers in simple detectors were straight or curved, but most professional cat's whiskers had a coiled section in the middle that served as a spring. [...] The crystal required just the right gentle pressure by the wire; too much pressure caused the device to conduct in both directions. Precision detectors often used a metal needle instead of a cat's whisker, mounted on a thumbscrew-operated leaf spring to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> applied.|$|E
50|$|Waulis design {{describes}} a crank device and an adjusting device of a combustion engine. <b>The</b> system <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> cylinder <b>pressure</b> of <b>the</b> motor {{in accordance with}} the required power. Adjustment of <b>the</b> cylinder <b>pressure</b> is achieved by changing the compression ratio by means of <b>the</b> <b>adjusting</b> device. <b>The</b> <b>adjusting</b> device moves an eccentric wheel to a set position using an adjusting wheel; this results in the connecting rod moving the piston to a desired distance from the cylinder head. <b>The</b> <b>adjusting</b> device measures <b>the</b> volume of the air entering <b>the</b> cylinder and <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> compression ratio appropriately. <b>The</b> <b>adjusting</b> device also takes into account the speed of rotation to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> compression <b>pressure</b> accordingly.|$|R
50|$|Watermarks {{are created}} in the paper by special pieces of bent wire or bits, either {{attached}} to the mould or attached to the Dandy roll of machine-made paper. The watermark is inherently created differently by these two methods. In {{the case of the}} mould, the watermark is created by the settling of the fibers on the mould, thus creating the intentional thinning of the paper. In the case of the Dandy Roll, the watermark is pressed into the wet pulp. <b>The</b> papermaker closely <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>the</b> Dandy Roll exerts on the paper to ensure a proper impression of the watermark design into the paper. Too little <b>pressure</b> and <b>the</b> watermark may not be detectable.|$|R

50|$|The {{depth of}} the C-shaped frame is called the throat. The largest {{machines}} have throat sizes of 120 cm (48 inches), while smaller machines have throat sizes of about 60 cm (24 inches). The C stands vertically and {{is supported by a}} frame. The throat size usually determines the largest size of metal sheet that the operator can place in the machine and work easily. On some machines, the operator can turn the top wheel and anvil 90 degrees to the frame to increase the maximum size of the work piece. Because the machine works by an amount of pressure between the wheels through the material, and because that pressure changes as the material becomes thinner, the lower jaw and cradle of the frame that holds the anvil roller is adjustable. It may move with a hydraulic jack on machines designed for steel plate, or a jackscrew on machines designed for sheet metals. As the material thins, the operator must <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> to compensate.|$|E
50|$|The {{historically}} older open diving chamber, {{known as}} an open diving bell or wet bell, is in effect a compartment with an open bottom that contains a gas space above a free water surface, which allows divers to breathe underwater. The compartment may {{be large enough to}} fully accommodate the divers above the water, or may be smaller, and just accommodate head and shoulders. Internal air pressure is at the pressure of the free water surface, and varies accordingly with depth. The breathing gas supply for the open bell may be self-contained, or more usually, supplied from the surface via flexible hose, which may be combined with other hoses and cables as a bell umbilical. An open bell may also contain a breathing gas distribution panel with divers' umbilicals to supply divers with breathing gas during excursions from the bell, and an on-board emergency gas supply in high-pressure storage cylinders. This type of diving chamber can only be used underwater, as the internal gas pressure is directly proportional to the depth underwater, and raising or lowering the chamber {{is the only way to}} <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{the wind}} turbine nacelle is {{positioned}} on {{the tower and}} the yaw bearing assembly is completed {{it is necessary to}} <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the adjustable gliding bearing systems. These adjustable gliding bearings comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure distribution plate. In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (pre-tension) elements are located. The vertical position of the pressure plates is usually controlled by an adjustment screw. This adjustment screw presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure support plate, fixed on the bearing assembly with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw bearing arrangement is performing as anticipated.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRemote {{real-time}} {{control is}} currently the most advanced form of pressure management. Here the parameters describing pressure control valves (or pumps) are changed in real-time {{in such a way}} to provide the most optimal pressure in the water distribution system (mostly at the consumer location), as demand and reservoir levels change.
