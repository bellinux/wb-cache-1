In a typical procedure, Fe 3 O 4 particles were prepared {{by following the}} literature report. The Fe 3 O 4 was then modified by oleic acid under the sonication. A coal pitch layer was produced and polymerization {{on the surface of}} nano-Fe 3 O 4 at 573 K for 6 h under O 2 atmosphere and then carbonized at 773 K in flowing nitrogen. SO 3 H bearing multifunctional composites were finally prepared with sulfonation process in fuming sulfuric acid. The structure, morphology and ferromagnetic property of ferrite powders and composites were characterized by XPS, TEM, FTIR spectra and VSM, respectively. The advantages, including high <b>acidic</b> <b>concentration</b> and magnetically active, are potentially important for industrial applications of the Core-shell Structure Carbon Based Solid Sulfonic Acid as an efficient heterogeneous solid acid catalyst in the future...|$|E
40|$|Photoperiod-sensitive sorghum, as a {{competitive}} biomass for ethanol production, was investigated {{to develop an}} integrated process for improving ethanol yield. Response surface methodology was employed to study the relationship between pretreatment variables (including temperature, sulfuric acid concentration, and reaction time) and cellulose recovery, as well as efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis (EEH) in the solid part. Recovery yield decreased and EEH increased as the pretreatment temperature, <b>acidic</b> <b>concentration,</b> and reaction time increased. A model was successfully developed to predict total glucose yield with a maximum value of 82. 2 %. Conditions of co-fermentation were also optimized, and the optimal ethanol yield was obtained with constant-temperature simultaneous saccharification and fermentation at 38 °C. Acetate buffer at a concentration of 50 mM was found helpful for increasing efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis as well as ethanol yield. The maximum ethanol yield was 0. 21 g ethanol per dry mass at the conditions of 38 °C, 0. 05 g yeast/L, and 50 mM acetate buffer. A complete cellulose balance was provided for the whole process...|$|E
40|$|Cancer is a {{heterogeneous}} disease that {{represents one of}} the principal causes of mortality in developed countries. Due to the social and economic implications of this pathology, tremendous efforts have been making over the past decades to improve available therapeutic options to tackle this illness. Although a large number of potent chemotherapeutic agents have been identified and successfully used in clinical practice, the development of new anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs with higher antitumor efficacy and less toxicity remains as a research challenge. Current advances in the mechanistic understanding of the molecular drivers of malignancy have led to many anticancer drugs, which are targeted directly at the cancerous cells and not the neighbouring healthy cells. Thus, in order to enhance the efficacy of existing anticancer agents, several drug delivery approaches have been developed. Appropriately, ADCs strategy consists on bind determinate cell-killing drug to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) through a specific linker. Due to their high-binding specificity for tumor-specific antigens, mAb can be used as vehicles to target cell- killing payloads to tumor cells. Accordingly, two kinds of linkers are suitable to attach the payload to the antibody. On one hand, non-cleavable linkers afford and stable binding between the drug and the antibody, and alternatively, the drug could be released in the proximity or even inside of affected cells using cleavable linkers. Based on the potential of ADCs as prodrugs, our main goal is develop linkers, which could promote the drug release close to the affected tumor cells. Taking into account that connection between the antibody and the cytotoxic agent has significant effects on the selectivity, pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of the ADC an efficient binding is needed. Therefore, the properties of a successful linker can be split up into different modules that have been combined to form an effective bridge between the cytotoxic payload and the carrier antibody. In the present thesis, we focus on the development of new linkers for bioconjugation and more specifically for Antibody–Drug conjugates (ADCs). With this purpose in mind, a conscious design of the linkers for ADCs has to be done. In the present thesis, different cleavable (Chapter 1) and non-cleavable (Chapter 2) linkers are studied and it will be explained in detail along the thesis. As a consequence, the design has to be focused on linkers stables in systemic circulation. Additionally, cleavable linkers should be unstable in tumor cells environment, such as high concentration of glutathione, highest <b>acidic</b> <b>concentration,</b> and enzymatic cleavage, among others as above-mentioned. These conditions should allow, chemically or enzymatically, the release of the drug from the carrier (antibody- linker). On one hand, the systems studied in chapter I involve N-alkylated dialkylglycines and the tetrahydropyran moiety as cleavable Linkers. On the other hand in chapter II, the mesitylene ring and perfluoroarylated compounds were studied as non-cleavable linkers for bioconjugation. The present thesis include and extensive study regarding both cleavable and non-cleavable linker. Particularly, the preparation and chemical modification of the handles in order to test and optimize the bioconjugation step. Also an interesting study was carried out in order to determine how the bioconjugation step affect to the macromolecular entities. Specifically we focus on the conjugation to antibodies and how the covalent binding of the studied linkers affect to the antigen- antibody bind affinity. El cáncer está considerado como una de las principales causas de mortalidad a nivel mundial. Y ello conlleva elevados esfuerzos socio-económicos para tratar y curar esta enfermedad a pesar de disponer un amplio número de agentes anticancerígenos descritos, la obtención de nuevos agentes terapéuticos con mejor eficacia y menores efectos secundarios continua siendo a día de hoy, un reto científico a lograr. Con el fin de mejorar estos tratamientos, se han desarrollado diversos sistemas de liberación controlada de fármacos. Un ejemplo interesante son, los sistemas conocidos como ADCs (Antibody-Drug Conjugates) que consisten en la unión de un fármaco a un anticuerpo para permitir direccionar el fármaco a célula diana. Dicha unión fármaco-anticuerpo se produce mediante un conector o linker que pueden ser no hidrolizables (Non-cleavable linkers) o hidrolizables (Cleavable Linkers). La presente tesis centra su objeto de estudio en el diseño de conectores tanto hidrolizables como no hidrolizables. En el primer capítulo de la presente Tesis se abordó la utilización de α, α-dialquilglicinas N-alquiladas como posibles conectores hidrolizables para bioconjugación. Este tipo de sistemas tipo 1, 4 -dicarbonílicos, presentan acidólisis de la amida del extremo C- terminal. Otro sistema estudiado como conector están basados en los enlaces tipo acetal, tioacetal y aminal sobre el anillo de tetrahidropirano. Fruto del estudio de el anillo de tetrahidropirano como conector, se estudio la aplicabilidad de este tipo de anillo como grupo protector del tiol de la cisteína para la síntesis de péptidos de fase sólida. En el segundo capitulo se abordó el estudio de conectores no hidrolizables con potencial aplicabilidad den bioconjugación. En primer lugar se estudiaron los compuestos aromáticos tipo mesitileno utilizando los precursores dibromados para la formación de tioeteres estables a partir de dos cisteínas en péptidos, proteínas y anticuerpos.

The effect of tributylphosphate (TBP) as co-solvent is investigated. According to experimental observations, water dragging to the IL phase increases with added TBP and/or acids. Acid extraction is found to be weak, however, for the four acids except for concentrated HNO 3 (> 3 M). Molecular dynamics simulations on model biphasic systems show that TBP is not surface active, but well dissolved in the IL. They also reveal the importance of HA acid model (either totally or half dissociated) and of the TBP content on acid extraction to the IL. Furthermore, they show that "the proton" can be extracted by TBP (H 3 O+(TBP) 3 "complex") without its A− conjugated base, via a cation transfer mechanism (BMI+ transfer to water). Experiments and simulations show that TBP plays an important role in the mutual solubility between water and ionic liquid, by different amounts, depending on the HA acid.

30|$|The {{adhesion}} {{process of}} the tooth substrates is a complex mechanism which involves the demineralization of the surface, micro-porosities formation, resin monomers infiltration, and a proper polymerization.

Considering each of these aforementioned factors, the acidic substance used for the experimental materials formulation was the HEMA-P, which has demonstrated satisfactory demineralization ability in a previous study; [11] after the primer’s application, the solvent was volatilized by air stream for 10 s, leading to the formation of a shiny layer over the substrate (a solvent-free pellicle was visually formed); lastly, the light source used was the same for all the materials evaluated.

The as-prepared catalysts with bimodal pore distribution not only possess relatively large pore and surface area, but exhibit high activity for ethylbenzene hydrogenation even in the presence of thiophene up to 640 ppm. It is evident that nickel oxide particles are small and well-dispersed on the surface of these catalysts from X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. The results of temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H- 2 -TPR), temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen and ammonia (H- 2 and NH 3 -TPD) also strongly suggest the interaction between Ni component and HPW takes place, and consequently results in remarkable H- 2 spillover and considerable increase of <b>acidic</b> site <b>concentration</b> of Ni-HPW/SiO 2 catalysts.

Healthy Beagles (n= 15) and Pug dogs (n= 12) were also examined as controls. Interestingly, only Pug dogs with necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME) showed elevated serum GFAP concentrations (< 0. 01 to 1. 14 ng/ml), while other breeds of dogs with NME did not. Among the Pug dogs with NME, serum GFAP concentrations did not correlate with their clinical features, such as ages or survival times. Our data indicate the usefulness of serum GFAP as a novel marker for Pug dogs with NME. KEY WORDS: canine, glial fibrillary acidic protein, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, serum...|$|R
40|$|Cisplatin is {{a widely}} used {{chemotherapeutic}} agent. Here we show that cisplatin induces apoptosis in renal collecting duct-derived cells (MDCK-C 7 cells, resembling principal cells) in a dose-dependentmanner. Additionally, we studied the role ofmitochondria in this process by inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the F 1 Fo-ATP synthase or by uncoupling. The role of intra- and extracellular pH in apoptosis induction was investigated. Activa-tion of caspase- 3 and DNA ladder formation were used to monitor the apoptotic response. When cells were incubated with inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain or an inhibitor of the ATP-synthase, cisplatin-induced apoptosis was markedly enhanced. Mitochondrial blockade led to enhanced production of lactic acid. Also, anoxia potentiated the cisplatin-induced caspase- 3 activa-tion. Neither intra- nor extracellular pH had an influence on caspase- 3 activation at low cisplatin <b>concentrations.</b> <b>Acidic</b> con...|$|R
