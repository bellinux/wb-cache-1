25|$|A common {{method to}} achieve this is the self-consistent {{multiple}} scattering approach. One essential point in this approach {{is the assumption that}} the scattering properties of the surface, i.e. of the individual atoms, are known in detail. The main task then reduces to the determination of the effective wave field incident on the individual scatters present in the surface, where the effective field is the sum of the primary field and the field emitted from all the other atoms. This must be done in a self-consistent way, since the emitted field of an atom depends on the incident effective field upon it. Once the effective field incident on each atom is determined, the total field emitted from all atoms can be found and its <b>asymptotic</b> <b>value</b> far from the crystal then gives the desired intensities.|$|E
