5|$|Kennedy had {{initially}} opposed busing schoolchildren across racial lines, but grew {{to support the}} practice as it became a focal point of civil rights efforts. After federal judge W. Arthur Garrity ordered the Boston School Committee in 1974 to racially integrate Boston's public schools via busing, Kennedy made a surprise appearance at a September 1974 anti-busing rally in City Hall Plaza to express the need for peaceful dialogue and was met with extreme hostility. The predominantly white crowd yelled insults about his children and hurled tomatoes and eggs <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> retreated into the John F. Kennedy Federal Building and {{went so far as}} to push against one of its glass walls and break it.|$|E
5|$|It {{was a brief}} stint back in {{the playing}} squad, with Barton banned for six matches, with a further {{suspended}} six-match ban, for his assault on Dabo. After serving his ban, he played 75minutes in a reserve match and {{said he wanted to}} transform his image to become a role model, before he returned to action in the Tyne–Wear derby on 25 October. He was booed by Sunderland fans and had missiles thrown <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> warmed up, as Newcastle lost 2–1. Without him, Newcastle had not recorded a league victory since the second match of the season, but Barton scored a penalty in his second match back to lift the club out of the relegation zone. The suspended six-match ban was nearly brought into action when Barton appeared to flick Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor in the club's next match, but the FA decided not to punish Barton. However, further allegations that Barton had made a racist remark to Agbonlahor were cause enough for the FA to reconsider this decision. The remarks remain unfounded and 'professional lip-readers' claimed he said nothing racist. In Newcastle's 2–2 draw with Wigan on 15 November 2008, Barton was injured after a tackle from Lee Cattermole. It was later confirmed that Barton would be out for two months with a medial ligament injury. Returning to the first team at the end of January, he played only twice before again breaking his metatarsal, during a 2–1 defeat to his old club Manchester City.|$|E

Near Giessen in Hesse-Darmstadt he stole a bicycle. He passed Offenbach am Main. A German guard shot <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> crossed a bridge near Stuttgart in Württemberg. After this, short {{of food and}} water, Bryks fell ill with dysentery. He hid in a wood near Eberbach in Baden. There on 31 April a group of Hitler Youth captured him.|$|E

25|$|The poem {{is about}} a local blacksmith. Noted as being strong, he works by the sweat of his brow and does not owe anyone anything. Children coming home from school stop to stare <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> works, {{impressed}} by the roaring bellows and burning sparks. On Sundays, the blacksmith, a single father {{after the death of}} his wife, takes his children to church, where his daughter sings in the choir. He goes through his life following the daily tasks assigned to him and has earned his sleep at night. The narrator concludes by thanking the blacksmith for the lessons he can teach.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneers, {{playing with}} the goal of keeping the Kansas City Chiefs’ Wing-T offense on the bench as much as possible, held them to little more than half of their regular rushing average. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers’ offense had their most {{productive}} day ever, setting a team record with three fourth-quarter touchdowns. Jimmy DuBose ran for two touchdowns and Louis Carter for one, and Doug Williams threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Morris Owens. Kansas City was held to a pair of Jan Stenerud field goals for most of the game. A fourth-quarter Tony Adams pass was ruled a touchdown, although replays showed that receiver Henry Marshall failed to keep both of his feet inbounds. Richard Wood was given much of the credit for stifling the Chiefs’ league-leading rushing attack. Wood correctly expected that Chiefs offensive coordinator Tom Pagna would run the offense straight <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did when Wood played at USC and Pagna coached at Notre Dame. Pagna assumed incorrectly that the undersized Wood would be overpowered, but Wood instead responded by making 12 tackles. This was the Buccaneers’ third consecutive road win, and came one day after the Kansas City Royals were eliminated from the American League pennant race.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Cruise enters the closet is {{referenced}} in the South Park {{segment of the}} opening of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 27, 2006, in which Conan O'Brien is {{trying to get to the}} show, but suddenly appears in Stan's room in an animated form. Stan begins yelling <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> runs into the nearby closet. Immediately following the entrance, he exits the closet and says, [...] "There's someone else in there", referring to Cruise, and leaves the door open. Cruise then pops out and closes the door.|$|E

500|$|Underwater for hours, {{sometimes}} {{near the}} seabottom, McCain surfaced; Japanese escorts fired shells <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{stood on the}} bridge, while he fired torpedoes back, striking and sinking one (originally {{thought to be a}} destroyer, it was the coastal minesweeper Tsubame). [...] McCain dove again and the Japanese ships continued in sonar-based pursuit. [...] After a total of 36 hours, nearly all spent underwater, Gunnels batteries were about to fail and the air was very hot and virtually unbreathable. [...] McCain surfaced in battle stations position, ready to engage in a disadvantageous gun battle with the Japanese pursuers, but they were heading in the opposite direction {{and he was able to}} escape.|$|E
500|$|Only {{three weeks}} before the voter {{referendum}} in Dade County, a state gay rights law to protect homosexuals from discrimination in employment, public services, and housing in Minnesota was defeated. The loss was {{due in large part to}} the efforts of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, and once more, caught gay activists completely by surprise. The Twin Cities' gay community was much more active than Miami's; both Minneapolis and St. Paul had passed gay rights laws three years before. State senator Allan Spear—the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the U.S.—served in St. Paul. Spear called it a [...] "victory for bigots" [...] on the senate floor, then went into his office and cried. A group of guerrilla activists struck Archbishop John Roach a week after the vote by throwing a chocolate cream pie <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke to receive the National Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews.|$|E
500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out {{in an interview that}} the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E

2500|$|As Sparks and Daniels {{called in}} the arrest from an area patrol box, they were {{approached}} by Private Alonzo Edwards. Edwards offered to take custody of Travers, but was pistol-whipped repeatedly by Sparks and then arrested. Later that afternoon, Corporal Charles Baltimore approached Sparks and Daniels {{in the same neighborhood}} to inquire about the status of Edwards. Sparks struck Baltimore with his pistol and fired three shots <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> fled into a nearby home. Sparks and Daniels pursued Baltimore, eventually finding him under a bed. They pulled him out, beat him, and placed him under arrest.|$|E
2500|$|Within a {{week after}} the arrival of troops, the Findlay, Strong, Elkton, Tornado, Thompson, Ajax, Shurtloff, and Golden Cycle mines began {{operations}} again, and recruited replacement workers brought in from outside the district. The mine owners recruited from surrounding states, not telling potential miners that there was a strike. When they arrived and learned of the strike, some were [...] "practically forced" [...] to go to work. Emil Peterson, a worker recruited from Duluth, ran when he realized the purpose of the military escort. Lieutenant Hartung fired a pistol <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> ran. A warrant for the lieutenant was ignored by the military officers.p.102 ...|$|E
2500|$|He further {{testified that}} the Dujail attack was [...] "part {{of a series of}} attacks and {{assassination}} attempts by this group, including against me." [...] He said that in 1980, Dawa Party insurgents threw a grenade <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> visited a Baghdad university, killing civilians around him. [...] "I'm a victim of a criminal act conducted by this party, which is in power right now. So put it on trial. Its leader was the prime minister and his deputy is the prime minister right now and they killed innocent Iraqis in 1980," [...] he said. The Dawa Party is now a party in the Shiite coalition that dominates the Iraqi government. The party's leader, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, was prime minister until mid-May, when another leading Dawa Party figure, Nouri al-Maliki, was picked {{and he was able to}} form a new government before the end of May 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Rainville enlisted Cpl. Ben Klick of the PPCLI {{to lie in}} a truckbed at night, {{awaiting}} potential [...] "saboteurs" [...] with a C3A1 rifle. From his position, {{he watched}} two Somalis, Ahmed Arush and Abdi Hunde Bei Sabrie, approach the food and water. Fifteen minutes after first noticing the pair, the thieves began to run from the base in fear they had been noticed; Rainville yelled at them to [...] "stop", and called to Sgt. Plante, Cpl. King and Cpl. Favasoli to [...] "get them". Plante fired with his shotgun, while King fired with his C7; Plante's shot wounded Sabrie, who fell to the ground, while Arush kept running back towards the roadway. Cpl Leclerc and MCpl Countway both shot <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> ran, while Cpl. Klick refrained, noting that the man presented no risk to Canadian forces. Arush fell to the ground, hit {{by one of the}} two men's shots. He struggled to stand up, but both men fired again, killing him.|$|E
2500|$|Nik Wallenda {{was born}} in Sarasota, Florida, on January 24, 1979, to Delilah Wallenda and Terry Troffer. At age two, his parents bought him a swing set. [...] Before Troffer had even {{finished}} assembling it, Wallenda climbed up to the crossbar and did a somersault. [...] "And he did it perfectly," [...] Troffer recalls. [...] "I didn't teach him that." [...] Around the same time, he began performing {{with his family in}} their circus act. Wallenda's first public performance, dressed as a clown, was at SeaWorld San Diego in 1981. [...] He began to play on the wire at age two, walking back and forth while holding his mother's hand. At age four, he starting walking the wire on his own, learning primarily from his father. As a child, he would play on his parent's practice wire with his older sister Lijana, two feet (0.6 m) off the ground. [...] Wallenda's parents would throw objects <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> practiced, and even shot him with a BB gun, to train him to deal with distractions. At age six, he first visited Niagara Falls and immediately decided that one day he wanted to walk a tightrope across it. [...] He spent most of his youth on the road, living in a mobile home as his parents performed across America. [...] However, Wallenda says there was never any family pressure to become a circus performer.|$|E
