40|$|In recent years, {{credit risk}} {{has played a}} key role in risk {{management}} issues. Practitioners, academics and regulators have been fully involved in the process of developing, studying and analysing credit risk models in order to find the elements which characterize a sound risk management system. In this paper we present an integrated model, based on a reduced pricing approach, for market and credit risk. Its main features are those of being mark to market and that the spread term structure by rating class is contingent on the seniority of debt within an arbitrage-free framework. We introduce issues such as, the integration of market and credit risk, the use of stochastic recovery rates and recovery by seniority. Moreover, we will characterise default risk by estimating migration risk through a "mortality rate", <b>actuarial</b> <b>based,</b> approach. The resultant probabilities will be the base for determining multi-period risk-neutral transition probability that allow pricing of risky debt in the trading and banking book. ...|$|R

Mathematical and actuarial models can be considered as management tools to understand the dynamical behavior, predict the risk, and compute it. This study is an attempt to develop conceptual model to investigate {{the economic}} burden due to seasonal influenza. The compartment SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model is used to capture the dynamical behavior of influenza. Considering the current investment and future medical care expenditure as premium payment and benefit (claim), respectively, the insurance and <b>actuarial</b> <b>based</b> conceptual model is proposed to model the present economic burden due to the spread of influenza. Simulation is carried out to demonstrate the variation of the present economic burden with respect to model parameters. The sensitivity of the present economic burden is studied with respect to the risk of disease spread. The basic reproduction is used to identify the risk of disease spread. Impact of the seasonality is studied by introducing the seasonally varying infection rate.

40|$|A core {{problem for}} {{knowledge}} representation and reasoning (KRR) systems is to infer from a knowledge base Γ which properties are true {{for a given}} individual object o. Classical and non-monotonic logics are suitable for such inference when Γ contains only non-probabilistic information. Alternately, Bayesian reasoning can be used if Γ contains sufficient information about a single joint distribution, or perhaps a convex set of distributions.

40|$|Risk {{and needs}} {{assessments}} are <b>actuarial</b> <b>based</b> instruments that aim to evaluate an (1) offender’s risks including {{the risk of}} reoffending, (2) criminogenic needs {{so they can be}} targeted in treatment and (3) offender responsivity inclusive of the learning style, motivation, abilities and strengths of the offender (Andrews, Bonta and Wormith, 2011, 735). Since 2006, looking to Western nations as exemplars, the HK Security Bureau’s policy initiatives have introduced a Risk and Needs Assessment Protocol for all local young offenders, and local adult offenders with sentences of two years and above. But one has to question how the policy transfer applies here in Hong Kong. What can Hong Kong’s criminal justice policy makers and practitioners adapt from research conducted in Canada and the United States? Is there anything HK officials can learn from other jurisdictions, both in terms of experiences implementing risk needs tools and the wider socio-cultural context under which such implementation takes place? This study has provided some preliminary answers to these questions through critical analysis and expert interviews. Subsequent analysis on the definition of risk and need under the HK CSD’s protocol outlined a further need for a definition of the responsivity principle. Concerns over the content of responsivity enhancement programs along with its effects on the voluntary participation of young offenders were also discussed in this analysis. Since the initial consultancy was commissioned by the CSD in 2002 to empirically develop and refine the protocol, a follow up study was much needed to suggest improvements. This study has served to fulfill this goal by suggesting improvements in addressing class, gender and racial disparity along with suggestions on operational excellence. Specifically, interviews with leading Canadian risk assessment experts including criminologists and practitioners highlighted four main challenges and three main lessons for HK CSD to examine (p. 57 - 58). Interviews with Hong Kong risk/needs assessment experts including criminologist and HK CSD practitioners help provide clarification on the risk/need assessment process and how rehabilitative programs operate. Additional analysis on the risk/need assessment instrument used in Hong Kong along with an examination of the questions used by assessors was subsequently conducted. The result challenges the CSD’s Risks and Needs Assessment and Management Protocol for Offenders as a “scientific and evidence based approach to prison management and offender rehabilitation” (CSD Booklet, 201, 3). This conclusion is based on the many social assumptions made on offenders found in the assessment tool and ambiguous design of questions used to evaluate criminogenic need. published_or_final_versionCriminologyMasterMaster of Social Science...|$|R

The prognosis for survival in cerebral palsy determines the financial provision made in cases that come to litigation. Issues of data quality and estimation methods are critical.

Only an <b>actuarial</b> analysis <b>based</b> on a standard life table of cases of cerebral palsy will enable a valid estimate of survival. Construction of the table requires a total cohort of cases of cerebral palsy with their date of birth. Each case must conform to a specified definition of the syndrome.

Estimating the probability of survival according to the severity of functional disability requires specific definitional criteria for each severity category and for those categories to be mutually exclusive.

Mathematical models have become important tools in analyzing transmission dynamics and measuring effectiveness of controlling strategies. In hope of further applying them to design insurance coverage against infectious diseases, the author makes an attempt to build a bridge between epidemiological modelling and <b>actuarial</b> mathematics. <b>Based</b> on classical compartment models of ordinary differential equation systems, {{the first part of this}} thesis is devoted to developing insurance policies among susceptible and infected participants and then formulating their financial obligations using actuarial notation.

The theory is later demonstrated to design insurance products for the Great Plague in Eyam and the SARS Epidemic in Hong Kong. In the second part, the thesis also investigates a stochastic model by incorporating the theory of comonotonicity and copulas. The idea of approximating a random vector indicating infectivity levels is developed by two approaches.

Few {{studies have reported}} 10 -year actual survival rates following hepatic resection; instead, most have used <b>actuarial</b> measures <b>based</b> on the Kaplan–Meier method. This systematic review aims to document 10 -year actual survival rates and to identify factors significant in determining prognosis. MethodsA comprehensive search was undertaken of MEDLINE and EMBASE. Only studies reporting the absolute number of patients alive at 10 years after first resection for HCC were included; these figures were {{used to calculate the}} actual 10 -year survival rate. A qualitative review and analysis of the prognostic factors identified in the included studies were performed. ResultsFourteen studies, all of which were retrospective case series, including data on 4197 patients with HCC were analysed. Ten years following resection, 303 of these patients were alive. The 10 -year actual survival rate was 7. 2 %, whereas the actuarial survival quoted from the same studies was 26. 8 %. Positive prognostic factors included better hepatic function, a wider surgical margin and the absence of satellite lesions. ConclusionsThe actual long-term survival rate after resection of HCC is significantly inferior to reported actuarial survival rates. The Kaplan–Meier method of actuarial survival analysis tends to overestimate survival outcomes as a result of censorship of data and subgroup analysis...|$|R

Evidence is presented to support the idea that patients with a projected cone amplitude of 3. 5 mVor greater at age 40 (about 25 % of our patient population with typical retinitis pigmentosa) would be expected, on average, to retain some useful vision for their entire lives without treatment.

However, it is entirely possible that these assumptions are incorrect, and if they are, then all claimants who rely on the same set of actuarial multipliers will be affected.

K. life insurance industry provides an interesting environment in which to examine whether senior management uses accounting vs. projected cash-flow-based financial performance measures for both managerial performance evaluation and strategic budgetary planning and control purposes. A survey is employed to examine what economic and organizational factors could condition managerial propensity to use three alternative measures: traditional accounting-based measures, Economic Value Added (EVA) and multiperiod, <b>actuarial</b> cash flow <b>based</b> measures such as embedded value (EV). Survey evidence suggests that life insurance CEOs {{are more likely to}} use EV for strategic management planning and control purposes, and that this preference is strongly conditioned by the firm's ownership structure.

50|$|LEPs are {{typically}} {{made up of}} actuaries and medical underwriters who utilize <b>actuarial</b> models <b>based</b> on published or proprietary mortality (life) tables and medical underwriting based on various debits/credits for various morbidity characteristics similar to the medical underwriting performed by life insurance company underwriters and reinsurance underwriters. Until recently, {{the most commonly used}} mortality table was the 2001 Valuation Basic Table (VBT) published by the Society of Actuaries based on data supplied by contributing life insurance carriers. In 2008, the Society of Actuaries published a new table, the 2008 VBT, that is based on 695,000 lives representing $7.4 Trillion in death benefits which is almost 3 times more lives than the former 2001 VBT. Included with 2008 VBT are relative risk tables (RR Tables) that separate insured lives into various underwriting categories based on the health/morbidity of the insured at the time the policy was issued. Note that no impaired lives are included in any of the RR tables, but rather were designed for companies that subdivide their standard policies into more than one sub-class. Most LEPs have factored in the experience data underlying the 2008 VBT, as well as their own experience data and other factors, as a basis for their mortality tables. This resulted in a significant lengthening of average LEs {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008 for some LEPs. All major LEPs have continued the practice of developing and using proprietary and confidential mortality tables based on extensive medical research and mortality experience. One new LEP has adopted the use of the 2008 VBT RR Tables as a replacement for proprietary multipliers, despite the fact that Relative Risk Factors are in their infancy and not designed for impaired life nor life settlement underwriting.|$|R

However, because of the regime switching and the nonlinearity, {{it is virtually impossible to}} obtain closed-form or analytic solutions for our problems. Thus we are seeking numerical solutions by using Markov chain approximation methods. Focusing on numerical solutions of the regime-switching models in the area of <b>actuarial</b> science, and <b>based</b> on the theory of weak convergence of probability measures, the convergence of the approximating sequences is obtained. In fact, under very broad conditions, we prove that the sequences of approximating Markov chain, the cost functions, and the value functions all converge to that of the underlying original processes. The proofs are purely probabilistic. It need not appeal to regularity properties of or even explicitly use the Bellman equation. Moreover, the feasibility of regime-switching model and Markov chain approximation method are illustrated by the examples...|$|R
40|$|Long-term social {{security}} statistical forecasts produced and disseminated by the Brazilian government aim to provide accurate results {{that would serve}} as background information for optimal policy decisions. These forecasts are being used as support for the government's proposed pension reform that plans to radically change the Brazilian Constitution insofar as Social Security is concerned. However, the reliability of official results is uncertain since no systematic evaluation of these forecasts has ever been published by the Brazilian government or anyone else. This paper aims to present {{a study of the}} accuracy and methodology of the instruments used by the Brazilian government to carry out long-term <b>actuarial</b> forecasts. We <b>base</b> our research on an empirical and probabilistic analysis of the official models. Our empirical analysis shows that the long-term Social Security forecasts are systematically biased in the short term and have significant errors that render them meaningless in the long run. Moreover, the low level of transparency in the methods impaired the replication of results published by the Brazilian Government and the use of outdated data compromises forecast results. In the theoretical analysis, based on a mathematical modeling approach, we discuss the complexity and limitations of the macroeconomic forecast through the computation of confidence intervals. We demonstrate the problems related to error measurement inherent to any forecasting process. We then extend this exercise to the computation of confidence intervals for Social Security forecasts. This mathematical exercise raises questions about the degree of reliability of the Social Security forecasts...|$|R
