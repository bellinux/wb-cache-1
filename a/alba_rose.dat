50|$|David Charles Henshaw Austin OBE (born 16 February 1926) is a rose breeder {{and writer}} who lives in Shropshire, England.

5000|$|Rosa × alba {{plants are}} tall shrubs with arching stems and bluish-green leaves. They bloom only in mid summer. They are {{extremely}} cold hardy and disease resistant, hence {{they are used}} to create new varieties for subarctic climates like northern Scandinavia and Canada. These magnificent shrubs can withstand shade and semishade, and are easily found abandoned in semi wild situations. In Sweden and Finland the French bred 'Minette' has been considered a wild rose called R. × suonum (Mustialanrussu). The Mustiala rose belongs to the Finns' tradition of roses [...] "and is unknown outside the Nordic countries, although in 1819 it was bred in France". Found <b>alba</b> <b>roses</b> are very common in Germany; some may be local variations, but some could be old cultivars waiting to be renamed.|$|R
5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the <b>Alba</b> <b>roses,</b> which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|R

50|$|At {{the turn}} of the millennium, <b>Alba</b> Volán-FeVita <b>rose</b> to {{prominence}} to become the top team in the nation. This culminated in the series of 10 consecutive championship titles of the Hungarian league from 2003. This turn of domination persuaded the club seek application into the Austrian League for stronger competition. This happened against the background, to better expose the players of the national team in the A-group level. In their first EBEL season in 2007-08, Alba Volánbusz experienced to skill level difference and finished in last place, this was offset however, by the successful Hungarian national team inclusion at the 2008 IIHF World Championships after seventy years back promotion to the highest international division.|$|R
5000|$|Rosa × <b>alba,</b> {{the white}} <b>rose</b> of York, is a hybrid rose of unknown {{parentage}} {{that has been}} cultivated in Europe since ancient times. It may have originally been grown mainly for the sweet scent of the flowers, but is now also used as a winter-hardy garden shrub. Cultivated forms have white or pink flowers, and most have many petals. Hybrid cultivars have also been produced with red or yellow flowers.|$|R
500|$|The {{utilitarian}} approach, classifying plants {{according to}} their medicinal properties, is exemplified {{by the work of}} Roman nobleman, scientist and historian, Pliny the Elder (29–79 CE) author of Naturalis historiae. [...] "Cultivars" [...] listed here are named after people, places or special plant characteristics. Most notable is the work of Dioscorides (ca.40–ca.90 CE) a Greek doctor who worked with the Roman army. His five-volume Materia Medica was a forerunner of the herbal which led to the modern pharmacopoeia. This work was endlessly plagiarised by later herbals including those printed between about 1470 and 1670 CE: it listed 600 to 1000 different kinds of plants including the cultigens Gallica, Centifolia, the rose of uncertain origin known as <b>Alba</b> and other <b>rose</b> cultivars grown by the Romans.|$|R
50|$|Despite her {{links with}} the Romanian Communist Party, Elisabeth {{was forced to leave}} the country after the {{proclamation}} of the Socialist Republic of Romania, on 30 December 1947. The new regime gave her three days to pack her belongings and the Elisabeta Palace was ransacked. However, before she went into exile, the princess had time to burn her archives in the domain of Banloc. On 12 January 1948 she left Romania with her sister Ileana aboard a special train provided by the Communists. The Scavani family accompanied them, but both princesses lost much of their property after being expelled from the country.Elisabeth settled firstly in Zurich and then in Cannes, at the Villa <b>Rose</b> <b>Alba.</b> In France, she met a handsome young seducer named Marc Favrat. Having fallen in love of the young man, the princess asked her cousin, Frederick, Prince of Hohenzollern, to bestow a title for him, but Frederick refused. The princess then decided to adopt her lover; which she did three months before her death. She died at her home on 14 November 1956.|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer&#x 2032;s disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder currently {{without an}} effective treatment. Impairment of memory is the initial and most significant symptom of AD. Memantine is the first novel class of AD medications acting on the glutaminergic system and produces symptomatic improvement in learning. Nootropic agents such as piracetam, aniracetam, and choline esterase inhibitors like donepezil {{are being used to}} improve memory, mood, and behavior, but the resulting side-effects associated with these agents have made their use limited. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of <b>Rose</b> <b>alba</b> (RA) on learning and memory in mice. Male Swiss albino mice (3 months old) weighing around 25 g were employed in the present investigation. Elevated plus-maze and passive-avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models, and diazepam-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. RA (100 and 200 mg/kg p. o.) was administered for eight successive days to the mice. Piracetam (200 mg/kg i. p.) was used as a standard nootropic agent. RA improved learning and memory of mice as indicated by decreased transfer-latency and increased step-down latency. RA significantly reversed the amnesia induced by diazepam (1 mg/kg, i. p.). The results indicate that the aqueous extract of calyces of RA might prove to be a useful memory restorative agent in the treatment of cognitive disorders...|$|R

The names are presented in a way that implies that they would have been familiar to fellow Romans. The [...] "cultivar" [...] names were mostly of one word and denoted the provenance of the cultivar (the geographical origin of the place where the plant selections were made). Writers up to the 15th century added little to this early work. In the Middle Ages the book of hours, early herbals, illuminated manuscripts and economic records indicate that plants grown by the Romans found their way into monastery gardens. For example, in 827 CE the following herbs were mentioned in the poem Hortulus by Walafrid Strabo as growing in the monastery garden of St Gallen in Switzerland: sage, rue, southernwood, wormwood, horehound, fennel, German iris, lovage, chervil, Madonna lily, opium poppy, clary, mint, betony, agrimony, catmint, radish, gallica rose, bottle gourd and melon. It seems likely that aromatic and culinary herbs were quite widespread and similar lists of plants occur in records of plants grown in Villa gardens at the time of Charlemagne (742-814 CE).|$|R
