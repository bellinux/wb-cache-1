2500|$|In May 2007, SAA {{launched}} an 18-month comprehensive restructuring programme which aimed {{to make the}} airline profitable. According to then-CEO Khaya Ngqula, this came largely after [...] "uncompetitive ownership and <b>aircraft</b> <b>lease</b> costs, excessive head count and fuel price volatility". The programme involves: the spin-off of businesses into seven subsidiaries, thereby allowing SAA to concentrate on its core business of passenger and cargo transport; grounding SAA's Boeing 747–400 fleet; rationalising international routes (Paris was dropped altogether); the axing of 30% of the airline's managers; among other reductions. This was expected to save the airline R2.7billion (US$378.2million). By June 2009, R2.5billion had been saved.|$|E
