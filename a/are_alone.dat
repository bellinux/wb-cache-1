5|$|Fruit, {{fish and}} wild pigs provide {{plentiful}} food, {{and at first}} the boys' life on the island is idyllic. They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions: a broken telescope, an iron-bound oar, and a small axe. Their first contact with other humans comes after several months when they observe two large outrigger canoes in the distance, one pursued by the other. The two groups of Polynesians disembark {{on the beach and}} engage in battle; the victors take fifteen prisoners, and kill and eat one immediately. But when they threaten to kill one of the three women captured, along with two children, the boys intervene to defeat the pursuers, earning them the gratitude of the chief, Tararo.

5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor {{importance}} as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi <b>are</b> <b>alone</b> often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years.|$|E

25|$|Die {{deterioration}} doubling is {{a result}} of a few simple causes, but {{it can be difficult to}} positively identify. There are a number of different features which appear similar, but the characteristic traits of each are easy to identify with practice. Die deterioration doubling is often mistaken for hub doubling. The causes of the two types of doubling are different, but their appearance on the finished coin is often similar. Die deterioration doubling appears most often around the mintmark and date because they <b>are</b> <b>alone</b> in the field. When it occurs in other features, like an image of a bust, it looks more like a weak strike than doubling.|$|E

25|$|The Beard is a notably {{controversial}} modern play, that {{explores the}} nature of seduction and attraction, as it portrays an explosive confrontation between two legendary figures, Jean Harlow, the platinum blonde movie star, and Billy the Kid, the baby-faced outlaw with a hair trigger.
