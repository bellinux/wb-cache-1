They extended the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the time coordinate has to be modified as well ("local time"). Henri Poincaré gave a physical interpretation to local time (to first order in v/c, the relative velocity of the two reference frames normalized to the speed of light) as the consequence of clock synchronization, {{under the assumption that}} the speed of light is constant in moving frames. Larmor is credited to have been the first to understand the crucial time dilation property inherent in his equations.|$|E

After a few more days, he was told by the Saudi deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Omar Saqqaff, that the Saudis would not accept any attempt by Egypt to leave security forces after their withdrawal. Saudi Arabia had already been cutting back on its support to the royalists, in part because Egypt's projected plan for unity with Syria and Iraq made Nasser seem too dangerous. By that time, the war cost Egypt $1,000,000 a day and nearly 5,000 casualties.

500|$|Two other {{participants}} were profoundly affected. Firstly, Knicks center Darrall Imhoff was branded as {{the player who}} let Chamberlain score 100 on him, although he only played 20 of 48minutes and {{was not on the}} court when it happened. On the other hand, the game immortalized little-used Warriors reserve player Joe Ruklick as the man who gave Chamberlain the 100-point assist. Decades later, The New York Times interviewed Ruklick <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> he refers to himself as [...] "a walking footnote" [...] of one of basketball's greatest moments. The game also produced the famous picture of Chamberlain sitting on a bench, holding up a paper with a scribbled [...] "100". The photograph was actually a matter of improvisation: when Warriors PR manager Harvey Pollack entered the Warriors locker room, he took a paper and scribbled the number on it, and Associated Press photographer Paul Vathis who was there at the game (not for professional reasons, but rather because he wanted to give his son a treat) took the now-famous photo. Cherry calls it the [...] "ultimate picture" [...] of Wilt Chamberlain.|$|E
500|$|Darren was {{initially}} characterised as a [...] "bad boy" [...] who has matured throughout his tenure.

Darren later helped his father, Jack (Jimmy McKenna), to fake his own death {{as part of a}} scam, which drew comparisons to the John Darwin disappearance case. Other storylines have included a relationship with Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring), a [...] "shotgun" [...] marriage to Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) and a brief affair with his mother-in-law, Suzanne Ashworth (Suzanne Hall). More recently Darren's storylines have seen him form a relationship with Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) that [...] "came out of nowhere" [...] but was kept long term as the pairing was popular with the serial's audience. Pressure was then put on Darren and Nancy's relationship when Suzanne returned pregnant with Darren's twins, leading to Darren and Nancy splitting up when he became a father.

After Locke and Jack begin to plan a rescue mission for Walt, they realize that they need more guns, and go to Sawyer, who realizes that Ana Lucia has stolen his. Elsewhere, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) has planned a romantic picnic for himself and Libby, but Hurley gets lost and leads them back to the survivors' beach. There, he realizes that he forgot to pack a blanket and Libby offers {{to go back to the}} hatch to retrieve one. She also suggests that Hurley ask Rose and Bernard for some wine for the picnic, a suggestion that Hurley is delighted to hear. Meanwhile, back in the hatch, Michael asks Ana Lucia what is going on and she explains a few things: Sawyer has all the guns, Jack, Locke, and Kate left to get the guns, and they currently have one of the Others, Henry, in captivity inside the armory. She mentions that Henry tried to kill her earlier in the day and that although she was about to kill Henry, she was not able to pull the trigger. Michael offers to do it, but after she hands him the gun he turns around and shoots her dead. Libby walks in with the blankets and startles Michael causing him to shoot her too. Michael then walks into the armory where Henry is being held. Instead of shooting Henry, Michael shoots himself in the arm.|$|E
