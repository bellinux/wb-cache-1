500|$|The episode guest starred Beth Grant, Steve Seagren, and Gary Weeks. Grant {{would later}} reprise her {{character}} in the ninth season episode [...] "Junior Salesman". Grant was asked {{to appear in the}} episode after Daniels saw her performance in the 2007 film No Country for Old Men. Grant praised Carell's improvisational skills—noting that [...] "he just keeps going off script [...] is channeling something"—as well as Wilson's humorous antics while acting. She concluded that [...] "if they had wanted a crazy, wild feature film using all the comedy that I saw in just those few days, you could <b>absolutely</b> <b>have</b> had one" [...] with their acting.|$|E
500|$|The {{race was}} {{originally}} sponsored by Donald Trump and {{known as the}} [...] "Tour de Trump" [...] in 1989 and 1990. The idea for the race was conceived by CBS Sports reporter John Tesh, who had covered the 1987 Tour de France and on his return suggested holding a race in the United States to the basketball commentator and entrepreneur Billy Packer. Packer originally planned to call the race the Tour de Jersey. He approached representatives of casinos in Atlantic City for sponsorship, and Trump offered to be the race's primary sponsor and Packer's business partner in the venture. It was Packer who suggested the Tour de Trump name. Speaking {{at the time of}} the start of the first Tour de Trump in May 1989, Trump himself stated that [...] "When [...] was initially stated, I practically fell out of my seat. I said, 'Are you kidding? I will get killed in the media if I use that name. You <b>absolutely</b> <b>have</b> to be kidding'". However, Trump reportedly changed his mind within 20 seconds, and was convinced by the commercial value of the name.|$|E

2500|$|A snow {{emergency}} {{was declared}} for Washington, D.C., meaning that residents {{would not be}} allowed to park on snow emergency routes after 9:30p.m. local time on January22. Mayor Bowser urged people to remain home during the storm, [...] "nless you <b>absolutely</b> <b>have</b> to be out tomorrow afternoon , residents should get home as soon as possible". Across Maryland, 2,700pieces of snow equipment were mobilized and crews planned to distribute 365,000tons of road salt. In Virginia, 500vehicles were deployed to treat roads and 500members of the Virginia National Guard were placed on standby. Schools across the D.C. area were scheduled to end classes early on January22, before the storm's arrival. Stores across Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. reported a substantial uptick in sales, with groceries, heaters, shovels, and similar items sold out in numerous locations. West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin mobilized the state's National Guard on January21.|$|E

60|$|This {{happened}} during the second week in May. On his return to London {{he did not go}} down to Fulham, but remained at his chambers in a most unhappy frame of mind. This renewed attempt of his to enter the world and to go among men that he might do a man's work, had resulted in the loss of a great many hundred pounds, in absolute failure, and, as he wrongly told himself, in personal disgrace.

He would take them on a little further, till they could look about them. I think I saw him also mentally confronted with the opportunity to deal--for once in his life--with some of his own dumb preferences, his limitations of sympathy, WEEDING a little in prospect and returning to a purer tradition. It was not unknown to me that he considered that toward the end of our host's career a certain laxity of selection had crept in.|$|E

Now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects that he dreams, the suspicion never fails to confirm itself, and the sleeper is almost immediately aroused. Thus Novalis errs not in saying that 'we are near waking when we dream that we dream.'

6000|$|It {{was only}} then that I {{understood}} the service Claude Rivet had rendered me; he had told them how I worked in black-and-white, for magazines, for story-books, for sketches of contemporary life, and consequently had copious employment for models.
