40|$|Introduction Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) {{is a serious}} problem for workers and {{therefore}} for businesses. The hearing conservation program (HCP) is a set of coordinated measures to prevent the development or evolution of occupational hearing loss, which involves a continuous and dynamic process of implementation of hearing conservation routines through anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and subsequent control of the occurrence of existing environmental risks or of those thatmay exist in the workplace and lead to workers hearing damage. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of the HCP in preventing further hearing loss in workers with audiograms suggestive of NIHL. The <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> and medical records of 28 furniture company workers exposed to noise were reviewed and monitored for 2 years. Methods This retrospective, cross-sectional study examined five <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> in the medical records (on admission and every semester) of 28 workers in a furniture company (totaling 140 audiometric exams) following the introduction of the HCP. Results Data analysis showed no differences between the <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> conducted on admission and those performed every semester. Conclusions The HCP implemented was effective in preventing the worsening of hearing loss in workers already with NIHL when exposed to occupational noise. Therefore, such a measure could be useful for the employment of workers with hearing loss in job sectors that have noise exposure...|$|R

50|$|Audiometers are {{standard}} equipment at ENT (ear, nose, throat) clinics and in audiology centers. An alternative to hardware audiometers are software audiometers, {{which are available}} in many different configurations.Screening PC-based audiometers use a standard computer.Clinical PC-based audiometers are generally more expensive than software audiometers, but are much more accurate and efficient. They are most commonly used in hospitals, audiology centers and research communities.

50|$|In {{conjunction}} with <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing,</b> OAE testing {{can be completed}} to determine changes in the responses. Studies have found that exposure to noise can cause a decline in OAE responses. In a study, industrial workers who were exposed 84.5 dBA of noise were compared to workers {{who were exposed to}} 53.2 dBA of noise by considering hearing thresholds and OAEs before and after 5 days of work. This study revealed that hearing thresholds and OAE results were significantly lower among the workers who were exposed to higher levels of noise.|$|E
50|$|An Exposure Action Value (EAV) or Action Value (AV) is a {{limit set}} on {{occupational}} exposure to noise where, when those values are exceeded, employers must take steps to monitor the exposure levels. These levels are measured in decibels. The American Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set the EAV to 85 dB(A). When the eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) reaches 85 dB(A), employers are required to administer a continuing, effective hearing conservation program. The program consists of monitoring, employee notification, observation, an <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing</b> program, hearing protectors, training programs, and record keeping requirements.|$|E

50|$|Another {{determination}} {{that is made}} includes whether an STS is “recordable” under OSHA standards, meaning the workplace must report the change to OSHA. In order to be recordable the employee’s new thresholds at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz must exceed an average of 25 dB HL. MSHA standard differs slightly in terms of calculation and terminology. MSHA considers whether an STS is “reportable” by determining if the average amount of change that occurs exceeds 25 dB HL. The various measures {{that are used in}} occupational <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing</b> allow consistency in standards within workplaces.

Twenty-four states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have OSHA-approved state plans and have adopted their own standards and enforcement policies. Most of these state standards are identical to those of federal OSHA. However, some states have adopted different standards or may have different enforcement policies. Most health and safety regulations are designed to keep damage risk within “acceptable limits” — that is, some people are likely to incur a hearing loss even when exposed to less than the maximum daily amount of noise specified in a regulation. Hearing conservation programs in other arenas (schools, military) have become more common, and it has been established that unsafe listening behaviors, such as listening to loud noise for extended periods of time without protection, persist despite knowledge of potential hearing loss effects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Hearing loss affects 31 million Americans, particu-larly {{veterans}} who {{were exposed to}} harmful levels of noise dur-ing military functions. Many veterans also receive treatment with ototoxic medications, which may exacerbate preexisting hearing loss.

Poor implementation of hearing protection programs and a lack of <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing</b> during medical treatment leave veterans vul-nerable to unrecognized and untreated hearing loss until speech communication is impaired. Individualized <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing</b> techniques, including assessment of high frequencies, can be used in clinical and occupational settings to detect early hearing loss.

The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the surgical success rate after stapes surgery by standard <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests,</b> Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE) and Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) as methods of evaluation of postoperative hearing. Methods: A descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 50 patients with otosclerosis at Yazd Shaheed Sadoughi Medical University from March 2004 till October 2007. TEOAE, DPOAE and other behavioral <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> were performed before, three months and six months after surgery on patients and results were compared. Results: The air-bone gap threshold decreased significantly in audiogram of patients after surgery. Prior to surgery, TEOAE and DPOAE responses were not recordable in any of the patients, but after surgery, they were recordable in only two patients. Conclusion: Although conductive hearing loss improved significantly in patients who underwent successful stapes surgery, OAE tests were recordable in an insignificant number of patients. Therefore, this is not an optimal method for evaluating the surgical success rate...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePure-tone {{audiometry}} (measurement {{of absolute}} thresholds using pure tones) {{is the main}} test for the diagnosis of hearing loss.

The HeadPhone Transfer Function (HPTF) describes both the headphone response and the coupling to a listener's ear.

To achieve tuning capabilities down to 1 Hz at 20 kHz and 15 Hz at 100 Hz, a fractional division of a 40 -MHz master clock based on noise-shaping techniques is performed. Moreover, for noise generation, a novel circuit based on pseudorandom sequences combined with analog switched-capacitor filters is used. The chip is fabricated in a 0. 8 -m CMOS process and occupies a 24. 2 -mm 2 silicon area. It consumes 45 mW from a single 5 -V power supply and achieves less than 90 -dB crosstalk between the channels. Index Terms—Audio systems, mixed analog–digital integrated circuits, signal synthesis.
