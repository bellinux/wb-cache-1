50|$|When {{a theory}} is {{symmetric}} {{with respect to}} a symmetry group, but requires that one element of the group <b>be</b> <b>distinct,</b> then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. The theory must not dictate which member <b>is</b> <b>distinct,</b> only that one is. From this point on, the theory can be treated as if this element actually <b>is</b> <b>distinct,</b> with the proviso that any results found in this way must be resymmetrized, by taking the average of each of the elements of the group being the distinct one.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two <b>are</b> <b>distinct</b> species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E
5|$|Another species {{analysed}} in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, {{also could}} not be distinguished from G.marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis as a distinct species. A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species <b>are</b> <b>distinct.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ants <b>are</b> <b>distinct</b> {{in their}} {{morphology}} from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, {{and a strong}} constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or {{the second and third}} abdominal segments).|$|E

Peru celebrates a yearly public holiday in honor of the cocktail during the first Saturday of February.|$|E
5|$|Erythranthe, the monkey-flowers and musk-flowers, is {{a diverse}} plant genus {{with at least}} 111 members (as of 2017) in the family Phrymaceae. Erythranthe was {{originally}} described as a separate genus, then generally regarded as a section within the genus Mimulus, and recently returned to generic rank. Mimulus sect. Diplacus was segregated from Mimulus as a separate genus at the same time. Mimulus remains as a small genus of eastern North America and the Southern Hemisphere. Molecular data show Erythranthe and Diplacus to be distinct evolutionary lines that <b>are</b> <b>distinct</b> from Mimulus as strictly defined.|$|E

Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.|$|E

Ramanuja interprets the Upanishadic literature to be teaching a body-soul theory, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, where the Brahman is the dweller in all things, yet also distinct and beyond all things, as the soul, the inner controller, the immortal. The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual souls {{to be of the}} same quality as the Brahman, but quantitatively they <b>are</b> <b>distinct.</b>|$|E
