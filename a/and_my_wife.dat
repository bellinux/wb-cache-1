Peter had been a slave of a Mr. Read in Charlotte County, a neighbor of John Randolph. He had been sold (apparently because of Read's debts) to a trader, leaving behind a wife and young daughter to work a cotton field for thirty-five years in Mississippi. When he was freed, Peter walked from Mississippi until he reached Abingdon in his quest to return home. Johnston wrote: [...] "It was evident to me <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that all our care could not rebuild that worn-out body, and that death was near at hand. He weakened rapidly ...

[...] "I can't regret the decision to go to war.

Reg Keys, whose son Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was [...] "just crocodile tears from Blair." [...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E

2500|$|The couple {{remained}} childless. When Sir Edward Bromley died in 1626, disputes {{about the}} inheritance {{of the family}} estates had already begun. The codicil to his will showed {{that he had been}} forced to sacrifice some of the lands he had intended as part of Lady Margaret's jointure to placate the Davenports, his great-niece and her husband, who were ultimately to acquire the main estate at Hallon, next to Worfield, after protracted litigation. As compensation, he left her all his moveable property, although he had originally intended to give her only the use of it during her life and the right to bequeath £400-worth in her own will. For everything not relating to the property dispute, Lady Margaret was appointed executrix. Sir Edward set aside £100 for a monument [...] "to be set up in Shifnall Church, or elsewhere, to me <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> Dame Margaret."
