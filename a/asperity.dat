25|$|Virtually all roads {{require some}} form of {{maintenance}} before {{they come to the}} end of their service life. Pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive maintenance treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads. Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial Profilometers. These measurements include road curvature, cross slope, <b>asperity,</b> roughness, rutting and texture. This data is fed into a pavement management system, which recommends the best maintenance or construction treatment to correct the damage that has occurred.|$|E
25|$|Static {{friction}} is {{friction between}} {{two or more}} solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise {{as the result of}} surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for {{only a fraction of the}} apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from <b>asperity</b> deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.|$|E
25|$|In the consistory of the Protestant {{church in}} Paris Guizot {{exercised}} a similar influence. His early education and his experience of life conspired {{to strengthen the}} convictions of a religious temperament. He remained throughout his life {{a firm believer in}} the truths of revelation, and a volume of Méditations on the Christian Religion was one of his latest works. But though he adhered inflexibly to the church of his fathers and combated the rationalist tendencies of the age, which seemed to threaten it with destruction, he retained not a tinge of the intolerance or <b>asperity</b> of the Calvinistic creed. He respected in the Church of Rome the faith of the majority of his countrymen, and the writings of the great Catholic prelates, Bossuet and Bourdaloue, were as familiar and as dear to him as those of his own persuasion, and were commonly used by him in the daily exercises of family worship.|$|E
50|$|An {{often used}} {{definition}} for <b>asperities</b> in geotechnical engineering:Unevenness of a surface are <b>asperities</b> if these cause dilation if two blocks with in between a discontinuity with matching <b>asperities</b> {{on the two}} opposing surfaces (i.e. a fitting discontinuity) move relative to each other, under low stress levels that do not cause breaking of the <b>asperities.</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Asperities</b> <b>Asperities</b> were {{selected}} as circular areas characterized by high slip amplitudes and high stress drops along the rupture surface. The number of <b>asperities</b> and their diameter, 0.2 to 0.8 times {{smaller than the}} main axis of the rupture, {{were selected}} randomly for each scenario.|$|R
25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the <b>asperity,</b> suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E

As an additional note Buckner paid for then Captain Grant's lodging in New York City after the Mexican War when Grant was destitute. Also Buckner acted as a pall bearer and paid for Grant's funeral and provided Grant's widow a financial monthly payment so she could live out her years. The surrender was a humiliation for Buckner personally, but also a strategic defeat for the Confederacy, which lost more than 12,000men and much equipment, as well as control of the Cumberland River, {{which led to the}} evacuation of Nashville.|$|E

[...] Like Sarcey, he commented with some <b>asperity</b> on the metaphorical use of Volsius and Ox as symbols of Good and Evil, rather than attractive young women playing Good and Bad Fairies: [...] "Is it not time, perhaps, to return to that practice?" [...] An anonymous reviewer for The New York Times said of the play: [...] "I have never seen anything more idiotically incoherent, or of which the dialogue is more pretentious," [...] but predicted {{that it would be a}} success because of its spectacular production values.

30|$|Knowledge of the {{locations}} of SMGAs and <b>asperities</b> is important in earthquake source modeling. By waveform inversion, Yamanaka and Kikuchi (2004) identified <b>asperities</b> along the subduction zone off northeastern Japan and showed {{that there have been}} repeated ruptures on some <b>asperities</b> in the Tohoku region. They concluded that the <b>asperities</b> for future earthquakes are likely to be in areas where slip was large during previous earthquakes. From another side, {{it is important to know}} the largest likely ground motion in areas of critical infrastructure (e.g., nuclear power plants, high-rise buildings), which is dependent on the distribution of SMGAs.|$|R
30|$|The {{depths of}} the M 9 - and M 7 -class <b>asperities</b> {{correspond}} to domains B and C of Lay et al. (2012), respectively (Figure 10 a). Domain B is a source region for large-slip earthquakes characterized by large seismic regions (<b>asperities),</b> whereas isolated patches (<b>asperities)</b> in domain C generate modest-slip earthquakes. These domains correspond to the low- and high-frequency radiation zones of Tajima and Kennett (2012), respectively. The bimodal depth distributions of thrust-type earthquakes in subduction zones (Pacheco et al. 1993) possibly reflect {{these two types of}} <b>asperities.</b> The high shear strength of deep seamounts is consistent with the strong seismic wave radiation observed in domain C.|$|R

More than half of the quake was produced from its southern segment of approximately , where the slip reached a maximum of up to [...] resulting in a large stress drop of at least 6 MPa. Optical remote sensing data shows that the Bam fault is not a single fault but consists of a 4–5km wide fault system with the main branch running between the cities of Bam and Baravat. The fault ruptured by the Bam earthquake is believed to stretch the along northwest branch of this fault system from Bam southward. Based on these results, scientists suggest that the Bam earthquake ruptured a hidden fault and that in this process an unusually strong <b>asperity</b> was involved, causing the widespread devastation of the tremor.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} whether the surface <b>asperities</b> detected with the transmission electron microscope in shavings of young adult articular cartilage detached from bone reflect an in vivo condition or are artefacts. With this in view shavings of rabbit articular cartilage processed in the conventional manner were compared with pieces of cartilage attached to bone processed by a new method which we have evolved. An undulating surface and <b>asperities</b> up to about 0. 3 micrometer deep were found in cartilage shavings processed in the conventional manner, but such <b>asperities</b> were not seen on cartilage processed attached to bone. We have therefore concluded that such <b>asperities</b> are artefactual and that they are engendered by cartilage curling. Cartilage processed attached to bone has an amazingly smooth surface; any so-called 'asperities' are less than 0. 03 micrometer in depth and are confined to the surface coat which seems to be of a transient nature. On rare occasions, however, focal areas of roughening were found, where the <b>asperities</b> reached a depth of about 0. 15 micrometer. Several past studies (reviewed in this paper) have shown that virtually all the <b>asperities</b> seen with the scanning electron microscope on the articular surface are artefacts of tissue processing. We have now shown that even most of the much smaller <b>asperities</b> seen with the transmission electron microscope are also artefacts. Therefore one has to conclude that the articular surface of young adults is remarkably smooth and that the surface <b>asperities</b> must be attributed to artefacts, ageing or pathological changes...|$|R

For a low normal force, only few <b>asperities</b> on the sample contact the upper and lower plates; therefore, a subtle change in the number of <b>asperities</b> in contact causes a fluctuation in the measured values. As the normal stress increases, the number of <b>asperities</b> in contact increases, and the measured data become smooth.|$|R

In the assembly process, it is primarily that the peaks on surface actually contact. The contact error plane equation is determined by three <b>asperities</b> which can stability support the other part, so three proper <b>asperities</b> should be searched out firstly.
