40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative mixing technology for centrifugal microfluidic platforms actuated using {{a specially designed}} flyball governor. The multilayer microfluidic disc was fabricated using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replica molding process with a soft lithography technique. The operational principle {{is based on the}} interaction between the elastic covering membrane and an <b>actuator</b> <b>pin</b> installed on the flyball governor system. The flyball governor was used as the transducer to convert the rotary motion into a reciprocating linear motion of the pin pressing against the covering membrane of the mixer chamber. When the rotation speed of the microfluidic disc was periodically altered, the mixing chamber was compressed and released accordingly. In this way, enhanced active mixing can be achieved with much better efficiency in comparison with diffusive mixing...|$|E
40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} for performing a mechanical release function exhibiting low shock. This system includes two pyrotechnic detents fixed mounted in opposing axial alignment within a cylindrical housing having two mechanical bellows. Two mechanical bellow assemblies, each having one end hermetically bonded to the housing {{and the other}} to the respective <b>actuator</b> <b>pin</b> extending from either end of the housing, ensure that all outgassing and contamination from the operation of the pyrotechnic devices will be contained within the housing and bellows. The pin {{on one end of the}} assembly is fixed mounted and supported, via a bolt or ball-and-socket joint so that when the charge corresponding to that pin ignites, the entire assembly will exhibit rectilinear movement, including the opposing pin providing the unlatching motion. The release detent pin is supported by a linear bearing and when its corresponding pyrotechnic charge ignites the pin is retracted within the housing producing the same unlatching motion without movement of the entire assembly, thus providing complete mechanical, electrical and pyrotechnic redundancy for the unlatching pin...|$|E

40|$|A {{design of}} a new tactile shape display {{to be used in}} Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) is presented. It {{consists}} of 32 micro brushless motors in a 4 -by- 8 configuration, and the total size is 27 mm * 20 mm * 18 mm. The main restrictive design parameter is the size of the display because it should be attached to a laparoscopic grasper. Another important design parameter is modularity, as it is desirable to do experiments with several <b>actuator</b> <b>pins.</b> Each <b>actuator</b> has 3 mm indentation and can provide 1. 7 N at a frequency of 2 Hz at full excursion.

40|$|The {{expense and}} use of {{non-recyclable}} materials often requires the retrieval and recovery of exploratory robots. Therefore, conventional materials such as plastics and metals in robotics can be limiting. For applications such as environmental monitoring, a fully biodegradable or edible robot may provide the optimum solution. Materials that provide power and actuation as well as biodegradability provide a compelling dimension to future robotic systems. To highlight the potential of novel biodegradable and edible materials as artificial muscles, the actuation of a biodegradable hydrogel was investigated. The fabricated gelatine based polymer gel was inexpensive, easy to handle, biodegradable and edible. The electro-mechanical performance was assessed using two contactless, parallel stainless steel electrodes immersed in 0. 1 M NaOH solution and fixed 40 mm apart with the strip <b>actuator</b> <b>pinned</b> directly between the electrodes. The actuation displacement {{in response to a}} bias voltage was measured over hydration/de-hydration cycles. Long term (11 days) and short term (1 hour) investigations demonstrated the bending behaviour of the swollen material in response to an electric field. Actuation voltage was low (< 10 V) resulting in a slow actuation response with large displacement angles (< 55 degrees). The stability of the immersed material decreased within the first hour due to swelling, however, was recovered on de-hydrating between actuations. The controlled degradation of biodegradable and edible artificial muscles could help to drive the development of environmentally friendly robotics. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|To {{return the}} feeling of touch to a surgeon during robot {{assisted}} minimally invasive surgery, a tactile display is necessary. Such a display usually consists of a large array of pins with challenging requirements for the <b>actuators</b> controlling the <b>pins.</b> A pneumatically controlled display has the advantage that the power can be generated at a distance, while the display itself is very simple. While {{this is not the}} first time pneumatics is used to actuate a tactile display, a satisfying valve has been missing. This valve is specifically designed to fill that gap. The presented valve is a proportional valve, controlled by a reluctance actuator and capable of dealing with relatively high pressures. To eliminate friction of the piston, an air bearing is included. A prototype offers a proof of concept, but it needs to be optimised to reach a full pressure range. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a controller for a tactile shape display for dexterous telemanipulation applications. This device consists of an array of pin elements which rest against the human finger tip. Shape memory alloy (SMA) wire <b>actuators</b> raise individual <b>pins</b> to approximate the desired surface shape on the skin. To overcome the slow response times of SMA actuators we have implemented a feedforward derivative compensator and pneumatic cooling. The hysteretic and nonlinear response of the SMA actuators required the use of a closed loop controller with position feedback using an optical emitter-receiver pair. This also improves robustness to the load variations which result from human interaction. 1 Introduction In teleoperated manipulation systems, a human operator controls a robot located in a distant, hazardous, or difficult to reach worksite. These systems have been used for many years in the nuclear industry and for submarine exploration, and new applications are emergi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Shear pins {{are used}} to attach C-SCOUT's fins to their {{actuating}} motors, so if something impacts the fins, the shear pins will break and the fins will fall off, thereby protecting the motors from damage. An analysis {{of the strength of}} the existing Garolite shear pins showed that they will fail during normal operation. It is possible for the fins to break off when the vehicle speed exceeds 2 m/s. Exact failure speeds depend on the angle of attack of the fins. To fix the problem, re-design of the shear pins was attempted, basing the new shear pin strength on the load required to damage an actuator. It was found that the bearings in the actuator's gearbox will be damaged during normal operation, at speeds exceeding 1. 3 m/s. Therefore, the motor will be damaged before the shear pins break, so creating stronger shear pins is not a solution that will protect the motors. Stronger fin actuators should be purchased. The potential for damage to the motors due to operational and impact loads should be considered when selecting a motor. Once new motors are selected, the method described in this report can be used to design appropriate shear <b>pins.</b> Until new <b>actuators</b> and shear <b>pins</b> are installed, C-SCOUT testing can proceed under a 2 m/s speed limit.

40|$|The {{digitally}} reconfigurable {{surface is}} a pin based mechanism for creating physical threedimensional contoured surfaces {{from a computer}} aided design (CAD) input. When the digital design is properly downloaded into the device, a pin array is collectively actuated to the desired geometry. A rubber interpolation layer is held onto {{the tops of the}} pins by vacuum pressure to prevent undesired dimpling of the surface caused by the discrete nature of the pin array. Prior art in this field of reconfigurable pin tooling (RPT) surfaces have mostly involved using large diameter pins with conventional linear <b>actuators</b> behind each <b>pin.</b> Such devices have rarely been commercially viable as the surface area and resolution of the surface scales poorly with the number of actuators and cost. The digitally reconfigurable surface developed theoretically only requires a single mechanically actuated plate, regardless of scale or resolution (number of pins or diameter of pins). The device works by pulling all of the closely packed steel pins simultaneously in one direction via a magnetic moving plate, and as they move, pins are individually clutched and held in position by a novel fusible alloy clutch array, integrated with input circuitry. When the magnetic plate reaches the end of its stroke, all pins are in the proper configuration. The simplicity of this actuation method allows for improved scalability (resolution and area) and low manufacturing cost for the device. In addition, the phase changing clutch array, when coupled with notched or threaded pins, has an excellent holding strength allowing for many possible high pressure molding applications on surfaces generated. It is my hope that this research will one day pave the way for a practical, commercially available, reconfigurable pin-based forming tool. by Benjamin J. Peters. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The {{construction}} of free form building stagnated, {{due to the}} high construction cost of it. Double curved surfaces are only applied at projects with a high profile and projects above average budget during years. The problem with double curved surfaces is mainly the formwork. The present days used techniques to construct these formworks are statically. For example: wooden, steel or milled EPS formwork could only be used for one shaped elements. The lack of repetition and so the reusability of the formwork, which means that for a free form surface for every element a unique formwork is needed, makes the construction very expensive. A feasible way for mass production of unique shaped double curved elements could be achieved by a flexible formwork: a formwork that can be adjusted in every desired shape. It consists of a flexible layer that can be deformed into the desired curved surface by adjusting for example pistons, <b>actuators</b> or <b>pins.</b> Recently K. Huyghe and A. Schoofs have executed a series of experiments with a flexible formwork, build earlier by D. Rietbergen and Dr. Ir. K. Vollers. The purpose of this master thesis was to solve more aspects of the flexible formwork, {{and to make it}} a feasibly system. The main focus was the behavior of the flexible layer, at some places the flexible layer did not though the actuators. Predicting the behavior of the deformed flexible layer makes an accurate production possible. To be able to determine the behavior of the flexible layer some models are proposed. With these models the reaction forces at the supports could be determined, compression forces means that the flexible layer though the supports. The first model that is proposed, is for a single curved element. For the double curved mould surface two models are proposed, a plate model and a strip model. With tests at the Stevin Laboratory these models are verified, and some other aspects are tested, for example the flexible border of the formwork. Tests indicate that a plate is not suitable for the flexible layer, it buckles due to the plate stresses. The strip mould consists of two layers of strips, perpendicular to each other. The top layer of the strips is the mould surface. Tests showed {{that it is possible to}} produce double curved elements with the strip mould. Conclusions and recommendations. The models that are proposed in this thesis describe the behavior of the flexible layer well. A plate does not fulfil the function of a flexible layer. Tests have shown that it is possible to produce double curved elements with the strip mould as flexible layer. To cover the strips an additional layer is needed. In these tests polyether is used, as well for the borders. The protection of the polyether with sealant made the concrete element very rough. Another material has to be found as elastic layer, or to protect the polyether. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
30|$|To Increase {{the speed}} of the MoMo, the second {{prototype}} (MoMo 2) was designed [18]. MoMo 2 and its experimental field are shown in Fig.  5. It comprises two legs and a translation component, upon which is mounted the DIND. The translation component is moved in a straight line between the two legs. This motion is used to reduce MoMo 2 ’s moment of inertia during a whole body rotating motion. Each leg has three screw pins that are rotated simultaneously by a <b>pinning</b> <b>actuator.</b> This mechanical structure reduces the number of steps in the gait sequence. The arrangement of nuts is adjusted according to changes in the mechanical structure. In the new field, three nuts compose one station and they are allocated {{in the form of an}} equilateral triangle. These stations are allocated at uniform distance and this is the same distance as between the two legs of MoMo 2. This indicates that the two legs are fixed at two adjacent stations. The gait sequence of MoMo 2, illustrated in Fig.  6, is simpler than that of MoMo 1. For MoMo 1, movement between two positions comprised 14 steps. However, for MoMo 2 only four steps are required: loosening of screws, rotation of the body, tightening of screws, and translating the DIND. The moving speed is increased in accordance with the reduction of steps in the process. As it is shown in Table  1, the no-load speed of MoMo 2 is more than six times faster than that of MoMo 1. However, MoMo 2 does not have an additional sensor for checking the status of the screw pins. Therefore, on occasion, a positioning error causes abrasion of the screw pins during their insertion into the nuts. This abrasion results in incomplete insertion into the nut and a gap between MoMo 2 and the field. This gap occasionally causes a critical positioning error between the other leg and its desired station. The latest prototype of MoMo is designed to solve the problems of the previous prototypes.|$|R
40|$|The two-axis joint is a {{mechanical}} device that provides two-degrees-of-freedom motion between connected components. A compact, moment-resistant, two-axis joint {{is used to}} connect an electromechanical actuator to its driven structural members. Due {{to the requirements of}} the overall mechanism, the joint has a low profile to fit within the allowable space, low friction, and high moment-reacting capability. The mechanical arrangement of this joint can withstand high moments when loads are applied. These features allow the joint to be used in tight spaces where a high load capability is required, as well as in applications where penetrating the mounting surface is not an option or where surface mounting is required. The joint consists of one base, one clevis, one cap, two needle bearings, and a circular shim. The base of the joint is the housing (the base and the cap together), and is connected to the grounding structure via fasteners and a bolt pattern. Captive within the housing, between the base and the cap, are the rotating clevis and the needle bearings. The clevis is attached to the mechanical system (linear <b>actuator)</b> via a <b>pin.</b> This pin, and the rotational movement of the clevis with respect to the housing, provides two rotational degrees of freedom. The larger diameter flange of the clevis is sandwiched between a pair of needle bearings, one {{on each side of the}} flange. During the assembly of the two-axis joint, the circular shims are used to adjust the amount of preload that is applied to the needle bearings. The above arrangement enables the joint to handle high moments with minimal friction. To achieve the high-moment capability within a low-profile joint, the use of depth of engagement (like that of a conventional rotating shaft) to react moment is replaced with planar engagement parallel to the mounting surface. The needle bearings with the clevis flange provide the surface area to react the clevis loads/moments into the joint housing while providing minimal friction during rotation. The diameter of the flange and the bearings can be increased to react higher loads and still maintain a compact surface mounting capability. This type of joint can be used in a wide variety of mechanisms and mechanical systems. It is especially effective where precise, smooth, continuous motion is required. For example, the joint can be used at the end of a linear actuator that is required to extend and rotate simultaneously. The current design application is for use in a spacecraft docking-system capture mechanism. Other applications might include industrial robotic or assembly line apparatuses, positioning systems, or in the motion-based simulator industry that employs complex, multi-axis manipulators for various types of motions...|$|R
