25|$|Discrimination of women: The {{complete}} {{denial of}} the freedoms of expression and association has exacerbated the generally unequal status of women. Food shortage and gender discrimination makes some women especially vulnerable. The male-dominated State preys on both economically advancing women and marginalized women who suffer bribery, sexual assault, and gender violence. Victims are not afforded protection by the State or recourse to justice. Structural problems are also major contributing factors to {{the high levels of}} trafficking in women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> escape from North Korea to China.|$|E

The new Technical wing was the most up-to-date building of its kind in Ontario.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the publication and distribution of Christian literature and Bibles, the Protestant missionary movement in China furthered the dispersion of knowledge with other printed works of history and science. As the missionaries went to work among the Chinese, they established and developed schools and introduced medical techniques from the West. The mission schools were viewed with some suspicion by the traditional Chinese teachers, but they differed from the norm by offering a basic education to poor Chinese, both boys <b>and</b> <b>girls,</b> <b>who</b> had no hope of learning at a school before {{the days of the}} Chinese Republic.|$|E
25|$|In rural areas, {{schools have}} been {{reported}} to have gained the improved sanitation facility. Given the existing socio-cultural norms and situation of sanitation in schools, girl students are forced not to relieve themselves in the open unlike boys. Lack of facilities in home forces women to wait for the night to relieve themselves and avoid being seen by others. Access to sanitation in some parts of northern India is very poor: about 85% of the rural households in Bihar have no access to a toilet; and this creates a dangerous situation for women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> are followed, attacked and raped in the fields.|$|E
25|$|Lack {{of access}} to water supply and {{sanitation}} has significant health impacts. In addition, it imposes a significant burden on women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> have to carry water. For instance, more than one in five households in Umutara is more than an hour away from its water source. This has implications for the quality of women's and girls' lives, their economic productivity and their access to education. Even where people statistically do have access to an improved water source such as a communal borehole that in some cases is shared by up to 175 families, they sometimes have to wait for more than four hours before they can get water.|$|E

25|$|The {{lifetime}} prevalence, or {{the proportion}} of individuals expected to stutter at one time in their lives, is about 5%, and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females. However, {{there is not much}} information known about the underlying cause for such a skewed sex ratio. Most stuttering begins in early childhood, and studies suggest that 2.5% of {{children under the age of}} 5 stutter. As seen in children who have just begun stuttering, there is an equivalent number of boys <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> stutter. Still, the sex ratio appears to widen as children grow: among preschoolers, boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter by about a two to one ratio, or less. This ratio widens to three to one during first grade, and five to one during fifth grade, as girls have higher recovery rates. Due to high (approximately 65–75%) rates of early recovery, the overall prevalence of stuttering is generally considered to be approximately 1%.|$|E
25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E
500|$|For {{the purpose}} of espionage, the SS started looking for young women {{to work in the}} brothel. In a {{circular}} deemed [...] "top secret", Schellenberg asked administrative offices in Berlin for assistance. The requirement profile read: [...] "Wanted are women <b>and</b> <b>girls,</b> <b>who</b> are intelligent, multilingual, nationalistically minded and furthermore man-crazy" [...] (Gesucht werden Frauen und Mädchen, die intelligent, mehrsprachig, nationalistisch gesinnt und ferner mannstoll sind.). Berlin's Sittenpolizei ("vice squad") arrested dozens of Berlin prostitutes and selected the most beautiful and sexually attractive as potential agents to work at Salon Kitty. Among other things, they were trained to recognize military uniforms, and to glean secrets from innocuous conversation. They were not told about the microphones, but had to make a report after every encounter. The ladies all had their particular attractions and had been trained to satisfy even the discerning customers. Historian Paul Roland further notes that the women who entertained members of the Nazi elite, however, were respected ladies of Berlin's high society who were given no allowances for their [...] "contributions" [...] and were nearly all married to men of good financial means.|$|E

500|$|It has {{affected}} more than 200 million women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> are alive today. The practice {{is concentrated in}} some 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. FGC affects many religious faiths, nationalities, and socioeconomic classes and is highly controversial. The main arguments advanced to justify FGC are hygiene, fertility, the preservation of chastity, an important rite of passage, marriageability and enhanced sexual pleasure of male partners. The amount of tissue removed varies considerably, leading the WHO and other bodies to classify FGC into four types. These range from the partial or total removal of the clitoris {{with or without the}} prepuce (clitoridectomy) in Type I, to the additional removal of the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora [...] (Type II) to narrowing of the vaginal orifice (...) with the creation of a covering seal by suturing the remaining labial tissue over the urethra and introitus, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation). In this type a small opening is created to allow urine and menstrual blood to be discharged. Type 4 involves all other procedures, usually relatively minor alterations such as piercing.|$|E
500|$|To {{optimise}} women's {{control over}} pregnancy, {{it is essential}} that culturally appropriate contraceptive advice and means are widely, easily, and affordably available to anyone that is sexually active, including adolescents. In {{many parts of the world}} access to contraception and family planning services is very difficult or non existent and even in developed counties cultural and religious traditions can create barriers to access. Reported usage of adequate contraception by women has risen only slightly between 1990 and 2014, with considerable regional variability. Although global usage is around 55%, it may be as low as 25% in Africa. Worldwide 222 million women have no or limited access to contraception. Some caution is needed in interpreting available data, since contraceptive prevalence is often defined as [...] "the percentage of women currently using any method of contraception among all women of reproductive age (i.e., those aged 15 to 49 years, unless otherwise stated) who are married or in a union. The “in-union” group includes women living with their partner in the same household and who are not married according to the marriage laws or customs of a country." [...] This definition is more suited to the more restrictive concept of family planning, but omits the contraceptive needs of all other women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> are or are likely to be sexually active, are at risk of pregnancy and are not married or [...] "in-union".|$|E
500|$|Serving as {{executive}} producers {{in addition to}} writers throughout the entire series, Schooley and McCorkle oversaw the show for its entire duration to maintain consistency. As executive producers, Schooley and McCorkle were mostly involved in the writing process, focusing mainly on plot and dialogue, while storyboarding was chiefly handled by Loter. The writing staff consisted of both Disney Channel employees and freelance writers. Much of the series is based on both Schooley and McCorkle's own experiences growing up as teenagers in high school. Although essentially a comedy series, Schooley and McCorkle also combined elements of adventure, relationships and humor in order to appeal to both boys, who are primarily interested in action, <b>and</b> <b>girls,</b> <b>who</b> are more-so attracted to relationships and character development, aware of [...] "ancient truisms" [...] surrounding the belief that boys are generally less likely to watch a series starring a female lead, while girls seldom exhibit such reservations when the casting situation is reversed. Without alienating younger viewers, to whom the show refuses to [...] "talk down", the writing in Kim Possible is [...] "a little older than" [...] that of traditional Disney animated series. While avoiding adult references, Schooley and McCorkle opted for a fast-paced sitcom-style dialogue and rhythm that attracted adult viewers instead, ultimately resulting in teleplays that were typically five pages longer than traditional Disney Channel scripts. Additionally, the show heavily parodies the popular James Bond films. Kim Possibles showrunners were heavily influenced by Marvel Comics, particularly the Spider-Man, Fantastic Four and X-Men comic book series. One particularly strong influence is found in Dr. Drakken and James Possible's former friendship, whose relationship closely mirrors that of the Fantastic Fours Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom and Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, respectively.|$|E
