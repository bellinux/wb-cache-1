5|$|<b>Athletes</b> <b>may</b> have competed against {{individuals}} with different classifications {{in the same}} event. For example, track and field athlete Jim Bob Bizzell competed in the men's 200meters T44; the prefix T designated a track event and 44 was the disability classification. Although he finished behind Oscar Pistorius (competing under the T43 class), Bizell set a world record in the T44 classification. For specific classification information, see the pages for individual sports at 2008 Summer Paralympics#Sports.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland competed as Great Britain in the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The United Kingdom was {{represented}} by the British Olympic Association (BOA), and the team of selected athletes was officially known as Team GB. The team {{was made up of}} athletes from the whole United Kingdom including Northern Ireland, whose <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> elect to hold Irish citizenship, allowing them to represent either Great Britain or Ireland. Additionally some British overseas territories compete separately from Britain in Olympic competition.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> {{have served as}} {{alternates}} for the various teams in the bobsleigh events, although there is disagreement among sources {{as to whether they}} should be considered medal winners. They are listed in the International Olympic Committee's medalist database as having won medals for teams on which they were alternates. However, while they do appear in the Official Report of the 1932 Olympic Games on pages which list members of the teams, their names are not mentioned in the pages that list winners of the events. This list only includes those athletes who were listed in the Official Report as winners of the events.|$|E

5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. <b>Athletes</b> <b>may</b> also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E

25|$|The sports {{sections}} of the AAC {{play a significant role}} in Coimbra's sport life, often being the city's main representative in that area. They include rugby, handball, basketball, baseball, martial arts, athletics, gymnastic or swimming, among others. Just as with the cultural sections, every student, including professional or semi-professional <b>athletes,</b> <b>may</b> belong to them.|$|E
50|$|In artistic gymnastics, it is {{advantageous}} to be shorter. A lower {{center of gravity}} can give an athlete better balance. A smaller <b>athlete</b> <b>may</b> also {{have an easier time}} manipulating their body in the air.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{calling the}} athlete's name, the <b>athlete</b> <b>may</b> choose from {{any part of}} the {{throwing}} circle to enter inside. They have sixty seconds to commence the throwing motion otherwise they are banned from the game.|$|R
50|$|A nation may {{transfer}} {{a pistol}} quota earned in one event to another event within the discipline only. An <b>athlete</b> <b>may</b> enter {{more than one}} event, granted {{no more than two}} athletes per country contest the event.|$|R
25|$|Student <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> also be state champions. The {{sports that}} offer {{individual}} state championships are bowling, cross country, fencing, golf, gymnastics, tennis (singles and doubles), swimming, diving, {{indoor and outdoor}} track, and wrestling. All of these sports — except gymnastics (girls only) and wrestling (boys only) — produce {{both male and female}} individual champions.|$|E
25|$|As {{other aspects}} of the Code, the Table of Elements is {{frequently}} re-evaluated. Skills listed in the Table may have their difficult ratings raised or lowered after evaluation by the FIG Technical Committee. In addition, skills that are determined to be too dangerous to the <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> be banned outright. The Technical Committee may also give specific hazardous skills artificially low difficulty ratings to deter gymnasts from trying to compete them.|$|E
25|$|Roller derby <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> {{attempt to}} knock their opponents {{out of bounds}} or impede their {{movements}} by blocking (actions which are not solely within the prerogative of the official blockers). Legal blocks follow certain rules. Contact by hands, elbows, head, and feet are prohibited, as is contact above the shoulders or below mid-thigh. Furthermore, contact may not be from the rear, only from a player's front or sides.|$|E
50|$|Places {{are awarded}} to the NPC, not the {{individual}} athlete. Where an athlete's name appears, the athlete's NPC has selected that athlete to take this place in Rio; this <b>athlete</b> <b>may</b> {{or may not have}} gained the qualification.|$|R
30|$|Many of the {{determining}} factors of running economy {{are able to}} adapt through training or other interventions, however an economical change in one <b>athlete</b> <b>may</b> be uneconomical in another athlete because of differences in other physiological or biomechanical characteristics.|$|R
50|$|The <b>athlete</b> <b>may</b> be {{a family}} member of a notable former player, alumnus or coach of the school. Often these players do not strive {{to be placed in}} a {{starting}} position, rather carry on the tradition of being a part of a particular team.|$|R
25|$|For {{individual}} sports, competitors typically qualify through attaining {{a certain}} {{place in a}} major international event or on the IF's ranking list. There is a general rule that maximum three individual <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> represent each nation per competition. National Olympic committees may enter {{a limited number of}} qualified competitors in each event, and the NOC decides which qualified competitors to select as representatives in each event if more have attained the benchmark than can be entered.|$|E
25|$|Track {{and field}} {{competitions}} {{emerged in the}} late 19th century and were typically contested between athletes who were representing rival educational institutions, military organisations and sports clubs. Participating <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> compete {{in one or more}} events, according to their specialities. Men and women compete separately. Track and field comes in both indoor and outdoor formats, with most indoor competitions occurring in winter, while outdoor events are mostly held in summer. The sport is defined by the venue in which the competitions are held – the track and field stadium.|$|E
500|$|Concussion may be under-diagnosed {{because of}} the lack of the highly {{noticeable}} signs and symptoms while <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> minimize their injuries to remain in the competition. [...] A retrospective survey in 2005 suggested that more than 88% of concussions are unrecognized.|$|E
50|$|The T11 {{category}} is for athletes {{with a visual}} impairment. A T11 <b>athlete</b> <b>may</b> be entirely without sight, or be able to perceive light, but have no ability to see {{the shape of a}} hand at any distance. T11 athletes commonly run with guides.|$|R

50|$|By restricting their diet, the <b>athlete</b> <b>may</b> worsen {{their problem}} of low energy availability. Having low dietary energy from {{excessive}} exercise and/or dietary restrictions leaves too little {{energy for the}} body to carry out normal functions such as maintaining a regular menstrual cycle or healthy bone density.|$|R
500|$|Young {{children}} {{have the highest}} concussion rate among all age groups. [...] However, most people who suffer concussion are young adults. A Canadian {{study found that the}} yearly incidence of MTBI is lower in older age groups (graph at right). Studies suggest males suffer MTBI at about twice the rate of their female counterparts. [...] However, female <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> be at a higher risk for suffering concussion than their male counterparts.|$|E
500|$|The only sport on the Olympic {{programme}} {{that features}} {{men and women}} competing together is the equestrian disciplines. There is no [...] "Women's Eventing", or 'Men's Dressage'. As of 2008, there were still more medal events for men than women. With the addition of women's boxing to the programme in the 2012 Summer Olympics, however, female athletes were able to compete in all the same sports as men. In the winter Olympics, women are still unable {{to compete in the}} Nordic Combined. There are currently two Olympic events in which male <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> not compete: synchronised swimming and rhythmic gymnastics.|$|E
500|$|For sprint races up to 400m, {{the starter}} gives two commands: [...] "on your marks" [...] to {{instruct}} athletes {{to approach the}} start line, followed by [...] "set" [...] to advise the athletes that {{the start of the}} race is imminent. The commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions, or in English or French in international competitions. Once all athletes are set in their starting position, the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated. If the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed, the <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> be called out of the blocks and the process started over.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>athlete</b> <b>may</b> {{touch the}} inside {{surface of the}} circle or toe board, but must not touch the top or outside of the circle or toe board, or the ground beyond the circle. Limbs may however extend over {{the lines of the}} circle in the air.|$|R

500|$|The {{position}} of the start gate determines the inrun speed, creating a difference {{of as much as}} [...] depending on whether the gate is set higher (thereby lengthening the inrun) or lower (shortening the inrun); the difference in height between individual gates is [...] Based on the jury's decision, the gate position – of which there are several available numbers – is subject to being adjusted accordingly, including between each jump. In especially tricky conditions, <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> sometimes be forced to enter and exit the gate multiple times before they are permitted to jump. The issue of gates being adjusted too often has become highly unpopular for audiences.|$|E
500|$|On February 20, 2014, Baseball America {{revealed}} that the Phillies reported Ben Wetzler and Jason Monda (two 2013 draft selections who did not sign with the club) to the National Collegiate Athletic Association for violating the NCAA's no-agent rule: student <b>athletes</b> <b>may</b> not use agents to negotiate professional contracts. Although players observe the [...] "patently ridiculous" [...] rule by routinely hiring [...] "advisors" [...] (usually agents), the NCAA suspended Wetzler for 11 games. The Phillies were criticized for reporting the players: [...] David Murphy of the Philadelphia Daily News asked if the Phillies wanted to punish Wetzler for not signing with them. According to ESPN's Buster Olney, the Phillies' reporting of Wetzler and Monda would hurt the team in the long run: [...] "As time passes and the Phillies’ silence continues, the impression hardens within the industry—particularly among agents and college coaches—that the team acted out of vindictiveness, because neither Wetzler nor Monda accepted their offer." [...] He called the Phillies' decision [...] "breathtakingly abhorrent", saying that the debacle would [...] "tarnish the reputation of a respected organization". Amaro dismissed the likelihood of retribution by agents or players, replying, [...] "No, I'm not", {{when asked if he}} was concerned that the organization's reporting of Wetzler would hinder its ability to [...] "glean accurate and detailed information about a player's willingness to go pro, or even gain access to said players".|$|E
