40|$|The {{standard}} of animal protection against cruelty, in farming, during transport and at slaughter in cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses and poultry and its {{development in the}} Czech Republic during the period 1996 - 2001 has been evaluated. The evaluation {{was carried out by}} comparison of the following parameters - veterinary measures for improvement of animal protection, violation of law, total number of failures to fulfil animal protection requirements in animal welfare to the total number of carried out inspections. In the surveyed farm animals there were only very sporadic cases of deliberate cruelty. The suffering of animals was caused mainly by neglecting the animal protection by incorect use of premises, by not observing technological procedures, by unsatisfactory hygiene, by insufficient feeding or watering, unsatisfactory care of <b>animal</b> <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> unsatisfactory care of mothers and their young, violation of animal protection during transport, in abattories and at slaughter. The consequences of the above mentioned cases were not only the suffering of animals and their possible consequent health problems, but a negative economic impact and sanctions for the farmers as well.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} claw disorders in youngstock and first parity heifers and to evaluate the effect of grazing on claw disorders, 10 Dutch dairy herds participated in a 2 -year longitudinal study. Five herds were zero-grazed, while in the other five herds cows and youngstock had access to pasture during the summer. Twenty female calves 15 %. The prevalence of DD increased considerably around first calving on both the grazing and the zero-grazing farms. The prevalence of IDHE increased with age while SH prevalence showed a more fluctuating pattern. Digital dermatitis was less frequently observed in pastured animals than in permanently housed animals (OR = 0. 12 – 0. 64 depending on month of observation; P < 0. 05), with the strongest effect being seen during the period when the herds which grazed cattle actually had <b>animals</b> <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> (May to August).

40|$|Management-intensive grazing is a grazing {{management}} strategy {{that relies on}} careful monitoring of <b>animals</b> <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> and frequent relocation of animals between various regions of the pasture, or paddocks, {{in order to maximize}} the nutrients and sustenance the animals obtain through grazing. When applied successfully, this approach to {{grazing management}} yields higher animal production, while cutting feed costs; however, a great deal of overhead is introduced in monitoring and moving the animals throughout the pasture, making this approach very difficult to implement at a large scale. Recent successes in the field of dynamic virtual fencing have demonstrated the feasibility of automatically restraining and moving cattle within a pasture, and without the need to build or move fences. This technology may be used to reduce the physical overhead of management-intensive grazing, but it does not address the decision-making aspects. This thesis proposes a decision-making system to be used in conjunction with dynamic virtual fence technology to implement a fully-automated intensive grazing management strategy. The system has been implemented and tested in simulation, and the results thereof are presented and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Control {{over the}} {{quantity}} and quality of food ingested by grazing ruminants in temperate pasture systems remains elusive. This is due in part to the foraging choices that animals make when grazing from communities of mixed plant species. Grazing behavior and intake interact strongly with the feed supply-demand balance, pasture composition, and grazing method. These interactions are not completely understood, even for relatively simple pasture communities such as a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) -white clover (Trifolium repens L.) mixture. When offered a free choice between these species, ruminants exhibit a partial preference for clover compared to grass (about 0. 7 : 0. 3) and have a higher intake rate from clover but do not graze to maximize their daily intake of dry matter (DM). When monocultures of grass and clover are offered as a free choice in 50 : 50 area ratio, animal performance is no different than from a clover monoculture alone. Thus, all of the feeding value benefits of clover are available when only 0. 5 of the grazing area is sown to clover. These observations accord with the satiety theory and imply that there are constraints to eating pure clover that animals can overcome by adding grass to their diet, provided their ability to locate and ingest each food is not seriously limited. The challenge for grassland management is to present feed to <b>animals</b> <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> in ways that allow them to meet their dietary preferences, while also allowing high rates of animal production per hectare...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{the energy}} {{expenditure}} of farm <b>animals</b> <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> {{is important for}} efficient animal management. In recent years, an alternative technique for estimating energy expenditure by measuring body acceleration has been widely performed in wildlife and human studies, but {{the availability of the}} technique in farm animals has not yet been examined. In the present study, we tested the potential use of an acceleration index, overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), as a new proxy for estimating the energy expenditure of grazing farm animals (cattle, goats and sheep) <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> with the simultaneous evaluation of a conventional proxy, heart rate. Body accelerations in three axes and heart rate for cows (n = 8, two breeds), goats (n = 6) and sheep (n = 5) were recorded, and the effect of ODBA calculated from the body accelerations on heart rate was analyzed. In addition, the effects of the two other activity indices, the number of steps and vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA), on heart rate were also investigated. The results of the comparison among three activity indices indicated that ODBA was the best predictor for heart rate. Although the relationship between ODBA and heart rate was different between the groups of species and breeds and between individuals (P< 0. 01), the difference could be explained by different body weights; a common equation could be established by correcting the body weights (M: kg) : heart rate (beats/min) = 147. 263 ∙M- 0. 141 + 889. 640 ∙M- 0. 179 ∙ODBA (g). Combining this equation with the previously reported energy expenditure per heartbeat, we estimated the energy expenditure of the tested animals, and the results indicated that ODBA is a good proxy for estimating the energy expenditure of grazing farm animals across species and breeds. The utility and simplicity of the procedure with acceleration loggers could make the accelerometry technique a worthwhile option in field research and commercial farm use...|$|R

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{is one of}} {{the three}} most {{important}} greenhouse gases (GHG). Nitrous oxide emissions currently account for approximately one third of GHG emissions from agriculture in Ireland. Emissions of N 2 O arise naturally from soil sources and from the application of nitrogen (N) in the form of N fertilizers and N in dung and urine deposition by grazing <b>animals</b> <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> Nitrous oxide emission measurements were conducted at three different scales. Firstly, a large-scale field experiment was undertaken to compare emission rates from a pasture receiving three different rates of N fertilizer application and to identify the effects of controlling variables over a two-year period. Variation in emission rates was large both within and between years. Two contrasting climatic years were identified. The cooler and wetter conditions in year 1 gave rise to considerably lower emission levels than the warmer and drier year 2. However, in both years, peak emissions were associated with fertilizer N applications coincident with rainfall events in the summer months. A small-plot study was conducted to identify the individual and combined effects of fertilizer, dung and urine applications to grassland. Treatment effects were however, difficult to obtain due to the overriding effects of environmental variables. Thirdly, {{through the use of a}} small-scale mini-lysimeter study, the diurnal nature of N 2 O emission rates was identified for two distinct periods during the year. The occurrence of a diurnal pattern has important implications for the identification of a measurement period during the day which is representative of the true daily flux. The research presented aims to identify the nature and magnitude of N 2 O emissions and the factors which affect emission rates from a grassland in Ireland. Further work is required to integrate the effects of different soil types and contrasting climatic regimes across soil types on N 2 O emissions.

40|$|Several {{external}} markers can be {{used for}} estimating total faecal output in view of assessing ruminant intake <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> Among them, ytterbium (Yb) has been used for many years in various conditions. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a promising external marker because it can be rapidly determined using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The study consisted of 24 adult lactating dairy ewes over three periods (P 1, P 2 and P 3), fed with three different diets: P 1, total mixed ration (TMR); P 2, Italian ryegrass (IRG); and P 3, pasture. After an adaptation period, the ewes were administered a daily dose of ytterbium oxide (0. 35 g/day) and PEG (20 g/day) for 2 weeks. During the last week, the daily organic matter intake (OMIOBS) was measured. Faecal samples were collected at milking time (0800 and 1600 h) to determine marker content, using only samples collected in the morning (PEGm) or by averaging samples (Yb, PEGma). Faecal marker content made it possible to assess total faecal output, either using the two recovery rates for PEG (0. 98 or 0. 87) or not. The OMIOBS was assessed on the basis of total faeces estimated with Yb (OMIYb) or PEG (OMIPEG), and the digestibility was calculated on the basis of feed analysis. With total TMR (P 1), the OMIPEG, corrected with recovery rate (OMIPEGm 98) or not corrected (OMIPEGm) was 2. 40 kg/day and 2. 50 kg/day, respectively, and was not different (P> 0. 05) from OMIOBS (2. 51 kg/day), whereas OMIYb was lower (2. 14 kg/day) (P 0. 05) from OMIOBS (1. 57 kg/day). With pasture (P 3), the OMIPEGm (1. 54 kg/day) and OMIPEGm 98 (1. 48 kg/day) were not different (P> 0. 05) from the OMI assessed from the biomass measurement (1. 52 kg/day). The OMIYb (1. 36 kg/day) was lower (P< 0. 05) but not different from OMIPEGm 98 and OMIPEGm 87. Spearman's rank correlation between OMIOBS and other OMIs (predicted with Yb or PEG P 1 and P 2) showed {{that it is possible to}} rank animals using PEG when there is a sufficiently wide range of OMIOBS (1. 65 to 2. 8 kg/day in P 1) but not within a narrower range (1. 47 to 1. 72 kg/day in P 2). In conclusion, the present study confirms that PEG is a valuable external faecal marker, easy to prepare (solution), administer and determine (NIRS). It {{can be used}} to assess intake with numerous <b>animals</b> <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> but only for groups, and not to quantitatively estimate individual OMI. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

This study used sensor technologies to investigate the patterns of behaviour and excreta distribution in dairy cows under commercial conditions. Seventeen cross-bred dairy cows in late lactation, in a herd of 180, were fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars, IceTag 3 D ® activity sensors and urine sensors for seven consecutive days.

Cows spent more time grazing and less time lying down during the AM than PM grazing period. As the frequency of grazing decreased, the frequency of lying increased within AM and PM grazing periods. Activity patterns were consistent within and between grazing periods.

In Experiment 1, 10 adult Martinik rams weighing, on average, 50. 5 (60. 9) kg, including four fitted with rumen cannula, were randomly allocated to two groups according to a 232 Latin Square design. These rams consumed a 21 -day regrowth of Digitaria decumbens grass diet during two successive 28 -day periods, indoors (five rams) or <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> (five tethered rams). In Experiment 2, 10 other Martinik rams weighing, on average, 45. 5 (60. 9) kg, including four fitted with rumen cannula, were randomly allocated to two groups according to a 232 Latin Square design. These rams consumed a 35 -day regrowth of D. decumbens grass diet during two successive 28 -day periods, either indoors (five rams) or <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> (five tethered rams). For the indoors groups, in vivo organic matter digestibility (OMD) was measured by total collection of feces. In addition, OMD was estimated indoors and <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> using the fecal CP (CPf) method (OMDCPf). Organic matter intake (OMI) was then estimated using OMDCPf and fecal organic matter output (OMICPf). Correlations of 0. 49 and 0. 77 were found between in vivo OMD and OMDCPf (P, 0. 05) and between OMI and OMICPf (P, 0. 001), respectively. OMDCPf was 1. 8 % (P, 0. 05) and 2. 7 % (P, 0. 01) lower indoors than <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>at</b> 21 and 35 days of regrowth, respectively, whereas OMICPf indoors was 1. 1 and 1. 16 times that registered <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>at</b> 21 and 35 days of regrowth, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to investigate the effect of limited grazing time on urination and defecation frequency, spatial distribution of excrement in the paddock, and the resulting nitrogen balance <b>at</b> <b>animal</b> and field level. During a 6 -week period in early summer, 60 Holstein Frisian dairy cows (31. 0 ± 5. 4 kg ECM) were randomly allocated to three different treatments, with grazing <b>at</b> clover-grass <b>pasture</b> during daytime for 4, 6. 5 or 9 h daily. Indoor feeding, with a mixture of roughage and concentrates (13 % crude protein), was restricted for treatment 4 and 6. 5 h to the amount the 9 -h treatment could eat. Cows allowed grazing <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> for 4 h moved more rapidly during pasture, moved longer distance per active hour and used a higher proportion of the time eating, both <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> and indoor, than the cows allowed longer time <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> Limiting the grazing time had no influence on the urination (mean = 0. 26) and defecation (mean = 0. 37) frequency per cow per hour during pasture. Even though the proportion of time active (eating, drinking, standing or walking), and the actual time active during pasture was different for the treatments, the frequency of urination and defecation per active hour was also unaffected by the treatments. Urine and faeces were distributed in the pasture, without specific hot-spots. The estimated daily N-balance <b>at</b> <b>animal</b> level showed increased N excretion with time <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> Assuming that excretion follows the active periods during the day and 7000 kg DM foliage is available on yearly basis, this would result in total excretion at field level of 58, 86 and 108 kg N per ha respectively for treatment 4, 6. 5 and 9 h.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of lameness and specific causes of lameness on standing time, number of lying bouts and test day yield (TDY) in cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> and cows which were housed. Data were collected from 200 cows from 10 farms where cows were <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> and 200 cows from 10 farms where they were housed. Each farm was visited twice over 3 days between May and August (autumn and winter) of 2009. At the first visit, 10 lame cows, all with locomotion score (LS) 3, and 10 non-lame cows, all with LS 1, were selected per farm. Electronic data loggers were positioned on one hind leg of each cow to record standing time and transitions. These were removed 3 days later at the second visit. There was no significant difference in standing time between housed and pasture-based cows but lame cows stood for a mean 1. 75 (SE 0. 36) h/day less than non-lame cows in both systems. Cows with sole damage, wall damage, misshapen feet and infectious lameness all stood for less time than non-lame cows. Housed cows had a mean 1. 4 more lying bouts per day than cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> Lame cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> had 1. 2 more lying bouts per day than non-lame cows but housed lame cattle had 0. 8 fewer lying bouts than non-lame housed cattle, so overall the number of lying bouts in lame cows, housed or <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> was similar. The only lesion associated with a change in the number of lying bouts was sole damage with a mean 1. 1 more lying bouts per day across systems than non-lame cows. Lame cows had lower TDY than non-lame cows and TDY was reduced more in lame cows when TDY was greater. In conclusion, standing times were similar in cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> and in housed cows, but lying bouts were different. However, given the associations between standing time, lying bouts and TDY the results might be most strongly influenced by TDY, rather than system. Future studies investigating the impact of lameness on cow behaviour by system in cows with similar and a range of TDY would be informative. ...|$|R

Journal of Agricultural Science, 136, 89 - 98. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that protein sources which are primarily degraded in the rumen such as rapeseed meal or soyabean meal may be as effective as a less rumen degradable protein source such as fishmeal in supporting higher levels of animal performance in young steers fed on grass silage. However, the response to type of protein supplement is likely to be influenced by the composition of the basal diet. This study has examined the effect of supplementing silages prepared from early (EH) and late (LH) harvested grass with two protein sources of differing rumen degradability, rapeseed meal (RSM) and fishmeal (FM) or a mixture of the two (M), thus creating eight experimental diets of LH, LHRSM, LHFM, LHM, EH, EHRSM, EHFM and EHM. Silage was offered ad libitum and supplements were included at 100 g fresh weight/kg silage DM intake. The RSM and M diets were made isonitrogenous with FM diets by the addition of urea. Animals remained on diets for 18 weeks and liveweights were monitored for a further 13 weeks while the <b>animals</b> were <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> Dry matter (DM) intakes and liveweight gains were higher with EH than with LH silage (P < 0 ? 001). Response to type of protein supplement was dependent on silage quality. On LH silage, higher intakes were noted on FM and M (82 ? 4 and 82 ? 8 g DM/unit metabolic liveweight/day, respectively) relative to silage only (75 ? 8 g DM/unit metabolic liveweight/day) and this contributed towards higher liveweight gains (P < 0 ? 01). Liveweight gains tended to be higher on LH silage supplemented with FM compared to RSM (0 ? 76 v. 0 ? 67 kg/day, respectively, P = 0 ? 08). In comparison, on EH silage, relative to EH unsupplemented, the intake was highest on M (89 ? 2 v. 96 ? 6 g DM/unit metabolic liveweight/day), but liveweight gains were not significantly different between supplements. On turnout to pasture, those animals fed on silage alone exhibited compensatory growth (P < 0 ? 025) with the result that those fed on LH silage only grew faster and achieved the same liveweight after 13 weeks at grass as those supplemented with RSM or M. There was a tendency for those fed on FM to maintain an advantage in liveweight after the period <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> On EH silage, {{at the end of the}} grazing period no significant differences in liveweight existed between the different supplements and on average were 23 kg heavier than EH silage unsupplemented. In conclusion, silage type (stage of harvest and quality) and protein supplementation influenced animal performance. On late harvest and poorer digestibility silage, there was some indication that feeding fishmeal was better than rapeseed but this was less evident on early harvest and higher digestibility silage. However, considering the price differential between these two supplements and small difference in animal performance it is concluded that rapeseed meal is as effective as fishmeal when used as a protein supplement for growing cattle fed on grass silage.

In trial 1, six Romane breed adult dry ewes placed in metabolism cages were fed daily with natural, freshly cut rangeland from a fertilised or unfertilised paddock for 6 weeks. Three ewes did not receive PEG and the three others were dosed with 10 g of PEG in solution form once daily {{until the end of the}} experiment to measure in vivo dry matter digestibility and PEG recovery rate for each forage quality. At the same time (trial 2), 15 ewe lambs and 14 lactating adult ewes suckling one or two lambs were allowed to graze together on the same herbage as that cut for indoor ewes. All animals were initially equipped with faecal bags emptied twice daily for collecting total faeces, and eight ewe lambs and seven adults were dosed once daily with 10 g of PEG. Faecal grab samples were collected for 4 to 5 days for each forage quality grazed. Indoor trial 1 showed that PEG had no effect on dry matter intake (DMI) or on digestibility. PEG recovery rates measured on fertilised (77. 7 %) and unfertilised (82. 1 %) forage were not different (P> 0. 05). PEG recovery rates measured <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> did not differ (P> 0. 05) between pasture quality and animal type with an average value of 68. 9 %. Faecal output {{measured with}} bags or estimated with PEG and calculated DMI were not different (P> 0. 05) when PEG recovery rate measured <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> was used. Conversely, using indoor PEG recovery values, significantly (P< 0. 05) or tended to overestimate faecal output. In conclusion, PEG could be used as a faecal marker administered at a minimal dose of 1 % of DMI with a recovery rate measured under pasture conditions for pasture intake measurements on a group of <b>animals</b> <b>at</b> the same physiological stage but not for individual measurements.

40|$|Pregnant Hereford cows of {{live weight}} 462 +: 5 kg (mea&SE) and {{condition}} score 2. 7 + 0. 04 were fed {{one of five}} drought rations {{over a period of}} 169 days commencing 3 - 6 months pre-calving. One ration was fed <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> the others in feedlots. The rations were: 4 kg whole wheat <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> 4. 6 kg wheat, 3. 5 kg wheat, 4 kg wheat + 0. 5 kg oaten straw or 7. 2 kg oaten hay. These rations were calculated on a daily basis but feeding was two or three times per week. The overall live weight (kg) and condition score (units) changes for cows were- 42. 8 and 0. 2;- 104 and 1. 0;- 137 and- 1. 3;- 87 and- 1. 1;- 106 and- 1. 6, respectively. Pregnant cows can be fed rations consisting solely of whole wheat; however 3. 5 kg was inadequate for a satisfactory liveweight change. No advantage was found by adding straw to the wheat ration, but wheat <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> gave the best performance. All rations appeared inadequate for optimum performance from lactating cows under the con-ditions of this experiment...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{nematode}} (GIN) infections have {{an important}} negative impact on small ruminant production. The selection of genotypes resistant to these parasitic infections is a promising alternative control strategy. Thus, resistance against GIN {{is an important component}} of small ruminant breeding schemes, based on phenotypic measurements of resistance in immune mature infected animals. In this study we evaluated both the impact of the post-weaning parasitism history on the response to an experimental Haemonchus contortus infection of resistant and susceptible Creole kids chosen {{on the basis of their}} estimated breeding value, and the interaction with the kid’s genetic status. During the post-weaning period (from 3 months until 7 months of age) Creole kids were reared <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> according to four different levels of a mixed rotational stocking system with Creole cattle: 100 % (control), 75 % (GG 75), 50 % (GG 50), and 25 % (GG 25) of the total stocking rate of the pasture. The level of infection of the kids decreased significantly at 50 % and 25 % of the total stocking rate. After the post-weaning period <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> <b>at</b> 11 months of age kids were experimentally infected with H. contortus. The faecal egg counts (FEC) were significantly lower in the groups showing the highest FEC <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> This result suggests that a degree of protection against an experimental H. contortus infection occurred during the post-weaning period and was dependant on the level of parasitism. Interestingly, no interaction was observed between this level of protection and the genetic status. In conclusion, the level of post-weaning natural parasitism history <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> would not influence the genetic status evaluation. More generally our results suggest that it would be better to expose kids to a high level of gastrointestinal parasitism during the post-weaning period in order to increase the basal level of resistance thereafter...|$|R

We studied {{the effect of}} polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW 4000), a polymer that binds condensed tannins, on the feeding behavior of Damascus goats (Capra hircas) on a range dominated by tannin-rich lentisk (Pistacia lentiscus L.). This was done {{with or without a}} nutritious alternative to browse (alfalfa hay) available <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> In phase 1, no hay was provided to goats; in phase 2, hay was distributed daily in the field.

40|$|Four bulls that {{produced}} spermatozoa {{with a high}} percentage of abnormal acrosomes were individually placed in pens with females for 21 days. Frozen semen from 2 of the bulls was used for artificial insemination. One of the bulls was placed in a competitive mating situation with normal bulls <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> First service pregnancy rates were determined by transrectal ultrasonography 28 days after bull removal from breeding pens, or after the last artificial insemination. The results of competitive mating <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> were determined from breeding observations, the phenotypic characteristics of calves sired, and blood typing for parentage. The results of these studies suggest that bulls that produce {{a high percentage of}} spermatozoa with indented acrosomes may have normal fertility when used in artificial insemination or in single sire mating; however, their fertility may be low when breeding competitively with bulls with normal spermiograms...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of daily grazing time and nycthemeral grazing pattern in ruminant nutrition research {{may result in}} a better understanding of sward–animal interactions and of the behavioural constraints affecting daily intake <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> Portable devices which automatically record grazing activities are needed. The Kenz Lifecorder Plus device (LCP, Suzuken Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan), originally developed for measuring human daily activity level, has been used recently to record daily grazing time and pattern in dairy cows. The aim of this validation study was to compare grazing activity duration as recorded simultaneously by the Lifecorder Plus fitted on the cow neck and by trained observers. A total of 250  h of visual observations on six grazing cows over 12 days were performed. The relative prediction error averaged 0. 12, 0. 07, 0. 05, and 0. 03 of actual grazing time when accuracy was investigated per hour, per sequence of observation (approx. 5  h), per day (approx. 21  h), and per cow (approx. 41  h), respectively. Error was mainly random, the proportion of mean square prediction error related to mean bias or line bias being always very small. This high accuracy shows no overall confusion between grazing and other activities, such as rumination, when cows were <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> No activity was detected when cows were ruminating. Walking time to and from the milking parlour was detected as activity due to much greater speed than while grazing. This can be easily filtered out when the raw data are processed so as not to over-estimate grazing time, particularly if some cows are fitted additionnally with Lifecorder on the leg to identify these periods. In conclusion, the high accuracy of the Lifecorder Plus to detect grazing activities when cows are <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> particularly <b>at</b> the day scale or when comparing cows over several days, as well as its robustness and simplicity in use, make it a very suitable device for recording the grazing time and pattern of dairy cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture...</b>|$|R
