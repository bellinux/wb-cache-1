5|$|An inscribed block {{dating to}} the later Ramesside period (1292–1077 BC) <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, was {{uncovered}} by Lepsius {{in a house in}} Abusir and shows Menkauhor enthroned beside four other deified kings of the Old Kingdom: the name of the first, partially lost, but probably Sneferu is then followed by Djedefre, Menkaure, Menkauhor and finally Neferkare. The owner of the tomb stands before the kings, in worship. Another relief {{dating to the}} same period shows a similar scene. It was inscribed on the lintel of the tomb chapel of Mahy buried in Saqqara North. Four deified kings of the Old Kingdom are shown, all of whom built their pyramids at Saqqara: Djoser, Teti, Userkaf and Menkauhor.|$|E
5000|$|The older Persian {{province}} of Khorasan included parts which are today in Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Some {{of the main}} historical cities of Persia {{are located in the}} older Khorasan: Nishapur <b>and</b> Tus (<b>now</b> <b>in</b> Iran), Merv <b>and</b> Sanjan (<b>now</b> <b>in</b> Turkmenistan), Samarkand <b>and</b> Bukhara (both <b>now</b> <b>in</b> Uzbekistan), Herat <b>and</b> Balkh (<b>now</b> <b>in</b> Afghanistan), Khujand <b>and</b> Panjakent (<b>now</b> <b>in</b> Tajikistan).|$|R

50|$|Khorasan, in {{its proper}} sense, {{comprised}} {{the cities of}} Balkh <b>and</b> Herat (<b>now</b> <b>in</b> Afghanistan), Mashhad <b>and</b> Nishapur (<b>now</b> <b>in</b> northeastern Iran), Merv <b>and</b> Nisa (<b>now</b> <b>in</b> southern Turkmenistan), <b>and</b> Bukhara <b>and</b> Samarkand (<b>now</b> <b>in</b> Uzbekistan). Some believe that at certain times Khorasan covered a wider area, which included parts of Transoxiana, Soghdiana, Sistan, and extended to {{the boundaries of the}} Indian subcontinent. When the Arabs first arrived to the southern Hindu Kush to defeat the Zunbils, they recognized it as al-Hind (Sind), owing to the prevalence of Buddhists and Hindus (non-Zoroastrians) due to its cultural connection with Greater India. Sources from the 14th to the 16th century report that areas in the south of the Hindu Kush mountain range (Zamindawar, Balochistan, and Kabulistan) formed a frontier between Khorasan and Hindustan.|$|R
5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1833 <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> Tate Britain. Intended {{to illustrate the}} virtues of honour and chastity, it depicts a scene from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in which the female warrior Britomart slays the evil magician Busirane and frees his captive, the beautiful Amoret. In Spenser's original poem Amoret has been tortured and mutilated {{by the time of}} her rescue, but Etty disliked the depiction of violence and portrayed her as unharmed.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Casterman {{suggested}} to Hergé that his books {{be published in}} a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> full colour rather than black-and-white. He agreed to this, and in 1943 The Crab with the Golden Claws was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944. Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long, and thus Hergé filled the missing pages with four full-page colour frames, thus bringing {{it up to the}} standard 62-page format.|$|E

5|$|Structure 10L-11 is on {{the west}} side of the Acropolis. It {{encloses}} the south side of the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is accessed from it by a wide monumental stairway. This structure appears to have been the royal palace of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, the 16thruler in the dynastic succession and the last known king of Copán. Structure 10L-11 was built on top of several earlier structures, one of which probably contains the tomb of his predecessor K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil. A small tunnel descends into the interior of the structure, possibly to the tomb, but it has not yet been excavated by archaeologists. Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat built a new temple platform over his predecessor's tomb in AD769. On top of this he placed a two-storey superstructure with a sculpted roof depicting the mythological cosmos. At each of its northern corners was a large sculpted Pawatun (a group of deities that supported the heavens). This superstructure had four doorways with panels of hieroglyphs sculpted directly onto the walls of the building. A bench inside the structure, removed by Maudslay in the nineteenth century <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the British Museum's collection, once depicted the king's accession to the throne, overseen by deities and ancestors.|$|E
5|$|With a firm lead <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> {{possession}} of the ball, Virginia Tech began to run out the clock by executing short rushing plays up {{the center of the}} field. Since the game clock does not stop in American college football if a player remains in bounds short of the first down marker, the Hokies could hasten {{the end of the game}} and preserve their lead by following this strategy. From their one-yard line, Taylor ran the ball for a one-yard gain, followed by two rushes by Evans for another four yards. The Hokies prepared to punt the ball, but during the kick, Cincinnati committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty by tackling Tech punter Brent Bowden. The penalty gave Virginia Tech a first down and kept their drive going. From the Tech 21-yard line, Evans was stopped for a loss of one yard, but broke free for an 11-yard gain and a first down on the next play. As the clock continued to tick down, Cincinnati began to use its timeouts in an effort to stop the clock after each play. This strategy was partially successful, as Tech was denied another first down and punted with 2:31 remaining in the game.|$|E
