5|$|Most of {{the islands}} have a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is about 400 million years old, and was laid down in the Devonian period. The islands have good {{agricultural}} qualities and have been continuously inhabited for thousands of years, {{as evidenced by the}} World Heritage Site of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney. The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide, and there are numerous lighthouses as an aid to navigation. The European Marine Energy Centre, which is located at Stromness, is currently testing various wave and tidal energy devices from Billia Croo on the Mainland and Eday. The islands <b>all</b> <b>fall</b> within the Orkney Islands Council area. Most of the larger islands have development trusts that support the local economy.|$|E

5|$|The islands <b>all</b> <b>fall</b> {{within the}} Shetland Islands Council local authority. They have been {{continuously}} inhabited since Neolithic times and experienced Norse rule for several centuries, the first written records being the Norse sagas. The excavations at Jarlshof near {{the southern end}} of the Mainland have provided archaeological evidence of life in Shetland since Bronze Age times and the annual Up Helly Aa fire festivals are a living reminder of Shetland's Viking past. The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide and there are numerous lighthouses as an aid to navigation. A small wind farm on Shetland recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity over the course of a year. The indigenous Shetland ponies are reputed for their strength and hardiness.|$|E
5|$|Although castle {{construction}} faded {{towards the}} end of the 16thcentury, castles did not necessarily <b>all</b> <b>fall</b> out of use. Some retained a role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particularly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11thcentury and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom. In other cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent residences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure castles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against raiders and other small threats.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We <b>all</b> <b>fall</b> into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

5|$|Myles' Mary Collins {{prosthetic}} {{took six}} hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first {{performance at the}} beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo {{his part of the}} scene because he felt that it was not good enough. Gaius' fall from the balcony was done by a stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera. The mattress that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; {{it was one of the}} most complex and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests <b>all</b> <b>fall</b> asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.|$|E

40|$|To {{calculate}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>all</b> <b>falls,</b> non-accidental falls and syncope in an older population and characterize cardiovascular risk profiles. Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. The first two waves of data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). 8172 community-dwelling adults aged 50 years and older resident in the Republic of Ireland. Self-reported history of <b>all</b> <b>falls,</b> non-accidental falls and syncope in the year preceding the first two waves of data collection. Demographic factors and self-reported cardiovascular conditions were used to characterize cardiovascular risk profiles. The prevalence of <b>all</b> <b>falls</b> {{in the past year}} was 19. 2 % or 192 per thousand persons and increased with age (50 - 64 years 17. 5 %; 65 - 74 years 19. 4 %; 75 + years 24. 4 %). Non-accidental falls had an estimated prevalence of 5. 1 % or 51 falls per thousand persons and accounted for 26. 5 % of <b>all</b> <b>falls</b> reported and also increased with age (50 - 64 years 4. 0 %; 65 - 74 years 5. 5 %; 75 + years 8. 0 %). The prevalence for syncope was estimated to be 4. 4 % or 44 per thousand persons but did not show a similar age gradient. Participants with at least 5 cardiovascular conditions {{were more likely to report}} <b>all</b> <b>falls</b> (OR = 2. 07, 95 % CI 1. 18 - 3. 64, p< 0. 05) and NAF (OR = 2. 89, 95 %CI 1. 28 - 6. 52, p< 0. 05). The prevalence of <b>all</b> <b>falls</b> and non-accidental falls increases with age but the same pattern was not consistently observed for syncope. There is an increased odds of reporting all three outcomes with increasing number of self-reported cardiovascular conditions. Further work is needed to uncover the interplay between cardiovascular disease and subsequent falls...|$|R

25|$|The United Nations Model Regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods and {{national}} transportation authorities, such as United States Department of Transportation, have classified gunpowder (black powder) as a Group A: Primary explosive substance for shipment because it ignites so easily.

25|$|Another {{dimension}} {{for analyzing}} language rights is with degree of overtness and covertness. Degree of overtness {{refers to the}} extent laws or covenants are explicit with respect to language rights, and covertness the reverse. For example, Indian laws are overt in promoting language rights, whereas the English Language Amendments to the US Constitution are overt prohibition. The Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child <b>all</b> <b>fall</b> under covert toleration.|$|E
25|$|The 17th-century critic Giovanni Bellori, in his survey {{entitled}} Idea, praised Carracci as the {{paragon of}} Italian painters, who had fostered a “renaissance” {{of the great}} tradition of Raphael and Michelangelo. On the other hand, while admitting Caravaggio's talents as a painter, Bellori deplored his over-naturalistic style, if not his turbulent morals and persona. He thus viewed the Caravaggisti styles with the same gloomy dismay. Painters were urged to depict the Platonic ideal of beauty, not Roman street-walkers. Yet Carracci and Caravaggio patrons and pupils did not <b>all</b> <b>fall</b> into irreconcilable camps. Contemporary patrons, such as Marquess Vincenzo Giustiniani, found both applied showed excellence in maniera and modeling.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{foundation}} in 1912, the international governing body for athletics {{has been the}} International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). It was initially known as the International Amateur Athletics Federation but changed later its name to reflect that the sport had moved away from amateurism towards professionalism in the late 1970s. The IAAF has 215 member nations and territories, which are divided into six continental areas (or area associations). The six association areas are for Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, North America and South America. The sports within athletics do not have their own independent governing bodies at either international or continental level, instead, <b>all</b> <b>fall</b> under the athletics authorities.|$|E
