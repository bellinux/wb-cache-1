40|$|In {{order to}} {{constrain}} the thermal histories of chondritic meteorites, a {{detailed study of}} the microstructures of low-Ca pyroxenes produced experimentally and in types 4 and 5 ordinary chondrites was carried out. Cooling experiments on synthetic MgSiO 3 at cooling rates between 2 and 10000 C/hr from the protopyroxene stability field into that of orthopyroxene (OPX) were performed and the products of these experiments were annealed {{for a variety of}} annealing times. There are clear microstructural differences between samples which were cooled and those which were subsequently annealed. A comparison of the microstructures observed in the experimental samples with those in H 4 - 5 ordinary chondrites shows that they cannot have experienced a single stage cooling history, as proposed for the <b>autometamorphism</b> model...|$|E
40|$|All Apollo 14 breccias {{for which}} thin {{sections}} are available (27 rocks) were studied petrographically. From one sample {{in each of}} six groups, electron microprobe analyses were performed on matrix (less than 25 microns) plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine and of rims and cores of plagioclase and pyroxene clasts (50 to 300 microns). Matrix plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine in the high-grade rocks display a narrow range of compositions, suggesting an equilibrated or metamorphic origin. However, in the low-grade rocks {{a wide range of}} compositions, suggesting a detrital or unequilibrated origin, is observed. Partially equilibrated states are observed in medium-grade samples. It is concluded that the Apollo 14 breccias formed as part of the Imbrium Basin ejecta blanket - the Fra Mauro formation. The continuous nature of the metamorphic series suggests that the medium- and high-grade breccias were derived from unmetamorphosed equivalents by <b>autometamorphism</b> in the thick, hot Fra Mauro formation at the Apollo 14 site...|$|E
40|$|Eocene dykes intruding the Ladakh {{batholith}} were sampled {{along the}} southern margin of the Trans-himalayan plutonic arc in Ladakh, NW-India. Approximately 30 dykes were encountered in the 40 km trail between Leh and Hemis Shugpachan. The dykes in {{the east of the}} field are trending E to NE and those in the west trending N to NW, exhibiting sub-parallel orientations within each area. Eighteen dykes were sampled (two of them multiple times) and subjected to petrographic, geochemical and isotopic analyses. They exhibit various degrees of differentiation from basaltic to rhyolitic compositions and are mainly composed of plagioclase, quartz, hornblende (s. l.) and/or biotite and magnetite. Furthermore, dykes {{in the eastern part of}} the field area contain quartz xenocrysts resulting from crustal assimilation, while no relict quartz was found in the west. The dykes exhibit alteration phases and features suggesting that they underwent <b>autometamorphism,</b> i. e. hydration reactions due to igneous cooling. Whereas the dykes in the east of the field area record low-T alteration, the mineral parageneses in the west are typical for alteration at elevated temperatures typical for greenschist metamorphic facies. Al-in-hornblende barometry performed on Magnesio-hornblende and Tschermakitic-hornblende phenocrysts of the least altered dyke indicates formation in upper-amphibolite metamorphic facies conditions and pressures of about 6 kbar corresponding to an intrusion depth of approximately 20 km. Major and trace element analyses and Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotope analyses revealed a stunning variability in geochemistry and isotopic composition amongst the coeval dykes. All dykes exhibit LREE enrichment and HREE depletion as well as negative Tb and Nb anomalies characteristic for subduction-related intrusives and extrusives. Their REE patterns support a clear subdivision into chemically distinct groups. The group hypothesis was further tested and found valid using statistical tools designed to assess similarity/dissimilarity amongst individuals of a group with a common ancestor, such as hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. The dykes are cogenetic, but clearly not consanguineous, i. e. have not formed from one, progressively differentiating magma chamber. The variability observed in Sr-Nd isotopes can be explained by the dykes having undergone differing degrees of crustal assimilation. In particular the dykes in the east containing quartz xenocrysts show negative iiNd) and positive N(Sr) values caused by crustal assimilation, whereas the dykes in the west with no quartz xenocrysts exhibit positive qqNd) and N(Sr) near zero. 39 Ar- 40 Ar dating by incremental heating of several hornblende-bearing dykes revealed crystallization ages between 50 and 54 Ma, whereas two biotite-bearing dykes gave ages of 45 and 37 Ma, likely to be cooling or recrystallisation ages. The combination of structural field evidence with petrographic, petrologic, geochemical, isotopic and geochronological analyses demonstrates that the dykes, although sharing a common origin, i. e. having formed in the same tectonic setting at roughly the same time, have undergone further geological processes leading to an unexpected diversification of the dykes. These findings provide ample scope for further in-depth and breadth investigations on “late-magmatic dykes” in the future. published_or_final_versionEarth SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Among Cretaceous-Tertiary {{boundary}} sites worldwide, {{variations in}} the concentrations and ratios of elements commonly enriched in meteorites complicate traditional geochemical attempts at impactor identification. Yet they may provide constraints on the physical and chemical processes associated with large-body disruption and dispersal, {{as well as with}} diagenesis of projectile components. To this end, we continue our efforts to identify the mineral host-phases of projectile-derived elements, particularly for Ir, and to document their partitioning between crater deposits and ejecta resulting from the Chicxulub basin-forming impact. Building on earlier work, we used INAA to measure Ir concentrations in successively smaller splits of finely powdered impact melt breccia from the Chicxulub Crater in Mexico (sample Y 6 Nl 9 -R(b)), and K/T boundary fish clay from Stevns Klint, Denmark (sample FC- 1, split from 40 kg of homogenized material intended as an analytical standard). Results for the Chicxulub sample show a heterogeneous Ir distribution and document that at least five discrete Ir-bearing host phases were isolated in subsequent splits, having Ir masses equivalent to pure Ir spheres from about 0. 8 to about 3. 5 mm in diameter. Three of these are within a sufficiently reduced mass of powder to warrant searching for them using backscattered electron microscopy. In contrast, successively smaller splits of the Stevns Klint fish clay show no statistically significant deviation from the reported value of 32 +/- 2 ng/g Ir, suggesting a uniform Ir host-phase distribution. For the smallest split obtained thus far (100 +/- 40 ng/g Ir), a pure Ir sphere of equivalent Ir mass would be < 0. 05 min in diameter. (n. b. Although homogenizing and sieving of FC- 1 to < 75 min obviously obscured variations in stratigraphic distribution, it is unlikely to have affected the size-frequency distribution of Ir host phases.) We previously identified micrometer-scale Ir host phases by electron microscopy in melt-rock samples from two widely separated drill holes at the Chicxulub Basin, including a replicate split of Y 6 -NI 9 -R. One is an aggregate of subhedral Ir metal grains enclosed in silicate, in which no other Pt group elements (PGE) were detected. A second particle with twice the mass as the first, concentrated predominantly in a single grain, is associated with minor concentrations of Os, Ru, and Pt, and with adhering particles of corundum and perovskite. A third Ir-rich particle, with a greater apparent Os concentration, was identified before being lost as a result of charging under the electron beam. In addition to demonstrating the preservation of projectile components within the Chicxulub Crater, analogous phase associations in Ca- and Al-rich inclusions (CAI) from C 2 and C 3 chondrites suggest to us that these melt-rock Ir host phases are relics from a carbonaceous chondrite K/T boundary impactor Although the obviously low Ru/Ir ratios of the Chicxulub Ir host phases are qualitatively consistent with suggested PGE fractionation with distance during condensation in an ejecta cloud, it seems difficult to explain the accumulation of the about 3 x 10 (exp 11) Ir atoms required to form a about 10 (exp - 10) g nugget of pure Ir metal within a jet of vaporized projectile expanding at 1 - 4 km/s, or to effectively exclude or remove commonly alloyed PGE and siderophile elements by fractionation processes resulting from condensation, oxidation, sulfidization, exsolution, or <b>autometamorphism</b> during cooling of the melt. We do not dismiss the importance of these processes entirely; on the contrary, other geochemical and mineralogical aspects of the melt rocks require them, and condensation from the expanding ejecta cloud appears to best explain the primary Ir host-phase distribution in the fish clay, as well as the high Ir concentrations associated with spinel-bearing spheroids at the K/T boundary in the Pacific Ocean. If the "relict" hypothesis is correct, micronuggets of other PGEs and alloys, not detected by our INAA screening, should also occur in the melt rocks. Possibly, the discrete host phases with lesser Ir masses are such alloys with subordinate Ir, rather than simply smaller, predominantly Ir-bearing particles. A CAI source for the relics would be consistent with either a comet or an asteroid K/T impact at Chicxulub. (Additional information contained in the original. ...|$|E
40|$|The Precambrian Sierra Ancha sill complex, 700 to 800 feet thick, was intruded into flat-lying {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Apache Group in central Arizona. The {{bulk of the}} complex consists of a central layer of feldspathic olivine-rich diabase and upper and lower layers of olivine diabase. Diabasic rocks present in relatively minor quantity in {{the upper part of}} the complex include diabase pegmatite, albite diabase, and quartz diabase. Potassic granophyres locally form lenses up to two hundred feet thick near and at the roof of the complex. The intrusion was studied in the field and in the laboratory to determine the origins of the rock types and the conditions under which they formed. Extensive electron microprobe studies of mineral compositions and zoning are presented together with nineteen new whole rock chemical analyses. The Sierra Ancha olivine diabase has a high-alumina olivine basalt composition. Olivine diabase and olivine-rich diabase display a differentiation pattern characterized by moderate iron enrichment. Diabase pegmatite is relatively enriched in alkalis. The principle primary minerals in feldspathic olivine-rich diabase and olivine diabase include: plagioclase (An_(72) -An_(16)); augite (Wo_(43) En_(44) Fs_(13) to Wo_(40) En_(38) Fs_(22)); olivine (Fo_(74) -Fo_(54)); orthopyroxene (En_(77) -En_(44)); magnetite_ss (Mgt_(66) Usp_(34) -Mgt_(89) Usp_(11)); and ilmenite_(ss) (Ilm_(86) Hem_(14) -Ilm_(96) Hem_ 4). All of the orthopyroxene is primary. Fe- Mg fractionations between mafic mineral pairs increase with iron enrichment and declining crystallization temperatures. Ilmenite which formed by reaction-exsolution from magnetite was found to be consistently different in composition from primary ilmenite. The late-crystallizing diabase pegmatites contain an assem 5 lage including iron-rich chlorite together with calcic pyroxene; from textural evidence the two phses appear primary. The calcic pyroxene has a compositional range from Wo_(49) En_(28) Fs_(23) to Wo_(49) En_(14) Fs_(37); its compositions define an iron-enriched trend in the pyroxene quadrilateral more calcic (i. e., closer to the diopsidehedenburgite join) than other iron-enriched igneous pyroxene trends described in the literature. Most diabasic rocks in the sill display some deuteric alteration. The mineral assemblage seemingly stable in the most-altered rocks includes albite (An_(2 - 0)), prehnite, calcic pyroxene (saute), chlorite, sphene, and apatite. Albite diabase contains this assemblage and apparently formed by recrystallization of normal diabase under deuteric conditions. The alteration assemblages are similar to those found in spilites. They provide an important example of the development of a spilitic assemblage by <b>autometamorphism.</b> The massive granophyres at and near the top of the sill appear to be igneous. The larger lenses occur at local high points in the roof of the complex near discordant contacts. The granophyres consist primarily of alkali feldspar with subordinate calcic pyroxene, iron-rich hornblende, biotite, and quartz and minor plagioclase and other phases. They have no relict sedimentary textural features, and they contain miarolitic cavities and rotated and displaced sedimentary rock inclusions. Locally, they occur as masses truncating overlying strata and as dikes in the overlying {{sedimentary rocks}}. Some of the dikes have apparent chilled contacts against the sedimentary rocks, suggesting that they were emplaced largely as melts. The granophyres formed as a result of the interaction of diabase magma with stratified rocks of the overlying Dripping Spring Quartzite. The massive granophyres are generally similar in composition to the overlying sedimentary rocks; both rock types have very unusual and distinctive high potassium contents. Contact metamorphism by the diabase has produced layered metasedimentary rocks with granophyric textures and mineral assemblages comparable to those in some massive granophyres. Consistent compositional differences between granophyres and sedimentary rocks may have been caused by metasomatic processes or by mixing of diabase magma with the sedimentary rock material which constitutes most of the granophyres. The interaction of diabase and sedimentary rocks may have occurred because magma in {{the upper part of the}} intrusion absorbed water from the overlying sedimentary rocks and solidified after magma in the central part of the intrusive. If this happened, the sedimentary rocks over the sill might have been melted to form the granophyres. No chilled facies of diabase occurs at the sill roof where granophyres are present. Compositional trends in mineral series indicate that the diabase magma in the upper part of the sill solidified towards the roof in at least one locality. Normal processes of magmatic differentiation produced feldspathic olivine-rich diabase, olivine diabase, and diabase pegmatite in the Sierra Ancha complex. The processes which produced the granophyres include recrystallization and fusion of rocks overlying the intrusion. The Sierra Ancha granophyres offer a superb opportunity to study these processes and others which may have produced many of the granitic rocks in the crust of the earth. ...|$|E
