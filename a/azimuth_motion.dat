Arenal's tremor contains {{as many as}} seven harmonics, whose frequencies vary temporally by up to 75 percent, from initial values of 1. 9 Hz for the first peak immediately following explosive eruptions to 3. 2 - 3. 5 Hz several minutes later. We infer that gas bubble concentration is variable within the conduit and also changes as a function of time, thereby changing the acoustic velocity. We infer that the source is a shallow, 200 - 660 m-long, vertically oriented 1 -D resonator with matched boundary conditions, radiating seismic energy from a dis-placement antinode.

The excitation of outstripping and lagging <b>azimuth</b> <b>motion</b> of the interface {{with respect to}} the cavity is revealed at definite ratios of rotation and vibration frequencies Ω υ / Ω r. The motion is generated by the inertial oscillations arising in the system in a resonant way. The formation of regular spatial structures on the interface is revealed at intensive outstripping motion. These structures have azimuth and axial periodicity and their shape depends on the type of inertial waves arising in the cavity. Intensity and direction of azimuth flows as well as shape of patterns on the granular matter-liquid interface are determined by the ratio Ω υ / Ω r. It is shown, that the lagging motion exists at Ω υ / Ω r 1.

40|$|Moving targets within SAR {{scenes are}} {{distorted}} {{depending on the}} particulars of the target motion. For small motions, the uncompensated phase of a point reflector is a sum of a term proportional to the range component of the target motion, and a more complicated term depending on the <b>azimuth</b> <b>motion.</b> The resulting phase may be analysed with time-frequency techniques since the motion effect may alternatively {{be seen as a}} time dependent Doppler frequency. An experiment performed with a moving target within a scene collected by the German E-SAR system gave a signature that agrees well with theoretical predictions. Time-frequency analysis, using the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville method, gave a linear chirp with superimposed oscillations as predicted from the theory and the target motion. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a useful radar technique to generate images of a scene with fairly high resolution from standoff ranges. SAR imaging of stationary scenes is well understood theoretically [1], and the major issue is the speed and accuracy of the SAR processor.

40|$|Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is an {{emerging}} technology {{that has the}} capability of providing range dependent transmit-domain degrees of freedom via receiver processing. When providing these additional degrees of freedom for target tracking, MIMO radar exhibits a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when {{compared to that of}} traditional single-input multiple-output (SIMO) phased array radar. Previous work has indicated the efficacy of combining MIMO operation with space-time adaptive processing (STAP) techniques in the presence of multipath clutter to improve the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). The tradeoff between target SNR and SCNR in multipath propagation environments is a crucial consideration in MIMO radar. In this paper, a transmit-receive directionality spectrum (TRDS) is used to examine the clutter characteristics at a range-Doppler bin of interest, most notably in multipath situations where MIMO operation is advantageous. In situations where ground clutter is spread in Doppler frequency and <b>azimuth</b> by <b>motion</b> in the propagation environment, the clutter rank can be significantly higher than a Brennan's rule estimate. However, the transmit observability within the MIMO data vector allows for a low rank representation of the clutter when compared to the total available degrees of freedom. A TRDS-based method based on the resolution limits of uniformly spaced linear transmit and receive arrays is presented which furnishes an estimate of the transmit-receive clutter rank in scenarios where Brennans rule provides a significantly underestimated measure.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} collective Hamiltonian (2 DCH) on both <b>azimuth</b> and polar <b>motions</b> in triaxial nuclei {{is proposed}} {{to investigate the}} chiral and wobbling modes. In the 2 DCH, the collective potential and the mass parameters are determined from three-dimensional tilted axis cranking (TAC) calculations. The broken chiral and signature symmetries in the TAC solutions are restored by the 2 DCH. The validity of the 2 DCH is illustrated with a triaxial rotor (γ=- 30 ^∘) coupling to one h_ 11 / 2 proton particle and one h_ 11 / 2 neutron hole. By diagonalizing the 2 DCH, the angular momenta and energy spectra are obtained. These results agree with the exact solutions of the particle rotor model (PRM) at high rotational frequencies. However, at low frequencies, the energies given by the 2 DCH are larger than those by the PRM due to the underestimation of the mass parameters. In addition, with increasing angular momentum, the transitions from the chiral vibration to chiral rotation and further to longitudinal wobbling motion have been presented in the 2 DCH.

40|$|During the EBEX 2013 long {{duration}} flight the payload {{was free}} to rotate in azimuth. The observed <b>azimuth</b> <b>motion</b> consisted of a superposition of full rotations with a period of 10 - 30 minutes and oscillatory motion with an amplitude of tens of degrees, average period of 79 s, and period dispersion of 12 s. We interpret the full rotations as induced by slow rotations of the balloon and the shorter period oscillatory motion as due to torsional oscillations of the flight line. We derive the torsional stiffness of the flight line using the bifilar pendulum model {{and apply it to}} the flight line of the EBEX 2013 payload. We find a torsional spring constant of 36 kg m$^ 2 $/s$^ 2 $ corresponding to a period of 58 s. We conclude that the bifilar model, which accounts for the geometry of the flight line but neglects all material properties, predicts a stiffness and period that are 45 % larger and 25 % shorter than those observed. It is useful to have a simple, easy to use, coarse approximation for the torsional constant of the flight line. Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted by Advances in Space Researc...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes fundamental extensions to the hinge-spring {{model used}} {{to simulate the}} first mode of blade vibration in wind turbine dynamics. Complete equations of motion are developed while allowing for both bending of the blade perpendicular to its chord and overall motion of the rotor in azimuth and yaw. The model examines {{the relationship between the}} natural rotation frequency of the rotor ω and the fundamental natural bending frequency of the blades without including the bending frequency of the tower. In the case of no yaw motion, perturbation analysis and iteration lead to analytical solutions for the bending and azimuth equations of motion that involve as little simplification of these equations as possible. The natural bending frequency is “stiffened” by the rotor rotation and is expressed as a multiple of the rotor rotation, ω∗ ω. While the bending frequency is used in models using the hinged blade, the solutions found in this work contain more detail than can be found in prior investigations. These analytical solutions reveal that the harmonics with frequencies Nω∗ω (ω ∗ + 1) ω and (ω∗ − 1) ω are involved with the coupling between bending motion and <b>azimuth</b> <b>motion</b> with N = 1, 2, 3,…. Subsequent derivation of the power output for the condition of a relatively large amplitude of blade vibration predicts a noticeable contribution to power generation for the ω∗ ω response, which is verified in the data. ^ Glauret 2 ̆ 7 s momentum transfer theory as extended by Wilson and Lissaman [1974] and de Vries [1979] is modified to allow for blade bending, variations of wind speed with time and position, and variations in wind direction with time. No vertical wind is considered. It is concluded that: (1) the bending frequency and linear combinations with the rotor rotation frequency provide an important contribution under {{at least some of the}} expected operating conditions of the turbine, (2) the dynamic mass imbalance produced by the effects of blade bending is not important for an otherwise balanced rotor, and (3) modest non-symmetric effects to the dynamics such as basic wind shear or changing wind speed and direction enhance the Nω frequencies much more readily than the Nω∗ω frequencies. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- The goal of {{this study}} is to explain the peculiarities of {{earthquake}} motion in the Colfiorito basin, central Italy, during the Umbria-Marche seismic sequence. We mainly focus on the ~ 2 min long duration of the horizontal coda waves observed in aftershocks. To estimate the wave-propagation properties (apparent velocity and back <b>azimuth)</b> of the <b>motion,</b> we first determine the time-dependent spectral structure using accurate time-frequency (TFA) analysis, and then we apply high-resolution array analysis to the selected most energetic parts of the motion. Within the frequency range 0. 5 to 3 Hz, we point out that the first part of motion is mainly due to the body-wave resonance (both P- and S-wave). Though the TFA indicates at later times energy concentrations around 1 and 2 Hz, the limited frequency range of the array analysis enables to demonstrate only persistent horizontal coda wave around 1 Hz. The array analysis gives surface-wave apparent velocities of the coda. The back azimuths of these waves are systematically different from those of epicenters. The long duration of the horizontal ground motion in the Colfiorito basin is mainly due to diffracted surface waves along the entire border of the basin, that is, not only due to single reflector...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{estimates}} of the rates and azimuths of Phoenix plate convergence with the Antarctic Peninsula have been derived from plate rotation calculations for two periods in the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary (83. 0 – 67. 7 and 61. 1 – 53. 4 Ma). Published marine magnetic anomaly identifications and ‘flow lines’ interpreted from gravity anomaly maps were used in simple spherical geometry calculations to derive Phoenix–Pacific stage rotations. These were combined with published Pacific–Antarctic rotation data to determine contemporaneous Phoenix–Antarctic stage rotations. The results indicate {{a significant change in}} <b>azimuths</b> of relative <b>motion</b> between the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary. Late Cretaceous, and perhaps earlier, oblique subduction probably caused migration of fore-arc slivers along the margin, resulting in variations in width of the accretionary prism. Comparison between synthetic magnetic profiles and a 900 km long magnetic profile across ocean floor produced at the Antarctic–Phoenix ridge during the early Tertiary establishes the time of a major decrease in spreading rate, and hence also in convergence rate, as chron C 23 r (52. 3 Ma). The associated change in subduction dynamics may have caused the dextral transtensional deformation observed in the George VI Sound region and initiated uplift of blueschist facies rocks now exposed on Smith Island. The calculated convergence history does not provide a simple explanation for the occurrence of high-Mg# andesite lavas on Alexander Island, which were erupted more than 20 Ma before the Antarctic–Phoenix ridge arrived at the margin. The existence of these lavas implies either earlier subduction of another ridge or slab break-up beneath Alexander Island...|$|R

The molecular data support a scenario where stellar winds and supernovae efficiently clear out gas from dense star-forming regions on timescales less than a few Myrs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new set}} of finite {{rotations}} describing the relative motion of the Pacific and North America plates during the last 10 m. y., incorporating recently published studies of the Pacific‐Antarctic, Antarctic‐Africa, and Africa‐North America plate boundaries is presented. These finite rotations show that changes have occurred in Pacific‐western North America motion at 2. 48 Ma and between 3. 40 and 3. 9 Ma, resulting in increased compression along the Pacific‐North America plate boundary. The most significant change in relative motion was of the latter age. During this change the predicted motion of the Pacific plate along the California coast changes from transform to transpressive, due to a clockwise rotation of the relative convergence vector by 12 °. This timing of the onset of transpression agrees well with a variety of geologic data along the California plate boundary, including the onset of compressive deformation in onshore and offshore sedimentary basins, formation of reverse faults and anticlines (which are parallel to strike‐slip faults of the previous, more westerly directed <b>azimuth</b> of relative <b>motion),</b> a change in the orientation of the San Andreas fault, and formation of a set of new, more northerly trending strike‐slip faults. In this model this change in relative motion is caused by a change in the absolute motion of the Pacific plate, due to the detachment of a slab beneath the Fiji Basin between 3. 4 and 3. 9 Ma. The detachment of this slab and the resultant change in overall Pacific plate torque resulted in a noncollisional “orogeny” along the California plate boundary. This study shows that minor adjustments in the motion of large oceanic plates, such as the Pacific plate, can have profound consequences on the preserved geologic record.

40|$|The {{errors in}} plate <b>motion</b> <b>azimuths</b> {{inferred}} from shear wave splitting beneath any one tectonic plate are {{shown to be}} correlated with the errors of other azimuths from the same plate. To account for these correlations, we adopt a two-tier analysis: First, find the pole of rotation and confidence limits for each plate individually. Second, solve for the best fit to these poles while constraining relative plate angular velocities to consistency with the MORVEL relative plate angular velocities. Our preferred set of angular velocities, SKS-MORVEL, is determined from the poles from eight plates weighted proportionally to the root-mean-square velocity of each plate. SKS-MORVEL indicates that eight plates (Amur, Antarctica, Caribbean, Eurasia, Lwandle, Somalia, Sundaland, and Yangtze) have angular velocities that differ insignificantly from zero. The net rotation of the lithosphere is 0. 25 [*]±[*] 0. 11 ° Ma− 1 (95 % confidence limits) right handed about 57. 1 °S, 68. 6 °E. The within-plate dispersion of seismic anisotropy for oceanic lithosphere (σ[*]=[*] 19. 2 °) differs insignificantly from that for continental lithosphere (σ[*]=[*] 21. 6 °). The between-plate dispersion, however, is significantly smaller for oceanic lithosphere (σ[*]=[*] 7. 4 °) than for continental lithosphere (σ[*]=[*] 14. 7 °).

40|$|Poster {{presentation}} abstractsThe World Stress Map (WSM) Project {{was initiated}} in 1986 {{under the auspices}} of the International Lithosphere Program in order to compile the global information on the contemporary crustal stress state. The data come from a wide range of stress indicators such as borehole data (e. g. hydraulic fracturing, borehole breakouts), earthquake focal mechanism solutions, engineering methods (e. g. overcoring), and geological data (e. g. inversion of fault slip measurements). To guarantee the comparability of the different data sources each data record is assessed with the WSM quality ranking scheme. For the 30 th anniversary we compiled a new WSM database with 42, 410 data records which is an increase by > 20, 000 data records compared to the WSM 2008 database. In particular we added new data from more than 3, 500 deep boreholes and put special emphasis on regions which previously had sparse or no published stress data such as China, Australia, Brazil, Southern Africa, Middle East and Iceland. Furthermore, we fully integrated the Chinese stress database and the Australian stress database. The resulting data increase reveals several areas with regional and local variability of the stress pattern. In particular we re-visited the question whether the plate boundary forces are the key control of the plate-wide stress pattern as indicated by the first release of the WSM in 1989 [Zoback et al, 1989]. As the WSM has now more than 10 times data records and thus a better spatial coverage we first filter the long-wave length stress pattern on a regular grid. We determine at these grid points the difference between absolute plate <b>motion</b> <b>azimuth</b> using the global plate model HS 3 -NUVEL 1 A [Gripp and Gordon, 2002] and the mean orientation of the maximum horizontal stress. The preliminary results show that the earlier findings are still valid in principal. However, all plates show in some parts significant deviations from this general trend; some plates such as the Australian Plate show hardly any correlation at all. These deviations seem to be either due to mantle drag forces, different plate boundary forces acting in different directions, additional internal body forces or major structural inhomogeneity’s. O.
