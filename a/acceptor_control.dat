40|$|The LD(_ 50) of 10 -day-old blowflies {{differed}} significantly {{in two different}} stocks, and {{were found to be}} 38. 12 ± 0. 07 ºC for the Durham stock and 40. 8 ± 0. 18 ºC for the Cambridge stock. A transitory increase in heat resistance occurred following the exposure of adult blowflies to a sublethal heat shock. This thermotolerance was apparent 1 h after the application of heat shock, was maximal 2 - 3 h later and had disappeared after 6 h. Oxidative phosphorylation by flight muscle mitochondria from non-thermotolerant control flies was impaired by an LD(_ 50) dose in vivo. Respiration using glycerol- 3 - phosphate was more heat sensitive than that with pyruvate plus proline. State III respiration was markedly inhibited, <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> (RCI) was lost with (G 3 P) as substrate and so ADP: 0 ratios were not measurable; whereas with pyruvate + proline as substrates, although State III respiration was inhibited by 50 % and <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> was significantly reduced, ADP: 0 remained measurable. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation was obvious only with pyruvate + proline where State IV was significantiy increased. The development of thermotolerance protected oxidative phosphorylation against heat damage. With G- 3 -P respiration State III was largely restored and <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> was not significantly different from controls, but ADP: 0 remained lower. With pyruvate + proline as substrates State III respiration was inhibited, but State IV was also lower without evidence of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. <b>Acceptor</b> <b>control</b> was restored to control levels but ADP: 0 values were lower. The lower ADP: 0 ratios indicate some impairment of mitochondrial function occurred. The effect of experimental temperature in vitro on respiratory performance of mitochondria from non-pretreated control and thermotolerant LD(_ 50) flies was also determined between 19 and 39 ºC. State III respiration was markedly temperature- dependent in mitochondria from non-pretreated control flies with both substrates; it was maximal at 24 - 29 ºC and fell progressively at higher measuring temperatures. In mitochondria from thermotolerant flies, State III respiration was less temperature dependent with both substrates, but this effect was more marked for G- 3 -P. The effect of experimental temperature on State IV respiration was similar in mitochondria from non- pretreated control and thermotolerant LD(_ 50) flies with the same substrate, but differed between the two substrates. With G 3 P as substrate, respiration rate rose with temperature with a Q(_ 10) of approximately 1. 5; however, with pyruvate + proline as substrate, the trend was for respiration rate to fall as experimental temperature rose. Differences in the temperature sensitivities of mitochondria from control and thermotolerant flies, in terms of <b>acceptor</b> <b>control,</b> were found. Using G- 3 -P, <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> was lost in mitochondria from control flies above 29 ºC, but was still measurable at 34 ºC in mitochondria from thermotolerant flies. With pyruvate + proline as substrate <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> was demonstrable in mitochondria from both non-pre-treated control and thermotolerant flies at all experimental temperatures. The thermal sensitivities of the respiratory complexes were studied using the inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A. In mitochondria from LD(_ 50) treated control flies respiration uncoupled with FCCP was not restored to State II levels. However, in LD(_ 50) treated mitochondria from thermotolerant flies respiration uncoupled with FCCP was not different from State III respiration. These data suggest that the reduction in State III respiration after heating is owing to an inhibition of oxidation rather than phosphorylation. Complex I, NADH coenzyme Q reductase, was shown to be the most temperature sensitive of the respiratory complexes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveDiscrete morphologic, enzymatic and {{functional}} changes in skeletal muscle mitochondria {{have been demonstrated}} in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We examined mitochondrial respiration in the gastrocnemius muscle of nine patients (10 legs) with advanced PAD and in nine control patients (nine legs) without evidence of PAD. MethodsMitochondrial respiratory rates were determined with a Clark electrode in an oxygraph cell containing saponin-skinned muscle bundles. Muscle samples {{were obtained from the}} anteromedial aspect of the gastrocnemius muscle, at a level 10 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity. Mitochondria respiratory rate, calculated as nanoatoms of oxygen consumed per minute per milligram of noncollagen protein, were measured at baseline (V 0), after addition of substrates (malate and glutamate; (VSUB), after addition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (VADP), and finally, after adenine nucleotide translocase inhibition with atractyloside (VAT). The <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> ratio, a sensitive indicator of overall mitochondrial function, was calculated as the ratio of the respiratory rate after the addition of ADP to the respiratory rate after adenine nucleotide translocase inhibition with atractyloside (VADP/ VAT). ResultsRespiratory rate in muscle mitochondria from patients with PAD were not significantly different from control values at baseline (0. 31 ± 0. 06 vs 0. 55 ± 0. 12; P =. 09), but Vsub was significantly lower in patients with PAD compared with control subjects (0. 43 ± 0. 07 vs 0. 89 ± 0. 20; P <. 05), as was VADP (0. 69 ± 0. 13 vs 1. 24 ± 0. 20; P <. 05). Respiratory rates after atractyloside inhibition in patients with PAD were no different from those in control patients (0. 47 ± 0. 07 vs 0. 45 ± P =. 08). Compared with control values, mitochondria from patients with PAD had a significantly lower <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> ratio (1. 41 ± 0. 10 vs 2. 90 ± 0. 20; P <. 001).

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that injury of {{neoplastic}} cells by cytotoxic macrophages (CM) in cell culture is accompanied by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. We have investigated {{the nature of this}} inhibition by studying mitochondrial respiration in CM-injured leukemia L 1210 cells permeabilized with digitonin. CM-induced injury affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain proper. Complex I (NADH-coenzyme Q reductase) and complex II (succinate-coenzyme Q reductase) are markedly inhibited. In addition a minor inhibition of cytochrome oxidase was found. Electron transport from alpha-glycerophosphate through the respiratory chain to oxygen is unaffected and permeabilized CM-injured L 1210 cells oxidizing this substrate exhibit <b>acceptor</b> <b>control.</b> However, glycerophosphate shuttle activity was found not to occur within CM- injured or uninjured L 1210 cells in culture hence, alpha- glycerophosphate is apparently unavailable for mitochondrial oxidation in the intact cell. It is concluded that the failure of respiration of intact neoplastic cells injured by CM is caused by the nearly complete inhibition of complexes I and II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The time courses of CM-induced electron transport inhibition and arrest of L 1210 cell division are examined and the possible relationship between these phenomena is discussed...|$|E

The fractions were characterized by appropriate microscopic observation. Mitochondria were then isolated from these fractions by differential centrifugation of their homogenates. The {{two different types of}} mitochondria were characterized with respect to certain enzyme activities, respiratory rate, rate of protein synthesis, and their buoyant density in sucrose gradients. The mitochondria from the neuron-enriched fraction were distinguished by a higher rate of incorporation of amino acids into protein, higher cytochrome oxidase activity, and a higher buoyant density in sucrose density gradients. Mitochondria from the glia-enriched fraction showed relatively high monoamine oxidase and Na-' 7 - and K+-stimulated ATPase activities. The rates of oxidation of various substrates and the <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> ratios did not differ appreciably between the two types of mitochondria.

40|$|Isolated {{mitochondria}} {{are capable}} of undergoing dramatic reversible ultrastructural transformations between a condensed and an orthodox conformation. These two conformations are the extremes in ultrastructural organization between which structually and functionally intact mitochondria transform during reversible respiratory cycles. It {{has been found that}} electron transport is required for the condensed-to-orthodox ultrastructural transformation which occurs in mitochondria under State IV conditions, i. e., under conditions in which exogenous substrate is present and ADP is deficient. Inhibition of State IV electron transport at the cyanide-, antimycin A-, or Amytal-sensitive sites in the respiratory chain results in inhibition of this transformation. Resumption of electron transport in initially inhibited mitochondrial systems, initiated by channeling electrons through pathways which bypass the inhibited sites, results in resumption of the ultrastructural transformation. The condensed-toorthodox transformation is DNP insensitive and, therefore, does not require participation of the coupling enzymes of the energy-transfer pathway. It is concluded that this ultrastructural transformation is manifest by the conversion of the chemical energy of electron transport directly into mechanical work. The reversed ultrastructural transformation, i. e., orthodoxto-condensed, which occurs during ADP-activated State III electron transport, is inhibited by DNP and parallels suppression of <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> and oxidative phosphorylation.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the redox-dependent effects of quinones on mitochondrial function. The functional parameters [respiratory activity, membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation] of isolated rat liver mitochondria and mitochondria in intact cells were measured in the presence of eight exogenously applied quinones that differ in lipophilicity and one-electron reduction potential. The quinones affected the respiratory parameters of mitochondria, and dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential as well as influenced (either decreased or enhanced) ROS generation, and restored the electron flow during electron transport chain inhibition. The stimulation of ROS production by juglone and 2, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone was accompanied by a decrease in the <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> and respiration control ratios, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of the reverse electron flow under succinate oxidation in isolated mitochondria. Menadione and 2, 3, 5 -trimethyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone, which decreased the mitochondrial ROS generation, did not affect the mitochondrial potential and, vice versa, were capable of restoring electron transport during Complex I inhibition. In intact C 6 cells, all the quinones, except for coenzyme Q 10, decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential. Juglone, 1, 4 -benzoquinone, and menadione showed the most pronounced effects.

40|$|Abstract: The {{electrons}} transfer (ET) from an atom or a molecule, donor (D), to another, acceptor (A) is {{the basis}} of many fundamental chemical and physical processes. The ET mechanism is controlled by spatial arrangements of donor and acceptors: it’s the particular spatial arrangement and thus the particular distance and the orientation between the elec-tron donors and <b>acceptors</b> that <b>controls</b> the efficiency in charge separation processes in nature. Here, we stress the impor-tance of this concept reviewing how spatial distribution of atomic and molecular self-assembly can determine the quality and physical features of ET process from biology to material science. In this context, we propose novel lab-on-chip tech-niques to be used to control spatial distribution of molecules at nanoscale. Synchrotron source brightness jointly to focus-ing optics fabrication allows one nowadays to monitor and visualize structures with sub-micrometric spatial resolution.

40|$|Wetland {{rice fields}} are source of {{atmospheric}} methane. Methane is formed following reduction {{of carbon dioxide}} by hydrogen and through decarboxylation of acetate in anaerobic soils under reduced conditions. Methane production requires flow of carbon and electrons to microbial population of methanogens under reduced conditions in the strict absence of free oxygen. Application of or in-situ availability of terminal electron acceptors (oxidants) such as ferric iron or sulfate allows iron or sulfate reducers to successfully compete for substrates, hydrogen or acetate, with methanogens. This stops methane production. Electron acceptors also oxidize methane and reduce its emission. Since iron redox system plays a dominant role in tropical rice soils, which are rich in iron, the role of iron oxides and hydroxides as electron <b>acceptor</b> for <b>controlling</b> methane emission from wetland rice fields deserves more attention. For mitigating methane emission from wetland rice fields, ferric iron as a terminal electron-accepting agent, can either {{be added to the}} soil or regenerated in the soil by manipulating redox potential through soil and water management.

Controls were also performed by adding malonate (a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase), pyruvate (a non-competitive inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase), oxalate (a competitive inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase) or N-ethylmaleimide (a blocker of SH groups). A specific malonate-sensitive linear test minus control response for succinate dehydrogenase activity was obtained in liver (1. 6 mumol H 2 cm- 3 min- 1) and tracheal epithelium (0. 8 mumol H 2 cm- 3 min- 1) {{but not in}} heart muscle. All variations in the incubation conditions tested {{did not result in}} a linear test minus control response in the latter tissue. Because the reaction was sensitive to malonate, it was concluded that the initial reaction rate was the specific rate of succinate dehydrogenase activity in heart muscle (9. 1 mumol H 2 cm- 3 min- 1). Test minus control reactions for lactate dehydrogenase activity were distinctly non-linear for all tissues tested. This appeared to be due to product inhibition by pyruvate generated during the reaction and therefore it was concluded that the appropriate control reaction was the test reaction in the presence of 20 mM pyruvate. The initial rate of the test minus this control was the true rate of lactate dehydrogenase activity. The lactate dehydrogenase activity thus found in liver parenchyma was 5. 0 mumol of H 2 generated per cm 3 liver tissue per mi...|$|E
40|$|Objectives of {{this study}} were to {{characterize}} residual feed intake (RFI) in growing calves and to examine relationships with growth, carcass composition, physiological indicators, energy metabolism and reproduction. To accomplish these objectives, multiple experiments were conducted. In all experiments, RFI was calculated as the difference between actual DMI and expected DMI from linear regression of DMI on mid-test metabolic BW and ADG. To examine the relationships between RFI and rate and composition of growth, and reproduction an experiment was conducted with postweaning Brangus heifers (N = 348). Measures of carcass composition (longissimus muscle area, LMA; and 12 th rib fat thickness, BF) were obtained by ultrasound at the start and end of each experiment. To determine if serum IGF-I concentration is associated with RFI, two experiments were conducted with Angus bulls and heifers (N = 95) divergently selected for serum IGF-I concentration. To evaluate relationships with energy metabolism, calves with low and high RFI were selected for determination of heart rate as an indicator trait for energy expenditure (4 experiments) and liver mitochondrial function (3 experiments). Residual feed intake was not correlated with ADG, but was positively correlated with gain in BF such that the more efficient calves were leaner. Calves from the low IGF-I selection line had lower RFI suggesting that RFI and IGF-I are related and that IGF-I could be used as an indicator trait to aid in selection for improved RFI in Angus cattle. Calves with low RFI had lower energy expenditure and greater mitochondrial <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> ratios than calves with high RFI suggesting improved regulation of energy metabolism.

Among several cytochalasins used only cytochalasin A (CA), a thiol-blocking reagent, inhibited respiration of certain bacteria and fungi at low concentrations. Thirteen bacterial species (5 gram positives and 8 gram negatives) were tested for CA-inhibition of respiration. All the gram negative organisms used were CA-resistant whereas the gram positive organisms were susceptible. The CA-inhibition of respiration in gram positive bacteria was rapid, concentration dependent and generally reversible by washing, except in Bacillus subtilis, and not mediated via inhibition of substrate transport. The CA-susceptibility of bacteria was related to their permeability to this compound. Gram negative organisms which were resistant had low CA-permeability whereas susceptible gram positive organisms possessed high permeability. CA-resistant gram negative bacteria became CA-susceptible and CA-permeable when their permeability was modified with EDTA-treatment. Among various fungi from 6 phylogenetic groups examined only Oomycetes and Chytridiomycetes were susceptible to CA-inhibition of respiration. Except in Basidiomycetes CA-susceptibility was correlated with CA-permeation into the cells. Experiments with Achlya ambisexualis, a typical Oomycetous fungus, indicated that CA-inhibition of respiration in this fungus was rapid, concentration dependent, irreversible and not mediated by inhibition of substrate transport. Although Achlya mitochondria in vitro respired the TCA-cycle intermediates pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate and succinate with good <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> ratios, CA inhibited only pyruvate oxidation. In contrast to the irreversible CA-action in intact systems, inhibition of pyruvate oxidation by isolated mitochondria was reversible by washing. Both in bacteria and in fungi CA acts as a thiol-blocking reagent. This thiol-blocking property of CA {{is the key to}} its effectiveness as a respiratory inhibitor. The selective action of CA as a respiratory inhibitor is mainly responsible for its bacteriostatic and fungistatic properties in susceptible organisms. Dept. of Biological Sciences.

40|$|The ABCA 1 {{transporter}} is {{the prototype}} of the A class of mammalian adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporters {{and one of the}} largest members of this family. ABCA 1 has been originally identified as an engulfment receptor on macrophages and, more recently, it has been shown to play an essential role in the handling of cellular lipids. Indeed by promoting the effluxes of membrane phospholipids and cholesterol to lipid-poor apoprotein <b>acceptors,</b> ABCA 1 <b>controls</b> the formation of high-density lipoproteins and thus the whole process of reverse cholesterol transport. A number of additional phenotypes have been found in the mouse model of invalidation of the ABCA 1 gene.

In contrast, the research progress of nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) with organic small molecule as donor and the n-OS as acceptor lags behind. Here, we synthesized a D-A structured medium bandgap organic small molecule H 11 with bithienyl-benzodithiophene (BDTT) as central donor unit and fluorobenzo-triazole as acceptor unit, and achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9. 73 % for the all organic small molecules OSCs with H 11 as donor and a low bandgap n-OS IDIC as <b>acceptor.</b> A <b>control</b> molecule H 12 without thiophene conjugated side chains on the BDT unit was also synthesized for investigating {{the effect of the}} thiophene conjugated side chains on the photovoltaic performance of the p-type organic semiconductors (p-OSs). Compared with H 12, the 2 D-conjugated H 11 with thiophene conjugated side chains shows intense absorption, low-lying HOMO energy level, higher hole mobility and ordered bimodal crystallite packing in the blend films. Moreover, a larger interaction parameter (chi) was observed in the H 11 blends calculated from Hansen solubility parameters and differential scanning calorimetry measurements. These special features combined with the complementary absorption of H 11 donor and IDIC acceptor resulted in the best PCE of 9. 73 % for nonfullerene all small molecule OSCs up to date. Our results indicate that fluorobenzotriazole based 2 D conjugated p-OSs are promising medium bandgap donors in the nonfullerene OSCs. clos...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe pseudoglycosyltransferase (PsGT) VldE is a glycosyltransferase-like {{protein that}} is similar to {{trehalose}} 6 -phosphate synthase (OtsA). However, in contrast to OtsA, which catalyzes condensation between UDP-glucose and glucose 6 -phosphate, VldE couples two pseudosugars to give a product with an α,α-N-pseudoglycosidic linkage. Despite their unique catalytic activity and important role in the biosynthesis of natural products, {{little is known about the}} molecular basis governing their substrate specificity and catalysis. Here, we report comparative biochemical and kinetic studies using recombinant OtsA, VldE, and their chimeric proteins with a variety of sugar and pseudosugar substrates. We found that the chimeric enzymes can produce hybrid pseudo-(amino) disaccharides, and an amino group in the acceptor is necessary to facilitate a coupling reaction with a pseudosugar donor. Furthermore, we found that the N-terminal domains of the enzymes not only play a major role in selecting the <b>acceptors,</b> but also <b>control</b> the type of nucleotidyl diphosphate moiety of the donors...|$|R
40|$|The {{energized}} uptake of {{low levels}} of Ca 2 + in the presence and absence of phosphate by isolated rat liver mitochondria, and the perturbation effected by this activity on ultrastructural and metabolic parameters of mitochondria have been investigated. In the presence of phosphate, {{low levels of}} Ca 2 + are taken up by mitochondria and result in various degrees of ultrastructural expansion of the inner mitochondrial compartment. This indicates that low levels of Ca 2 + {{in the presence of}} phosphate, are accumulated in an osmotically active form into the water phase of the inner compartment. The first clearly observable quantitative increase in the volume of the inner compartment occurs after the accumulation of 100 nmoles Ca 2 +/mg protein. An accumulation of 150 – 200 nmoles Ca 2 +/mg protein, which is equivalent to the osmolar concentration of endogenous K+, is required to effect a doubling of the volume of the inner compartment. This degree of osmotic perturbation occurs as mitochondria transform from a condensed to an orthodox conformation. The osmotically induced orthodox conformation differs from the mechanochemically induced orthodox conformation previously described, in that its development is concomitant with a marked decrease in <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> and oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and it fails to transform to a condensed conformation in response to addition of ADP. In the absence of added phosphate, a maximum of 190 nmoles Ca 2 +/mg protein was found to be taken up by mitochondria (state 6). Ca 2 + is apparently bound under state 6 conditions since the uptake does not effect an ultrastructural expansion of the inner compartment. Phosphate added after state 6 Ca 2 + binding, however, results in an immediate ultrastructural expansion of the inner compartment. The addition of phosphate to mitochondria in the absence of exogenous Ca 2 - fails to effect an osmotic ultrastructural transformation. Under state 6 conditions, the binding of between 40 and 190 nmoles Ca 2 +/mg protein results in the formation of dense matrix inclusions which appear to be composed of tightly packed, concentrically oriented membranes. Under conditions in which the bound Ca 2 + is subsequently released, there is a concomitant loss in the density of these matrix inclusions, leaving behind morphologically distinct membrane whorls in the mitochondrial matrix...|$|E
40|$|Trabajo presentado al 45 th Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) celebrado en Viena del 14 al 18 de abril de 2010. Caveolin- 1 {{has been}} shown to {{function}} predominantly as a scaffolding protein involved in organizing the activity of multiple signalling molecules in caveolae. In addition, caveolin- 1 exhibits binding properties towards fatty acids and cholesterol, suggesting it could {{play a role in the}} intracellular transport of lipids, including cholesterol. We have previously shown that caveolin- 1 deficiency impairs liver regeneration, which is restored upon glucose supplementation, implying inefficient mitochondrialderived energy production. Caveolins can act independently of caveolae and are found in non-caveolar regions of caveolaecontaining cells including ER, Golgi and possibly mitochondria. Mitochondria can be closely apposed to plasma membrane caveolae and caveolin- 1 has been detected in liver mitochondria. Since mitochondrial cholesterol modulates hepatocellular susceptibility to TNF/Fas, our aim was to examine the role of caveolin- 1 in the regulation of mitochondrial cholesterol and fate of hepatocytes following TNF/Fas challenge. [Methods]: Primary hepatocytes and isolated mitochondria were prepared from wild-type and caveolin- 1 knockout mice (KO). Oxygen consumption, GSH, free cholesterol levels, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and subsequent release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo were analyzed in isolated mitochondria, while susceptibility to TNF/Fas-mediated apoptosis was examined in primary hepatocytes. [Results]: Impaired state 3 respiration and decreased <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> ratio were observed in mitochondria from caveolin- 1 KO mice compared to wild-type mice. tBid+Bax-induced release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo was greater in isolated mitochondria from caveolin- 1 KO mice than from wild-type mice. Moreover, these findings were accompanied by higher mitochondrial free cholesterol levels (30 – 50 %) and GSH depletion (40 – 60 %). Consistent with the latter results, hepatoyctes from caveolin- 1 KO mice were more susceptible to Fas-mediated cytochrome c release and apoptosis with respect to wild-type mice, an outcome that was prevented upon GSH ethyl ester pretreatment. Finally, mitochondrial cholesterol extraction by methylcyclodextrin improved mitochondrial respiration and prevented tBid+Bax-mediated cytochrome c release. [Conclusions]: These findings indicate a novel role of caveolin- 1 in the hepatocellular susceptibility to TNF/Fas-mediated apoptosis by regulating mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking and GSH homeostasis, implying that caveolin- 1 could play a role in liver diseases, such as alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

40|$|The {{divalent}} cations, Ca++ and Mg++, {{are known}} to competitively inhibit {{a large number of}} aminoglycoside-membrane interactions, so that Ca++ prevents both the neurotoxic and ototoxic effects of these antibiotics acutely in vitro. Since gentamicin-induced plasma and subcellular membrane damage appear to be critical pathogenetic events in gentamicin nephrotoxicity, Ca++ may play a similar protective role in gentamicin-induced acute renal failure. To test this possibility in vivo, rats (group 2) were given a 4 % calcium (in the form of CaCO 3) supplemented diet to increase delivery of Ca++ to the kidney and administered single daily subcutaneous injections of gentamicin, 100 mg/kg, for 10 d. Compared with a simultaneously studied group (group 1) of rats receiving identical gentamicin dosages and normal diets, Ca++ supplementation ameliorated gentamicin-induced acute renal failure. After 10 doses of gentamicin, blood-urea nitrogen values in group 1 averaged 213 +/- 15 (SE) and 25 +/- 3 (P less than 0. 001) in group 2. The progressive decline in renal excretory function, as measured by BUN, in group 1 animals was accompanied by simultaneous declines in renal cortical mitochondrial function and elevations in renal cortex and mitochondrial Ca++ content, quantitative indices of the degree of renal tubular cell injury. Oral Ca++ loading markedly attenuated these gentamicin-induced derangements. After eight and 10 doses of gentamicin, mitochondria isolated from the renal cortex of group 2 rats had significantly higher rates of respiration supported by pyruvate-malate, succinate and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenyldiamine-ascorbate, higher rates of dinitrophenol-uncoupled respiration and greater <b>acceptor</b> <b>control</b> ratios than those measured in mitochondria isolated from the renal cortex of group 1 animals. Similarly, after 8 and 10 doses, renal cortex and renal cortical mitochondrial Ca++ content of group 2 was significantly lower than values observed in group 1. Thus, dietary calcium supplementation significantly protected against gentamicin-induced renal tubular cell injury and, consequently, gentamicin-induced acute renal failure. The mechanism for this protective effect of Ca++ may relate to the manner in which this polycationic antibiotic interacts with anionic sites, primarily the acidic phospholipids of renal membranes. In this regard, Ca++ was found to be a competitive inhibitor both of 125 I-gentamicin binding to renal brush border membranes, the initial site of interaction between gentamicin and renal proximal tubule cells, with a composite inhibition constant (Ki) of 12 mM and of 125 I-gentamicin binding to phosphatidic acid, an important membrane acidic phosp...|$|E
40|$|A {{magnetic}} particle-based immuno-supported {{liquid membrane}} assay (m-ISLMA) based on chemiluminescence detection of a horseradish peroxidase-labeled hapten tracer that allows sample cleanup, analyte enrichment, and detection {{in a single}} analysis unit has been developed. Antibodies were immobilized on magnetic beads, and {{their position in the}} <b>acceptor</b> was <b>controlled</b> by two alternating opposing electromagnetic fields generated by a voltage applied to either of two electromagnets placed below and above the acceptor channel of the supported liquid membrane unit. The influence of antibody bead dilution in the acceptor was investigated and found to follow the ISLM theory, that is improved enrichment and sensitivity with increasing antibody concentration. Two different extraction procedures were investigated: procedure 1 (m-ISLMA-P 1), which keeps the antibody beads trapped {{at the bottom of the}} acceptor during the entire analysis process; and procedure 2 (m-ISLMA-P 2), which keeps the antibody beads dispersed and in motion in the acceptor phase during the extraction process. m-ISLMAP 2 resulted in 2000 times improved enrichment of simazine and a more than 3 orders of magnitude better limit of detection (LOD 10 %) (1. 29 x 10 (- 5) mu g L- 1) than for m-ISLMA-P 1 (2. 00 x 10 (- 2) mu g L- 1) and corresponding microtiter plate magnetic particle-based ELISA (m-ELISA, LOD 10 % 1. 30 x 10 (- 1) mu g L- 1). m-ISLMA-P 2 and m-ELISA were further applied for the extraction and analysis of simazine-spiked surface water and fruit juice, finding no evidence for matrix influence for the former method; however, indications that trace amounts (nanograms per liter) of simazine or specific cross-reactants were present in both samples...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing {{efforts to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of organic photovoltaic cells emphasize the significance of the architecture of molecular assemblies in thin films, at nanometer and micron length scales, to enhance both exciton diffusion and charge transport, in donor and <b>acceptor</b> layers. <b>Controlled</b> growth of molecules via self-assembly techniques presents new opportunities to develop nano-structured organic thin films for electronic devices. This thesis is focused on controlling the orientation of phthalocyanine molecular assemblies in thin films in order to demonstrate the impact of microscopic control of molecular order on electrical properties and organic solar cell device performance. The studies performed here provide insights into the self-assembling behavior, film morphology, nanoscale electrical conductivity, and photovoltaic properties of a disk-shaped peripherally substituted phthalocyanine (Pc) molecule possessing amide functional groups in the side chains. Amide functionality was integrated in the side chains of this phthalocyanine molecule with the purpose of increasing the intra-columnar interaction through formation of a hydrogen bonding network between molecules, and to guide columnar orientation in a preferred direction via specific surface-molecule interactions. It is realized that molecule-substrate interactions must dominate over molecule-molecule interactions to achieve control over the deposition of molecules in a preferred direction for organic solar cell applications. Microscopic imaging and spectroscopic studies confirm the formation of flat-lying, well ordered, layered phthalocyanine films as anticipated. The remarkable electrical conductivity of the flat-lying phthalocyanine molecules, as studied by Conducting tip Atomic Force Microscopy (C-AFM) provide the impetus for the formation of organic solar cells based on layers of these hydrogen bonding phthalocyanine molecules. The photocurrent from devices that are made with the ordered Pc molecules and disordered Pc molecules as the primary photoactive donor layer, and vacuum deposited C 60 as the acceptor material, were evaluated. The results presented here demonstrate the feasibility of increasing the photogenerated current by controlling the molecular organization in the photo active layer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFluorescence {{resonance}} energy transfer (FRET) {{is a technique}} {{used to measure the}} interaction between two molecules labeled with two different fluorophores (the donor and the acceptor) by the transfer of energy from the excited donor to the acceptor.

Numerous approaches {{can be found in the}} literature to quantify and map FRET, but the measures they provide are often difficult to interpret. We propose here a quantitative comparison of these methods by using a surface FRET system with controlled amounts of donor and <b>acceptor</b> fluorophores and <b>controlled</b> distances between them. We support the system with a Monte Carlo simulation of FRET, which provides reference values for the FRET efficiency under various experimental conditions.
