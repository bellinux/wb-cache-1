Israeli security forces later arrived at the scene. According to a Palestinian official, the Palestinians had attempted to set up barricades in the area to prevent home demolitions by the Israeli Army, but a group of them proceeded to attack the tomb.|$|E

5|$|In late 1956, {{parliamentary}} elections in Jordan resulted in major victories for Arab nationalist and other left-leaning parties. Hussein subsequently appointed Suleiman Nabulsi, an Arab nationalist, socialist {{and one of}} the leading pro-Nasser MP-elects, as prime minister in October. Roughly coinciding with Nabulsi's appointment, the British, French <b>and</b> <b>Israelis</b> launched a tripartite invasion of the Suez Canal and the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, mainly in response to Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company among other reasons. Hussein {{declared a state of emergency}} and his opposition against the invasion and agreed to Egyptian chief of staff Abdel Hakim Amer's request for Jordanian military intervention. To that end, Hussein instructed Abu Nuwar to immediately execute Amer's order to launch Operation Beisan, which entailed a Jordanian-Syrian armored invasion of the Israeli coastal plain, which was seen as Israel's most vulnerable region due to the short length between the coast and the Jordanian-held West Bank. However, Abu Nuwar viewed the operation as far too risky for the Jordanian army and advised Hussein to await Syria's adherence to the plan; Egypt, Syria and Jordan had formed a defense pact days before the Israeli occupation of Sinai on 29 October.|$|E

25|$|Active {{immigration}} and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin {{is home to}} about 200,000 Turks, making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the Aussiedlergesetze enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former Soviet Union. Today ethnic Germans from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community. The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions. A portion of the African immigrants have settled in the Afrikanisches Viertel. Young Germans, EU-Europeans <b>and</b> <b>Israelis</b> have also settled in the city.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a lively}} debate around the shape that a lasting peace {{settlement}} would take (see {{for example the}} One-state solution and Two-state solution). Authors like Cook {{have argued that the}} one-state solution is opposed by Israel because the very nature of Zionism and Jewish nationalism calls for a Jewish majority state, whilst the two-state solution would require the difficult relocation of half a million Jewish settlers living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Palestinian leaders such as Salam Fayyad have rejected calls for a binational state or unilateral declaration of statehood. As of 2010, only a minority of Palestinians <b>and</b> <b>Israelis</b> support the one-state solution. Interest in a one-state solution is growing, however, as the two-state approach fails to accomplish a final agreement.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, Nehru had criticised {{the joint}} {{invasion}} of the Suez Canal by the British, French <b>and</b> <b>Israelis.</b> The role of Nehru, both as Indian Prime Minister and {{a leader of the}} Non-Aligned Movement was significant; he tried to be even-handed between the two sides, while denouncing Eden and co-sponsors of the invasion vigorously. Nehru had a powerful ally in the US president Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using America's clout in the International Monetary Fund to make Britain and France back down. The episode greatly raised the prestige of Nehru and India among the third world nations. During the Suez crisis, Nehru's right-hand man, Menon attempted to persuade a recalcitrant Gamal Nasser to compromise with the West, and was instrumental in moving Western powers towards an awareness that Nasser might prove willing to compromise.|$|E
25|$|Relations between Cyprus and Israel {{have been}} {{excessively}} strong, thus many Cypriots <b>and</b> <b>Israelis</b> usually {{refer to it}} as Cypriot-Israeli brotherhood and consider the other nation an ally and a brother-nation. Cyprus and Israel consider each other as being the only two democracies in the Eastern Mediterranean, leading the leader of Democratic Rally Averof Neofytou in September 2013 to support that Israel is Cyprus most reliable partner. President of Israel Shimon Peres has claimed that Cyprus is Israel's most predictable neighbour. As a sign of the emotional bonding between Israel and Cyprus there has been a high level of exchange of representation for various events in both countries such as the representation of the Israeli government at the funeral of Cypriot fourth President Glafcos Clerides by the Israeli Minister of Tourism Uzi Landau in November 2013 and the visit of the Cypriot Minister of Defence Fotis Fotiou to the funeral of ex-Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon.|$|E
25|$|Michael Palumbo, {{author of}} The Palestinian Catastrophe: The 1948 Expulsion of a People from Their Homeland, {{reviewing}} {{the first edition}} of Morris's book on Palestinian refugees, criticizes Morris's decision, which Palumbo thinks characteristic of Israeli revisionist historians generally, to rely mainly on official, 'carefully screened' Israeli sources, especially for radio transcripts of Arab broadcasts, while disregarding unofficial Israeli sources such as BBC and CIA transcripts, many of which point to a policy of expulsion. He says Morris failed to supplement his work in Israeli archives, many still classified, by U.N., American, and British archival sources that Palumbo considers objective on such issues as IDF atrocities, as well as oral testimonies of Palestinians <b>and</b> <b>Israelis,</b> which can be reliable if their substance can be independently verified. Palumbo says:Morris' regard for documentation is indeed commendable, were it not for his tendency to choose sources which support his views, while avoiding those document collections which contain information inconsistent with his principal arguments. His decision not to use the testimony of Israeli veterans is unfortunate, since some of them have spoken candidly about Israeli atrocities and expulsion of civilians at Deir Yassin, Lydda–Ramle and Jaffa.|$|E
