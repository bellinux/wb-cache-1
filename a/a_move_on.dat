5|$|Bertie the Brain was {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.|$|E
5|$|Operation Spring was {{scheduled}} in four tightly timed phases. The Calgary Highlanders would attack Bourguébus Ridge and May-sur-Orne {{to secure the}} flanks of the main thrust, {{which was to be}} <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> Verrières Ridge by the Black Watch, along with armoured support from the British 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. The plan called for the offensive to start on 23 July but poor weather led to a postponement for 48 hours. Taking advantage of this respite, the I SS Panzer Corps reinforced the ridge with an additional four battalions, 480 tanks and 500 guns. Allied Intelligence learned of this reinforcement through Ultra signals intercepts and advised Simonds's headquarters.|$|E
5|$|On lap 48, Mercedes changed strategies, {{bringing}} in both drivers for another tyre stop, {{much to the}} dismay of Lewis Hamilton, who complained to his team over the radio. Meanwhile, a fight developed between Massa and Ricciardo for fifth place, with the latter making the pass at the beginning of lap 53. On the same lap, Sebastian Vettel spun once more at turn seven, this time hitting the barriers, ending his race and bringing out the safety car. The double retirement marked {{the first time since the}} 2006 Australian Grand Prix that none of their cars were classified. During the caution period, the order stood as: Rosberg, Hamilton, Kvyat, Bottas, Ricciardo, Massa, Hülkenberg, Pérez, Verstappen and Grosjean. At the restart at the beginning of lap 58, Bottas made <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> Kvyat into turn one, taking third place. Over the last laps of the race, Hamilton was able to close on Rosberg, as was Massa on the two Red Bull drivers ahead of him. However, neither were able to overtake, and Rosberg crossed the finish line to take victory, followed by Hamilton and Bottas.|$|E

25|$|Reid {{ruled that}} ceasefires proclaimed by the Ulster Defence Association and the Loyalist Volunteer Force {{could no longer}} be {{recognised}} by the government because of their involvement in sectarian attacks and murders.

25|$|Surely the cry to the stonewallers, {{who are now}} tiresomely {{occupying the}} Test crease, is {{to get on with}} it. 'Wake up and entertain, or you could be drawing {{unemployment}} benefits next week'...remind yourself that England's selectors dropped first Ken Barrington and later Geoff Boycott from England sides after they had refused to get <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> Isolated punishments such as these clearly were not effective. Those drawbridges of defences were brought back {{as soon as it was}} thought to be politic.|$|E
25|$|Carr's natural father, Lucien Carr, was a writer, {{who in the}} 1940s was at {{the center}} of a group of as-yet unknown writers (Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs). In the summer of 1944, he killed his former scoutmaster, a man who was enamoured with him. One night, the scoutmaster {{supposedly}} made <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> Carr, and Carr stabbed him in the chest with his Boy Scout knife. Carr disposed of the body in the Hudson River, and together he and Kerouac got rid of the knife. Carr was sentenced to two years' jail time and Kerouac a few days.|$|E

25|$|On 13 July 2016, {{national}} broadcaster NHK {{reported that}} the Emperor intended to abdicate in favor of his eldest son Crown Prince Naruhito within a few years, citing his age; an abdication within the Imperial Family has not occurred since Emperor Kōkaku abdicated in 1817. However, senior officials within the Imperial Household Agency denied {{that there was any}} official plan for the monarch to abdicate. A potential abdication by the Emperor would require an amendment to the Imperial Household Law, which currently has no provisions for such <b>a</b> <b>move.</b> <b>On</b> 8 August 2016, the Emperor gave a rare televised address, where he emphasized his advanced age and declining health; this address is interpreted as an implication of his intention to abdicate.|$|E
25|$|In retirement, Newsam was {{commissioned}} by the British Medical Association to report into whether it was realistic for doctors {{to withdraw from the}} National Health Service should their pay demand be rejected. He found that the threat to withdraw was unrealistic, and that public opinion would not easily forgive <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> behalf of doctors to undermine the NHS. Newsam's conclusion was unwelcome to the BMA which officially dissociated itself from it. He also served on the police committee of the British Transport Commission. Newsam's health had begun to decline during his last years in office, and he died of cancer at his home in Paddington on 25 April 1964. His name lived on as the Police Staff College inaugurated the 'Frank Newsam Memorial Lectures' on criminal justice matters.|$|E
25|$|Leonard {{also has}} an affair with Raj's younger sister Priya (apparently every time she comes to town), despite a pinky swear with Howard that neither of them would attempt to make <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> her, and Raj giving his strong disapproval. When Priya returns, she and Leonard begin a relationship. Raj {{strongly}} opposes this, and Penny is secretly uncomfortable with Leonard dating someone else, eventually breaking down and crying while talking with her friend Amy Farrah Fowler. Once again, Leonard is unaware of Penny's true feelings. Subsequently, Priya pressures Leonard into ending his friendship with Penny, which he attempts with extreme reluctance. Penny complies, though {{it is clear that}} she does not want Leonard out of her life. Penny eventually resolves to stay in Leonard's life by ingratiating herself to Priya.|$|E

25|$|In October 1960, the 379th wing {{began to}} {{transfer}} its aircraft to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base for storage {{in preparation for}} <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> paper to Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan and reassignment to another division. Although the 823d was originally scheculed to inactivate with only a single wing left at Homestead, {{by the time the}} 379th's move occurred in January 1961 the division instead began preparations for a new role as the command element for dispersed bombardment wings, which would include four bombardment wings at four locations by the end of 1961. The 306th Bombardment Wing at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida and 321st Bombardment Wing at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida were assigned to the wing in early February and the 2d Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia became the division's fourth wing in April.|$|E
25|$|Senna took pole, but Prost {{beat him}} away from the grid and led by 1.4seconds {{by the end of the}} first lap. By lap 15, however, Senna was all over the back of Prost's McLaren after moving through both Williams and Benettons. He whittled down Prost's 5 second lead to just under a second by lap 30, but the latter pulled a few seconds ahead by the 35th lap. By the end of lap 46, with 7 to go, the gap was just over a second. Senna, further back than he had been earlier in the race, made <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> Prost in the chicane before the start-finish straight. True to his word, Prost closed the gap and the two skidded into the escape road and both engines stalled. Prost jumped from his car. Senna, however, got a push from the marshals and {{returned}} to the track.|$|E
25|$|After a lap {{behind the}} safety car, the field were let loose {{again at the}} {{beginning}} of lap three. Vernay closed in on his Italian team-mate, slipstreaming past him on the run to the Mandarin, and doing enough to hold off Mortara into Lisboa. For the ensuing laps, Vernay was doing {{what he had to do}} to keep his team-mate, who had stepped back from GP2 to rid himself of his close defeat to Keisuke Kunimoto in the previous year's race. Further back, Bianchi, who had avoided the first lap incidents was quietly moving his way up the field, and was eleventh by the end of lap seven. Sims had also dropped to the tail of the field, after <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> Cozzolino failed, and he made an unscheduled trip up the Lisboa escape road. Mortara started charging back towards Vernay, and in the process, broke the Frenchman's lap record set the day before. Mortara lowered it to a lap of 2:10.732, lapping the circuit at close to 105mph, and well under the previous record held by Marko Asmer. Cozzolino exited the race on lap eleven, crashing at Black Sands without the need for the safety car to reappear.|$|E
5000|$|Bishops {{are also}} among the three pieces that can [...] "fly". A bishop can make <b>a</b> {{standard}} <b>move</b> <b>on</b> any of the two levels. It can make <b>a</b> normal <b>move</b> <b>on</b> the higher level and then descend diagonally {{in the direction of}} movement, or go up from a ground square to the upper level square directly above it, or go down from an upper level square to the ground square immediately below it.|$|R

25|$|First, the {{movement}} system (and turn structure with it) departs {{from the traditional}} 'everyone takes a turn in order' structure used {{in the vast majority}} of games. Instead a proportional movement system is used, where a little bit of the total movement (termed an impulse, 32 of which comprise each game turn) for all players is resolved simultaneously, so that each can see what is happening and respond to it. This avoids the usual problems with moving long distances without any fire or reactions happening, and keeps in mind that everything is moving at the same time. This system produces two important and well-known effects for movement: on impulse #1 of the game turn no units move (starships are restricted to speed 31 or less) and on impulse #32 (the last) all units move. The former instance means that speed-32 seeking weapons one hex from their targets hit automatically without possibility of interception, and targets at the range limit of overloaded torpedoes (8 hexes) cannot escape before taking fire. The latter instance means that even the slowest units in play make <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> the turn's final impulse.|$|E
500|$|Raymond Benson {{considered}} the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil. This crystallised in Goldfinger with the Saint George motif, which is stated explicitly in the book: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St George had better get <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> and do something"; Black notes {{that the image of}} St. George is an English, rather than British personification.|$|E
500|$|Andy {{decides he}} needs to make <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> Erin (Ellie Kemper) before the day is out, as he may {{otherwise}} never see her again due to the possible impending closure of Dunder Mifflin.

[...] He is worried that Erin only agreed because Naughty Nelly is a promiscuous character.|$|E

Jim tries to convince Roy that it was just [...] "office pranks" [...] and asks Dwight to back him up, but he simply denies any involvement leaving Jim awkwardly embarrassed. Dwight reveals that he had no problems betraying Jim, {{despite the fact that he}} recently fell into one of Jim's tricks.|$|E
500|$|As with Ladenson's {{observation}} that Bond was being depicted as [...] "the worthy knight", Raymond Benson also identifies the Saint George theme in Goldfinger, {{which he says}} has run in all the novels, but is finally stated explicitly in the book as part of Bond's thoughts after Goldfinger reveals he will use an atomic device to open the vault: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St. George had better get <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> and do something". Jeremy Black notes {{that the image of}} the [...] "latter-day St. George [...] again an English, rather than British image." ...|$|E
500|$|Webber claimed pole {{position}} in a drying qualifying session at Silverstone, beating Vettel by 0.032 seconds. The race however did not go as well, as a slow start followed by slow pitstops meant that Webber found himself running fourth behind Alonso, Vettel and Lewis Hamilton. Towards {{the end of the}} race, a strong charge saw Webber pass Hamilton and then close the gap to Vettel's second position, when his team asked him to [...] "maintain the gap" [...] and not try to make <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> Vettel. Although Webber ignored his team's requests and tried to pass Vettel, Vettel was able to hold him off and finish second, with Webber taking third place.|$|E
