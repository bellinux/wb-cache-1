25|$|In epigeal {{germination}} (or epigeous germination), the hypocotyl elongates {{and forms}} a hook, pulling rather than pushing the cotyledons and <b>apical</b> <b>meristem</b> through the soil. Once {{it reaches the}} surface, it straightens and pulls the cotyledons and shoot tip of the growing seedlings into the air. Beans, tamarind and papaya are examples of plants that germinate this way.|$|E
25|$|Pteridophytes, like fern, on {{the other}} hand, do not possess a {{multicellular}} <b>apical</b> <b>meristem.</b> They possess a tetrahedral apical cell, which goes on to form the plant body. Any somatic mutation in this cell can lead to hereditary transmission of that mutation. The earliest meristem-like organization is seen in an algal organism from group Charales that has a single dividing cell at the tip, much like the pteridophytes, yet simpler.|$|E
25|$|Early root {{growth is}} one of the {{functions}} of the <b>apical</b> <b>meristem</b> located near the tip of the root. The meristem cells more or less continuously divide, producing more meristem, root cap cells (these are sacrificed to protect the meristem), and undifferentiated root cells. The latter become the primary tissues of the root, first undergoing elongation, a process that pushes the root tip forward in the growing medium. Gradually these cells differentiate and mature into specialized cells of the root tissues.|$|E

25|$|Post-emergence, {{females have}} a pre-oviposition period {{of one to}} two days. Using their ovipositor, females lay single eggs within the plant tissue, and may lay an average of forty eggs during their lifetime. Females of S. dorsalis prefer to lay their eggs inside of young leaves and buds at the <b>apical</b> <b>meristem</b> of plants, but as populations increase, will lay their eggs within the surface of mature leaves. Depending on temperature, eggs may gestate for one to three weeks. After hatching, larvae will migrate from older leaves to the newer growth at terminals. Like many thrips, S. dorsalis appears to prefer feeding on new growth and young plants, and is often found on the newer top leaves on smaller plants, {{although}} individual plant morphology and chemistry may result in some distributional differences.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} plants, palms have been {{threatened}} by human intervention and exploitation. The greatest risk to palms is destruction of habitat, {{especially in the}} tropical forests, due to urbanization, wood-chipping, mining, and conversion to farmland. Palms rarely reproduce after such great changes in the habitat, and those with small habitat ranges are most vulnerable to them. The harvesting of heart of palm, a delicacy in salads, also poses a threat because it {{is derived from the}} palm's <b>apical</b> <b>meristem,</b> {{a vital part of the}} palm that cannot be regrown (except in domesticated varieties, e.g. of peach palm). The use of rattan palms in furniture has caused a major population decrease in these species that has negatively affected local and international markets, as well as biodiversity in the area. The sale of seeds to nurseries and collectors is another threat, as the seeds of popular palms are sometimes harvested directly from the wild. At least 100 palm species are currently endangered, and nine species have reportedly recently become extinct.|$|E
25|$|In A. thaliana, {{function}} A {{is mainly}} represented by two genes APETALA1 (AP1) and APETALA2 (AP2) AP1 is a MADS-box type gene, while AP2 {{belongs to the}} family of genes that contains AP2, which it gives its name to and which consists of transcription factors that are only found in plants. AP2 has also been shown to complex with the co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) in developing floral buds to repress the C-class gene AGAMOUS (AG). However, AP2 is not expressed in the shoot <b>apical</b> <b>meristem</b> (SAM), which contains the latent stem cell population throughout the adult life of Arabidopsis, and so it is speculated that TPL works with some other A-class gene in the SAM to repress AG.AP1 functions as a type A gene, both in controlling the identity of sepals and petals, and it also acts in the floral meristem. AP2 not only functions in the first two verticils, but also in the remaining two, in developing ovules and even in leaves. It is also likely that post-transcriptional regulation exists, which controls it’s A function, or even that it has other purposes in the determination of organ identity independent of that mentioned here.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apical</b> <b>meristems</b> are the {{completely}} undifferentiated (indeterminate) meristems in a plant. These differentiate {{into three}} kinds of primary meristems.

25|$|This {{class of}} PGR is {{composed}} of one chemical compound normally produced in the leaves of plants, originating from chloroplasts, especially when plants are under stress. In general, it acts as an inhibitory chemical compound that affects bud growth, and seed and bud dormancy. It mediates changes within the <b>apical</b> <b>meristem,</b> causing bud dormancy and the alteration of the last set of leaves into protective bud covers. Since it was found in freshly abscissed leaves, it was thought {{to play a role}} in the processes of natural leaf drop, but further research has disproven this. In plant species from temperate parts of the world, it plays a role in leaf and seed dormancy by inhibiting growth, but, as it is dissipated from seeds or buds, growth begins. In other plants, as ABA levels decrease, growth then commences as gibberellin levels increase. Without ABA, buds and seeds would start to grow during warm periods in winter and be killed when it froze again. Since ABA dissipates slowly from the tissues and its effects take time to be offset by other plant hormones, there is a delay in physiological pathways that provide some protection from premature growth. It accumulates within seeds during fruit maturation, preventing seed germination within the fruit, or seed germination before winter. Abscisic acid's effects are degraded within plant tissues during cold temperatures or by its removal by water washing in out of the tissues, releasing the seeds and buds from dormancy.|$|E
500|$|The parsnip is a {{biennial}} {{plant with}} a rosette of roughly hairy leaves {{that has a}} pungent odor when crushed. Parsnips are grown for their fleshy, edible, cream-colored taproots. The roots are generally smooth, although lateral roots sometimes form. Most are cylindrical, but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape, which generally tends to be favored by food processors as it is more resistant to breakage. The plant's <b>apical</b> <b>meristem</b> produces a rosette of pinnate leaves, each with several pairs of leaflets with toothed margins. The lower leaves have short stems, the upper ones are stemless, and the terminal leaves have three lobes. The leaves are once- or twice-pinnate with broad, ovate, sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed margins; they grow up to [...] long.|$|E
500|$|L. williamsii is {{native to}} {{northern}} Mexico and southern Texas. Individual stems are about [...] high with a diameter of , and {{may be found in}} clumps up to [...] wide. A large part of the stem is usually below ground. Mescaline is concentrated in the photosynthetic portion of the stem above ground. The center of the stem, which contains the growing point (the <b>apical</b> <b>meristem),</b> is sunken. Experienced collectors of peyote remove a thin slice {{from the top of the}} plant, leaving the growing point intact, thus allowing the plant to regenerate. Evidence indicates peyote was in use more than 5,500 years ago; dried peyote buttons presumed to be from a site on the Rio Grande, Texas, were radiocarbon dated to around 3780–3660 BC. Peyote is perceived as a means of accessing the spirit world. Attempts by the Roman Catholic church to suppress its use after the Spanish conquest were largely unsuccessful, and by the middle of the 20th century, peyote was more widely used than ever by indigenous peoples as far north as Canada. It is now used formally by the Native American Church.|$|E

40|$|Plants {{display a}} wide variety of three {{dimensional}} forms, or architectures, that are critical for their survival in competitive environments or, in the case of crops, for their productivity. Architecture is generated after embryogenesis through the activities of shoot <b>apical</b> <b>meristems</b> and root <b>apical</b> <b>meristems.</b> Leaves are the principal lateral organ that determines the plant shoot morphology, and they normally develop in very regular patterns in time and space.

Both programs involve many gene activities as well as the hormones auxin and cytokinin. Apparently, the mechanisms controlling phyllotaxy and plastochron share some regulatory components. In this review, the molecular mechanisms for both patterning programs will be discussed. Â© 2009 The Botanical Society of Korea...|$|R
