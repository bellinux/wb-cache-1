40|$|Chidamber and Kemerer {{suite of}} metrics {{were used in}} the study of 3250 classes from five JAVA based {{industrial}} systems. System 1 had 34 classes, System 2 had 318 classes, System 3 383 classes, System 4 1055 classes, and System 5 1460 classes. Metric values were computed for the Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM), Coupling between Object Classes (CBO), Response For a Class (RFC), Number of Children (NOC), Depth of Inheritance (DIT), Weighted Methods per Class (WMC), Number of Public Methods (NPM) <b>and</b> Afferent <b>Coupling</b> (CA). LCOM was used as cohesion variable; CBO, RFC, CA as coupling variables; WMC, NPM, NOC as size variables and DIT as inheritance variable. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were used to analyze the results. Tests of hypotheses were carried out to examine if there were significant relationships between cohesion and couplingvariables, cohesion and size variables, cohesion <b>and</b> inheritance variables, <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> inheritance variables, <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> size variables, inheritance and size variables. The results of the study showed that in System 1, there were strong significant relationships between cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> (CBO, RFC), cohesion <b>and</b> size (WMC,NPM), <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> size variables (WMC, NPM), and a weak relationship between Affarent <b>coupling</b> CA <b>and</b> inheritance (DIT). In System 2, there were strong significant relationship between cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> (CBO, RFC), cohesion and size variables (WMC, NPM), <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> size (WMC, NPM); a low relationship between <b>coupling</b> by CA <b>and</b> WMC, NOC, and a weak relationship between inheritance DIT and WMC, RFC, NPM. In System 3, there were strong significant relationship between cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> (CBO, RFC), cohesion and size (WMC, NPM), <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> size (WMC, NPM); a low relationship between coupling by CA. In System 4, there were strong significant relationship between cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> (RFC), cohesion <b>and</b> size (WMC, NPM), size WMC and Size NPM. There were low relationships between cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> (CBO, CA) <b>and</b> weak relationships between inheritance DIT and CA, inheritance and size (WMC).

40|$|Abstract:- In {{object-oriented}} programs, classes {{consist of}} attributes and methods {{and they are}} the basic programming units. Therefore, the quality of the classes affects the overall quality of the object-oriented software. Class cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> are key internal quality attributes. Class coupling refers to {{the degree to which a}} class is related to other classes, whereas class cohesion refers to the degree of relatedness of the class attributes and methods. Classes of high quality are expected to exhibit high cohesion <b>and</b> low <b>coupling</b> values. In this paper, using classes of three open-source Java systems, we empirically explore the correlation between class cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling.</b> Five method-interaction cohesion measures <b>and</b> eight <b>coupling</b> measures are considered in the empirical study. The empirical study results show that class cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> internal quality attributes are inversely correlated. The strength of the correlation depends highly on the cohesion <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> measurement approaches. Key-Words:- object-oriented class, software quality, class cohesion measure, class coupling measure. ...|$|R
