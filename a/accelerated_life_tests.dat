40|$|The {{objective}} ofthis {{research project}} {{was to assess the}} reliability of a supercapacitor that was {{to be used as a}} replacement for supercapacitors of recalled products. The supercapacitors used in company XYZ's medical device products had considerable quality problems which caused them to leak electrolyte over time onto sUlTounding electronic circuitry.
