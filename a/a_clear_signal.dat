5|$|Honório Hermeto {{departed}} for Montevideo, {{the capital of}} Uruguay, on 23 October. He chose José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to assist him. Paranhos was a brilliant {{young man who had}} once been a Liberal Party member and protégé of the disgraced Aureliano Coutinho. This surprising choice was <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>signal</b> from Honório Hermeto to his colleagues in the cabinet of his independence. On 21 November, Honório Hermeto signed a treaty of alliance with Uruguay and the rebel Argentine provinces of Entre Ríos and Corrientes. On 3 February 1852, the allies defeated Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom. As a reward for his role, the Emperor granted Honório Hermeto the title of Visconde de Paraná (Viscount of Paraná) in July 1852. The title was derived from the Paraná River, a tributary of the Río de la Plata, upon which free passage rights for Brazilian shipping was secured after Rosas' downfall.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{description}} may have been accurate, many puritanical embellishments were added to better fit the moral story being portrayed by the authorities. The modern medical condition that best fits {{the description}} of the infant is anencephaly, meaning partial or complete absence of a brain. This episode was just the beginning of the attention emanating from Dyer's personal tragedy. The religion of the Puritans demanded a close look at all aspects of one's life for signs of God's approval or disapproval. Even becoming a member of the Puritan church in New England required a public confession of faith, and any behavior that was viewed by the clergy as being unorthodox required a theological examination by the church, followed by a public confession and repentance by the offender. Such microscopic inspection caused even private matters to become looked at publicly for the purpose of instruction, and Dyer's tragedy was widely examined for signs of God's judgment. This led to a highly subjective form of justice, an example of which was the 1656 hanging of Ann Hibbins whose offense was simply being resented by her neighbor. In Winthrop's eyes Dyer's case was unequivocal, and he was convinced that her monstrous birth was <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>signal</b> of God's displeasure with the antinomian heretics. Winthrop felt that it was quite providential that the discovery of the monstrous birth occurred exactly when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated from the local body of believers, and exactly one week before Dyer's husband was questioned in the Boston church for his heretic opinions.|$|E

In 1980, WSET won FCC approval to relocate its transmitter to Thaxton Mountain near Bedford, halfway between Roanoke and Lynchburg. WSET activated its new transmitter in 1982, which gave the station <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>signal</b> in most of Roanoke for the first time ever. However, the FCC required WSET to significantly conform its signal to protect WOWK.

In addition, Goebbels sent him <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>signal</b> that if he left Germany he would never be allowed back, frightening him with the prospect of permanent separation from his mother (to whom he was very close) and his children. Furtwängler considered himself responsible for the Berlin Philharmonic and for his family, and decided to stay.|$|E
25|$|For {{two generations}} of quarks, there are no CP violating phases, {{as shown by the}} {{counting}} of the previous section.

25|$|Each {{receiver}} must {{be connected}} to an external antenna, which is included with the receiver. Antenna placement is crucial to receiving <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>signal.</b> In some locations users have experienced difficulty receiving the Sirius programming because the signal is not consistently strong. For best reception, antennas should be placed such {{that they have an}} unobstructed view of the sky (preferably on rooftops without overhanging eaves or trees). If this is not an option, the antenna should be placed on an exterior wall. When placing on an exterior wall, the antenna should be mounted to a wall which faces the center of the continental United States in order to minimize the likelihood of the building itself blocking the signal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{depiction}} of Jews {{in some of}} Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of anti-Semitism. This case has been presented most forcefully {{in a study by}} Anthony Julius: T.

In [...] "Gerontion", Eliot writes, in the voice of the poem's elderly narrator, [...] "And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner [...] / Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp." [...] Another well-known example appears in the poem, [...] "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar". In this poem, Eliot wrote, [...] "The rats are underneath the piles. / The jew is underneath the lot. / Money in furs." [...] Interpreting the line as an indirect comparison of Jews to rats, Julius writes, [...] "The anti-Semitism is unmistakable. It reaches out like <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>signal</b> to the reader."
