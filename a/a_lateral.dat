5|$|Most {{species of}} fish and {{amphibians}} possess <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> line system that senses pressure waves in water. One of the brain areas that receives primary input from the lateral line organ, the medial octavolateral nucleus, has a cerebellum-like structure, with granule cells and parallel fibers. In electrosensitive fish, the input from the electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like structure. In ray-finned fishes (by far the largest group), the optic tectum has a layer—the marginal layer—that is cerebellum-like.|$|E

5|$|The {{body of a}} {{crustacean}} {{is composed}} of segments, which are grouped into three regions: the cephalon or head, the thorax, and the pleon or abdomen. The head and thorax may be {{fused together to form}} a cephalothorax, which may be covered by a single large carapace. The crustacean body is protected by the hard exoskeleton, which must be moulted for the animal to grow. The shell around each somite can be divided into a dorsal tergum, ventral sternum and <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> pleuron. Various parts of the exoskeleton may be fused together.|$|E

5|$|Warner's {{next two}} years were less fruitful. The 1900 {{football}} team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback Jimmy Johnson would make <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> pass to the halfback running towards the sideline, bringing the defense {{with him as he}} tossed the ball back to the fast-running Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Florida State {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. The Seminoles returned the kickoff to their 22-yard line, and on the first play {{of the second half}} attempted <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> pass. Virginia Tech defender Corey Moore knocked the ball down and out of bounds, causing a loss of 16 yards. Despite the loss, Weinke was able to make good the needed yards with a 28-yard pass to Minor. Minor picked up short yardage on a run up the middle, then Weinke passed for another first down, advancing the ball to the State 45-yard line. On first down, Weinke fumbled, but managed to recover the ball after a five-yard loss. Unlike before, State was unable to regain the lost yardage and was forced to punt. Virginia Tech returned the kick to their 33-yard line, where the Tech offense began work.|$|E

5|$|Domestic sheep are {{relatively}} small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> spiral. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic {{as a result of}} selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E
5|$|During the Syracuse game, Kafka set {{a school}} record for {{consecutive}} completions in a game with 16, breaking the 47-year-old record set by Tom Myers in 1962. He set a new career-high in passingyards in a game by passing for 390yards, breaking his previous career-high in the season opener. Kafka also ran for a three-yard touchdown and threw three touchdown passes along with an interception. He caught a receiving touchdown when he tossed <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> to Andrew Brewer who threw it back to Kafka for a 24-yard touchdown. Kafka became the first Big Ten Conference player to score at least one passing, receiving and rushing touchdown in a game since Zack Mills from Penn State accomplished it on September 4, 2004, against Akron. Kafka finished the game with 35 completions on 42 attempts. However, despite his record-breaking performance, the Wildcats lost 37–34. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week on September 20 for his performance.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell of}} Proclydonautilus, {{like those of}} other Clydonautilitidae, is {{involute}} and smooth.

5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E
5|$|Most starfish embryos hatch at the blastula stage. The {{original}} ball {{of cells}} develops <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> pouch, the archenteron. The entrance {{to this is}} known as the blastopore and it will later develop into the anus. Another invagination of the surface will fuse with the tip of the archenteron as the mouth while the interior section will become the gut. At the same time, a band of cilia develops on the exterior. This enlarges and extends around the surface and eventually onto two developing arm-like outgrowths. At this stage the larva is known as a bipinnaria. The cilia are used for locomotion and feeding, their rhythmic beat wafting phytoplankton towards the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Most {{terrestrial}} caecilians {{that lay}} eggs {{do so in}} burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water. The development of the young of Ichthyophis glutinosus, a species from Sri Lanka, has been much studied. The eel-like larvae hatch out of the eggs and {{make their way to}} water. They have three pairs of external red feathery gills, a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes, <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> line system and a short tail with fins. They swim by undulating their body from side to side. They are mostly active at night, soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land. Metamorphosis is gradual. By the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes, lateral line systems and tails. The skin thickens, embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments. By this time, the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land.|$|E

5|$|Mount Elbert {{is part of}} the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which {{separated}} from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded, which lie on <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> moraine. Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam.|$|E
5|$|Sean Glennon's four {{turnovers}} tied {{a career-high}} for interceptions and brought his season interception mark to 11. He completed 13ofhis26passes for 94yards and a completion percentage of 50%. The passing total of 94yards was the second-lowest total {{in the entire}} season, coming behind only a November 4 game in Miami where Glennon passed for just 86yards {{in the face of}} a tough defense. In a statistic unusual for the 2006 season, Glennon was not the only Tech player to complete a pass. Wide receiver Eddie Royal's 53-yard TD pass made him just the third Virginia Tech player to complete a pass during the 2006 season. The play on which Royal made his throw, <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> WR pass, had been attempted once previously in the season during a 38–27 loss to Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The Browns next {{played the}} Buffalo Bisons in Buffalo, New York. Just over 30,000 people watched the game; while {{this was a}} lower total than the Browns' {{previous}} two games, it set a professional football attendance record in Buffalo. Playing in 80-degree heat, Browns quarterback Otto Graham threw two touchdowns {{in the first quarter}} to John Yonakor and Marion Motley. Cleveland scored for a third time in the first quarter when Cliff Lewis, substituting for Graham, pitched <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> to Gaylon Smith, who ran it in for a touchdown. After neither team scored {{in the second and third}} quarters, the Browns added a fourth touchdown on Chet Adams' fumble return. Al Dekdebrun, Buffalo's second-string quarterback, fumbled at the Bisons' 34-yard line and Adams picked it up and ran for a touchdown. The Bisons were held scoreless despite having more first downs than the Browns. The team played without its primary rushing threat, Steve Juzwik, who was sidelined with a pulled leg muscle.|$|E
