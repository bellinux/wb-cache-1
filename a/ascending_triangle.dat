While the shape of the triangle is significant, of more importance is the direction that the market moves when it breaks out of the triangle. Lastly, while triangles can sometimes be reversal patterns—meaning a reversal of the prior trend—they are normally seen as continuation patterns (meaning a continuation of the prior trend).|$|E

40|$|We {{define a}} novel {{criterion}} of pattern similarity in financial time series data. This criterion is robust, and concurs with human intuition. For fast pattern matching, we introduce a hierarchical piecewise linear representation of financial time series data. The {{piecewise linear approximation}} greatly reduces {{the complexity of the}} raw data, and the hierarchical representation keeps the structure of the time series data. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Patterns in the stock times series data In forecasting stock market, a popular method is to identify prototype patterns in the charts (plots of stock time series data), and forecast the future trend based on these chart patterns. Frequently used patterns include: symmetrical <b>triangles,</b> <b>ascending</b> <b>triangles,</b> descending triangles, Wedges, flags and pennants, rectangles, head and shoulders. Another related problem is to find patterns in the historical data that are similar to the current stock market pattern because many people believe that [...] ...|$|R

When the price is {{breaking}} away from a <b>triangle</b> (<b>Ascending</b> or Descending) with a gap then it can be implied that change in sentiment is strong and coming move will be powerful. One must {{keep an eye on}} the volume. If it is heavy after the gap is formed then there is a good chance that market does not return to fill the gap. When the price is breaking away on a low volume, there is a possibility that the gap will be filled before prices resume their trend.|$|R

Producers always look for the ultimate: ever-accurate, foolproof, technical signals to tell what moves to make in the market. The problem is the markets are an ever-changing phenomenon; no one signal can predict prices with 100 percent accuracy. This NebGuide is design to give readers a feel for different kinds of tecnical signals analysts look for to determine market direction. Major signals discussed are: key reversals, double and triple bottoms, head and shoulders (top and bottom), and <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>triangles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} {{from a number}} of laboratories indicates that humans have the ability to identify fatty acids in the oral cavity, presumably via fatty acid receptors housed on taste cells. Previous research has shown that an individual's oral sensitivity to fatty acid, specifically oleic acid (C 18 : 1) is associated with body mass index (BMI), dietary fat consumption, and the ability to identify fat in foods. We have developed a reliable and reproducible method to assess oral chemoreception of fatty acids, using a milk and C 18 : 1 emulsion, together with an <b>ascending</b> forced choice <b>triangle</b> procedure. In parallel, a food matrix has been developed to assess an individual's ability to perceive fat, in addition to a simple method to assess fatty food liking. As an added measure tongue photography is used to assess papillae density, with higher density often being associated with increased taste sensitivity.

40|$|A high-fat {{diet for}} four weeks {{has been shown to}} {{attenuate}} fat taste sensitivity in healthy weight individuals. However, there is minimal evidence as to whether a single high-fat meal immediately prior to fat taste threshold testing has an effect on thresholds. Therefore, the aim {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of a high-fat meal immediately prior to detection threshold testing for oleic acid (C 18 : 1). Thirty-two participants (15 males, 17 females, aged 39. 1 ± 3. 1 years, Body Mass Index 23. 1 ± 0. 7 kg/m(2)) attended three laboratory sessions. In each session, participants were randomly assigned to one of three different types of breakfast: a high-fat (60 % energy from fat), or low-fat (20 % energy from fat) or macronutrient balanced (33 % energy from fat) frittata. Fat taste thresholds were evaluated using <b>ascending</b> forced choice <b>triangle</b> tests on two occasions each day; once one-hour post breakfast and then one-hour post the completion of the first threshold test. There was no effect of breakfast type on fat taste detection thresholds for the first testing session of each day (P = 0. 288), or the second testing session of each day (P = 0. 754). There was also no effect of breakfast within each day (day 1 : P = 0. 198, day 2 : P = 0. 199, day 3 : P = 0. 125). There was no effect of macronutrient composition on the ability of participants to rank the level of fat in food (P = 0. 345), or preference for the level of fat in food (P = 0. 187 - 0. 868). This study provides preliminary evidence that the composition of the meal consumed by a participant immediately prior to testing does not affect fat taste thresholds...|$|R
60|$|I walked quite {{round the}} hill, and saw, at no great {{distance}} from it, the enclosure of the Protestant burial-ground, which lies {{so close to}} the pyramid of Caius Cestius that the latter may serve as a general monument to the dead. Deferring, for the present, a visit to the cemetery, or to the interior of the pyramid, I returned to the gateway of San Paolo, and, passing through it, took a view of it from the outside of the city wall. It is itself a portion of the wall, having been built into it by the Emperor Aurelian, so that about half of it lies within and half without. The brick or red stone material of the wall being so unlike the marble of the pyramid, the latter is as distinct, and seems as insulated, as if it stood alone in the centre of a plain; and really I do not think there is a more striking architectural object in Rome. It is in perfect condition, just as little ruined or decayed as on the day when the builder put the last peak on the summit; and it ascends steeply from its base, with a point so sharp that it looks as if it would hardly afford foothold to a bird. The marble was once white, but is now covered with a gray coating like that which has gathered upon the statues of Castor and Pollux on Monte Cavallo. Not one of the great blocks is displaced, nor seems likely to be through all time to come. They rest one upon another, in straight and even lines, and present a vast smooth <b>triangle,</b> <b>ascending</b> from a base of a hundred feet, and narrowing to an apex at the height of a hundred and twenty-five, the junctures of the marble slabs being so close that, in all these twenty centuries, only a few little tufts of grass, and a trailing plant or two, have succeeded in rooting themselves into the interstices.|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} supports {{the existence of}} a fat specific oral detection system activated by fatty acids, which conveys the presence of fat in foods. Stability in psychophysical measurement of fatty acids is an essential step in supporting {{the existence of a}}n oral fat detection system as well as supporting the association between fatty acid taste and development of obesity. This study aimed to determine the test-retest reliability of oral fatty acid thresholds. Seventeen subjects (eight males, age 31 ± 2. 3 years, BMI 22. 9 ± 0. 6 kg/m 2, nine females, age 29 ± 1. 8 years, BMI 23. 4 ± 0. 9 kg/m 2) attended 30 laboratory sessions to determine oral detection thresholds for oleic acid (C 18 : 1), linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and lauric acid (C 12 : 0). Taste thresholds were also performed using sucrose (sweet), citric acid (sour), sodium chloride (salty), caffeine (bitter) and monosodium glutamate (umami). Each stimulus was evaluated on six occasions using <b>ascending</b> forced choice <b>triangle</b> tests, over 2 days. Diet records were also collected prior to each testing session. Fatty acid taste thresholds were determined for all subjects and strong intra-class correlations were found for within day and across day testing sessions for C 18 : 1, C 18 : 2 and C 12 : 0. The strongest correlations were found for across day testing for C 18 : 1 [intra-class correlation (ICC) = 0. 78, confidence interval (CI) = 0. 49 - 0. 91], C 18 : 2 (ICC = 0. 94, CI = 0. 84 - 0. 98) and C 12 : 0 (ICC = 0. 80, CI = 0. 54 - 0. 92). Strong correlations were also found for sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami tastes (ICC range, 0. 7 - 0. 9). This study provides evidence supportive of an oral fatty acid specific detection system. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
