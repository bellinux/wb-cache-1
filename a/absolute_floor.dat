40|$|Observations during past {{earthquakes}} {{have demonstrated}} the seismic vulnerability of nonstructural components and equipment with their expensive recovery and/or replacement costs. With {{the exception of the}} nuclear industry, the limited data collected form past earthquakes are not sufficient to completely characterize the seismic behavior of nonstructural components and develop effective mitigation measures. To address these limitations, the University at Buffalo’s (UB-NEES) facility is commissioning a dedicated Nonstructural Component Simulator (UB-NCS) composed of a two-level testing frame capable of simultaneously subjecting both displacement-sensitive and acceleration-sensitive nonstructural components to realistic full scale floor motions expected in typical multi-story buildings. In order to generate the necessary data to evaluate the seismic performance of nonstructural components and quantify their experimental seismic fragility, a dynamic testing protocol capable of replicating expected average <b>absolute</b> <b>floor</b> accelerations and inter-story drifts has been developed. This paper summarizes the criteria considered for the selection of the required UB-NCS servo-hydraulic equipment, the main characteristics of the UB-NCS testing facility and the criteria considered to generate an adequate dynamic testing protocol...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the seismic}} {{response}} {{of a pair}} of linear multistory building structures linked to one another at floor levels by nonlinear passive devices is comprehensively evaluated. Three possible height-wise distributions of the connectors were analyzed for wide ranges of values of their characteristic constants. Two response quantities were considered: interstory drift and <b>absolute</b> <b>floor</b> acceleration. Results indicate that, while it is possible to reduce both response quantities in both buildings, the level of response reduction generally decreases with decreasing values of damper exponent α. Results also indicate that the response of the systems is not sensitive to the height-wise distribution of the connecting dampers. Finally, it was also found that the optimal value of the damper exponent α depends on the value of the sum of the damper coefficients of the linking devices (c 1 +c 2 = C) : while the optimal value of α is 0. 80 when the value of C is relatively low, the optimal value of α is 1. 00 (i. e., a linear viscous damper) when the value of C is relatively hig...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{control of}} 1 -DOF Active Vibration Isolation System (AVIS) using Frequency-Shaped Sliding Surface Control (FSSSC) {{approach}} {{based on the}} measurement schemes of the relative displacement and the <b>floor</b> <b>absolute</b> velocity/acceleration. Seismic velocity/acceleration sensors usually have large dimensions and mass which sometimes cause difficulties to fix them to the payload. The FSSSC approach has been recently applied to AVIS control and generalized as a two-step AVIS control design method. It is simple and has validated robust performance. Assuming linear regulation, both sliding surface design and the robustness of the realized performance are studied. The realized transmissibility {{is limited by the}} displacement sensor noise at high frequencies. The FSSSC designs of an example 1 -DOF plant with the measurement schemes of the relative displacement and the <b>floor</b> <b>absolute</b> velocity/acceleration are provided.

40|$|Seismic {{isolation}} {{systems are}} widely used to protect reinforced concrete (RC) structures against the effects of strong ground motions. After a magnitude 6. 6 earthquake, the outpatient building of Lushan People’s hospital in China remained in good condition due to the seismic isolation technology, while the non-isolated older outpatient building nearby experienced major damage. The building provides {{a good opportunity to}} study and assess the contribution of isolation systems to seismic performance of RC structures. In the current research project, the isolated outpatient building was modelled and analyzed using computer software SAP 2000. The post-yield behaviour of the structure was modelled by assigning multi-linear plastic links to frame objects. The rubber isolators were represented by rubber isolator link elements, assigned as a single joint element between the ground and the superstructure. The isolated structure was subjected to four earthquake records with increasing intensity. The performances of the isolated structure were compared with those of the fixed-base structures in terms of lateral inter-storey drifts, peak <b>absolute</b> <b>floor</b> accelerations, and residual drifts. The laminated rubber bearings, the high damping isolation devices, composed of rubber bearings and viscous dampers, and the hybrid isolation system of rubber bearings and friction pendulum bearings were analysed. The effectiveness of the three base isolation systems considered in enhancing structural performance was investigated. The results show the level of improvement attained in seismic response by each system. They also illustrate that the rubber bearings coupled with friction pendulum bearings produce the best drift control without causing excessive horizontal displacements at the base level and without adversely affecting floor accelerations...|$|E
40|$|Retrofit {{strategies}} {{based on}} softening techniques with supplemental damping have shown promise in reducing dynamic response of civil infrastructures {{as compared with}} other optimal retrofit techniques. This technique involves the determination of optimal locations and corresponding capacities of dampers and softened stories. The three optimal design methodologies {{presented in this paper}} are capable of determining optimal locations and optimal stiffnesses and capacities of softened stories and dampers placed in a building. Initially, a preliminary design procedure based on a spectral approach is used to estimate global stiffness modification and total damping which should be Lidded to the original building. This procedure allows for reducing the maximum expected spectral demands to acceptable levels. The first method presented for the structural performance optimization is based on a procedure for finding optimal storey stiffnesses and damper placements that minimize the sum of amplitudes of the transfer functions of inter-storey drifts. The second approach is based on concepts of optimal control theory through an adaptation of a gain matrix obtained from using the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) algorithm. The third method is a modification of the simplified sequential search algorithm that uses a performance index, which considers inter-storey drifts and <b>absolute</b> <b>floor</b> velocities and accelerations to find the optimum placement of damping devices and storey stiffnesses. Two examples of shear-type buildings with uniform and non-uniform initial stiffness distributions are presented to show effectiveness of the proposed design methodologies. The optimum distributions obtained using these optimization methods are compared using response time history analysi...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The steel diagrid {{structural}} {{system is a}} recent load bearing and lateral resisting {{structural system}} for tall building structures that is relatively unexplored in the western United States. One possible reason for the little use of diagrid systems in earthquake prone regions {{is the lack of}} guidelines and application examples illustrating the design and analysis of these structures. In this work, a prototype building with 72 stories is used as an example for which the design and analysis of the diagrid system is performed. To mitigate the possible large displacement and base shear demands that these structures may undergo under seismic events, two new design solutions consisting of one or two friction tuned mass damper (TMD) units are explored. In the first solution, a TMD is placed on the top four stories of the building and is tuned to reduce the contribution of the fundamental mode of vibration of the structure. The second solution uses a double TMD system, in which a second TMD unit - tuned to the second period of the structure – is added at mid-height of the building. Using a nonlinear finite element model of the tuned mass damper, the effectiveness of the friction mass damper design is studied. The mass damper system consists of a concrete tank containing sand or water. The tank is placed in between the building reinforce concrete structural core and the exterior steel diagrid system. This mass damper is connected to the structure using friction pendulum isolators which are chosen due to their ability to undergo large deformations. The models are then subjected to earthquake ground motions from historical shallow crustal and subduction-zone events. Parametric studies are carried out to optimize the mass damper design in improving the seismic performance of the building. Optimization of the seismic performance is assessed in terms of minimization of inter-story drift ratios, base and story forces, as well as floor absolute accelerations. The results show that the single TMD system can reduce significantly the peak base reaction and inter-story drift envelopes. Addition of the second TMD provides further improvements in terms of reducing the peak base reactions, while also producing notable reductions in peak <b>absolute</b> <b>floor</b> accelerations, which are not observed when only one TMD unit is used...|$|E
40|$|Analytical seismic {{response}} of multi-storey buildings isolated by lead–rubber bearings (LRB) is investigated under near-fault motions. The superstructure is idealized as a linear shear type flexible building. The force–deformation behaviour of the LRB is modelled as bilinear with viscous damping. The governing {{equations of motion}} of the isolated structural system are derived and the {{response of}} the system to normal component of six recorded near-fault motions is evaluated by step-by-step numerical method. The variation of top <b>floor</b> <b>absolute</b> acceleration and bearing displacement of the isolated building is plotted under different system parameters such as superstructure flexibility, isolation period and bearing yield strength. The comparison of results indicated that for low bearing yield strength there is significant displacement in the bearing under near-fault motions. In addition, there also exists a particular value of the yield strength of the LRB for which the top <b>floor</b> <b>absolute</b> acceleration of the building attains the minimum value. Further, the optimum bearing yield strength is derived for different system parameters under near-fault motions. The criteria selected for optimality are the minimization of both the top floor acceleration and the bearing displacement. The optimum yield strength of the LRB is found to be in the range of 10 %– 15 % of the total weight of the building under near-fault motions. In addition, the response of bridge seismically isolated by the LRB is also investigated and found that there exists a particular value of the bearing yield strength for which the pier base shear and deck acceleration attain the minimum value under near-fault motions. © Elsevie...|$|R

The airframe noise of the envisioned advanced subsonic transport is 2 EPNdB less than the largest contributor to the total aircraft noise, the fan inlet. The noise impact of the airframe noise, as measured by noise contour area, is 1 / 4 that of fan noise. Further fan noise reduction efforts should not view airframe noise as an <b>absolute</b> noise <b>floor.</b> In the second part of the paper, the results from one recent cavity noise wind tunnel experiment is reported. A cavity of dimensions 11. 25 in. (28. 58 cm) long, 2. 5 in. (6. 35 cm) wide, and variable depth was tested in the Mach number range of. 20 through. 90.

In general, the deeper the cavity, the greater the amplitude of the acoustic tones. Reynolds number appeared to have little effect on acoustic tone amplitudes. Tone amplitude and bandwidth changed with Mach number. The effect of yaw on acoustic tones varied with Reynolds number, Mach number, 1 /h, and mode number.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Comprehensive {{experimental}} and analytical {{studies have been}} conducted to understand the behaviour of frame buildings constructed before the introduction of modern design codes. This usually has been done assuming a fixed-base structure while ignoring the flexibility of soil. The interaction between the super-structure and sub-structure (SSI) is investigated by modelling the soil as simple as possible to capture the overall response of the system. As new analytical hysteresis rules and more advanced tools of analysis have been developed in recent years, and as part of a more comprehensive investigation on the response of older structures before and after retrofit, focus will be herein given on the response of SDOF systems representing a broad range of existing, newly designed and, retrofitted structures, while allowing for flexibility of the soil-foundation system. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the compliance of simply modelled soil for typical building structures have in average beneficial effects in terms of structural demand especially in the case where as a consequence of implementing a retrofit strategy, the stiffness of the structure might increase. On the other hand, the governing component of these effects, i. e. rocking of foundation, can result on average in higher <b>absolute</b> displacement of <b>floors.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{friction}} coefficient of a sliding {{system with a}} restoring force for the minimum acceleration response of a base-isolated structure under earthquake ground motion is investigated. The stochastic model of El-Centro 1940 earthquake which preserves the non-stationary evolution of amplitude and frequency content of the original record {{is used for the}} model of earthquake. The base-isolated structure consists of a linear flexible multi-storey structure supported on the sliding system. The sliding system is modelled to provide a friction force (ideal Coulomb-friction type) and a linear restoring force. The non-stationary stochastic response of the isolated structure is obtained using the time dependent equivalent linearisation technique as the force-deformation behaviour of the sliding system is highly non-linear. The response of the system is analysed for the optimum {{friction coefficient}} of the sliding base isolation system. The criterion selected for optimality is the minimisation of the root mean square top <b>floor</b> <b>absolute</b> acceleration. The optimum friction coefficient of sliding isolation system is obtained under important parametric variations such as: period and damping of the superstructure, ratio of the base mass to the superstructure floor mass, the damping ratio of the isolation system, the period of base isolation system and the intensity of earthquake excitation. It has been shown that the above parameters have significant effects on optimum friction coefficient of the sliding base isolation system. © Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of isolator characteristics on the seismic response of multi-story base-isolated structure is investigated. The isolated building is modeled as a shear type structure with lateral degree-of-freedom at each floor. The isolators are modeled by using two different mathematical models depicted by bi-linear hysteretic and equivalent linear elastic–viscous behaviors. The coupled differential {{equations of motion}} for the isolated system are derived and solved in the incremental form using Newmark’s step-by-step method of integration. The variation of top <b>floor</b> <b>absolute</b> acceleration and bearing displacement for various bi-linear systems under different earthquakes is computed to {{study the effects of}} the shape of the isolator hysteresis loop. The {{influence of}} the shape of isolator force-deformation loop on the response of isolated structure is studied under the variation of important system parameters such as isolator yield displacement, superstructure flexibility, isolation time period and number of story of the base-isolated structure. It is observed that the code specified equivalent linear elastic–viscous damping model of a bi-linear hysteretic system overestimates the design bearing displacement and underestimates the superstructure acceleration. The response of base-isolated structure is significantly influenced by the shape of hysteresis loop of isolator. The low value of yield displacement of isolator (i. e. sliding type isolation systems) tends to increase the superstructure accelerations associated with high frequencies. Further, the superstructure acceleration also increases with the increase of the superstructure flexibility. © Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{response}} of multi-story building supported on various base isolation systems during impact with adjacent structures is investigated. The isolated building is modeled as a shear type structure with lateral degree-of-freedom at each floor. An impact {{element in the}} form of spring and dashpot is used to model the adjacent structure (i. e. retaining wall or entry bridge). The coupled differential equations of motion for the isolated system are derived and solved in the incremental form using Newmark’s step-by-step iteration method. The variation of top <b>floor</b> <b>absolute</b> acceleration and bearing displacement for different isolation systems during impact upon the adjacent structures under different earthquakes is computed to study the behavior of the building during impact and comparative performance of various isolation systems. The impact {{response of}} isolated building is studied under the variation of important system parameters such as size of gap, stiffness of impact element, superstructure flexibility and number of story of base-isolated building. It is concluded that the response of base-isolated structures is affected when impact takes place with the adjacent structures and hence need to be avoided. The superstructure acceleration increases and the bearing displacement decreases due to impact with adjacent structure. However, even after the occurrence of impact phenomenon, the isolation remained effective as compared to the non-isolated structure. Further, it is also observed that superstructure acceleration increases with the increase of the isolation gap up to a certain value and then the acceleration decreases with further increase of gap. The effects of impact are found to be severe for the system with flexible superstructure, increased number of story and greater stiffness of the adjacent structure. © Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} and rigorous probabilistic methodology for performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) {{has been under}} development under the auspice of the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Center over the past thirteen years. The probabilistic estimation of the seismic demand {{is an important part}} of the PBEE methodology and consists of a two-step procedure: probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), and probabilistic seismic demand analysis (PSDA). Two shortcomings are identified in past applications of the PBEE methodology : (i) the use of a single, or scalar, ground motion intensity measure (IM) which is typically taken as the 5 % damped linear spectral acceleration, Sa(T 1), at the fundamental period of the structure; and (ii) the use of testbed applications based on two- dimensional (2 -D) finite element (FE) models (e. g., 2 -D frame models) of the considered structures, which are three-dimensional in nature and cannot always be reduced to 2 -D models. Sa(T₁) represents an inefficient and insufficient predictor of the nonlinear structural response for structures with significant higher mode effects and significantly different fundamental periods in two orthogonal directions. This dissertation addresses both shortcomings. First, a simplified and computationally efficient vector-valued PSHA (VPSHA), making use of USGS scalar probabilistic seismic hazard maps results, is proposed. Second, a PSDA of an advanced 3 -D nonlinear FE model of the 13 -story National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) reinforced-concrete frame-wall building design example is performed based on the simplified VPSHA for a specific site located in Berkeley, California. Nonlinear dynamic time-history analyses (NDTHA) are performed by subjecting the 3 -D nonlinear FE model to an ensemble of 90 bi-directional (horizontal) historical earthquake ground motions. The FE model was developed in OpenSees and results of the FE analyses are used to establish a statistical model between the IMs and different EDPs (e. g., roof drift ratio, interstory drift ratios, and <b>floor</b> <b>absolute</b> accelerations). Based on the computational results from NDTHA, it is found that, for the building structure considered, a vector-valued IM consisting of multiple spectral accelerations at different periods of interest is a sufficient and more efficient predictor of the structural response, and therefore provides for more reliable and mode accurate PSDA result...|$|R
