25|$|Most lenses have an {{adjustable}} diaphragm, which changes {{the size of}} the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> and thus the entrance pupil size. The entrance pupil diameter is not necessarily equal to the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> diameter, because of the magnifying effect of lens elements in front of the aperture.|$|E
25|$|In some contexts, {{especially}} in photography and astronomy, aperture {{refers to the}} diameter of the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> rather than the physical stop or the opening itself. For example, in a telescope, the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> is typically the edges of the objective lens or mirror (or of the mount that holds it). One then speaks of a telescope as having, for example, a 100-centimeter aperture. Note that the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> is not necessarily the smallest stop in the system. Magnification and demagnification by lenses and other elements can cause a relatively large stop to be the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> for the system. In astrophotography, the aperture may be given as a linear measure (for example in inches or mm) or as the dimensionless ratio between that measure and the focal length. In other photography, it is usually given as a ratio.|$|E
25|$|A larger <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> {{requires}} larger diameter optics, {{which are}} heavier and more expensive.|$|E
50|$|In Autogain framing live view, {{such as in}} AE modes with Auto ISO in effect, {{using the}} dof button can take on two {{different}} effects: autogain during <b>aperture</b> <b>stopped</b> down (easy to see dof preview), and autogain-locked or suspended during <b>aperture</b> <b>stopped</b> down (difficult to see dof, just like looking with a non-live view DSLR of optical viewfinder (OVF) preview through-the-lens (TTL).|$|R

Nikon F mount lenses (except 'a cine variant') also feature a CPU and aperture connection for Exif data and exposure measuring, they are labelled as AE.|$|R
40|$|Techniques and {{instrumentation}} for submillimeter photometry are discussed. The described photometer {{is designed}} to work over the wavelength range 2 mm to 300 microns and uses bandpass filters to isolate the windows at 1200, 850 - 750, and 450 - 350 microns. Information on atmospheric transmission for various amounts of water vapor is presented. The photometer uses <b>aperture</b> <b>stops,</b> selective filters, sky chopping, Fabry optics, and an inbuilt offset guider. Observation and calibration procedures are considered, and preliminary results for Rho Oph, Sgr B 2, and W 51 are reported...|$|R
25|$|The stop {{determines whether}} the image will be vignetted. Larger stops {{can cause the}} {{intensity}} reaching the film or detector to fall off toward {{the edges of the}} picture, especially when, for off-axis points, a different stop becomes the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> by virtue of cutting off more light than did the stop that was the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> on the optic axis.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{stops and}} {{diaphragms}} are called apertures, {{even when they}} are not the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> of the system.|$|E
25|$|In astronomy, the {{diameter}} of the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> (called the aperture) is a critical parameter in the design of a telescope. Generally, one would want the aperture to be as large as possible, to collect the maximum amount of light from the distant objects being imaged. The size of the aperture is limited, however, in practice by considerations of cost and weight, as well as prevention of aberrations (as mentioned above).|$|E
25|$|Most SLR cameras provide {{automatic}} aperture control, {{which allows}} viewing and metering at the lens's maximum <b>aperture,</b> but <b>stops</b> the lens {{down to the}} working aperture during exposure, and returns the lens to maximum aperture afterward.|$|R
50|$|Most SLR cameras provide {{automatic}} aperture control, {{which allows}} viewing and metering at the lens’s maximum <b>aperture,</b> <b>stops</b> the lens {{down to the}} working aperture during exposure, and returns the lens to maximum aperture after exposure. For perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage is impractical, and automatic aperture control was not offered on the first such lenses. Many PC and TS lenses incorporated a feature known as a “preset” aperture, which lets the photographer set the lens to working aperture, and then quickly switch between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the aperture control. Though slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation.|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} {{principle of}} exposure is reciprocity. If one exposes the film or sensor {{for a longer}} period, a reciprocally smaller aperture is required {{to reduce the amount}} of light hitting the film to obtain the same exposure. For example, the photographer may prefer to make his sunny-16 shot at an aperture of [...] (to obtain a shallow depth of field). As [...] is 3 stops [...] "faster" [...] than , with each stop meaning double the amount of light, a new shutter speed of (1/125)/(2·2·2) = 1/1000 s is needed. Once the photographer has determined the exposure, <b>aperture</b> <b>stops</b> can be traded for halvings or doublings of speed, within limits.|$|R
25|$|The word stop is {{sometimes}} confusing {{due to its}} multiple meanings. A stop can be a physical object: an opaque part of an optical system that blocks certain rays. The <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> is the aperture setting that limits {{the brightness of the}} image by restricting the input pupil size, while a field stop is a stop intended to cut out light that would be outside the desired field of view and might cause flare or other problems if not stopped.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} of a laser {{is based on}} the concept of accessible emission limits (AEL) that are defined for each laser class. This is usually a maximum power (in W) or energy (in J) that can be emitted in a specified wavelength range and exposure time that passes through a specified <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> at a specified distance. For infrared wavelengths above 4 μm, it is specified as a maximum power density (in W/m2). It {{is the responsibility of the}} manufacturer to provide the correct {{classification of}} a laser, and to equip the laser with appropriate warning labels and safety measures as prescribed by the regulations. Safety measures used with the more powerful lasers include key-controlled operation, warning lights to indicate laser light emission, a beam stop or attenuator, and an electrical contact that the user can connect to an emergency stop or interlock.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> is an {{important}} element in most optical designs. Its most obvious feature is that it limits the amount of light that can reach the image/film plane. This can be either unavoidable, as in a telescope where one wants to collect as much light as possible; or deliberate, to prevent saturation of a detector or overexposure of film. In both cases, the size of the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> is constrained by things other than the amount of light admitted; however: ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{advanced}} exposure simulation live (pre-)view ES-LV on Canon's prosumer Powershots {{was absent}} on all interchangeable-lens DSLRs till Canon introduced a first ES-LV for an interchangeable-lens DSLR (they dubbed it: [...] "ExpSim LV" [...] version) in its EOS 20Da, to preview star exposures live, which {{was similar to}} ES-LV found in its advanced prosumer Powershot digicams. Later, Canon extended its more sophisticated DSLR ExpSim LV all shooting light conditions like its Powershot digicams. The most significant advances and difference in DSLR version of ES-LV was simulating exposure changes effects with chosen <b>aperture</b> changes without <b>stopping</b> down the <b>aperture.</b> The ES-LV of its Powershot digicams always kept its <b>apertures</b> <b>stopped</b> down, so no 'aperture exposure simulation' was needed, and briefly opened aperture to assess focus with shutter button partially depressed before a shot is taken. The ExpSim LV of its EOS lens DSLRs could achieve the same 'exposure simulation' effect in both aperture stop-down mode and aperture wide open of its EOS lenses, even if the aperture selection was narrower than widest diameter (wide open).|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} the {{development}} of a spectrograph for confirming the size of the particles in a particle cloud is described. With the wavelength dependency of Mie-scattering, it can be determined if the particles are of the desired size. There is a significant trade-off effect between size and resolution of an optical system. The spherical aberrations that arise due to the focal length being short compared to the lens diameter are reduced by using lens combinations called achromatic doublets, both as collimating and focusing lenses. The manufactured spectrograph has a resolution of about 10 nm that is approximately as expected from the optical design. But the spectrograph suffers from stray light. This remains to be reduced with <b>aperture</b> <b>stops,</b> non-reflective interior and fore-optics...|$|R
5000|$|Some lenses {{were marked}} by T-stops (transmission stops) instead of f-stops to {{indicate}} the light losses. T-stops were [...] "true" [...] or effective <b>aperture</b> <b>stops</b> and were common for motion picture lenses, so that a cinematographer could ensure that consistent exposures were made by all the different lenses {{used to make a}} movie. This was less important for still cameras and only one still lens line was ever marked in T-stops: for the Bell & Howell Foton 35mm rangefinder camera. Bell & Howell was normally a cinematographic equipment maker. The Foton's standard lens was the Taylor, Taylor & Hobson Cooke Amotal Anastigmat 2 inch f/2 (T/2.2) (1948; camera USA; lens UK, a Double Gauss). The quarter stop difference between f/2 and T/2.2 is a 16% loss.|$|R
2500|$|In astronomy, the {{f-number}} {{is commonly}} referred to as the focal ratio (or f-ratio) notated as [...] It is still defined as the focal length [...] of an objective divided by its diameter [...] or by the diameter of an <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> in the system: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to an <b>aperture</b> <b>stop,</b> a photographic lens may have one or more field stops, which limit the system's field of view.

50|$|Early {{instances}} of forced perspective used in low-budget motion pictures showed objects that were clearly {{different from their}} surroundings: often blurred or at a different light level. The principal cause of this was geometric. Light from a point source travels in a spherical wave, decreasing in intensity (or illuminance) as the inverse square of the distance travelled. This means that a light source must be four times as bright to produce the same illuminance at an object twice as far away. Thus {{to create the illusion}} of a distant object being at the same distance as a near object and scaled accordingly, much more light is required. When shooting with forced perspective, it's important to have the <b>aperture</b> <b>stopped</b> down sufficiently to achieve proper DOF (depth of field), so that the foreground object and background are both sharp.|$|R
5000|$|The camera {{offers the}} {{convenience}} of image composition with wide open aperture. The <b>aperture</b> is <b>stopped</b> down to the selected value after the shutter is released. After exposure the mirror stays up until the bottom-mounted {{single-stroke film advance lever}} is again wound. Focusing is via a ground glass screen with a central split-image rangefinder.|$|R
2500|$|The {{biological}} pupil {{of the eye}} is its aperture in optics nomenclature; {{the iris}} is the diaphragm {{that serves as the}} <b>aperture</b> <b>stop.</b> Refraction in the cornea causes the effective aperture (the entrance pupil in optics parlance) to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter. The entrance pupil is typically about 4mm in diameter, although it can range from 2mm (...) in a brightly lit place to 8mm (...) in the dark.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> of a {{photographic}} lens {{can be adjusted}} to control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor. In combination with variation of shutter speed, the aperture size will regulate the film's or image sensor's degree of exposure to light. [...] Typically, a fast shutter will require a larger aperture to ensure sufficient light exposure, and a slow shutter will require a smaller aperture to avoid excessive exposure.|$|E
2500|$|An {{optical system}} {{typically}} has many openings or structures that limit the ray bundles (ray bundles are {{also known as}} pencils of light). [...] These structures may be {{the edge of a}} lens or mirror, or a ring or other fixture that holds an optical element in place, or may be a special element such as a diaphragm placed in the optical path [...] to limit the light admitted by the system. [...] In general, these structures are called stops, and the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> is the stop that primarily determines the ray cone angle and brightness at the image point.|$|E
40|$|A multi-aperture {{telecentric}} lens is {{a single}} telecentric lens with multiple <b>aperture</b> <b>stops</b> that provides images with constant magnification and precise 3 -D measurement capability. This entry first describes the conventional telecentric lens. The configurations of a multi-aperture telecentric lens are then presented, after which the advantages of a multi-aperture telecentric system {{with respect to the}} conventional stereo vision systems are discussed. A geometric model for 3 -D reconstruction using a multi-aperture telecentric lens is presented, and camera calibration and image matching in multi-aperture telecentric systems are also discussed. Based on the geometric model, a theoretical analysis of the potential accuracy of a multi-aperture telecentric system used in 3 -D reconstruction is conducted. Finally, several future research directions related to the multi-aperture telecentric lens are suggested.

2500|$|A {{device called}} a {{diaphragm}} usually {{serves as the}} <b>aperture</b> <b>stop,</b> and controls the aperture. The diaphragm functions [...] much like the iris of the eye– it controls the effective diameter of the lens opening. Reducing the aperture size increases the depth of field, which describes {{the extent to which}} subject matter lying closer than or farther from the actual plane of focus appears to be in focus. In general, the smaller the aperture (the larger the number), the greater the distance from the plane of focus the subject matter may be while still appearing in focus.|$|E

50|$|The largest {{opening of}} the pencils, which {{take part in the}} {{reproduction}} of O, i.e. the angle u, is generally determined by the margin of one of the lenses or by a hole in a thin plate placed between, before, or behind the lenses of the system. This hole is termed the stop or diaphragm; Abbe used the term <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> for both the hole and the limiting margin of the lens. The component S1 of the system, situated between the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> and the object O, projects an image of the diaphragm, termed by Abbe the entrance pupil; the exit pupil is the image formed by the component S2, which is placed behind the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop.</b> All rays which issue from O and pass through the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop</b> also pass through the entrance and exit pupils, since these are images of the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop.</b> Since the maximum aperture of the pencils issuing from O is the angle u subtended by the entrance pupil at this point, the magnitude of the aberration will be determined by the position and diameter of the entrance pupil. If the system be entirely behind the <b>aperture</b> <b>stop,</b> then this is itself the entrance pupil (front stop); if entirely in front, it is the exit pupil (back stop).|$|E

Additionally, there are also photons that do not undergo the focused double reflections in the optics and we term these Ghost Rays.
