5|$|Cardiff City is yet {{to return}} to the FA Charity Shield, which was renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. However, between 2001 and 2006, the match was held at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. The closest Cardiff City has come so far to {{returning}} to the match was in 2008 when they reached the FA Cup Final once more, but lost by <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> nil against Portsmouth.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans with his arms out-stretched, and {{sticking}} out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into the air with a raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd. Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Müller {{started in}} all six matches that Germany {{played at the}} Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy, Müller's shot {{was the first one}} to be saved in the penalty {{shoot-out}} during the tournament. This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup. Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5. Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> his name at the Euros.|$|E

5|$|After basic training, Carlos was {{relocated}} to San Diego, and {{assigned to a}} destroyer in the Pacific Fleet – the USS Cape Cod (AD-43). He won the California state (amateur) Middleweight Boxing Championship in 1983. He had set <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the Junior Olympics in boxing, but he injured his shoulder in training, and was then deployed to the Middle East subsequent to the U.S. Embassy bombing in Beirut on April 18, 1983. His ship was in the Strait of Hormuz when the US Marine barracks (along with the French paratrooper barracks) in Beirut were bombed on October 24, 1983. By 1984, the Cape Cod was rotated out of the Persian Gulf. Ashenoff returned to San Diego, and received an honorable discharge.|$|E
5|$|Everton had contested {{the final}} on four {{previous}} occasions. They beat Newcastle United 1–0 {{to win the}} Cup in 1906, but were defeated in the 1893, 1897 and 1907 finals. The 1933 final was Manchester City's third. Both their previous finals were against Bolton Wanderers. Manchester City won by <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> nil in 1904, and lost by the same scoreline in 1926. Both teams had performed well in the previous season. Manchester City reached the semi-finals of the 1932 FA Cup; Everton were reigning league champions. The clubs had never previously met in cup competition. The league matches between the two {{earlier in the season}} each finished as a win for the home team. At the time of the final, Everton's league position was tenth, and Manchester City's sixteenth. Newspapers did not declare a clear favourite for the win. Everton were viewed as having the more skilful players, particularly their forwards, whereas Manchester City were seen as having greater strength and determination.|$|E
5|$|Football {{games last}} {{for a total of}} 60 minutes in {{professional}} and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes. The two-halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are also followed by a short break. Prior {{to the start of the}} game, the referee and team captains for each team meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or kick off the ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.|$|E

5|$|Luongo {{made his}} {{international}} debut at the 1995 World U-17 Hockey Challenge in Moncton, New Brunswick, with Team Québec, winning bronze. Three years later, {{he was named}} to the Canadian national junior team for the 1998 World Junior Championships in Finland. He played backup to Victoriaville Tigres goaltender Mathieu Garon, going winless in three appearances with a 3.70 GAA, as Canada finished in eighth place. Luongo became the starting goaltender the following year at the 1999 World Junior Championships in Winnipeg, Manitoba, appearing in seven of Canada's eight games. He recorded a shutout in {{the first game of the}} tournament against the Czech Republic, making 36 saves in a 0–0 tie. He went on to help Team Canada to the gold medal game against Russia, but lost in overtime, surrendering <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> Artem Chubarov. With a 1.92 GAA and two shutouts, Luongo was given Best Goaltender and All-Star Team honours.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 2010, in {{the first}} Premier League match of the 2010–11 season, Rosický was brought on as a {{substitute}} when Arsenal were trailing by <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> Liverpool at Anfield, producing a cross in the 89th minute that was diverted by Marouane Chamakh against the post. The ball then hit Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina before crossing the line for the equalising goal as the game finished 1–1. He scored his only goal {{of the season in}} an FA Cup tie away to League One side Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road on 20 February 2011 with a 53rd-minute header, although the match finished in a 1–1 draw. On 27 February 2011, Rosický started the 2011 League Cup Final against Birmingham City at Wembley, playing the full 90 minutes as Arsenal were defeated 2–1. At the end of the campaign, Rosický had scored one goal and made 34 appearances in all competitions for the Gunners.|$|E
5|$|Portuguese side Porto {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the quarter-finals. The first leg in Portugal ended 0–0. Liverpool won the second leg at Anfield 2–0 with Danny Murphy and Michael Owen scoring {{in the first half}} to progress to the semi-finals courtesy of a 2–0 aggregate victory. Liverpool were drawn against Spanish side Barcelona in the semi-finals. Liverpool defended resolutely during the first leg at Barcelona's ground the Camp Nou to earn a 0–0 draw. The second leg at Anfield was equally close, until the 44th minute when Liverpool were awarded a penalty. Gary McAllister scored the subsequent penalty to put Liverpool 1–0 up in the match and the tie. However, a Barcelona goal would see them progress {{as a result of the}} away goals rule. Liverpool managed to see out the 90 minutes without conceding <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> progress to their first European final, since they were banned from participating in Europe following the Heysel Stadium disaster at the 1985 European Cup Final.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} played on 18 November on an icy pitch (straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before), which nearly caused the game to be cancelled. The All Blacks kicked off, and had {{the best of the}} first ten minutes. Scotland {{eventually}} got a scrum near the All Blacks goal-line, and after winning the scrum, passed to Ernest Simson, who dropped <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> put Scotland ahead 4–0. It {{was the first time the}} All Blacks had been behind on tour. The All Blacks replied with a try under the posts, which was unconverted. A second try was then scored, by Smith; again it went unconverted. Scotland then scored an unconverted try, to lead at half time 7–6. With less than ten minutes to go the score remained 7–6 and it looked like the All Blacks might lose their first match on tour. However, with four minutes to go the All Blacks had a scrum on halfway; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for a try. Bill Cunningham then scored a try with seconds remaining, and the All Blacks were victorious 12–7.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the second}} half and five minutes into the half Liverpool defender Josemi was shown a yellow card for fouling Miloš Krasić. Liverpool's poor play in front of goal {{continued}} after the restart; Josemi {{had a chance to}} score, but his shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area went over the crossbar. After the attack, Liverpool made the first substitution of the match; Florent Sinama Pongolle replaced Finnan. After just over an hour's play, a mix-up between Reina and Sami Hyypiä nearly contrived to present <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> CSKA, before Hyypiä intervened to clear the ball. CSKA made their first substitution in the 66th minute with Deividas Šemberas replacing Yuri Zhirkov. Liverpool followed this by replacing Xabi Alonso with Mohamed Sissoko. Vágner Love had a chance to extend CSKA's lead in the 77th minute, but he was unable to control the ball after a high pass and lost possession. Despite their lead CSKA were negative in their play; they were punished when Liverpool replaced John Arne Riise with striker Djibril Cissé. Cissé made an immediate impact; he ran onto to a pass from García. The pass was cleared by CSKA defender Sergei Ignashevich but it ricocheted off Cissé and left him with an open goal after Akinfeev had come off his line in an attempt to clear the ball. Cissé's goal meant the match was now drawn at 1–1 and with no further goals the match went into extra-time.|$|E
