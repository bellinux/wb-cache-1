5|$|After the Duke’s {{service in}} Malta was over they {{returned}} to England where the family lived {{for the next few}} years. They divided their time between Eastwell Park, their country home in Kent, <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> House, their residence in London facing Buckingham Palace. Eastwell, a large estate of 2,500 acres near Ashford, with its forest and park was the children's favorite residence. In January 1886, shortly after Princess Victoria turned nine, the family left England when her father was appointed commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean naval squadron, based on Malta. For the next three years, the family lived at the San Anton Palace in Malta, Victoria's birthplace.|$|E
5|$|Edward's preferment of {{the former}} Lancastrian-supporting Woodville family, {{following}} his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, led Warwick <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> to help Margaret depose Edward and return Henry to the throne. Edward and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled, but on their return, Clarence switched sides at the Battle of Barnet, leading {{to the death of}} the Neville brothers. The subsequent Battle of Tewkesbury brought the demise of the last of the male line of the Beauforts. The battlefield execution of Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, and the later probable murder of Henry VI extinguished the House of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz {{appointed}} Fabio Capello as coach.

As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Predrag Mijatović.|$|E

5|$|Montagu, though, was {{not happy}} with the new arrangements, and King Edward has been held {{responsible}} for turning Montagu from a friend to an enemy. Warkworth's Chronicle describes him as condemning these grants to him as 'a pyes] nest.' Montagu had been on the Scottish border since at least January 1470. Following unrest in Lincolnshire and the subsequent Lincolnshire rebellion, the king marched from London to crush the rising. This he did at the Battle of Empingham. Following the battle, Edward headed north where he was met by Montagu and Northumberland at Doncaster. Warwick and Clarence's involvement in the Lincolnshire uprising had by now been established, and they fled to Calais. Further trouble broke out in the summer of 1470 in the north, with friends and relatives of Warwick in open rebellion. The new Earl of Northumberland was unable to put down these risings, so the king, once again marched north to deal with it personally. Modern historians generally consider that these rebellions were a deliberate trap, instigated by Warwick <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> from Calais. On 24 June 1470 the Wardenship of the East March was stripped from Montagu and given to Percy. Edward was still in the north with Percy when he received word that the Warwick <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> had landed in Dartmouth.|$|E
5|$|The New York Islanders {{have won}} the Prince of Wales Trophy <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> S. Campbell Bowl three times each and the Stanley Cup four {{consecutive}} times, from 1980 to 1983. The Islanders have never won the Presidents' Trophy which {{has been given to}} the team finishing the regular season with the best overall record based on points since the 1985–86 season. Prior {{to the creation of the}} trophy the Islanders led the league in points three times for the 1978–79, 1980–81, and 1981–82 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Warwick soon gave up, {{and once}} more fled the country with Clarence. Denied access to Calais, they sought refuge with King Louis XI of France. Louis {{arranged}} a reconciliation between Warwick and Margaret of Anjou, {{and as part of}} the agreement, Margaret and Henry's son, Edward, Prince of Wales, would marry Warwick's daughter Anne. The objective of the alliance was to restore Henry VI to the throne. Again Warwick staged an uprising in the north, and with the king away, he <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> landed at Dartmouth and Plymouth on 13September 1470. Among the many who flocked to Warwick's side was his brother Montagu, who had not taken part in the last rebellion, but was disappointed when his loyalty to the king had not been rewarded with the restoration of his earldom. This time the trap set up for the king worked; as Edward hurried south, Montagu's forces approached from the north, and the king found himself surrounded. On 2October he fled to the Netherlands. King Henry was now restored, with Warwick acting as the true ruler in his capacity as lieutenant. At a parliament in November, Edward was attainted of his lands and titles, <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> was awarded the Duchy of York.|$|E

5|$|After the First World War, Somerset {{began playing}} in {{a wider variety of}} {{locations}} around the county, including three different grounds in Yeovil, and also hosted five matches at the Recreation Ground in Torquay, despite that being in Devon. They played in three different grounds in Bristol, which has been considered an independent county since 1373, though {{it was part of the}} county of Avon from 1974 until 1996, and where Gloucestershire County Cricket Club have their headquarters. After 1979, Somerset only played at the County Ground, the Recreation Ground <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> Park until 2012, when they faced Cardiff MCC University at Taunton Vale, their first new ground in 37 years. Somerset have not played a county match outside of Taunton since 2011, when they faced Essex in a Twenty20 match in Bath.|$|E
5|$|Alford {{was signed}} by the BC Lions and participated at {{training}} camp in 1996, but he was cut from the roster in late June. Despite not being offered {{a spot on the}} practice squad, Alford remained in Surrey and practiced with the Lions for free. He was signed onto the active roster in late July after the Lions cut receivers Darryl Frazier <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> Verdin. Alford made his CFL debut against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on July 27, 1996. After recording over 200 receiving yards across two games in August, Alford began starting at wide receiver. He finished the season as the second most-productive Lions receiver with 721 receiving yards, leading the team to nominate Alford for the league-wide Most Outstanding Rookie award.|$|E
5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the Vice Presidency in 2009.

He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led the legislative efforts for creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> Thomas.|$|E

5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that {{this was one of}} the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E
5|$|During Warwick's exile, King Edward {{stripped}} Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, {{making him}} Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville {{appears to have}} seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained {{about the lack of}} landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a 'pie's nest'. When the Earl of Warwick <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled into exile in Burgundy.|$|E
5|$|Further {{investigations}} {{were then}} performed in 1900 by Alessandro Barsanti, who uncovered the {{vertical access shaft}} leading to the burial chamber. Barsanti, seeing that several corridors and chambers were seemingly unfinished and that all were completely devoid of artefacts, deemed that the pyramid had never been used. Shortly after, in 19101911, George Reisner <b>and</b> <b>Clarence</b> S. Fisher worked on the site, excavating {{the north and east}} exteriors of the pyramid as well as the cemeteries surrounding it. The dimensions of the pyramid as estimated by Barsanti, Reisner and Fisher differ greatly and even the numbers of subterranean galleries they report are in disagreement. Unfortunately, the pyramid lies within a restricted military area since 1970 and consequently no excavation has been undertaken there since Reisner and Fisher's superficial work, leaving the structures beneath the pyramid in doubt. Furthermore, the pyramid is now sanded up, hampering modern estimations of its dimensions.|$|E
