5|$|In 1869, {{both the}} piano version and the orchestral version were published. The first edition was <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> version by the Brandis & Dufour {{who made it}} {{available}} {{on the day of}} the premiere, based on Rossini's piano version but reduced to only one piano, also cutting passages. It was soon followed by editions from Chappell in London, Ricordi in Milan, and Oliver Ditson in Boston, somewhat later by B. Schotts Söhne. These four prints have in common that they were settings for harmonium and only one piano. Ricordi published <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> reduction of the orchestral score rather than following Rossini's original piano version. Some versions failed to mention that Rossini intended the work to be accompanied by two pianos.|$|E
5000|$|In most implementations, <b>a</b> digital <b>piano</b> {{produces}} <b>a</b> {{variety of}} <b>piano</b> timbres and usually other sounds as well. For example, <b>a</b> digital <b>piano</b> may have settings for <b>a</b> concert grand <b>piano,</b> <b>an</b> upright <b>piano,</b> <b>a</b> tack <b>piano,</b> and various electric pianos {{such as the}} Fender Rhodes, the Wurlitzer, and the DX electric piano. Some digital pianos incorporate other basic [...] "synthesizer" [...] sounds such as string ensemble, for example, and offer settings to combine them with piano.|$|R
50|$|Just like <b>a</b> {{traditional}} <b>piano,</b> <b>a</b> digital <b>piano</b> features <b>a</b> keyboard. <b>A</b> digital <b>piano's</b> keyboard is weighted {{to simulate}} the action of <b>a</b> traditional <b>piano</b> and is velocity sensitive so that {{the volume of the}} sounds depends on how hard the keys are pressed. Many instruments now have a complex action incorporating actual hammers in order to better simulate the touch of <b>a</b> grand <b>piano.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> player <b>piano</b> {{is neither}} <b>an</b> {{electric}} <b>piano,</b> electronic <b>piano,</b> nor <b>a</b> digital <b>piano.</b> The distinction between these instruments {{lies in the}} way sounds are produced. <b>A</b> player <b>piano</b> is <b>an</b> acoustic <b>piano</b> where the sound is produced by hammer strikes on the piano strings. Electrical or electronic components are limited to moving the keys or hammers mimicking {{the actions of a}} person; no sound is produced from electrically amplified audio.|$|R

5|$|After {{purchasing}} a drum set and acquiring <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures {{the remainder of}} the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a black market dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a snooker hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre to give them a gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-heroin campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a power outage.|$|E
5|$|As a high {{altitude}} species with limited contact with humans until {{the development of}} mountain tourism activities, the Alpine chough has little cultural significance. It was, however, featured together with its wild mountain habitat in Olivier Messiaen’s Catalogue d'oiseaux ("Bird catalogue"), <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> piece written in 1956–58. Le chocard des alpes ("The Alpine Chough") is the opening piece of Book 1 of the work.|$|E

50|$|The hammers {{and action}} became much heavier, {{so that the}} touch (keyweight) of <b>a</b> modern <b>piano</b> is several times heavier than that of <b>an</b> 18th-century <b>piano.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the age of}} six, Flanagan's parents {{gave him}} a {{clarinet}} for Christmas. He learned to read music from playing the clarinet, but {{within a few years}} he preferred the piano. The family had <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> in the house, and Flanagan received lessons from one of his brothers, Johnson, and Gladys Wade Dillard, who also taught Kirk Lightsey and Barry Harris. Flanagan graduated from Northern High School, which he attended with other future musicians, including Sonny Red.|$|E
5|$|By 1827, {{the family}} had {{returned}} to Leipzig. Wagner's first lessons in harmony were taken during 1828–31 with Christian Gottlieb Müller. In January 1828 he first heard Beethoven's 7th Symphony and then, in March, the same composer's 9th Symphony (both at the Gewandhaus). Beethoven became a major inspiration, and Wagner wrote <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> transcription of the 9th Symphony. He was also greatly impressed by a performance of Mozart's Requiem. Wagner's early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period.|$|E
5|$|During {{praise and}} worship, {{participants}} may {{raise their hands}} {{as an act of}} worship. Congregational singing is usually led by a choir or worship team. Full drum sets, <b>a</b> <b>piano,</b> an organ, and various other instruments are frequently used. The type of music sung is generally popular worship choruses, such as those by Calvary Chapel and Hillsong. Worship is often characterized as intense and enthusiastic.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> digital <b>piano,</b> {{also known}} as piano synthesizer, {{portable}} piano, weighted keyboard, or in the late 1980s, personal electronic <b>piano,</b> is <b>a</b> modern electronic musical instrument; a variation of electronic keyboard or synthesizer designed to serve primarily {{as an alternative to}} the traditional acoustic piano, both in the way it feels to play and in the sound produced. It is intended to provide an accurate simulation of <b>an</b> acoustic <b>piano.</b> Some digital pianos are also designed to look like <b>an</b> acoustic <b>piano,</b> both the upright or grand piano body style. Digital <b>pianos</b> use either <b>an</b> electronic synthesized emulation of the <b>piano</b> sound or <b>a</b> sampled <b>piano</b> sound, which is then amplified through an internal loudspeaker. Digital pianos typically have weighted or semi-weighted keyboards, which attempt to recreate the feel of <b>an</b> acoustic <b>piano.</b>|$|R
5|$|Having now gained {{experience}} with the Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, Final Fantasy V (1992), was much better than that of IV. He named this as the primary reason that the soundtrack album was two CDs long, a first for the series. Like IV, the discography of Final Fantasy V included an arranged and <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> album {{in addition to the}} main soundtrack album.|$|E
5|$|He met {{his future}} wife Lynne while still a youth team player at Bolton Wanderers, and the pair married on 1 June 1974. They had a son, Craig (9 June 1975), and daughter, Rachael (21 April 1979). He was given an honorary {{doctorate}} by the University of Bolton in July 2010. In addition to his football career, Allardyce has also run a number of businesses, including a motor spares firm, a fast-food restaurant, a social club, a pub, <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> bar, and a pub restaurant. He published his autobiography, Big Sam, in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|In December 1883 Messager and Chabrier {{gave the}} first {{performance}} of the latter's Trois valses romantiques at the Société Nationale de Musique. The concert also included the two-piano version premiere of España. A close friend of Chabrier from the 1880s until Chabrier's death, Messager had a great admiration for Chabrier's opera Gwendoline and swore that he would conduct it in Paris, which he later did. He also prepared <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> reduction of the orchestral parts for the published vocal score of the work.|$|E

5000|$|In modern usage, {{the term}} {{electronic}} piano sometimes refers to either <b>a</b> digital <b>piano</b> or <b>a</b> stage <b>piano.</b> This {{is actually a}} misnomer, as electronic pianos use analog synthesis to generate its sounds while digital pianos normally use sample-based synthesis. In addition, early digital pianos in the mid-1980s were {{often referred to as}} <b>a</b> personal electronic <b>piano.</b>|$|R
5|$|In Toronto, on September 15, 1886, {{he married}} Emily Charlotte Lee in a {{traditional}} ceremony at St. Peter's Anglican Church. Emily Wilson owned <b>a</b> <b>piano,</b> {{one of the first}} in Edmonton, and it was used at various dances, an activity the couple enjoyed. The Wilsons were friends of many notable early leading Canadian figures, such as Father Albert Lacombe, Charles Tupper, and Amédée Forget.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s Miller joined bassist Dave Holland's band, {{changing}} {{it from a}} quintet to a sextet, and adding gospel and soul elements to the group's sound. Around this time, Miller had two regular bands of his own: <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> trio, and a quintet featuring saxophone and vibraphone. He also became heavily involved in music education: Miller was the Director of Jazz Studies at William Paterson University from 2005, and was the Artist in Residence at Lafayette College in 2008, which was two years after it had awarded him an honorary doctorate in Performing Arts.|$|E
5|$|Lutosławski was at {{this time}} writing his Piano Concerto for Krystian Zimerman, {{commissioned}} by the Salzburg Festival. His earliest plans to write <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> concerto dated from 1938; he was himself in his younger days a virtuoso pianist. It was a performance of this work and the Third Symphony at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 1988 that marked the composer's return to the conductor's podium in Poland, after substantive talks had been arranged {{between the government and}} the opposition.|$|E
