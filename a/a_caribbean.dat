5|$|In February 1964, {{she had an}} {{emergency}} appendectomy, {{which led to the}} postponement of a planned tour of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji until 1966. She recuperated during <b>a</b> <b>Caribbean</b> cruise aboard the royal yacht, Britannia. In December 1966, she underwent an operation to remove a tumour after she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Contrary to rumours, she did not have a colostomy. In 1984, she {{was diagnosed with breast cancer}} and a lump was removed from her breast.|$|E

Captain Thomas Tower replaced Captain Binney on 30 August 1933.

5|$|In 1532, Pedro de Alvarado, {{governor}} of Guatemala, was issued with royal authorisation {{to conquer the}} general area of Higueras, {{in order to establish}} <b>a</b> <b>Caribbean</b> port for Guatemala. Less than a year after permission was given to Alvarado, then {{governor of}} Honduras and Higueras, Diego Alvítez, was given royal authorisation to pacify and colonise the Naco valley and the area around Puerto de Caballos. Soon afterwards, in 1533, Francisco de Montejo, governor of Yucatán, was granted governorship over a huge area extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ulúa River, Naco and Puerto de Caballos, so long as neither Alvarado nor Alvítez had established themselves in those regions. At the same time, Alvardo received reconfirmation of his permission to conquer those parts of Higueras that had not been pacified by the governors of Yucatán and Honduras-Higueras. Effectively, all three governors had royal permission to conquer and settle the same general region, and could interpret the royal authorisations as they chose.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the 1909 Greater Antilles {{hurricane}} are unclear, but {{are believed to have}} begun with a large, slow-moving storm system near Jamaica in early November. By November8, it was classified as a tropical storm and was situated over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, north of Panama. A ship {{in the vicinity of the}} system recorded an atmospheric pressure of 1004mbar (hPa; 29.68inHg). Slowly moving northeastward, an unusual direction for <b>a</b> <b>Caribbean</b> cyclone, the storm gradually intensified. The forward motion of the system steadily increased on November10 as it headed towards Jamaica. Late on November11, the system brushed the eastern tip of Jamaica as a strong tropical storm, with maximum winds estimated at 70mph (120km/h). Several hours later, the storm intensified into what would now be classified a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. During the afternoon of November12, the hurricane made landfall in northern Haiti, in Nord-Ouest, with winds of 85mph (140km/h). After briefly moving over land, the storm entered the Atlantic Ocean and turned east-northeast and further accelerated.|$|E
5|$|Calculus' shark-shaped {{submarine}} was visually {{based on}} a real American submarine; Hergé had seen a picture of this in a German newspaper. The diving suit worn in the story was also based on clippings that Hergé had accumulated. Similarly, the dockside bar depicted by the cartoonist was {{based on a}}n illustration that he had collected. The shop where Haddock and Tintin buy the diving equipment, including the suit, was inspired from a picture of a bar which was featured in the German magazine, Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. The tribal effigy found on <b>a</b> <b>Caribbean</b> island by Sir Francis Haddock was based on a Bamileke tribal statue from Cameroon that Hergé saw in a museum. The Sirius, which had appeared before in The Shooting Star, was named after the SS Sirius, the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean solely under steam power, but was visually based upon the design of a trawler, the John-O.88. Hergé had sketched this ship in Ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of the trawler from the builders, Jos Boel & Son, and a small-scale model of it from a collector. The undersea wreck of the Unicorn was loosely inspired by images of the wreck of a 17th-century Swedish vessel, the Vasa, which Hergé had collected. The instance in the story in which a shark swallows a large box (that the characters hope contains the treasure) is based on a real account of a shark that swallowed a camera from the American underwater photographer Otis Barton, which Hergé had encountered in a French illustrated magazine.|$|E

5|$|Grant's {{success with}} Britain was {{undermined}} by {{his attempt to}} annex the Dominican Republic, an independent nation unable to pay its debt. Many Americans believed <b>a</b> <b>Caribbean</b> naval base would establish naval dominance and be useful in protecting shipping from piracy in a potential isthmian canal. Anti-imperialist Republicans had previously rejected a Johnson administration treaty to establish a Samaná Bay naval base. Grant took interest in Dominican annexation and sent his secretary, Orville E. Babcock, there to consult with Buenaventura Báez, the pro-annexation Dominican president. Babcock returned in September 1869 with a draft treaty of annexation, although Fish had not given him any diplomatic authority. Given such authority by Fish, Babcock visited the island nation a second time making a treaty for Dominican annexation and the lease of Samaná Bay. The cabinet discussed the treaties at a meeting on December 21. Fish dismissed annexation, seeing the island as politically unstable. Grant supported it, believing acquisition of the majority-black nation would increase commerce, create a refuge for African Americans, and help to exploit the island's natural resources. He lobbied Sumner in hopes of influencing him to help with passage of the treaties. Fish added to the effort out of loyalty to Grant, but to no avail; Sumner was set against annexation and on June 30, 1870, the Senate rejected the treaties. A congressional investigation headed by Senator Carl Schurz revealed speculators had promoted the treaties' passage. Unwilling to admit defeat, Grant convinced Congress to send a commission to investigate. Although the commission approved Grant's call for annexation in its findings, the Senate remained opposed and Grant was forced to abandon further efforts. Grant retaliated by firing Sumner's friend and Minister to Great Britain, John Lothrop Motley, while he pressured the Senate to depose Sumner of his chairmanship.|$|E
