40|$|Considerable {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the relationship between transportation costs and land values in urban areas, but little research has been conducted on the other factors that affect land values. The study in this paper should concentrate on any {{one of a number of}} different types of public projects, but we shall be concerned with the effect of <b>airports</b> <b>on</b> land values. At the public level, {{attention has}} frequently been drawn to the effects of <b>airports.</b> <b>On</b> the one hand, one cannot help but notice the substantial residential and commercial development in areas immediately adjacent to <b>airports.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, concerned residents have often been adamant in their opposition to airport expansion;some have attempted either to have airport facilities moved or to mitigate their effects by other means. If the real estate market reflects preferences for particular land, the former might be interpreted to suggest the positive influence, while the latter suggests the negative influence of <b>airports</b> <b>on</b> land values. ...|$|R

40|$|Our {{research}} {{examines the}} role of airports in regional development.

Second, airports add significantly to regional development measured as economic output per capita. Third, the effect of <b>airports</b> <b>on</b> regional development occurs through two channels—their capacity to move both people and cargo, with the former being somewhat more important. Fourth, the impact of <b>airports</b> <b>on</b> regional development varies with their size and scale...|$|R
