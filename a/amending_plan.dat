50|$|The {{government}} {{estimated the}} cost of the bridge at $5 - $10 million and claimed that its construction would protect the site. The local aboriginal community rejected the bridge proposal and immediately appealed to the Minister of Heritage, David O'Byrne. Over the following weeks, representatives of the aboriginal community negotiated with the government over the site. They suggested the government re-route funds from their failed Tarkine road project into diverting the bypass around the Levee. They proposed to have the road follow the train tracks before crossing the Jordan River. The government rejected this idea, as funding for the Tarkine road was designated for the north-west of the state and creating a diversion in the sweeping bypass would lower the speed limit, create unsafe geometry, and be almost impossible to build without altering the site of the rail bridge. The aboriginal community then released an <b>amended</b> <b>plan</b> proposing to have the highway cut through the southern tip of the Brighton Suburb. The government rejected this proposal also, stating that the <b>amended</b> <b>plans</b> would cost an additional $60 million and not address all the safety concerns.|$|R

25|$|On 16 June 2006, it was {{announced}} that Everton had entered into talks with the Knowsley Council and Tesco over the possibility of building a new 55,000 seat stadium, expandable to over 60,000, in Kirkby. The plan became known as The Kirkby Project. The club took the unusual move of giving its supporters a say in the club's future by holding a ballot on the proposal with the results being in favour of it, 59% to 41%. Opponents to the plan included other local councils concerned by the effect of a large Tesco store being built as part of the development and a group of fans demanding that Everton should remain within the city boundaries of Liverpool. Following a public inquiry into the project, the central government rejected the proposal. Local and regional politicians attempted to put together an <b>amended</b> rescue <b>plan</b> with the Liverpool City Council calling a meeting with Everton F.C.
