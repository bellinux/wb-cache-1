By methods of white noise analysis (S-transformation, characterization theorem, etc.) these problems are reduced to fixed point problems in <b>appropriatly</b> constructed Banach spaces. This technique provides a systematic treatment of existence and uniqueness questions {{for a variety of}} equations. The method is applied to non-linear heat equations, non-linear Volterra equations and non-linear ordinary differential equations, which may all be anticipating.

This better understanding of the process during a {{pinch analysis}} will not only result in energy savings but also lead to creative ideas to improve product quality. This paper presents the recent results of a heat pump study by TENSA Services with support from the Department of Energy. The objective {{of the study was to}} <b>appropriatly</b> place and size the heat pump system in a food plant.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{coagulation}} {{is associated with}} scalar conservation laws, where the adhesion particle dynamics results from shock waves. Conversely, the fragmentation of a massive particle {{into a number of}} smaller ones, or into a continuous (dust) distribution, is associated with refraction waves. It is generally agreed that a reversible solution of a conservation law cannot include neither shock waves, nor the spontanus emergence of refraction waves. The present paper is an attemp to demonstrate that both coagulation and fragmentation may coexist for a reversible solution, under a natural generalization of the system of conservation law. This is done by the introduction of an action principle which includes, in addition to the inertial (kinetic energy) term, also an <b>appropriatly</b> defined internal energy. The above generalization of the system of conservation law appears as the Euler-Lagrange equations for this action. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{pervasive}} computing environment, mobile ad-hoc group gaming will {{become one of}} the signficant entertainment applications. Mobile ad-hoc group gaming is where players form their wireless local network and play network games using wireless heterogeneous devices. In network games, it is important to synchronize game states among players <b>appropriatly</b> for keeping entartaining interactivity. However, in the pervasive environment, it is difficult due to the highly variable network latency and wireless packet loss caused by mobility and wireless characteristics. In this paper, we propose a middleware for mobile ad-hoc group gaming called Architecture for Network Games utilizing Eligible Leaders (ANGEL). AN-GEL supports to exchange game messages synchronizing each player’s game state. ANGEL hierarchizes game players ’ nodes based on their packet loss ratio and network latency, and selects the most appropriate route for exchanging game messages. We have implemented a proto-type of ANGEL on Linux. We show that ANGEL improves packet loss ratio of the paths among gaming nodes at about a second, and the overhead of ANGEL on the network is 12. 5 %. By using ANGEL, we demonstrate to maintain interactivity of mobile ad-hoc group gaming. ...|$|E

These phenomena (such as the Struve [...] Sahade effect, difficulties to determine properly the spectral type, [...] .) have been reported and documented in the literature. Aims: We simulate the spectra of circular massive binaries at different phases of the orbital cycle and accounting for the gravitational influence of the companion star on the shape and physical properties of the stellar surface. Methods: We use the Roche potential to compute the stellar surface, von Zeipel theorem and reflection effects to compute the surface temperature. We then interpolate in a grid of NLTE plan-parallel atmosphere model spectra to obtain the local spectrum at each surface point. We finally sum all the contributions (accounting for the Doppler shift, limb-darkening, [...] .) to obtain the total spectrum. The computation is done for different orbital phases and for different sets of physical and orbital parameters. Results: Our first models reproduce the Struve [...] Sahade effect for several lines. Another effect, surface temperature distribution is visible but the distribution predicted by our current model is not yet consistent with observations. Conclusions: In some cases, the Struve [...] Sahade effect {{as well as more}} complex line intensity variations could be linked to blends of intrinsically asymmetric line profiles that are not <b>appropriatly</b> treated by the deblending routine. Systematic variations of lines for (nearly) contact systems are also predicted by the model. Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysic...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{organisation}} {{of the interests of}} the small business sector in the political system of the Federal Republic of Germany. 'Freie Berufe' are regarded {{as an integral part of}} this sector. Starting from the hypothesis that these interests are not represented <b>appropriatly</b> in the interest organisation system on the national political level it is the goal of this paper to show a way to realize an empirical test. In order to reach this goal it was referred to the policy network concept as an appropriate empirical analytical tool. Starting from a suitable data set containing interest organizations which try to influence the political system on a national level, the reputational approach was used to identify the whole system of the influential interest organisations in this sphere. The empirical small business influence network gained by that method contains 49 interest organisations. Yet the organisational system found is of extreme heterogenity. According to the influence reputation between the organisations many differences were discovered. They differ furthermore in a number of certain aspects like size of the membership, organisational structure or organisational environment. Taken the empirical results into account one is forced to reject the hypothesis of the underrepresentation of small business interests in the political system at the national level in Germany. But there was found not one organisational vote but a whole network of organisations with different goals, structures and relationships to each other. lobbying, middle class, liberal professions, political system...|$|E

To <b>appropriatly</b> {{account for the}} actions that could be imposed by the ridge keels their properties should be described statistically. A useful tool to observe ridge keels are upward looking sonars. Upward looking sonars, which can be mounted on submarines or moored to the seabed, observe the ice draft directly above. Such observations are suitible for the derivation of ridge keel geometry statistics. The current work focused on the derivation of ridge keel geometry and shape from upward looking sonar data. From 2006 to present the Norwegian Polar insitute has monitered the ice export out of Fram Strait using upward looking sonars with a time resolution which enables individual ridges to be identified. Data from this instumentation during the period 2006 to 2011 is {{the primary source of}} data used in the present study. Ice ridge keels were identified using the Rayleigh criterion with a threshold value of 2. 5 m and a minimum draft of 5 m. Key statistics of the geometry parameters draft, width and area are provided. The deepest keel observed in the Fram Strait in the period was 35 m deep and an extreme value analysis suggest that a 100 year return value is in the range 37 - 41 m. The shape of the ridge keel is studied through two symmetry parameters and the keel area coefficient. The symmetry parameters confirmed the common assumption abut symmetric ridge keels, but also quantify the variation of the location of the deepest point of the ridge keel and the centroid keel. The keel area cofficient is the ratio between the area of an idealized triangular ridge keel, spanned by the keel width and keel draft, and the observed keel area. A triangular keel would underestimate the keel area for 78...|$|E
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of Concentrating Solar Power Systems (CSP) systems is currently {{taking place at}} a much slower pace than photovoltaic (PV) power systems. This is {{mainly because of the}} higher present cost of the solar thermal power plants, but also for the time that is needed in order to build them. Though economic attractiveness of different Concentrating technologies varies, still PV power dominates the market. The price of CSP is expected to drop significantly in the near future and wide spread installation of them will follow. The main aim of this project is the creation of different relevant case studies on solar thermal power generation and a comparison betwwen them. The purpose of this detailed comparison is the techno-economic appraisal of a number of CSP systems and the understanding of their behaviour under various boundary conditions. The CSP technologies which will be examined are the Parabolic Trough, the Molten Salt Power Tower, the Linear Fresnel Mirrors and the Dish Stirling. These systems will be <b>appropriatly</b> sized and simulated. All of the simulations aim in the optimization of the particular system. This includes two main issues. The first is the achievement of the lowest possible levelized cost of electricity and the second is the maximization of the annual energy output (kWh). The project also aims in the specification of these factors which affect more the results and more specifically, in what they contribute to the cost reduction or the power generation. Also, photovoltaic systems will be simulated under same boundary conditions to facolitate a comparison between the PV and the CSP systems. Last but not leats, there will be a determination of the system which performs better in each case study...|$|E
40|$|How {{teachers}} from pre-schools and primary schools treat children with ADHD syndrome ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) syndrome is psychological disorder that has three main symptoms : impulsivness, hyperactivity and inattetion. Because {{of these three}} symptoms, children with ADHD have often serious problems at school. Even if they try their best to have good marks they usually dont, because of their inability to concentrate. Because of the symptoms of the condition, they are usually not well behaved compare to thier classmates. Thats why ADHD syndrome can often cause conflicts between students and teachers and between {{children and their parents}} too. Nowadays ADHD affects around 3 - 5 % of children. This means that every teacher will most likely come in to contact with ADHD {{at some point in their}} career. With this in mind, are teachers really well informed about ADHD? Do they really treat children with psychical disorders <b>appropriatly?</b> Children with ADHD usually dont like school because they are never successful and good as their peers. Although they dont like studying they still have thier favourite teachers. But which characteristics should an ideal teacher have when working with these children? Which characteristics would these children best relate to? This is obviously a huge subject to look at, we could examine a million different teaching approaches, but for my diploma work I have decided to consider the five which are for me the most important ones { [...] } extraversion, agreebleness, emotional stability, openness to experience and ability to resist stress. For my research i used two anonymous questionnaires - Big Five Test and Sense of Coherence Test. Next method was test with only five question that examines a teacher´s knowledge of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. In addition to these, I also did interviews with children to find out which teachers they prefer to be taught by. As a teacher it can be challenging to have children with ADHD in your class. It needs a large amout of patience, because you wont see the results of your work for very long time. But if teachers and parents work together in supporting child sufferers of ADHD, and help to create a positive learning environment, they can make a difference and turn education into an enjoyable experience. By providing help with things that maybe easier for the rest of the class, and by promoting social activity between ADHD sufferers and their peers, teachers can create an eviroment that better for everyone...|$|E
