40|$|In March 2013, the EC {{started a}} project aimed at harmonizing accrual-based public sector {{accounting}} systems through {{a set of}} harmonized accrual-based public sector accounting standards. The entire project {{is based on the assumption}} that the “superiority of the <b>accruals</b> <b>principle,</b> whether for macro or micro fiscal monitoring, is indisputable” (EC, 2013, p. 6). The paper offers critical perspective on the possible adoption of the European Public Sector Accounting Standards (EPSAS) inspired by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). More specifically, the paper deals with the theoretical concepts of harmonization, standardization, and unification, as defined by the international accounting literature, with a view to identify the possible consequences of the public accounting unification process that is going to be promoted by the EU. In the European Union perspective, accounting unification is a desirable outcome, a pre-condition for attaining, measuring, controlling, and demonstrating budgetary equilibrium, according to a strictly rational logic consistent with a functionalist perspective of public sector accounting. Such an approach, it is argued in the paper, leads to a misunderstanding of public sector accounting, which is considered as a neutral technology whereas it is actually a tool of commensuration with a strong influence on the economic and political life of social communities, since it generates interpretative categories and contributes to change social relationships and values prioritization...|$|E
40|$|This paper briefly {{outlines}} the significant issues that occur during {{the implementation of}} the <b>accrual</b> <b>principle</b> accounting in the public sector {{in the context of the}} reform of accounting of public finance in the Czech Republic. The reform mostly regards government organizational units, selfgoverning territorial units and allowance organizations. The objective of the paper is to describe the transformation process from state accounting to <b>accrual</b> <b>principle</b> accounting in the Czech Republic and to identify the main problems associated with the introduction of <b>accrual</b> <b>principle.</b> Authors summarize these key problems with the use of questionnaire survey results at the municipal level in the Czech Republic. According to the research presented in this paper, the ongoing reform has not provided the intended transparency of accounting in selected entities and these tend to have an impression of their efforts being wasted by doing unnecessary work. Drawing on the above facts, approaches to the public finance accounting reform by central authorities and municipalities are different. However, we can say that the reform was launched to improve the situation of users of financial statements and had been needed for many years because public sector accounting regulations were incomplete and non-uniform...|$|R

The paper first discusses general considerations on tax collection in the Czech Republic and its constitutional and legal aspects, followed by reflections on how a tax base is constructed when the accounting profit according to Czech accounting regulations is used in the case of accounting units. The core of all considerations is the discussion about whether all revenues reported in accounting (unless specified otherwise in particular cases) are income that is subject to tax.

The <b>accrual</b> <b>principle</b> {{is reflected in the}} Balance Sheet and Income Statement. Accrual measurements in the Balance Sheet are measured using PersistenceCurrent Operating Accrual, Persistence Non-Current Operating Accrual. Idiosyncratic risk reflects the specific information about the company and it will fluctuate according to the information itself. To measure the idiosyncratic risk in this study five factors of Fama-French Model were used (Fama and French 2014). Asset Pricing Measurement uses the Dividend Disscounted Model to predict stock prices. The samples used in this study are listed below. The Manufacturing Company is selected with consideration for accrual measurement of accounts receivable, inventory, investment and liabilities. The sample was chosen by purposive random sampling method. The number of samples generated by this method is 145 companies with full reports for 2010 - 2015. Using the SEM AMOS Ver. 24 and Sobel Test Path Analysis, the results show that Current Operating Accrual has a negative and significant relationship to the idiosyncratic risk and stock price. For non-Current Operating Accrual variables have positive and significant relation.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>accrual</b> accounting <b>principles</b> {{is a challenge}} for public sectors internationally and increases the level of transparency and accountability of management. Taxation authorities are governed by legislation {{and have to be}} supported by a sound legislative framework to enable effective administration of taxes and the proper {{application of}} the <b>accrual</b> accounting <b>principles.</b> The recent issuing of the accounting standard for taxes and developments relating to the subsequent measurement of tax receivables highlights the ineffectiveness of current administrative tax legislation relating to penalties and interest which does not allow SARS to effectively apply <b>accrual</b> accounting <b>principles.</b> The receipt of taxpayer returns and payments as required by legislation are critical in order to allow the recording of taxes owed in the financial records of SARS. These taxpayer actions can only be effectively influenced by an effective penalty regime. Similarly, the current interest regimes on tax receivables and payables need to be adjusted in order to allow efficiencies and be comparative to market rates and calculation methods. International comparisons of penalty and interest regimes did not indicate a specific standard regime that should be applied, but the United Kingdom identified sound design principles for penalty and interest regimes. A simple standardised penalty and interest regime for all taxes administered by SARS is recommended which meets the identified design principles and supports the <b>accrual</b> accounting <b>principles.</b> The move to accrual accounting is an additional driver for administrative legislative reform which supports the effective management of taxation authorities.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the accounting reform of public finances {{from the point}} of view of its impact on the financial statements of local government units, especially applied to the municipalities in the Vysocina region. The reform changed legislative regulations, especially the accounting law, the decree implementing the accounting law and Czech accounting standards for the selected accounting entities. This thesis analyzes the changes in these regulations and it describes the impact of these modifications on the financial statements. These changes create areas that are, due to the reform, new for villages and can be problematic in context of misinterpretations and wrong booking. The areas affected by the reform are divided into three separate areas. The first area is the creation of state accountancy and implementation of accrual based accounting, connected to the state accounting, from which the further <b>accrual</b> <b>principle</b> is derived. The second imaginary area of changes relates to accounting reform in terms of chart of accounts including an off-balance sheet which has considerably changed. The third area is a wide range of assets of an entity, where there was a major change in relation to the <b>accrual</b> <b>principle</b> and that is the beginning of depreciation of all depreciable assets. In connection with depreciation, adjustments are made and the problem area of inventory of property has widened. Changes occurred in valuation of assets, a new way was created and an obligation to revalue assets held for sale was made. Subsequently, the impact of individual problem areas at the municipalities is examined, and so as how the changes will be reflected in their financial statements...|$|R

40|$|When new {{international}} statistical standards {{were published in}} 1993, {{one of the major}} changes to the recommended presentation of the system of national accounts and the balance of payments was the adoption of accruals reporting for income and expenditure. However, as countries have begun to implement these standards, questions have arisen about their exact interpretation in respect of interest flows associated with tradable debt, where the cash flow is fixed at the time of issue but where the price of the instrument fluctuates with market conditions. A clear consensus has yet to emerge. The paper explores the issues involved in using the alternative approaches, the so-called "debtor" and "creditor" approaches. The debtor approach uses the rate implicit at the time of issue, and the creditor approach, the current market rate. The paper concludes that the creditor approach is the only one consistent with <b>accrual</b> <b>principles</b> and market valuation for the debt outstanding.

40|$|The International Federation of Accountants {{recommends}} a transition of all accounting {{units in the}} public sector to the accrual basis and issues International Public Sector Accounting Standards to support the new concept. Accounting in the Czech public administration is based rather on the cash base with all its drawbacks and complications Regional administration units are finding out and recording net cash flow directly in the system of synthetic accounts of the core activitity in the ledger, with the priority of recording income and expenses. Organizational parts of the state use the same system of bookkeeping based on the same directive charts of accounts. I percieve a conceptual inconsistence in {{the fact that in the}} system of synthetic accounts, the budget surplus or deficit as the main expression of the accounting cash concept is not being found out neither recorded. An obstacle for implementing the <b>accrual</b> <b>principle</b> lies also in the persistent definition of yields. For the area of budget economy of accounting units of public administration, existence of yields is not admitted. The reason is to be found in business concept of yields expecting yields only in rela- tion to the market. This concept will have to be substituted by a concept which respects so called non-exchangeable yields. Then, based on this concept, yield accounts will be incorporated into the charts of accounts of the core activity of the accounting units. Accrual accounting concept, which is also based on the comparison of costs with performance for which they are expended, creates prerequisites also for depreciation of long-term assets. In the current concept of accounting core activity of public administration these long-term assets are not depreciated. Its appreciation and reporting then intentionally does not respect the requirement of true picture of reality. Therefore the content and methodology of changes have to be considered, especially in the following fields: • Acknowledgement and introduction of the category of income as defined by IPSAS; • Restructuring of the pilot accounting system according to the accrual concept; • Detecting budget inflows or outflows outside the system of the synthetic accounts based on the analytical accounts (budget classification); • Restructuring of the accounting statement scheme, namely its internal structure; • Creating legislative conditions to change the system...|$|R

40|$|The European {{accounting}} directive does not specify the users of financial statements, nor weights the single objectives of financial accounting. Thus deducting EU accounting standards consistently and systematically from predefined objectives is nearly impossible. As an example, accounting for ‘provisions for future charges’ {{can be justified}} neither by financial statements’ informational and stewardship function nor by the objective of measuring distributable profits for tax dividend payment purposes, or by capital maintenance requirements. Accounting for ‘provisions for future charges’ simply allows preparers of financial statements to shift ex post profit distribution decisions to ex ante profit determination, for a specific ‘apparent’ purpose i. e. the maintenance of assets or repairs thereof. Accordingly the ‘true and fair’ profit actually realized by the entity is not disclosed to external users. Thus accounting for ‘provisions for future charges’ is in contradiction with the informational and stewardship function of the annual accounts, {{as well as with}} the determination of a fair measurement of distributable profits. More specifically, shareholders find themselves deprived of part of the profits actually realized by the entity and dispose of fewer financial resources to cover for their own expenses. Besides, by shifting the profit distribution decisions to the level of profit determination, a circular reference is introduced in the question of determining the distributable profit, residing in the fact that in the function of the distributable profit is included a variable that needs to be determined by the financial statements, i. e. the variable ‘profit to be distributed’. The usefulness of the balance sheet as a basis for the profit determination is taken ad absurdum, if management’s profit distribution decisions are already reflected at the level of profit determination. In this case, determination of distributable profit is based on the question of how much profit the entity’s governing body intend to distribute and not based on the ‘true and fair’ profit actually realized. Accounting for ‘provision for future charges’ is neither the expression of protection of creditors. In substance, accounting for provisions is required by the prudence principle but this is only true for provisions accounted for future expected losses (future charges not compensated by future revenues). Provisions for charges cover expenses not linked to ‘expected’ future losses. Thus, provisions for charges reflect compensated future charges. Accordingly accounting for ‘provisions for future charges’ distorts the financial position and performance of an entity, misinterprets the prudence principle and violates the <b>accrual</b> <b>principle</b> of accounting...|$|R
