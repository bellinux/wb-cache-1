5|$|Liverpool's {{victory was}} their third UEFA Cup success, this put them level with Internazionale and Juventus as the teams {{with the most}} success in the competition. Their victory <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> they {{completed}} a Treble of cup victories, as they had won the Football League Cup and the FA Cup earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|The new ball rule <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that spin bowling {{was less}} {{effective}} in the Tests, so Australia only used one full-time spinner in the Tests, off spinner Johnson, until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring. Together they took only eight wickets.|$|E
5000|$|Mexico: Mole, which <b>also</b> {{originally}} <b>meant</b> sauce, features different regional variations and {{combinations of}} chilies, spices, and chocolate.|$|R

50|$|Robert, the king's uncle, {{successfully}} interposed and no repudiation followed as repudiating {{her would}} <b>also</b> have <b>meant</b> {{the loss of}} Artois to the French crown.|$|R
5|$|This {{meeting was}} also the first-ever match-up between the twostoried programs; the twoteams had {{combined}} to play 1,594games before meeting. For Texas, it <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> playing a second Big Ten Conference powerhouse soon after winning the first-ever matchup between Texas and the University of Michigan {{at the end of}} the 2004 season.|$|E

5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
50|$|Application: Having an {{information}} sign that signifies {{the beginning of}} a school zone should not <b>also</b> be <b>meant</b> to imply that the speed limit in this area is reduced.|$|R
50|$|The name 'Kalki' {{may also}} be derived from the Sanskrit word kalka (Devanagari: कल्क) which means 'filth'. So, the name 'Kalki' can <b>also</b> be <b>meant</b> 'destroyer of the filth'.|$|R
50|$|The term showman or show people, can <b>also</b> be <b>meant</b> as a superlative or {{complimentary}} term, {{sometimes as}} an accolade or quasi-title, {{such as in}} the documentary name Harry Saltzman: Showman.|$|R
5|$|As the {{defending}} champion, Kuznetsova took a wildcard into the Kremlin Cup, {{knowing that she}} had to win the title to qualify for Singapore. Kuznetsova handled the pressure well; defeating Alizé Cornet, Tímea Babos, Elina Svitolina and Daria Gavrilova in the final to win the title.

5|$|By Tuesday, {{the storm}} was rapidly moving across eastern Canada. Without the warm lake waters, it lost power quickly. This <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> less snowfall, both because of the fast motion of the storm {{and the lack of}} lake effect snow. All {{shipping}} was halted on Monday and part of Tuesday along the St. Lawrence River around Montreal, Quebec.|$|E
5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E

5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their rights under Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting meant little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous maternity leave was legally required, and a national network of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Kyo {{has also}} {{appeared}} in video games outside The King of Fighters series. He is a playable character in the shooter game Sky Stage. In the crossover video games Neo Geo Battle Coliseum and SNK vs. Capcom series, Kyo appears as a playable character; in the former game he appears with his 99 costume, while in the latter {{he is in his}} school uniform.

50|$|Unfortunately, this venue was <b>also</b> not <b>meant</b> to be, as the {{ownership}} of the Wild Club found the weekly poetry crowd to be too rowdy for their taste. Once again, PuroSlam {{had to find a}} new home.|$|R
50|$|Quark is {{possibly}} described by Tacitus {{in his book}} Germania as lac concretum ("thick milk"), eaten by Germanic peoples. However, this could <b>also</b> have <b>meant</b> soured milk or {{any other kind of}} fresh cheese or fermented milk product.|$|R
50|$|Parapets on {{bridges and}} other highway {{structures}} (such as retaining walls) prevent users from falling off {{where there is}} a drop. They may <b>also</b> be <b>meant</b> to restrict views, to prevent rubbish passing below, and to act as noise barriers.|$|R
5|$|Nash {{trained with}} South Melbourne during the 1946 {{pre-season}} but ultimately retired from VFL football {{to accept a}} position as captain-coach of the Ovens and Murray Football League side Wangaratta for a salary of £12 per week, four times the wage he would have received playing for South Melbourne. The high wage <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that Nash was not required to find additional employment to cover his family's expenses, and in so doing, {{became one of the}} first fully professional Australian rules football players.|$|E
5|$|Of the First Test team, all bar Toshack scored {{multiple}} first-class {{centuries in}} their careers, and all averaged under 27.50 with the ball. As Bradman wanted all four spin techniques covered, {{as well as}} both left and right-arm seamers, this <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that he could only have two fast bowlersLindwall and Milleras three positions were occupied by spinners and a fourth by Toshack, who was of medium pace.|$|E
5|$|Property in the County of Tripoli, {{granted to}} the Knights in the 1140s, {{included}} the Krak des Chevaliers, the towns of Rafanea and Montferrand, and the Beqa'a plain separating Homs and Tripoli. Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city. While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, it <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> Homs was close {{enough for them to}} raid. Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} changes was the spread internet, which enabled knitters to share advice, patterns and experience, but <b>also</b> it <b>meant</b> that home knitters had direct access to supplies rather being reliant on local sources. These trends have continued.|$|R
6000|$|Jason {{saw that}} he was entrapped; but his second promise to Cheiron came into his mind, and he thought, ‘What if the Centaur were a prophet in that <b>also,</b> and <b>meant</b> that I should win the fleece!’ Then he cried aloud— ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Also,</b> it <b>meant</b> that Dr. Hunkapiller's {{idea would}} require {{competing}} {{against his own}} customers, to all of whom Applied Biosystems sold its sequencing machines and their chemical reagents. However, he calculated that it would also mean doubling the market for that equipment.|$|R
5|$|Tax {{revenue from}} the Belgian Congo enabled the Belgian {{government}} in exile and Free Belgian Forces to fund themselves, unlike most other states in exile, which operated through subsidies and donations from sympathetic governments. It <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the Belgian gold reserves, which had been moved to London in 1940, were not needed to fund the war effort, and therefore were still available {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The French ironclad Invincible was {{the second}} of the three wooden-hulled s built for the French Navy in 1858–62. The ships of the Gloire class were {{classified}} as armoured frigates because they only had a single gun deck and their traditional disposition of guns arrayed {{along the length of the}} hull <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that they were broadside ironclads. Invincible had an uneventful career and was deployed in North American waters during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The unseasoned timber of her hull rotted quickly and she was condemned in 1872 and scrapped in 1876.|$|E
5|$|This {{inequality}} further offended {{the smaller}} countries. Finally, this inequality <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the minority rights were {{not seen as}} a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had no state to back up their claims were relatively disadvantaged when compared to ones backed up by a powerful state or group of interests.|$|E
50|$|On March 12, 2014, ESPN named Musburger and Jesse Palmer as {{the lead}} game {{commentators}} for college football coverage on the SEC Network, ending his involvement with Saturday Night Football. <b>Also,</b> this <b>meant</b> Musburger would not be participating in calling the College Football Playoff championship.|$|R
50|$|This expansion, was {{released}} in Japan in February 1999 under the name Towerkit CD-ROM: The Statue of Liberty. It was <b>also</b> originally <b>meant</b> {{to be available to}} download from the American official website, but the English version never materialized. The expansion is rare in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The Commissariat was {{the central}} office {{responsible}} for issuing postage stamps of the Soviet Union. In addition to overprinting older issues, the government created new postage stamps. Between 1922 and 1930, there were <b>also</b> stamps <b>meant</b> {{to raise money for}} famine relief, child welfare and other charity purposes.|$|R
