5|$|Even before Haywood {{first became}} <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>with</b> the Western Federation of Miners, he was {{convinced}} that the system under which working people toiled was unjust. He described the execution of the Haymarket leaders in 1887 as a turning point in his life, predisposing him toward membership in the largest organization of the day, the Knights of Labor. Haywood had watched men die in unsafe mine tunnels, and had marched with Kelly's Army. He had suffered a serious hand injury in the mines, and found that his only support came from other miners. When Haywood listened to Ed Boyce of the WFM addressing a group of miners in 1896, he discovered radical unionism and welcomed it.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's role as supreme judge {{could be}} {{temporarily}} duplicated by any official he designated {{in times of}} emergency or in distant borderlands where central government had little influence. This entailed a symbolic conferral of power, which was embodied in the Staff of Authority (Jiezhang 節杖). Roughly 2m (6ft) in height and decorated with ribbons, the Staff of Authority was often granted to <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>with</b> a specific errand, such as {{acting on behalf of}} the emperor as ambassador to a foreign country, appointing civilians to office, or immediately promoting a deserving military officer on the field of battle. Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.|$|E

25|$|H. V. Porter, <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>with</b> the Illinois High School Association (and later {{a member}} of the Basketball Hall of Fame), {{was the first person to}} use March Madness to {{describe}} a basketball tournament. Porter published an essay named March Madness during 1939, and during 1942, he used the phrase in a poem, Basketball Ides of March. Through the years the use of March Madness was increased, especially in Illinois, Indiana, and other parts of the Midwest. During this period the term was used almost exclusively in reference to state high school tournaments. During 1977, Jim Enright published a book about the Illinois tournament entitled March Madness.|$|E
25|$|The Tennessee Constitution {{requires}} each {{county to}} elect a sheriff to a four-year term. In all Tennessee counties except one, the sheriff is <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>with</b> full police powers, usually county-wide, although Tennessee sheriffs and their deputies generally perform the patrol portion of their duties primarily in unincorporated areas of their counties if the municipalities have their own police departments. The {{exception to the rule}} is Davidson County. In Davidson County, the sheriff has the primary responsibility of serving civil process and jail functions without the common law powers to keep the peace. Protection of the peace is instead the responsibility of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department under the county's Metropolitan Charter. The Metropolitan Charter did not remove the Davidson County Sheriff's status as a Law Enforcement officer however. It is simply not his or her primary function as it was prior to the consolidation of the City of Nashville and Davidson County.|$|E

The Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign used tactics ranging from non-violent protest to the alleged firebombing of houses owned by executives associated with HLS's clients and investors.

500|$|The {{story of}} Kuhl's {{slapping}} broke in the U.S. when newspaper columnist Drew Pearson revealed {{it on his}} 21 November radio program. Pearson received details of the Kuhl incident and other material on Patton from his friend Ernest Cuneo, <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>with</b> the Office of Strategic Services, who obtained the information from War Department files and correspondence. Pearson's version not only conflated details of both slapping incidents but falsely reported that the private in question was visibly [...] "out of his head", telling Patton to [...] "duck down or the shells would hit him" [...] and that in response [...] "Patton struck the soldier, knocking him down." [...] Pearson punctuated his broadcast by twice stating that Patton would never again be used in combat, {{despite the fact that}} Pearson had no factual basis for this prediction. In response, Allied Headquarters denied that Patton had received an official reprimand, but confirmed that Patton had slapped at least one soldier.|$|E
500|$|On March 5, 1825, the {{alliance}} set a trap which forced Anne into a naval battle. After 45 minutes, Cofresí abandoned his ship and escaped overland; he {{was recognized by}} a local resident, who ambushed and injured him. Cofresí was captured and imprisoned, making a last unsuccessful attempt to escape by trying to bribe <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>with</b> part of a hidden stash. The pirates were sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where a brief military tribunal found them guilty and sentenced them to death. On March 29, 1825, Cofresí {{and most of his}} crew were executed by firing squad. The pirate inspired stories and myths after his death, most emphasizing a Robin Hood-like [...] "steal from the rich, give to the poor" [...] philosophy which became associated with him. In poetry and oral tradition this portrayal has evolved into legend, commonly accepted as fact in Puerto Rico and throughout the West Indies. A subset of these claims that Cofresí became part of the Puerto Rican independence movement and other secessionist initiatives, including Simón Bolívar's campaign against Spain. Historic and mythical accounts of his life have inspired songs, poems, plays, books and films. In Puerto Rico caves, beaches and other alleged hideouts or locations of buried treasure have been named after Cofresí, and a resort town near Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic is named for him.|$|E
