5|$|Several agencies, {{including}} the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed plans for <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>response</b> {{in addition to}} addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, {{and the number of}} response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.|$|E
5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Recopa Sudamericana, {{manufactured}} by Nike, is named the Total 90 Omni CSF. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration.

25|$|The {{historical}} {{treatment of}} OPC was surgical, with an approach through {{the neck and}} splitting of the jaw bone, {{which resulted in a}} considerable risk of death. Later, radiotherapy with or without the addition of chemotherapy, provided a less invasive alternative, and the results in terms of treating the cancer, were comparable. Newer minimally invasive surgical techniques through the mouth have improved outcomes, and surgery is often followed by radiation and or chemotherapy in high risk cases. In the absence of high quality evidence, management decisions are often based on technical factors, likely functional loss and the persons preferences. Some HPV+OPC may first appear in lymph nodes in the neck, without an obvious source (cancer of unknown primary origin) but removal of tonsil tissue from the oropharynx will often show hidden disease. The presence of HPV in the tumour is associated with <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>response</b> to treatment and a better outcome, independent of the treatment methods used and a nearly 60% reduced risk of dying from the cancer. Most recurrence occurs locally and within the first year after treatment. The use of tobacco decreases the chances of survival. While most head and neck cancer has been declining with reduced smoking rates, HPV+OPC has been increasing. Compared to HPV-OPC patients, HPV+OPC patients tend to be younger, have a higher socioeconomic status and are less likely to smoke. In addition they tend to have smaller tumours, but {{are more likely to have}} involvement of the cervical lymph nodes. In the United States and other countries, the number of cases of oropharyngeal cancer has been increasing steadily, with the incidence of HPV+OPC increasing faster than the decline in HPV-OPC. The increase is seen particularly in young men in developed countries, and HPV+OPC now accounts for the majority of all OPC cases.|$|E

500|$|An {{example of}} such a design is shown in figure 10a. The {{resonators}} are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one half-wavelength (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a narrow-band filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>response</b> than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings. [...] For even higher frequencies, microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below.|$|E

40|$|Background: The MDR 1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein (PGP), {{which plays}} an {{important}} role in mediating multidrug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Polymorphisms in the MDR 1 gene may have an impact on the expression and function of PGP, thereby influencing the response to chemotherapy. Methods: We investigated the potential association of MDR 1 polymorphisms (2677 G>Tat exon 21 and 3435 C>T at exon 26) and their haplotypes with chemotherapy response in 54 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients who received a combination chemotherapy of etoposide–cisplatin. Results: The 3435 CC genotype was associated with <b>a</b> significantly <b>better</b> chemotherapy <b>response</b> compared with the combined 3435 CT and TT genotype (P = 0. 025). The 2677 GG genotype was also associated with <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chemotherapy <b>response</b> compared with the combined 2677 GTand TT genotype,although it was not statistically significant. Consistent with the resultsof genotyping analyses, patients harboring the 2677 G– 3435 C haplotype had <b>a</b> statistically signifi-cant <b>better</b> <b>response</b> to chemotherapy compared with those with the other haplotypes combined (P = 0. 015). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the MDR 1 2677 G>Tand 3435 C>T polymorphisms can be used for predicting treatment response to etoposide–cisplatin chemotherapy in SCLC patients.

40|$|Background: Poor {{response}} to diuretics {{is associated with}} worse prognosis in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). We hypothesized that treatment with tolvaptan improves diuretic response in patients with AHF. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the AQUAMARINE open-label randomized study in which a total of 217 AHF patients with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2)) were randomized to either tolvaptan or conventional treatment. We evaluated diuretic {{response to}} 40 mg furosemide or its equivalent based on two different parameters: change in body weight and net fluid loss within 48 h. Results: The mean time from patient presentation to randomization was 2. 9 h. Patients with <b>a</b> <b>better</b> diuretic <b>response</b> showed greater relief of dyspnea and less worsening of renal function. Tolvaptan patients showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>better</b> diuretic <b>response</b> measured by diuretic response based both body weight [- 1. 16 (IQR - 3. 00 to - 0. 57) kg/ 40 mg vs. - 0. 51 (IQR - 1. 13 to - 0. 20) kg/ 40 mg; P < 0. 001] and net fluid loss [2125. 0 (IQR 1370. 0 - 3856. 3) mL/ 40 mg vs. 1296. 3 (IQR 725. 2 - 1726. 5) mL/ 40 mg; P < 0. 001].
