5|$|As {{the final}} {{was held in}} England, at Wembley, Liverpool were clear favourites to retain the European Cup. Brugge were without {{a number of key}} players, such as Raoul Lambert, whose {{inclusion}} in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised. Liverpool were also without a few players. Tommy Smith, who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after dropping a pick-axe on his foot and breaking <b>a</b> <b>toe.</b> Striker David Johnson was also absent. He had strained knee ligaments during a match against Leicester City, an injury that ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{days after}} his OHL return, Hodgson {{suffered}} another injury, breaking <b>a</b> <b>toe</b> on his right foot while blocking a shot against the Sudbury Wolves. Initial X-rays came up negative and he continued playing for nine more games before a second X-ray revealed a hairline fracture {{in one of his}} right metatarsal bones. Missing the Battalion's final five regular season games, he finished the campaign with eight goals and 20 points over 13 contests. Despite missing the majority of the season, he was voted as the smartest player in the Eastern Conference for the third consecutive year in the OHL coaches poll.|$|E

5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of {{malignant}} melanoma under the nail of <b>a</b> <b>toe.</b> Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead a symptom of the already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring and {{was in the process of}} scheduling a world tour in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Tinker {{had serious}} health {{problems}} in his later life. Complications of diabetes mellitus and Bright's disease left Tinker near death in 1936, when his physician believed he had 24 hours to live, and 1944, when he was placed in an oxygen tent. However, he returned to health and scouted minor league players for the Boston Braves in 1946. Tinker developed an infection relating to diabetes that in 1947 required the amputation of <b>a</b> <b>toe</b> and persisted until his left leg above the knee was amputated as well. Tinker died at Orange Memorial Hospital in Orlando on July 27, 1948, his 68th birthday, of complications from diabetes. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery and survived by his four children.|$|E
5|$|The four {{throwing}} events generally all {{begin on}} one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with <b>a</b> <b>toe</b> board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area {{on one side}} of the field specifically for steeplechase races.|$|E
50|$|Brian Joubert (FRA) lands three quads (<b>a</b> quad <b>toe</b> in {{combination}} with double <b>toe,</b> <b>a</b> quad Salchow and <b>a</b> second quad <b>toe)</b> in competition at the Cup of Russia. He became the first European to perform it, and the first skater to land three quads in a free program under the ISU Judging System.|$|R
50|$|Timothy Goebel {{made history}} by {{becoming}} {{the first person to}} land three quadruple jumps in one program. In the men's free skating, he landed a quad salchow, <b>a</b> quad <b>toe</b> loop in combination, and <b>a</b> quad <b>toe</b> loop as <b>a</b> solo jump.|$|R
50|$|Chan won {{his fourth}} {{consecutive}} Canadian National title at the 2011 Canadian Championships. He placed {{first in the}} short program with 88.78 points after landing <b>a</b> quad <b>toe</b> loop and <b>a</b> triple flip-triple <b>toe</b> loop, though he doubled his intended triple axel. He won the free skating earning 197.07 after completing <b>a</b> quad <b>toe</b> loop, <b>a</b> quad <b>toe</b> loop-triple toe loop combination and six more triple jumps. This {{was the first time}} he landed two quad toe loops in the same program. Overall, he won the gold medal with 285.85 points. His free skating and combined total scores were a new record at the Canadian Nationals.|$|R
5|$|Tom Dollery {{was called}} into the team after a run of heavy scoring for Warwickshire on {{difficult}} pitches at Edgbaston. He had made two centuries and seven fifties in 12 first-class matches for the season. Batsman Charlie Barnett was dropped after scoring only eight and six in the First Test. Joe Hardstaff junior was also left out; he had scored a duck and 43 in the First Test, and had <b>a</b> <b>toe</b> infection, so the selectors were spared the predicament of deciding whether to drop him on performance grounds. With Wright in for Young, and Coxon selected {{in place of a}} specialist batsman, England had a more attacking bowling line-up, something the retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly praised. He also thought the selection of Coxon was beneficial, as his swing bowling would ease the workload of batsman Bill Edrich, who had opened the bowling in the previous Test. O'Reilly regarded Edrich as a mediocre bowler and thought the extra burden with the ball was detracting from his main duty, batting.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{suffered}} several injuries {{over the}} course of the season, including a back problem, a knee injury and <b>a</b> <b>toe</b> injury, the latter sidelining him for four months. Dickov made nine starts and seven substitute appearances in 2006–07, but failed to score a single goal. In May 2007 he announced his interest in pursuing a coaching role when he retires. He was transfer listed by Manchester City in August. He joined Crystal Palace on a three-month loan on 31 August 2007. He played his first game for the Eagles in a friendly against Crystal Palace Baltimore, Crystal Palace's American counterparts, on Friday 7 September, playing the full 90 minutes. On 31 January 2008, Dickov joined Blackpool managed by Simon Grayson on loan until May. Two days later he scored on his debut for Blackpool, what proved to be the winning goal in the Seasiders' 2–1 victory against Leicester City, one of his former clubs, at Bloomfield Road. He had come on as a 70th-minute substitute and scored the winning goal in the 89th minute. It was his first goal since 2 January 2006. He went on to score five goals in his first five appearances for the club, and on 4 March he was named as the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA)'s Fans Championship Player of the Month for February. By the end of his loan, Dickov had scored six goals in eleven appearances. He returned to Manchester City after his loan before then being released at the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|The scapula (shoulder blade) {{was longer}} than the humerus (upper arm bone); its blade was slender and narrow, and {{slightly}} twisted, following the contour of the ribs. The scapula did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The coracoid was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a slender shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The deltopectoral crest (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles attach) was weakly developed. The ends of the ulna were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The radius was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the pelvic girdle was very broad for a bipedal archosaur, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The ilium was elongated and the ischium was long and slender. Though the pubis is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of Homalocephale. The femur (thigh bone) was slender and inwards curved, the tibia was slender and twisted, and the fibula was slender and wide at the upper end. The metatarsus of the foot {{appears to have been}} narrow, and the single known ungual (claw bone) of <b>a</b> <b>toe</b> was slender and slightly curved. Though the limbs of Stegoceras are not completely known, other pachycephalosaurs show that they had five-fingered hands and four toes.|$|E

5|$|Michigan lost to Purdue on January 3, {{by making}} only 4 second half field goals after taking an 8-point half time lead. The team {{defeated}} Penn State on January 6 with Albrecht {{in the starting}} lineup in place of Chatman. On January 10, the team wore throwback uniforms honoring the 1988–89 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team that won the 1989 NCAA Tournament. Michigan was down 49–40 with less than nine minutes remaining, before coming back to defeat Minnesota by a margin of 62–57. Michigan lost to (Receiving votes/#25) Ohio State on January 13. On January 17 Michigan defeated Northwestern, but lost LeVert for the season after he reinjured the foot that he had had surgery on the prior May. In the game, Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman made his first start (in place of an ailing Albrecht) and made the game winning three-point shot. At the time of his injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8). Nonetheless, the team defeated Rutgers in its first game without LeVert and with Dawkins making his first start. With LeVert absent, Walton scored 10 of the team's 15 points as it rallied from a 42–37 deficit to assume a 52–44 lead with just 32.5 seconds left. On January 24, Michigan fell to (AP #6/Coaches #5) Wisconsin in overtime after Walton, who had a team-high 17 points, scored Michigan's final seven points, including a game-tying three point shot with 1.3 seconds remaining in regulation. The game had been the featured College GameDay game of the week. On January 27 with Walton and Mark Donnal sidelined Michigan defeated Nebraska, as Irvin recorded his first career double-double, leading the team with 14 points and a career-high 12 rebounds. Eventually, Walton missed final 12 of the season due to <b>a</b> <b>toe</b> injury. Due to the backcourt injuries, Dakich burned his redshirt season. Michigan finished the first half of its conference schedule with a 6–3 record.|$|E
