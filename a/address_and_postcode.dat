40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Death Records dataset of Scotland contains administrative records about mortality events occurred in Scotland since 1974. Typically, information that is collected on the registration form includes name and address, date and cause of death, duration of illness {{as well as the}} occupation of the deceased. The cause of death is recorded on a medical certificate and must be taken at the time of registration. Arrangements for the registration of a stillbirth follow roughly the same process. All deaths in Scotland must be registered within eight days by a Local Registrar. Then, every death registered is entered by a Local Registrar onto the Forward Electronic Register (FER) system. This is a live computer system linked to National Records of Scotland. The information is then transferred to the National Records of Scotland Vital Events statistical database where quality checks are carried out on each record. The paper records are sent by Local Registrars to National Records of Scotland (NRS) in January of each year. The registration of a death in Scotland is controlled by the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965. The Act controls the registration system of births, deaths and marriages in Scotland, including the provision of statistics to Scottish Ministers and the power to the Registrar General authority to correct errors in entries. Information on Scottish deaths has been recorded since 1855 when it became compulsory. However, information in the National Records of Scotland database is available from 1974 onwards. All Vital Events which occur in Scotland should be registered in Scotland, even if the people involved are residents of other countries. Registrations do not include Scottish residents who have died abroad. Information on deaths in England and Wales is recorded by the Office for National Statistics. In Northern Ireland it is recorded by the Department for Finance and Personnel. The classification of the underlying cause of death is based on the information collected on the death certificate together with any additional information provided by other official sources. The cause of death codes may change if additional information is provided by a GP, Consultant or Procurators Fiscal. For deaths registered from 1 January 2000, the causes of death have been coded in accordance with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD- 10). Deaths which were registered in 1999 were coded using both ICD- 9 and ICD- 10, in order to obtain an indication of the effect on the figures of the change in the classification. The complexity of the ICD- 10 rules can result, in some cases, in the underlying cause of death coded by National Records of Scotland differing from that which was recorded on the original death certificate. The National Records of Scotland Death Records data is of a high standard and is the most reliable death dataset available in Scotland. Automatic quality checks are carried out by the National Records of Scotland computer system at the point of entry by the Local Registrar and further checks are then carried out by staff once the information has been passed into the National Records of Scotland Vital Events statistical database. Research Usage and Linkage The National Records of Scotland Death Records data are used in combination with other Vital Events statistics to produce a wide variety of health statistics and research and answer parliamentary questions. For example the figures contribute to debate and the development of policy on issues such as ‘fuel poverty’ and the health of the elderly, winter fuel payments, and programmes for seasonal flu vaccination, central heating installation and home insulation. The Scottish Government use the data for the development of health related policy including alcohol and drug related deaths and also suicides. It is also used to monitor their National Indicators, specifically to reduce mortality from coronary heart disease among the under 75 s in deprived areas and to target population growth. It is also used to estimate life expectancy in order to assess the scale of inequalities in health between different population sub-groups, and how Scotland compares with other countries. The Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland also widely use the data for health related research including cancer mortality, drug and alcohol misuse and also for the calculation of standardised mortality ratios for individual hospitals and the monitoring of unusual increases or patterns in deaths. In particular, the Death Records data are part of the ISD Scottish Morbidity Database, which links together NHS Scotland’s inpatient, mental health and cancer registry datasets with the NRS Death Records. Furthermore, NRS Stillbirth and infant death records are also part of NHS Scotland’s Maternity and Neonatal Linked Database. This database contains obstetric histories of mothers giving birth since 1981. National Records of Scotland Death Registration data are also used as part of the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS). This is a large-scale linkage study which has been created using data from a range of government statistical administrative sources. The SLS website provides a high quality longitudinal research dataset {{that can be used to}} provide an insight into the health and social status of the Scottish population and how it changes over time. In theory the National Records of Scotland Death Records can be linked to other datasets with common identifiable fields such as name, <b>address</b> <b>and</b> <b>postcode.</b> </div...|$|E
40|$|Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the commonest {{cause of}} {{premature}} death {{in men and}} women in Scotland. Research has suggested that a significant proportion of incident CHD is attributable to modifiable risk factors such as level of physical activity, diet and smoking. This recognition that CHD is a largely preventable disease has focused health policy, both in the UK and elsewhere, on prevention strategies. There is well established evidence of a socioeconomic gradient in CHD; where those of lowest socioeconomic position (SEP) experience the highest CHD burden and greatest exposure to cardiovascular risk factors. This presents distinct challenges for effective primary prevention (defined as the prevention of new-onset CHD) and secondary prevention (defined as the prevention of recurrent coronary events in patients with established CHD) of the disease. A key consideration in the implementation of CHD preventative strategies is thus the measure of SEP used in the allocation of preventative resources. This study will investigate the predictive validity of Council Tax Valuation Banding (CTVB) in identifying high-risk sub-groups within both CHD primary and secondary prevention populations. CTVB is worthy of consideration as a marker of SEP in this context as it appears to have several appealing characteristics appropriate for use in CHD prevention. CTVB is based on the property value; theoretically reflecting both individual material circumstance and to an extent geographical area characteristics. Furthermore CTVB is objective, uncomplicated, universally available and sensitive to the household level. This study originated from an interest in developing practical and applicable methods of identifying highest risk individuals within CHD prevention populations. Gaps in existing research support a need for this. Firstly a cohort of just under 2, 000 men and women, aged between 45 - 60 years who participated in the Have a Heart Paisley (HaHP) CHD Primary Prevention Programme was examined. These individuals were enrolled in 2006 and underwent comprehensive cardiovascular risk screening. Secondly, in 2009, the HaHP Chronic Disease Register (CDR) was used to pool Secondary Prevention primary care data for just over 3, 000 men and women, of all ages with established CHD. Socioeconomic patterning of risk factors and absolute risk was examined in the primary prevention population. Socioeconomic inequalities were examined in risk-factor monitoring and therapies prescribing in the secondary prevention population. SEP for analyses in both populations was measured using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) and CTVB- which was supplied by the Renfrewshire Joint Valuation Board. Both measures of SEP were linked to these data using address information and postcodes. The findings of this study demonstrate some potential for the use of CTVB as a surrogate marker of SEP in health research and cardiovascular preventative strategies. But that further research on this matter is required. CTVB showed significant association with few classical cardiovascular risk factors in the primary prevention population; body mass index in females, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol in females, and rates of current smokers in both males and females (age and age-squared adjusted). However all associations with the exception of rates of current smokers (both males and females) became insignificant when SIMD was added into the statistical modelling. CTVB displayed association with Framingham risk scores in both men and women (age and age-squared adjusted) however added independent predictive power in men only. The associations between SEP (as measured by CTVB) and classical risk factors in the present study are generally weaker than the literature reviewed using established measures of SEP. Particularly striking is the insignificant socioeconomic variance in blood pressure levels when using CTVB, which is at odds with the overwhelming majority of literature in this field to date. Aside from the CTVB analyses, in general the analysis undertaken adds to existing literature; re-enforcing the existence of socioeconomic inequalities in classical risk factors and absolute risk in an asymptomatic population. When examining the secondary prevention population, significant socioeconomic (using CTVB as a measure of SEP) variance was identified in risk-factor monitoring and in some therapies prescribing. The analyses demonstrates that the removal of “exception reporting” from the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) records reveals some important inequalities in care and treatment within an established CHD population. The analyses did demonstrate that overall rates of risk factor monitoring and therapies prescribing have risen markedly over the past decade, especially post introduction of the QOF. These findings have important implications for the delivery of the QOF in Scotland and for Secondary Prevention of CHD in general. Considerable methodological difficulty was encountered when using CTVB as a surrogate marker of SEP. Data linkage based on <b>address</b> <b>and</b> <b>postcode</b> data proved problematic, notable proportions within each population required matching “by hand” which proved time consuming. Furthermore use of CTVB in this study identified significant potential to misclassify the SEP of individuals who are renting properties; particularly homes of multiple occupation. Additionally the marked rise in housing price {{over the past two decades}} in the UK may further compromise CTVB’s accuracy as a measure of SEP. Such practical and theoretical limitations of the use of CTVB as a marker of SEP have not been reported in the literature to date. This supports the conclusions of the literature review within the present study which question the quality and scientific objectivity of studies examining CTVB as a marker of SEP undertaken thus far...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Birth Registration dataset for Northern Ireland contains the administrative records about birth events occurred in Northern Ireland since 1864, while electronic records are available from 1974 onwards. The Birth Registration data provide {{a wide variety of}} information including date and place of birth, parental forename(s), surname(s), occupation and address details. It also records marriage details and the mother’s previous live and stillborn births. All babies born in Northern Ireland must be registered within 42 days of the birth occurring. There are around 25, 000 births in Northern Ireland each year which are registered by 26 District Registrars. The Registrars are under the instruction and authority of the Northern Ireland Registrar General who are responsible for the recording of all life events (such as births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships) in Northern Ireland. Once a birth is registered and recorded by a District Registrar it is made available to the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP). In particular, every birth registered is entered by a Local Registrar onto an Electronic Register system. This is a live computer system linked to Department of Finance and Personnel. The information is then transferred to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA), an executive agency of the DFP, who carries out further quality check and compiles the data for research and statistical purposes. Information on birth registrations has been collected since 1864. The Department of Finance and Personnel keep Northern Ireland birth registration records from 1887 to the present day. Full electronic registration details have been kept since 1997. The data recorded are of high quality and should have complete population coverage as it is a legal requirement to register the birth. There are many in built checks that are carried out by the District Registrars and statisticians within NISRA to ensure data quality. All births which occur in Northern Ireland should be registered in Northern Ireland, even if the people involved are residents of other countries. For example, if an American baby is born in Northern Ireland, the birth should be registered in Northern Ireland. The residence of the baby born is allocated to the Mother’s usual area of residence and not the place where the birth occurred (although in many cases this will be the same). The Birth Registration dataset held by the Department of Finance and Personnel covers births in Northern Ireland only. Information on births in Scotland is recorded by National Records of Scotland. In England and Wales it is recorded by the Office for National Statistics. Birth registration records for England & Wales and/or Scotland may not always be on exactly the same basis as Northern Ireland as there can be differences in the coverage of what at first sight appear to be the same statistics. The registration of births in Ireland commenced on 1 st January 1864. Northern Ireland came into existence in 1922. Until this point, birth registrations were governed under All Ireland legislation. All birth registrations are now governed under the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, which repealed all prior legislation. Although information on birth registrations has been collected since 1864, the Department of Finance and Personnel keep Northern Ireland birth registration records from 1887 to the present day and full electronic registration details have been kept since 1997. Therefore, the information held by the Department of Finance and Personnel on birth registrations in Northern Ireland varies according to the time period. In particular, from 1887 to 1973 &# 58; The Department of Finance and Personnel hold basic information about birth registrations including sex of baby and parents marital status. The information for this period is held in the Annual Reports of the Registrar General and they have not yet been extracted into an electronic format for research and statistical purposes. from 1974 to 1996 &# 58; Electronic files are available for this period. The variables available include sex, age of parents, marital status of parents, number of previous children and geographical information. from 1997 onwards &# 58; More detailed electronic files are available on birth registrations for this period including name and address details, place of birth, country of birth and occupation of parents. Under the Stillbirth (Definition) Act 1992 there was a change in the definition of a stillbirth from 28 weeks gestation to 24 weeks gestation. A still born baby who was alive at 24 weeks gestation must be registered. Details are provided to a separate stillbirth register. Research Usage and Linkage The Northern Ireland birth registration data are used {{for a wide variety of}} purposes. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency use the data for the creation of birth statistics, reports and the Annual Report of the Registrar General. The data are also used as part of The Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS).

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Death Records dataset of Northern Ireland contains administrative records about mortality events occurred in Northern Ireland since 1974. The dataset contains {{a wide variety of}} information including date and place of death, forename(s) and surname, age, marital status, occupation and cause of death. There are around 14, 000 deaths in Northern Ireland each year which are registered by 26 District Registrars. The Registrars are under the instruction and authority of the Northern Ireland Registrar General who is responsible for the recording of all life events (such as births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships) in Northern Ireland. The population of Northern Ireland is approximately 1. 8 million. By law, deaths should be registered no later than five days from the date of death. In practice this does not always happen {{for a number of reasons}} such as coroner’s cases. Around 20 per cent of all deaths are referred to the Coroner. Once a death is recorded by a District Registrar the information is made available to the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP). The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) who are an executive agency of the DFP then compile the data for research and statistical purposes. The Death Records dataset held by the Department of Finance and Personnel covers deaths in Northern Ireland only. Information on deaths in Scotland is recorded by National Records of Scotland. In England and Wales it is recorded by the Office for National Statistics.

The information is then transferred to the NISRA statistical database where further quality checks are carried out on each record. The recording of deaths in Ireland commenced on 1 st January 1864. Northern Ireland came into existence in 1922. Until this point, the recording of deaths was governed under All Ireland legislation. Deaths are now governed under the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, which repealed all prior legislation. Statistics and publications that use the Northern Ireland Death Records data are available from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency website. From 2001 cause of death is classified using the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD 10). Previous years were coded in the ninth revision (1979 - 2000) and eighth revision (1970 - 1978). Although ICD- 09 and ICD- 10 are not comparable for alcohol related deaths, research in England and Wales showed that the introduction of ICD- 10 resulted in a difference of less than one per cent in the number of deaths from alcohol related causes compared to using ICD- 09. The information held by the Department of Finance and Personnel on death records in Northern Ireland varies according to the time period. Below provides a summary. 1887 to 1973 &# 58; the Department of Finance and Personnel hold basic information about death records including sex and age of death. The information held in these annual reports for this period have not yet been extracted into an electronic format for research and statistical purposes. 1974 to 1996 &# 58; electronic files are available for this period. The variables available include sex, age, cause of death and geographical information. 1997 onwards &# 58; more detailed electronic files are available on death records for this period including name and address details. In addition, during the period 1922 to 2008 there were multiple changes in coding practice for cause of death. Between 1967 and 1968 the coding changed from version 7 to version 8 of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and resulted in an increase in the number of deaths classified as ‘Circulatory diseases’. The data recorded are of a high quality and should have complete population coverage as it is a legal requirement to record a death. There are many in built checks that are carried out by the District Registrars and statisticians within NISRA to also ensure data quality. Research Usage and Linkage The death records data are used for a wide variety of purposes. The Northern Ireland Statistical and Research Agency use the data for statistical purposes and have produced research reports into the causes of death. The Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure identifies small area concentrations of multiple deprivation. NISRA use the death data to help produce some of the domains used to compile the measure. The data are also used as part of The Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS). This is a large scale data linkage study that combines census, vital events and health datasets to examine trends and patterns in cultural, demographic, economic, health, housing and social issues. The Centre for Suicide Prevention based at the University of Manchester receives quarterly extracts of the deaths data. The data are used by them to help research into suicide across the UK. NINIS (Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service) is part of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Birth Registration dataset for Scotland contains administrative records about birth events occurred in Scotland since 1855, while electronic individual records are available from 1974 onwards. Typically, the information collected through the registration form includes the date, time and place of birth, child’s name and sex, mother’s full name, place of residence, occupation, and details of the father depending on the marital status. Other information is collected for statistical information and this includes the mother’s previous children and her birth details as well as additional details about the father. A father’s name {{can be added to}} the register at any time after the birth. The registration of births in Scotland is controlled by the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965. The Act controls the registration system of births, deaths and marriages in Scotland, including the provision of statistics to Scottish Ministers and the power to the Registrar General authority to correct errors in entries. All births in Scotland must be registered within 21 days by a Local Registrar. This applies even if the baby is stillborn or only lives for a short time. The doctor or midwife attending the delivery must issue a medical certificate of stillbirth and this certificate is used to register the birth. &# 160; The paper records are sent by Local Registrars to National Records of Scotland in January of each year. However, birth registrations recorded by Local Registrars are also linked by a computer system and so National Records of Scotland always has a ‘live’ and up to date system of birth registrations in Scotland. In particular, every birth registered is entered by a Local Registrar onto the Forward Electronic Register (FER) system. This is a live computer system linked to National Records of Scotland. The information is then transferred to the National Records of Scotland Vital Events statistical database where quality checks are carried out on each record. The National Records of Scotland Birth Registration data is of a high standard. Automatic quality checks are carried out by the National Records of Scotland computer system at the point of entry by the Local Registrar and further checks are then carried out by staff once the information has been passed into the National Records of Scotland Vital Events statistical database. Information on births in England and Wales is recorded by the Office for National Statistics. In Northern Ireland it is recorded by the Department for Finance and Personnel. Birth registration records for England & Wales and/or Northern Ireland may not always be on exactly the same basis as National Records of Scotland’s figures for Scotland as there can be differences in the coverage of what at first sight appear to be the same statistics. For the purpose of producing statistics of home births from the information which is held in National Records of Scotland’s database, the following definition should exclude almost all the births which occur elsewhere&# 58; the final character of the ‘institution’ code is ‘N’ (i. e., the birth did not take place in an institution); the postcode of the mother’s usual residence {{is the same as the}} postcode of the place of birth (in order to exclude births which took place in, say, the house of another family member); and the mother’s country of residence is Scotland (this condition is necessary because, for mothers who are not resident in Scotland, the value in the National Records of Scotland statistical database’s field for the postcode of the mother’s usual residence may actually be the postcode of the place of birth. This is done so that, when National Records of Scotland produces statistics for areas within Scotland, it counts births to mothers who are not resident in Scotland on the basis of where the births occurred. National Records of Scotland produces its statistics of births to mothers who are not resident in Scotland by using the database’s separate code for mother’s country of residence). Note that this definition may not produce absolutely accurate figures for home births. It will include any cases where a mother gave birth in another home within the same postcode, and exclude cases where a woman chose (or had) to give birth in someone else’s home that was in a different postcode. All the Vital Events statistics of births, stillbirths, marriages, civil partnerships and deaths on the National Records of Scotland website are based on the date of registration of the event and not the date on which the event occurred. For example, a birth on 31 December 2010 which was registered on 5 January 2011 would be included in the 2011 figures (because the statistics are the numbers of events registered in the specified period). All Vital Events which occur in Scotland should be registered in Scotland, even if the people involved are residents of other countries. For example, if an American tourist dies in Scotland, the death should be registered in Scotland. Research Usage and Linkage The National Records of Scotland Birth Registration data are used in combination with other Vital Events statistics to produce a wide variety of statistics and research and answer parliamentary questions. This includes estimating the size of the population to meet population growth targets. National Records of Scotland Birth Registration data are also used as part of the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS). This is a large-scale linkage study which has been created using data from a range of government statistical administrative sources. This high quality longitudinal research dataset can be used to provide an insight into the health and social status of the Scottish population and how it changes over time. The National Records of Scotland Birth Registration records have been linked to other many studies and research. For example the data is part of the Millennium Cohort Study, a 1 % sample of census records and vital events data to help examine important social health and demographic issues. The Birth Registration data are also used by NHS Scotland for a wide variety of research including fertility rates and teenage pregnancies. NRS birth records are in fact part of NHS Scotland’s Maternity and Neonatal Linked Database, which contains obstetric histories of mothers giving birth since 1981. &# 160; In theory the National Records of Scotland Birth Registration records can be linked to other datasets with common identifiable fields such as name, <b>address</b> <b>and</b> <b>postcode.</b> </div...|$|E

50|$|The {{locality}} {{is required}} only where its absence would cause ambiguity, for example where a post town or postcode district includes two streets {{with the same}} name. Royal Mail specifies that post towns should be written in block capitals. Until 1996 a postal county (or permitted abbreviation) was required after the post town, unless {{it was a special}} post town, for example London. The post town <b>and</b> <b>postcode</b> should each be on a separate line. Historically, each line of an address ended with a comma and was indented from the previous line. Royal Mail discourage this usage and specify that all lines should start from the same point and not be staggered or aligned to the centre. The postcode identifies, from left to right, increasingly smaller units of the postal delivery system. The first half of the postcode, known as the outward code, contains the <b>postcode</b> area <b>and</b> <b>postcode</b> district. The second half, known as the inward code, contains the <b>postcode</b> sector <b>and</b> <b>postcode</b> unit.|$|R
