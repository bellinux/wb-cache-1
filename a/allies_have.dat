25|$|The use of {{the term}} {{insurgency}} recognizes the political motivation of those who participate in an insurgency, but the term brigandry implies no political motivation. If an uprising has little support (for example, those who continue to resist towards the end of an armed conflict when most of their <b>allies</b> <b>have</b> surrendered), such a resistance may be described as brigandry and those who participate as brigands.|$|E
25|$|Following the Libyan Civil War, {{the removal}} of Gaddafi and the ensuing period of post-civil war {{violence}} in Libya allowed various Islamist militant groups affiliated with al-Qaeda to expand their operations in the region. The 2012 Benghazi attack, {{which resulted in the}} death of US Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and 3 other Americans, is suspected of having been carried out by various Jihadist networks, such as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Ansar al-Sharia and several other Al-Qaeda affiliated groups. The capture of Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, a senior al-Qaeda operative wanted by the United States for his involvement in the 1998 United States embassy bombings, on October 5, 2013, by US Navy Seals, FBI and CIA agents illustrates the importance the US and other Western <b>allies</b> <b>have</b> placed on North Africa.|$|E
25|$|Once all <b>allies</b> <b>have</b> {{had their}} HP {{depleted}} to zero, the battle will end triggering a Game Over, {{which will give}} the player the option to retry the battle with the enemies' stats lowered and the OverDrive Gauge filled. If all enemies have had their HP deplete to zero, instead, the player will achieve victory and receive a rank based on their performance in battle. The rank is based both on time spent in battle and the finisher, but the rank will also be lowered if the player retried. Trigger Points and items are distributed based on the rank the player obtained in the battle. Also, if a character used an item enough times, that character will be rewarded with a stat up and the unlocking of an OverSkill {{that can be used}} in later battles.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{lingering}} geopolitical crises stemming from British colonialism {{is the challenge}} to Pashtun society posed by the Durand Line, the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan demarcated by the British, which dissects the traditional tribal territory of the Pashtuns. The severing of their tribal lands is viewed by Pashtun leaders {{as a threat to}} their dominance within Afghanistan, emboldening rival ethnic tribes, and has provoked cross-border tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. While having significant political, economic and social impact on Afghanistan, the intervention of the Soviet Union (1979–89), Afghan Civil War (1989–96), Taliban Regime (1996–2001) and United States invasion and occupation (2001–present) have not noticeably disrupted the primacy of ethnic tribal authority, and thus the power and influence of warlords, in ordering Afghan society. Although the United States and its coalition <b>allies</b> <b>have</b> expended a considerable amount of time, effort and resources attempting to foment the centralization of government and consolidation of power in the state with its seat of power in Kabul l, tribal warlords continue to maintain political influence and power throughout the country outside of Kabul.|$|E

He and Mistress Quickly go inside the inn. Ford has realised his error in suspecting his wife, and they and their <b>allies</b> <b>have</b> been watching secretly. [...] They now concoct a plan for Falstaff's punishment: dressed as supernatural creatures, they will ambush and torment him at midnight. Ford privately proposes a separate plot to Caius: Nannetta will be disguised as Queen of the Fairies, Caius will wear a monk's costume, and Ford will join the two of them with a nuptial blessing. Mistress Quickly overhears and quietly vows to thwart Ford's scheme.|$|E

500|$|Numbers {{of ships}} and {{men for the}} Allies are also {{somewhat}} problematic. Herodotus claims that Leotychides had 110 triremes under his command. However, the previous year, the <b>allies</b> <b>had</b> fielded 271 triremes at the Battle of Artemisium, and then 378 at the Battle of Salamis. We are also told that the <b>Allies</b> <b>had</b> [...] "command of the sea" [...] after Salamis, which implies that they could at least equal the Persian fleet. Diodorus, on the other hand, tells us the <b>allies</b> <b>had</b> 250 ships, which is more consistent with their force levels of the previous year. These two numbers can be reconciled by assuming that Leotychides had 110 triremes under his command before being joined by Xanthippus and the Athenian ships, after the <b>Allied</b> army <b>had</b> marched out from the Peloponnesus. This is the approach taken by Holland, and gives a naval force which might well match {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet.|$|R

Ex-FBI agent Canton Delaware, under the ruse of capturing them as criminals, helps to reunite the group inside a special prison at Area 51 containing the TARDIS. Though they do not yet know the name or motive for the aliens, the Doctor's <b>allies</b> <b>have</b> discovered they exist across the entire planet, and have the ability to place post-hypnotic suggestions in humans they encounter. The Doctor plants a communication device called a nanorecorder in each of the group's hands to record audio of meetings with the Silence. As they travel to Kennedy Space Center shortly before the launch of Apollo 11, Amy tells the Doctor she was mistaken and is not pregnant as she previously had claimed.|$|E
500|$|Historically, {{the studies}} of {{learning}} and cognition in non-human primates have focused on simians (monkeys and apes), while strepsirrhine primates, such as the ring-tailed lemur and its <b>allies,</b> <b>have</b> been overlooked and popularly dismissed as unintelligent. A couple of factors stemming from early experiments {{have played a role}} in the development of this assumption. First, the experimental design of older tests may have favored the natural behavior and ecology of simians over that of strepsirrhines, making the experimental tasks inappropriate for lemurs. For example, simians are known for their manipulative play with non-food objects, whereas lemurs are only known to manipulate non-food objects in captivity. This behaviour is usually connected with food association. Also, lemurs are known to displace objects with their nose or mouth more so than with their hands. [...] Therefore, an experiment requiring a lemur to manipulate an object without prior training would favor simians over strepsirrhines. Second, individual ring-tailed lemurs accustomed to living in a troop may not respond well to isolation for laboratory testing. Past studies have reported hysterical behaviour in such scenarios.|$|E
