Two algorithms are provided, one which finds a minimal arc embedding (in quadradic time in the number of crossings), and one which constructs a minimal subdiagram having same arc number as D. 1. introduction An undecorated chord diagram D = (C,H,X) consists of an oriented circle C, a set H ⊂ C half-crossings having finite, even cardinality, and a partition X of H into two element sets, called (full) crossings. Given another undecorated chord diagram D ′ = (C ′, H ′, X ′), D and D ′ are equivalent as undecorated chord diagrams (write D ∼ D′) if there is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism φ: C → C ′ such that φ(x) |x ∈ X = X ′.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{results of a}} {{comparison}} between ultra low frequency (ULF) electromagnetic (EM) radiation, recorded by an electric field instrument onboard the satellite detection of electromagnetic emissions transmitted from earthquake regions in the topside ionosphere, and the seismicity of regions with high and low seismic activity. In particular, we evaluated the energy variations of the ULF Ezelectric field component {{during a period of}} four years (2006 - 2009), in order to examine the possible relation of ULF EM radiation with seismogenic regions located in Central America, Indonesia, the Eastern Mediterranean Basin and Greece. As a tool for evaluating the ULF Ez energy variations we used singular spectrum analysis techniques. The results of our analysis clearly show a significant increase of the ULF EM energy emitted from regions of highest seismic activity at the boundaries tectonic plates. Furthermore, we found that higher electromagnetic radiation was detected in a region above the northern- western Greek <b>Arc</b> (<b>R</b> 1) than above the adjacent region including Athens and its urban area. We interpret these {{results of the present study}} as suggesting that: i) the seismogenic regions at the boundary of tectonic plates radiate ULF EM emissions observed by satellites in the topside ionosphere; and ii) that this EM radiation is not only related with the occurrence time of great (M≥ 5) earthquakes, but it is often present in intermediate times and it appears as a quasi-permanent phenomenon...|$|E

Its prevalence has increased since the use of the aldosterone (ALD) /plasma renin activity (PRA) ratio (ARR). The objective {{of this study is to}} determine ARR and ARC (ALD/plasma renin concentration ratio) cut-off values (COV) and their diagnostic concordance (DC%) in the screening for PA in an Argentinian population. Design multicenter prospective study. Subjects and methods We studied 353 subjects (104 controls and 249 hypertensive patients). Serum aldosterone, PRA and ARR were determined. In 220 randomly selected subjects, 160 hypertensive patients and 60 controls, plasma renin concentration (PRC) was simultaneously measured and ARC was determined. Results According to the 95 th percentile of controls, we determined a COV of 36 for ARR and 2. 39 for ARC, with ALD &# 8805; 15 ng/dL. In 31 / 249 hypertensive patients, ARR was &# 8805; 36.

40|$|In my {{graduation}} thesis I {{focused on}} curved turnouts as devices which enable the transition between tracks in curves (arc and transtiton curve). This {{is perceived as}} one of the more complexed processes in railway transport. The first part of the thesis covers the theoretical background. It therefore represents the clasification of turnouts, their labeling and components. The calculation of horizontal elements (radius of the turnout track, and lengths changes of closure rails) and altitude profile of the turnout is essential for the design of the turnouts. This is how the speed through the turnout is defined. I have used this knowledge to design the doublel track, which runs in an <b>arc</b> (<b>R</b> = 800 m) and then with the transition curve ends into the station area. Longitudinal slope of the rail is S‰ = 2 ‰. The track connection in the arc is composed by right internal curved turnout (KR 1) and right external curved turnout (KR 2). In the end of the transition curve the station track split from the internal rail track. All this enables the right internal parabolic turnout (KR 3). These calculations are all based on the turnout 60 E 1 - 500 - 1 : 12. What is more I also made the calculations for horizontal elements and the altitude profile for the entire turnout area. In the final part of the thesis I drew a ground plan and the altitude profile of the turnout area. All designing work was done accordingly to the Guideline about the railway superstructure (Pravilnik o zgornjem ustroju železniških prog, UL RS, št. 92 / 2010). ...|$|E
40|$|A physics-based {{prediction}} model is employed to simulate jet surface interaction (JSI) noise in a transversely sheared jet exhaust. The methodology finds application in jets {{with a high}} aspect ratio (AR) rectangular exhaust in the proximity of a flat surface. Two component spectra are simulated: (i) mixing/scrubbing noise; (ii) trailing edge noise [...] and are superimposed to obtain the far field exhaust noise {{on either side of}} a nearby surface. This document describes the necessary input parameters (including mean flow and turbulence information for the nozzle exhaust of interest) that should be prepared in order to initiate the simulation for each noise component. Sample input/output files in connection with an 8 : 1 aspect ratio rectangular exhaust at Mach 0. 98 near a rigid surface are described. Jet noise spectra are examined below at operating conditions listed in Table IV. Individual noise components, designated as Scrubbing Noise and Trailing Edge Noise, are presented and their sum Total Noise (Analysis) is compared with Measurement (Refs. 8 and 9) at selective number of observer polar angles at azimuth = 90 deg. Results are presented on an <b>arc</b> <b>R</b> = 17. 80 -ft (i. e., R = 100 Deq) on both sides of a nearby surface. Although the predicted TE noise component is symmetric with respect to the edge due to symmetry in the propagator, measurements for the majority of cases are not quite symmetric and exhibit a slightly larger peak on the reflected side of the surface. Turbulent mixing/scrubbing noise component has a greater presence on the reflected side, as expected. Figure 13 to Figure 18 show that the peak in the predicted TE component could differ from measurements by as much as 4 dB due to lack of symmetry in measured data, however, the general trend is in agreement with data across the three Mach numbers. The overall sound pressure level (OASPL) associated with the TE noise component follows a U 5 velocity scaling in the current modeling (Ref. 4). Directivity predictions for the TE noise component as well as the total noise are shown in Figure 19 (bottom) -and are compared with measurements (top figure) at conditions of Table IV. As anticipated, the TE noise component (dashed-line) overwhelms the directivity factor due to its dominant spectral peak level. Only at small angles to the jet axis the mixing noise component contributes significant enough to weight noticeably on the total noise...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{discuss the}} X-ray and optical {{properties}} of the massive galaxy cluster MACSJ 1206. 2 - 0847 (z = 0. 4385), discovered in the Massive Cluster Survey (MACS). Our Chandra observation of the system yields a total X-ray luminosity of 2. 4 × 1045 ergs- 1 (0. 1 - 2. 4 keV) and a global gas temperature of 11. 6 +/- 0. 7 keV, very high values typical of MACS clusters. In both optical and X-ray images, MACSJ 1206. 2 - 0847 appears close to relaxed in projection, with a pronounced X-ray peak {{at the location of}} the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG); we interpret this feature as the remnant of a cold core. A spectacular giant gravitational arc, 15 arcsec in length, bright (V ~ 21) and unusually red (R - K = 4. 3), is seen 20 arcsec west of the BCG; we measure a redshift of z = 1. 036 for the lensed galaxy. From our Hubble Space Telescope image of the cluster, we identify the giant arc and its counter image as a sevenfold imaged system. An excess of X-ray emission {{in the direction of the}} arc coincides with a mild galaxy overdensity and could be the remnant of a minor merger with a group of galaxies. We derive estimates of the total cluster mass as well as of the mass of the cluster core using X-ray, dynamical and gravitational-lensing techniques. For the mass enclosed by the giant <b>arc</b> (<b>r</b> < 119 kpc), our strong-lensing analysis based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging yields a very high value of 1. 1 × 1014 Msolar, inconsistent with the much lower X-ray estimate of 0. 5 × 1014 Msolar. Similarly, the virial estimate of 4 × 1015 Msolar for the total cluster mass, derived from multi-object spectroscopy with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and the VLT of 38 cluster members, is significantly higher than the corresponding X-ray estimate of 1. 7 × 1015 Msolar. We take the discrepancy between X-ray and other mass estimates to be indicative of pronounced substructure along the line of sight during an ongoing merger event, an interpretation that is supported by the system's very high velocity dispersion of 1580 km s- 1.

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} use of a spatial {{analysis}} technique, based on the calculation of local spatial autocorrelation, as a possible approach for modelling and quantifying structure in northern Australian savanna landscapes. Unlike many landscapes in the world, northern Australian savanna landscapes appear on the surface to be intact. They have not experienced the same large-scale land clearance and intensive land management as other landscapes across Australia. Despite this, natural resource managers are beginning to notice that processes are breaking down and declines in species are becoming more evident. With future declines of species looking more imminent it is particularly important that models are available that can help to assess landscape health, and quantify any structural change that takes place. GIS and landscape ecology provide a useful way of describing landscapes both spatially and temporally and have proved to be particularly useful for understanding vegetation structure or pattern in landscapes across the world. There are many measures that examine spatial structure in the landscape and most of these are now available in a GIS environment (e. g. FRAGSTATS* <b>ARC,</b> <b>r.</b> le, and Patch Analyst). All these methods depend on a landscape described in terms of patches, corridors and matrix. However, since landscapes in northern Australia appear to be relatively intact they tend to exist as surfaces of continuous variation rather than in clearly defined homogeneous units. As a result they cannot be easily described using entity-based models requiring patches and other essentially cartographic approaches. This means that more appropriate methods need to be developed and explored. The approach examined in this paper enables clustering and local pattern in the data to be identified and forms a generic method for conceptualising the landscape structure where patches are not obvious and where boundaries between landscape features are difficult to determine. Two sites are examined using this approach. They have been exposed to different degrees of disturbance by fire and grazing. The results show that savanna landscapes are very complex and that even where there is a high degree of disturbance the landscape is still relatively heterogeneous. This means that treating savanna landscapes as being made up of homogeneous units can limit analysis of pattern, as it can over simplify the structure present, and that methods such as the autocorrelation approach are useful tools for quantifying the variable nature of these landscapes...|$|E
