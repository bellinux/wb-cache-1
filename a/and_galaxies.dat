5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter in the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies,</b> scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in the universe is dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark matter in the universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{observations}} of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are {{in agreement with the}} current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies</b> formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet telescopes make {{observations}} at ultraviolet wavelengths, i.e. between approximately 10 and 320 nm. Light {{at these}} wavelengths is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Objects emitting ultraviolet radiation include the Sun, other stars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|E

5|$|Once a field {{had been}} selected, an observing {{strategy}} {{had to be}} developed. An important decision was to determine which filters the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including narrowband filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest, and broadband filters useful {{for the study of}} the colours of stars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies.</b> The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the 'throughput' of each filter—the total proportion of light that it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with bandpasses overlapping as little as possible were desirable.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies</b> has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E
5|$|The first {{subatomic}} particles to be formed included protons, neutrons, and electrons. Though simple atomic nuclei formed {{within the first}} three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first electrically neutral atoms formed. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were hydrogen, along with helium and traces of lithium. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies,</b> and the heavier elements were synthesized either within stars or during supernovae.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies.</b> It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E
5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, {{and in a few}} cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies,</b> and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.|$|E
5|$|Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic {{names to}} many stars {{that are still}} used today and they invented {{numerous}} astronomical instruments that could compute {{the positions of the}} stars. They built the first large observatory research institutes, mainly for the purpose of producing Zij star catalogues. Among these, the Book of Fixed Stars (964) was written by the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, who observed a number of stars, star clusters (including the Omicron Velorum and Brocchi's Clusters) <b>and</b> <b>galaxies</b> (including the Andromeda Galaxy). According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian polymath scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni described the Milky Way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of nebulous stars, and also gave the latitudes of various stars during a lunar eclipse in 1019.|$|E

5|$|Outer space, or just space, is {{the expanse}} {{that exists between}} {{celestial}} bodies, including Earth. Outer space is not completely empty, but consists of a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7kelvins (K) (−270.45°C; −454.81°F). Plasma with a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins {{in the space between}} galaxies accounts for most of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in outer space; local concentrations have condensed into stars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Observations indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Other observations indicate {{that the majority of the}} mass-energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space which astronomers label dark energy. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the Universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies</b> visible today.|$|E
25|$|Astronomy is the {{scientific}} study of celestial objects (such as stars, planets, comets, <b>and</b> <b>galaxies)</b> and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere (such as the cosmic background radiation). It is concerned with the evolution, physics, chemistry, meteorology, and motion of celestial objects, as well as the formation and development of the universe.|$|E

25|$|JWST is {{the formal}} {{successor}} to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and since its primary emphasis is on infrared observation, {{it is also a}} {{successor to the}} Spitzer Space Telescope. JWST will far surpass both those telescopes, being able to see many more and much older stars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Observing in the infrared is a key technique for achieving this, because it better penetrates obscuring dust and gas, allows observation of dim cooler objects, and because of cosmological redshift. Since water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs most infrared, ground-based infrared astronomy is limited to narrow wavelength ranges where the atmosphere absorbs less strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared, often overwhelming light from the object being observed. This makes space the ideal place for infrared observation.|$|E
25|$|An oversimplified {{definition}} of the tropical year would be the time required for the Sun, beginning at a chosen ecliptic longitude, to make one complete cycle of the seasons {{and return to the}} same ecliptic longitude. Before considering an example, the equinox must be examined. There are two important planes in solar system calculations, the plane of the ecliptic (the Earth's orbit around the Sun), and the plane of the celestial equator (the Earth's equator projected into space). These two planes intersect in a line. This direction is given the symbol ♈ (the symbol looks like the horns of a ram because it used to be toward the constellation Aries. The opposite direction is given the symbol ♎ (because it used to be toward Libra). Because of the precession of the equinoxes and nutation these directions change, compared to the direction of distant stars <b>and</b> <b>galaxies,</b> whose directions have no measurable motion due to their great distance (see International Celestial Reference Frame).|$|E
