50|$|In fluid dynamics, a Tollmien-Schlichting wave (often {{abbreviated}} T-S wave) is <b>a</b> <b>streamwise</b> unstable wave which {{arises in}} a bounded shear flow (such as boundary layer and channel flow). It {{is one of}} the more common methods by which a laminar bounded shear flow transitions to turbulence. The waves are initiated when some disturbance (sound, for example) interacts with leading edge roughness in a process known as receptivity. These waves are slowly amplified as they move downstream until they may eventually grow large enough that nonlinearities take over and the flow transitions to turbulence.|$|E
5000|$|As an updraft {{begins to}} form, it {{will tend to}} tilt the {{crosswise}} vorticity lines into the vertical, resulting in an anticyclonic vorticity axis on the northern fringe and a cyclonic vorticity axis on the southern fringe of the updraft. At this point, despite vorticity lines being oriented in the vertical, the storm {{can not be considered}} a supercell, as the areas of rotation are outside of the main updraft. Due to the short time scale (scale analysis reveals the Coriolis acceleration in the vorticity equation is negligible on short time scales [...] ), the areas of vorticity result in low pressure (perturbations) on the flanks of the convective updraft. Given favorable environmental thermodynamics (sufficient buoyancy and negligible convective inhibition {CIN}) these pressure perturbations will induce mass flux from below, initiating new convective updrafts. These new updrafts are now located [...] "off" [...] the hodograph, with one to the left and one to the right, both co-located with the previously mentioned pressure perturbations. The updraft can now enhance the vorticity (by as much a several orders of magnitude) through stretching. Additionally, since both new updrafts are now located off the hodograph, <b>a</b> <b>streamwise</b> vorticity component (quantifiable as Storm Relative Helicity...SRH) is able to be ingested into the storm (with the anticylonic split ingesting negative SRH and the right split ingesting positive SRH).

Flow visualization was also used to verify these results. In contrast to most recent studies, low angles of attack were emphasized, with most data {{in the range of}} 5 – 20 deg. Delta wings of 50 - and 65 -deg leading-edge sweep and 30 -deg windward-side bevels were tested at Reynolds numbers of 6 £ 103 – 1. 5 £ 104. At these low Reynolds numbers, secondary leading-edge vortices were weak, giving way to essentially stagnant ow outboard of the primary leading-edge vortices at the higher angles of attack. Otherwise, velocity data for the 65 -deg wing were consistent with well-known observations for slender delta wings. The 50 -degwing exhibited unexpectedly strong primary leading-edge vortices at low angles of attack, with a generally conical velocity eld. Upstream progression of vortex breakdown with increasing angle of attack exhibited extensive regions of streamwise undulation. Leading-edge shear-layer rollup was observed in cross ow planes well downstream of the breakdown region, but with an increased occurrence of paired vortical structures of opposite sign inside the shear layer itself.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{input-output}} response of <b>a</b> <b>streamwise</b> constant {{projection of the}} Navier-Stokes equations for plane Couette flow, the so-called 2 D/ 3 C model. Study of <b>a</b> <b>streamwise</b> constant model is motivated by numerical and experimental observations that suggest the prevalence and importance of streamwise and quasi-streamwise elongated structures. Periodic spanwise/wall-normal (z–y) plane stream functions are used as input to develop a forced 2 D/ 3 C streamwise velocity field that is qualitatively similar to a fully turbulent spatial field of direct numerical simulation data. The input-output response associated with the 2 D/ 3 C nonlinear coupling is used to estimate the energy optimal spanwise wavelength over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results of the input-output analysis agree with previous studies of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. The optimal energy corresponds to minimal nonlinear coupling. On the other hand, {{the nature of the}} forced 2 D/ 3 C streamwise velocity field provides evidence that the nonlinear coupling in the 2 D/ 3 C model is responsible for creating the well known characteristic “S” shaped turbulent velocity profile.
