25|$|Lippstadt was {{not used}} as an active RAF base and {{eventually}} the destroyed airfield and its facilities were completely removed. The British Army constructed a new garrison (Camp El Alamein) spreading a mean part of the former airfield. From 1958 to 2007 the Bundeswehr used the garrison as Lipperland-Kaserne. The surroundings including the Luftwaffe garrison was used for creating new urban settlements in the late 1940s/early 1950s. Since 2013 an investor is rising a business area {{in the northern part}} and family homes in the south of the area of the former Bundeswehr garrison. So the urban area has absorbed the former airfield and only little evidence of existence remains. The Luftwaffe station can still be seen by some military style buildings laid out in a pattern indicating a garrison next to the former airfield as well in the business <b>area</b> <b>you</b> will find facilities of the former Bundeswehr use.|$|E
25|$|The Coulomb {{approximation}} mathematically {{follows from}} the assumptions that surfaces are in atomically close contact only over {{a small fraction of}} their overall area, that this contact area is proportional to the normal force (until saturation, which takes place when all area is in atomic contact), and that the frictional force is proportional to the applied normal force, independently of the contact <b>area</b> (<b>you</b> can see the experiments on friction from Leonardo da Vinci). Such reasoning aside, however, the approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule of thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though in general the relationship between normal force and frictional force is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.|$|E

"Once {{inside an}} <b>Area</b> <b>you</b> must look after yourself; but I {{tell you that}} a fight which means that every man-Jack of us may lose a week's pay isn't so damn-sham after all. It keeps the men nippy. Still, in the long run, it's like whist on a P. & O. It comes out fairly level if you play long enough. Now and again, though, one gets a present--say, when a Line {{regiment}}'s out on the 'heef,' and signifies that it's ready {{to abide by the}} rules of the game. You mustn't take head-money from a Line regiment in an Area unless it says that it'll play you; but, after a week or two, those clever Linesmen always think they see a chance of making a pot, and send in their compliments to the nearest I.G. Then the fun begins. We caught a Line regiment single-handed about two years ago in Ireland--caught it on the hop between a bog and a beach. It had just moved in to join its brigade, and we made a forty-two mile march in fourteen hours, and cut it off, lock, stock, and barrel. It went to ground like a badger--I will say those Line regiments can dig--but we got out privily by night and broke up the only road it could expect to get its baggage and company-guns along. Then we blew up a bridge that some Sappers had made for experimental purposes (they were rather stuffy about it) on its line of retreat, while we lay up in the mountains and signalled for the A.C. of those parts." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the case}} of {{secondary}} and higher education one discovers an equal stress and incompatibility. At present, I must point out, even {{the boundaries of the}} projected educational authority for London are absurdly narrow. For example, in Folkestone, as in every town upon the south coast, there are dozens of secondary schools that are purely London schools, and filled with London boys and girls, and there are endless great schools like Tonbridge and Charterhouse outside the London area that are also London schools. If you get, for example, a vigorous and efficient educational authority for London, and you raise a fine educational system in the London <b>area,</b> <b>you</b> will find it incomplete in an almost vital particular. You will give the prosperous middle class and the upper class of London the alternative of good teaching and bad air, or of what very probably, under tolerant local authorities, will be relatively bad teaching and open air and exercise out of London. You will have to tax this influential class of people for the magnificent schools they in many cases will be unable to use. As a consequence, you will find again all the difficulties of their opposition, practically the same difficulties that arise so naturally in the way of municipal trading. I would suggest that it would be not only logical but politic, for the London Educational Authority, and not the local authority, to control every secondary school wherever it happened to be, which in an average of years drew more than half its attendance from the London area. That, however, by the way. The point more material to my argument here is that the educational organization of the London area, the Thames valley, and the southern counties are inseparable; that the question of local locomotion is rapidly becoming impossible upon any smaller basis than such an area; that roads, light railways, drainage, water, are all clamouring now to be dealt with on the big scale; and that the more you cut this great area up, the more you leave it {{in the hands of the}} localized men, the more you sin against efficiency and the light.|$|E
