40|$|Graduation date: 1995 A CMOS {{implementation}} of a True-Q Flip Flop is presented. It can perform either as an asynchronous storage element in micropipelines or {{a part of the}} synchronizer. It is capable of double-edge triggering which latches data at both the rising and the trailing edges. It is also free of the metastability state problem. Some analog and digital circuits are incorporated with a true double-edge triggered Flip Flop (DETFF) making it a True-Q Flip Flop. A True-Q Flip Flop outputs an <b>acknowledge</b> <b>signal</b> only after the Q and NQ are stabilized. Therefore, if the proceeding stages utilize this <b>acknowledge</b> <b>signal</b> as the triggering signal, then, the value of Q from the flip flop will not be received by the next stage if Q is in a metastable state. The number of transistors used in this {{implementation of}} True-Q flip flop is 90. Due to the overhead of circuit complexity, the time delay from Request to <b>Acknowledge</b> <b>signal</b> is 6. 5 ns...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a FIFO buffer with fully asynchronous, {{non-blocking}} write and read operation is presented. The buffer's logic consists of a standard self-timed FIFO (e. g. pipeline) surrounded by two special interface blocks, In and Out, connected to Writer and Reader, respectively. To avoid temporal blocking of Writer requesting for a write when the pipeline is full the In block implements skipping of the data item. Similarly, if Reader attempts to read an empty pipe, to avoid its blocking, a special <b>acknowledge</b> <b>signal</b> is produced telling Reader to re-read the previous item. These blocks are synthesised from their Signal Transition Graph (STG) specifications using an asynchronous circuit synthesis tool, petrify.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Information can be transmitted over a channel synchronously or asynchronously. When the communication channel is asynchronous, then the receiver is not sure when the data transmitted by the sender will be received. To make the asynchronous channel delay insensitive, codes like unordered codes have been proposed. Although these codes are delay insensitive, the receiver still has to wait for all the 1 s in the transmitted data to be received before sending an <b>acknowledge</b> <b>signal</b> to the sender. A new class of codes called Proximity Detecting Codes can be used to overcome this problem associated with asynchronous channels. A t-proximity detecting (t-PD) code can detect when a received word is within distance t from the transmitted codeword, when using a four-phase asynchronous communication protocol (or other similar protocols). A non-trivial t-proximity detecting code must be unordered. However, not all unordered codes are t-proximity detecting. This thesis analyzes the designs and bounds for systematic proximity detecting codes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{describes}} an Electric Power Monitoring Device for low voltage (127 / 220 Volts) distribution network. A small sensor box makes an automatic phone call when an outage {{occurs at the}} costumer residence. An automated Call Center identifies the device and generates an <b>acknowledge</b> <b>signal</b> to the calling device. Many Power Utillities uses the Call Centers not only for customers complains [1] {{but also as a}} way to register outages [2][3]. Currently most of the outages in feeders or branches of electric power distribution in Brazil is detected and registered from costumers ’ phone calls to the Utility Call Centers (generally a reserved phone number 196 for this function) [3]. When a feeder outage happens (that causes generalized outage), thousands of phone calls are originated causing a bottleneck at the Call Center. Usually most of those calls are not completed. Increasing the number of attendants to handle 100 % of the claims is economically impracticable. On the other hand only through the phone call the Power Utility can receive the information about outages in feeder branches, after a key fuse for example. Using the device presented here, the Power Utility can receive a higher number of pone calls and have more information about outages in a shorter time and with better accuracy.

40|$|Delay-insensitive (DI) {{circuits}} are asynchronous circuits whose functional correctness {{is independent}} of the delays in their components and the interconnecting wires. The environment and circuit module follows a specified usage protocol, sometimes called handshake signals. It has been believed that purely DI circuits are easy to test because any fault will prevent the generation of an <b>acknowledge</b> <b>signal.</b> We show {{that this is not}} always true under a general set of components. A Petri net fault model is used to reveal the possibility of critical races/hazards during test. A design for test method using observation points is shown which guarantees 100 % fault coverage, and structural theorems are proved which can reduce/eliminate these observation points. No automated techniques exist so far for reducing the test length of these circuits, in particular, two-phase transition signaling circuits which contain implicit state encoding. Since there can be very few combinational components, classic scan design would not apply. A theory for control point insertion is presented for test length reduction. The major difficulty is in deriving a safe hazard-free test; the specified usage protocol does not directly apply because of the alterations made. Algorithms based on partial order protocol extraction and partial states are presented which produce provably correct test behaviors. Finally, an impossibility result is proved for fault tolerance in the most common class of DI circuit...|$|E

The two waves are recombined for a final output to an external digital-to-analog convertor.

40|$|Abstract — Asynchronous {{handshake}} protocol {{communication is}} accomplished by sending data down a communication link coupled with data validity information. Flow control is established by acknowledging the receipt of data, thereby enabling transmission of new data down the link. Handshake protocols operate at target cycle times based on system operational requirements. When the communication delay down wires increases beyond a certain point, the latency in sending the request and <b>acknowledge</b> <b>signals</b> across the link becomes longer than the target cycle time. This reduces the communication bandwidth below the desired value. This deleterious effect is particularly conspicuous on long links and network-on-chip communication. A method of enabling full communication bandwidth on wires with arbitrary delay when employing handshake communication is provided. This method supports end-to-end communication across links with arbitrarily large but finite latency without limiting the bandwidth, so long as line variation can be reliably controlled. This paper introduces the new SAS protocol, provides an efficient implementation, and reports the resultant significant energy and bandwidth improvements over conventional handshaking methods.

In order to compare designs that have been designed with different technologies, we attempt to scale the area, delay, and power by using lambda rules and ring oscillator delay and power results available on the MOSIS website.
