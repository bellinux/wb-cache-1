500|$|On October 29, 1963, two <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Chart</b> and Information Center cartographers, James Clarke Greenacre and Edward M. Barr, at the Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona, {{manually}} recorded {{very bright}} red, orange, and pink colour phenomena {{on the southwest}} side of Cobra Head; a hill southeast of the lunar valley Vallis Schröteri; and the southwest interior rim of the Aristarchus crater. This event sparked {{a major change in}} attitude towards TLP reports. According to Willy Ley: [...] "The first reaction in professional circles was, naturally, surprise, and hard {{on the heels of the}} surprise there followed an apologetic attitude, the apologies being directed at a long-dead great astronomer, Sir William Herschel." [...] A notation by Winifred Sawtell Cameron states (1978, Event Serial No. 778): [...] "This and their November observations started the modern interest and observing the Moon." [...] The credibility of their findings stemmed from Greenacre's exemplary reputation as an impeccable cartographer, rather than from any photographic evidence.|$|E
