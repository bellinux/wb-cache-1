A step-by-step calculation model was established in order to predict the characteristic points of the thermodynamic cycle of the R 22 -E 181 ARU and to simulate its performance. The influence of the ambient conditions on the operation of the ARU is shown graphically when the saturated condensing temperature ranges from 30 to 45 degreesC. Regression analysis is carried out to express the actual coefficient of performance and the cooling load as functions of the condenser temperature and the absorber-condenser temperature difference.
