5|$|A {{member of}} the Whadjuk Noongar people, Yagan belonged to a tribe of around 60 people whose name, {{according}} to Robert Lyon, was Beeliar. Scholars now believe that the Beeliar people {{may have been a}} family subgroup (or clan) of a larger tribe whom Daisy Bates called Beelgar. According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the Swan and Canning rivers, as far south as Mangles Bay. The group had customary land usage rights over a much larger <b>area</b> <b>than</b> this, extending north as far as Lake Monger and northeast to the Helena River. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours' land, possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring groups.|$|E

5|$|Maple {{and lime}} forests {{are found in}} gulleys. These forests are only present in {{isolated}} areas and {{are at risk of}} extinction. Downy oak woods are more common in the Aosta Valley <b>area</b> <b>than</b> in the Piedmont area because of its higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Oak is not a typical species in the park and it is often found mixed with Scots pine. The park's chestnut groves have been affected by human cultivation for wood and fruit. It rarely grows above 1,000 metres (3,280ft), and the most important chestnut forests are in the park's Piedmontese side. The park's conifer woods include Scots pine groves, spruce forests dominated by the Norway spruce, often mixed with larch. Larch and Swiss stone pine woods are found up to the highest sub-alpine level (2200–2300 metres (7,217-7,546ft)).|$|E

5|$|Since 1958, the Cup has {{undergone}} several minor alterations. The original collar and bowl were too brittle, and were replaced in 1963 and 1969, respectively. The modern one-piece Cup design {{was introduced in}} 1958, when the old barrel was replaced with a five-band barrel, each of which could contain 13 winning teams. Although the bands were originally designed to fill up during the Cup's centennial year, {{the names of the}} 1965 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a larger <b>area</b> <b>than</b> allotted and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 13. When the bands were all filled in 1991, the top band of the large barrel was preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was added to the bottom so the Stanley Cup would not grow further.|$|E

The Gila River is the second longest and drains a greater <b>area</b> <b>than</b> the Green, but has a significantly lower flow because of a more arid climate and larger diversions for irrigation and cities.

Additionally, among the curves of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle is the one with both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger <b>area</b> <b>than</b> the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant width.|$|E
