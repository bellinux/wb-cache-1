Yanchep National Park (Western Australia) was used as a case study, with the results from a recent visitor survey providing the data for satisfaction analyses.

([URL] befolkning/folkemengde-og-endringer/, 01. 01. 16) The area is located south of {{preserved}} forest areas surrounding the city, and the recreational area of of Sognsvann, northwest of Majorstua, between Blindern and Vinderen metro stations. The area has traditionally been cultivated as farmland, and was later made part {{of a network of}} green “Fingers” (green outdoor spaces) connecting the forest area surrounding the city with the fjord, in the city plan by Harald Hals dated 1950. Today the property is owned and managed by the government through Statsbygg, until management and ownership will be transferred to the municipality of Oslo, Oslo Kommune. Cooperation between the two institutions concerning proper management is in progress. Legally the area in question is preserved as a park <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>leisure</b> and outdoors activities, making it an object of interest in terms of preservation and development of green cityscapes for the future, with focus on socially including urban agriculture activities. The approach of this thesis is analysis of the area to determine potential for urban agriculture activities, followed by a presentation of different urban agriculture concepts, in order to show how future development of this particular area can be based on socially including projects concerned with cultivating edible plants. Today the area serve as a connection beween the reserved forest area surrounding the city of Oslo, and the city centre. It is situated between public functions such as kindergartens, a senior care centre and the facilities of Vinderen Psychiatric Departments (DPS). The area is also situated in the campus area of the University of Oslo (UiO). Another neighbour is Vinderen Elementary School. This makes school gardens, amongst other forms of urban agriculture a concept of consideration in this thesis. The target of the thesis is to explore how the property {{can be used as a}} recreational area serving the different needs of interested parties in the local neighbourhood. Parts of the area might be developed to form a therapeutical garden for the elderly and patients at the psychiatric department, in order to make room for further research on the inherit connection between green living spaces and overall health benefits. The thesis will also present a discussion of principles for planning related to the presented urban agriculture concepts, and make suggestions for proper use of the land in accordance to theese. The thesis consist of three parts: PART 1 : Introduction to Gaustadjordet, presenting thesis background, aim and issue, and physical and thematic appraisal. This is followed by analysis of the areas physical appearance, nescessary for determination of possibilities concerning urban agriculture. PART 2 : Present an understanding of official documents in relation to the thesis aim and issue.

Working with living materials entails a certain relinquishing ofcontrol, and despite the meticulous care bestowed on the gardens, there remains an inevitable uncertainty about outcome (Johnstone 2, 007, 9). A garden should present a correspondingpuzzle to be fathomed, some things veryr clear and others veiled (Jencks 2, 003, 2, 5). T he First Nations Garden in the Montreal Botanical Garden is a municipally-funded horti-cultural site situated within the tradition of botanical gardens as public <b>areas</b> <b>for</b> <b>leisure</b> and eco-tourism. It is a pastoral garden consisting of indigenous plant species from Quebec, set on an area consecrated by the botanical garden's founder in 1934, Frere Marie-Victorin, to the botany of Quebec. The garden was inaugurated in 2, 001 as part of Montreal city-wide commemorations of the 300 th anniversary of the 1701 Treaty, La Grande Paix (The Great Peace), between French colonizers and thirty-nine aboriginal nations (Havard 2, 001).
