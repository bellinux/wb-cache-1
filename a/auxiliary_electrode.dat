The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electrode</b> functions as a cathode whenever the working electrode is operating as an anode and vice versa.

50|$|A bulk {{electrolysis}} is best {{performed in}} a three part cell in which both the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electrode</b> and reference electrode have their own cell which connects to the cell containing the working electrode. This isolates the undesired redox events taking place at the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electrode.</b> During bulk electrolysis, the analyte undergoes a redox event at the working electrode. If the system was open, {{then it would be}} possible for the product of that reaction to diffuse back to the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electrode</b> and undergo the inverse redox reaction. In addition to maintaining the proper current at the working electrode, the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electrode</b> will experience extreme potentials often oxidizing or reducing the solvent or electrolyte to balance the current. In voltammetry experiments, the currents (amps) are so small and it is not a problem to decompose a small amount of solvent or electrolyte. In contrast, a bulk electrolysis involves currents greater by several orders of magnitude. At the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electrode,</b> this greater current would decompose a significant amount of the solution/electrolyte and probably boiling the solution in the process all in an effort to balance the current. To mitigate this challenge the auxiliary cell will often contain a stoichiometric or greater amount of sacrificial reductant (ferrocene) or sacrificial oxidant (ferrocenium) to balance the overall redox reaction.|$|E

50|$|The {{experimental}} {{setup for}} linear sweep voltammetry utilizes a potentiostat and a three-electrode setup {{to deliver a}} potential to a solution and monitor its change in current. The three-electrode setup consists of a working electrode, an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electrode,</b> and a reference electrode. The potentiostat delivers the potentials through the three-electrode setup. A potential, E, is delivered through the working electrode. The slope of the potential vs. time graph is called the scan rate and can range from mV/s to 1,000,000 V/s.The working electrode {{is one of the}} electrodes at which the oxidation/reduction reactions occur—the processes that occur at this electrode are the ones being monitored. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electrode</b> (or counter electrode) is the one at which a process opposite from the one taking place at the working electrode occurs. The processes at this electrode are not monitored. The equation below gives an example of a reduction occurring at the surface of the working electrode. Es is the reduction potential of A (if the electrolyte and the electrode are in their standard conditions, then this potential is a standard reduction potential). As E approaches Es the current on the surface increases and when E=Es then the concentration of A = A− at the surface. As the molecules {{on the surface of the}} working electrode are oxidized/reduced they move away from the surface and new molecules come into contact with the surface of the working electrode. The flow of electrons into or out of the electrode causes the current. The current is a direct measure of the rate at which electrons are being exchanged through the electrode-electrolyte interface. When this rate becomes higher than the rate at which the oxidizing or reducing species can diffuse from the bulk of the electrolyte to the surface of the electrode, the current reaches a plateau or exhibits a peak.|$|E
