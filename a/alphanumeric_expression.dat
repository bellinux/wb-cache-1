More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>expression</b> embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of microattribution.|$|E

In 1965, Derek J. de Solla Price described the inherent linking characteristic of the SCI in his seminal paper titled [...] "Networks of Scientific Papers". The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online. In 1973, Henry Small published his work on co-citation analysis which became a self-organizing classification system that led to document clustering experiments and eventually what is called [...] "Research Reviews".|$|E
