5000|$|The name <b>ajvar</b> {{comes from}} the Turkish word havyar, which means [...] "salted roe, caviar" [...] and shares an {{etymology}} with [...] "caviar".

Domestic <b>ajvar,</b> meaning [...] "caviar", used to be a very popular dish in Belgrade homes and restaurants. However, the domestic production of caviar was not steady starting in the 1890s because of labor disputes, and eventually a special pepper salad was offered as a substitute in Belgrade restaurants under the name [...] "red ajvar" [...] (crveni <b>ajvar)</b> or [...] "Serbian ajvar" [...] (srpski <b>ajvar).</b>|$|E

5000|$|Homemade <b>ajvar</b> is made {{of roasted}} peppers, while some {{industrial}} producers use cooked peppers, {{which leads to a}} lower quality. The preparation of <b>ajvar</b> is somewhat difficult, as it involves a great amount of manual labour, especially related to peeling the roasted peppers. Traditionally, it is prepared in mid-autumn, when bell peppers are most abundant, and is conserved in glass jars for consumption throughout the year—though in most households stocks do not last until the spring, when fresh salads start to emerge anyway, so it is usually enjoyed as a winter food. Often, the whole family or neighbours gather to bake the bell peppers, peel them, and cook them. The principal cultivar of pepper used is called roga (i.e. [...] "horned"). Roga is large, red, horn-shaped, with thick flesh and relatively easy to peel. It typically ripens in late September.|$|E

5000|$|The Rahovec municipality, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Development (MAFRD), USAID, {{and other}} sponsors, were all {{supporters}} of a workshop for farmers {{and the growing}} of their crops. Around €80,000 were invested in this workshop and 30 women of Krusha who are widows are hired full-time {{to work with the}} crops. The workshop's opening was on May 30, 2011 in Krusha e Madhe with various politicians and donors present. This investment in the village’s agriculture is considered {{to be one of the}} best initiatives by the MAFRD to help female farmers who suffered during the war provide a more secure future for their families. In this workshop, the village residents learn to take care of crops, use them to create final products, and then sell them in the markets. Before this project, the women of Krusha e Madhe worked by hand, but now, with donations from different organizations and ministries, they can work faster and more efficiently with the use of different machines. [...] These investments are a huge success as Krusha e Madhe is a leader in the selling of vegetables like pickles, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes etc. It is also known for the production of <b>ajvar,</b> a widely popular type of relish in Kosovo.

50|$|Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, {{but usually}} in {{moderate}} quantities.

5000|$|Pljeskavica (пљескавица, [...] ), {{a grilled}} dish of spiced meat patty mixture of pork, beef and lamb, is a {{national}} dish of Serbia, also popular in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. It is a main course served with onions, kajmak (milk cream), <b>ajvar</b> (relish), and urnebes (spicy cheese salad), either on plate with side dishes, or with lepinja (flatbread, {{as a type of}} hamburger).

50|$|In {{order to}} produce <b>ajvar,</b> bell peppers and {{aubergines}} (eggplants) are roasted whole on a plate on an open fire, a plate of wood in a stove, or in an oven. The baked peppers must briefly rest in a closed dish, {{to allow them to}} cool and to allow the flesh to separate from the skin. Next, the skin is carefully peeled off and the seeds are removed. The peppers are then ground in a mill or chopped into tiny pieces (this variant {{is often referred to as}} Pindjur). Finally, the resulting mush is stewed for a couple of hours in large pots. Sunflower oil and garlic are added at this stage in order to condense and reduce the water, as well as to enhance later conservation. Salt (and sometimes also vinegar) is added at the end and the hot mush is poured directly into glass jars, which are sealed immediately.|$|E
50|$|Bosnian cuisine {{reflects}} {{a balance of}} Western and Eastern influences. Due to almost 500 years of Ottoman rule, Bosnian food {{is closely related to}} Turkish, Greek, and other former Ottoman and Mediterranean cuisines. However, years of Austrian rule can be detected in the many influences from Central Europe. Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, but usually in very small quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are completely natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, garlic, peppers, cucumbers, carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, spinach, courgettes, dried beans, fresh beans, plums, milk, and cream called pavlaka. Typical meat dishes include primarily chicken, beef and mutton. Some local specialties are ćevapi, burek, dolma, sarma, pilaf, goulash, <b>ajvar</b> and an extensive range of Eastern sweets. The best local wine comes from the southern region of the country, Herzegovina, where the climate is particularly suitable for growing grapes. Plum or apple rakia is distilled in the northern region of Bosnia.|$|E
50|$|Eggplant {{is often}} stewed, {{as in the}} French ratatouille. Eggplant is also often deep fried as in the Italian parmigiana di melanzane, the Turkish karnıyarık, or Turkish and Greek musakka/moussaka, and Middle Eastern and South Asian dishes. Eggplants can also be {{battered}} before deep-frying and served with a sauce made of tahini and tamarind. In Iranian cuisine, it is blended with whey as kashk e bademjan, tomatoes as mirza ghassemi, or made into stew as khoresh-e-bademjan. It can be sliced and deep-fried, then served with plain yogurt (optionally topped with a tomato and garlic sauce), {{such as in the}} Turkish dish patlıcan kızartması (meaning fried aubergines), or without yogurt, as in patlıcan şakşuka. Perhaps the best-known Turkish eggplant dishes are imam bayıldı (vegetarian) and karnıyarık (with minced meat).It may also be roasted in its skin until charred, so the pulp can be removed and blended with other ingredients, such as lemon, tahini, and garlic, as in the Arab baba ghanoush and the similar Greek melitzanosalata.

5000|$|In the Balkans, meze is {{very similar}} to Mediterranean antipasti in the sense that cured cold-cuts, cheese and salads are {{dominant}} ingredients and that it typically doesn't include cooked meals. In Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro it includes hard or creamy cheeses, kajmak (clotted cream) or smetana cream, salami, ham and other forms of [...] "suho/suvo meso" [...] (cured pork or beef), kulen (paprika flavoured, cured sausage), cured bacon, <b>ajvar,</b> and various pastry; In Bosnia and Herzegovina, depending on religious food restrictions one obeys, meze excludes pork products and replaces them with sudžuk (dry, spicy sausage) and pastrami-like cured beef. In southern Croatia, Herzegovina and Montenegro more mediterranean forms of cured meat like pršut and panceta and regional products like olives are common. Albanian-style meze platters typically include prosciutto ham, salami and brined cheese, accompanied with roasted bell peppers (capsicum) or green olives marinated in olive oil with garlic. In Bulgaria, popular mezes are lukanka (a spicy sausage), soujouk (a dry and spicy sausage), sirene (a white brine cheese), and Shopska salad made with tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, roasted peppers and sirene. In Romania, mezelic means quick appetizer and includes Zacuscă, cheeses and salamis, often accompanied by Țuică.|$|E
5000|$|The {{agricultural}} areas of Krusha e Madhe are rich {{with an overall}} of 630 hectares of fertile land. The fertile lands of Krusha e Madhe impact the economy. More than 16 hectares of the land are used for planting different vegetables, including 6 hectares of peppers, 2 hectares of potatoes, 2 hectares of onions and cucumbers, and other vegetables. An agricultural cooperative is currently open, which is mostly renowned for processed vegetables.
