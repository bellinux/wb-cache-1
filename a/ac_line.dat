5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming <b>AC</b> <b>line,</b> a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is {{assessing}} the economic feasibility of four-phase AC overhead connections, i. e. the real chance that such lines have of being competitive with commonly-used solutions for power transmission. For this reason, the paper illustrates an economical comparison among innovative 325 kV four-phase <b>ac</b> <b>lines,</b> traditional 400 kV three-phase <b>ac</b> <b>lines</b> and increasingly-popular 500 kV HVDC lines. These systems are considered firstly in single-circuit and secondly in double-circuit overhead arrangement. The comparison is based on the main cost items that characterize these lines, namely investment costs, energy losses costs and reliability-related costs. The uncertainty of the relevant parameters, particularly significant as far as innovative four-phase <b>ac</b> <b>lines</b> are concerned, is also discussed...|$|R
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E
5|$|Many fixed-speed {{motor load}} {{applications}} that are supplied direct from <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> power can save energy {{when they are}} operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and cube, respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with affinity laws that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the <b>AC</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to develop a {{technical}} comparison among different possible solutions for overhead transmission lines. These include both traditional and innovative solutions: the former are usual three-phase <b>AC</b> <b>lines</b> and HVDC lines, the latter are four-phase <b>AC</b> <b>lines</b> and combined AC-DC lines. A technical-economical comparison between aerial standard three-phase AC and innovative four-phase <b>AC</b> <b>lines</b> has been already developed in, where the possible scope of convenience of the four-phase solution has been individuated.

5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

25|$|In 1876, Russian {{engineer}} Pavel Yablochkov {{invented a}} lighting system where sets of induction coils were installed along a high voltage <b>AC</b> <b>line.</b> Instead of changing voltage, the primary windings transferred {{power to the}} secondary windings which were connected to one or several 'electric candles' (arc lamps) of his own design, used to keep the failure of one lamp from disabling the entire circuit. In 1878, the Ganz factory, Budapest, Hungary, began manufacturing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their AC systems used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.|$|E

30|$|DGs {{and energy}} storage systems (ESSs) have been {{investigated}} to achieve real-time voltage regulation in distribution networks [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Moreover, {{in order to increase}} transfer capacities and DG accommodations, some <b>AC</b> <b>lines</b> can be converted into DC ones and forms a hybrid AC/DC distribution network by connecting existing <b>AC</b> <b>lines</b> through voltage source converters (VSCs) [13]. Then, real time regulations could be improved through utilizing flexible and fast control ability of VSCs. Ideally, controllable devices including ESSs, DGs, and the VSCs connecting <b>AC</b> and DC <b>lines</b> should be considered together to generate optimal real-time regulation strategies for the hybrid AC/DC distribution networks.|$|R
25|$|These first {{loudspeakers}} used electromagnets, because large, powerful {{permanent magnets}} were generally not available {{at a reasonable}} price. The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a choke coil, filtering the power supply of the amplifier that the loudspeaker was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated {{by the action of}} passing through the choke coil. However, <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 Jensen introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight Alnico magnets after World War II.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, {{electric}} traction accounted for 90% {{of the passenger}} kilometers, 93% of the tonne kilometers and 74% of the energy consumption of all trains running in Norway, with the rest being accounted for by diesel traction.

The first electric industrial railway in Norway opened in 1892 at Skotfos Bruk near Skien. Two years later, parts of the Oslo Tramway were electrified. The first alternating current (<b>AC)</b> <b>line</b> became operational in 1892, while the first line to use a single-phase, single overhead wire power supply opened in Germany in 1903. In 1912, all German railway agreed to use the [...] standard, which was later adopted first by Sweden and then by NSB.

Tesla used this type on his big coils, and they are used today on large entertainment coils. The rapid separation speed of the electrodes quenches the spark quickly, allowing [...] "first notch" [...] quenching, making possible higher voltages. The wheel is usually driven by a synchronous motor, so the sparks are synchronized with the <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> frequency, the spark occurring {{at the same point}} on the AC waveform on each cycle, so the primary pulses are repeatable.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, {{electrification}} projects initially {{focused on}} mountainous regions for several reasons: coal supplies were difficult, hydroelectric power was readily available, and electric locomotives gave more traction on steeper lines. This was particularly applicable in Switzerland, where close to 100% of lines are electrified. An {{important contribution to}} the wider adoption of AC traction came from SNCF of France after World War II. The company had assessed the industrial-frequency <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> routed through the steep Höllental Valley, Germany, which was under French administration following the war. After trials, the company decided that the performance of AC locomotives was sufficiently developed to allow all its future installations, regardless of terrain, to be of this standard, with its associated cheaper and more efficient infrastructure. The SNCF decision, ignoring as it did the [...] of high-voltage DC already installed on French routes, was influential in the standard selected for other countries in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Switches {{in any of}} {{the three}} legs of the {{inverter}} cannot be switched off simultaneously due to this resulting in the voltages being dependent on the respective line current's polarity. States 7 and 8 produce zero <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> voltages, which result in <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> currents freewheeling through either the upper or the lower components. However, the line voltages for states 1 through 6 produce an <b>AC</b> <b>line</b> voltage consisting of the discrete values of Vi, 0 or -Vi.|$|E
5000|$|Once a DC {{operating}} point {{is defined by}} the DC load <b>line,</b> an <b>AC</b> load <b>line</b> can be drawn through the Q point. The <b>AC</b> load <b>line</b> is a straight line with a slope equal to the AC impedance facing the nonlinear device, which is in general different from the DC resistance. The ratio of AC voltage to current in the device is defined by this line. Because the impedance of the reactive components will vary with frequency, the slope of the <b>AC</b> load <b>line</b> depends on the frequency of the applied signal. So there are many <b>AC</b> load <b>lines,</b> that vary from the DC load line (at low frequency) to a limiting <b>AC</b> load <b>line,</b> all having a common intersection at the DC {{operating point}}.
