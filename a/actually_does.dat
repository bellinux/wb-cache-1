5|$|Apollo tells Veronica that he <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> {{want the}} {{paternity}} test. Dick’s father, {{who was involved}} in a corporate crime, appears and berates him for going on the surfing trip in the summer. Apollo takes the paternity test, but the father doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that he actually was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his father was genuinely loving. The only reason the father did not show up to the paternity test was that he was detained for having the wrong license plates. Apollo and the father meet at the Sheriff’s office, where they have an emotional reunion. Dick angrily confronts his father, but the next time he is seen, he calls off his trip with Logan. Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Each {{county is}} run by a commissioners' court, {{consisting}} of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts drawn based on population) and a county judge elected from all the voters of the county. In smaller counties, the county judge <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> perform judicial duties, but in larger counties, the judge's role is limited to serving on the commissioners' court. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by the voters, but the commissioners' court determines their office budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan; the one exception is the board of trustees of the Dallas County department of education (the Harris County trustees were elected on a nonpartisan basis until 1984).|$|E
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} some conservative readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> much to challenge that image.|$|E

25|$|However, {{things take}} a strange turn when Sanian <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> become the host for the Saint's spirit, after Sabbat's true {{incarnation}} perishes in the assault.

With the Imperial fleet all but destroyed and surrounded by an enemy who has multiple advantages over them, the Ghosts face one of their most daunting challenges yet.|$|E
25|$|Their {{first attempt}} ends up recreating (after a liberal {{interpretation}} of the results) the Mary Magdalene conspiracy theory central to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Casaubon jokingly suggests that to create something truly new Belbo must look for occult connections in non-obvious contexts, such as by linking the Kabbalah to a car's spark plugs. (Belbo <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> this, and after some research concludes that the powertrain {{is a metaphor for}} the Tree of life.) Pleased with the results of the random text program, the three continue resorting to Abulafia whenever they reach a dead-end with their game.|$|E
25|$|Both when {{encrypting}} {{messages and}} when verifying signatures, {{it is critical}} that the public key used to send messages to someone or some entity <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> 'belong' to the intended recipient. Simply downloading a public key from somewhere is not an overwhelming assurance of that association; deliberate (or accidental) impersonation is possible. From its first version, PGP has always included provisions for distributing user's public keys in an 'identity certificate', which is also constructed cryptographically so that any tampering (or accidental garble) is readily detectable. However, merely making a certificate which is impossible to modify without being detected is insufficient; this can prevent corruption only after the certificate has been created, not before. Users must also ensure by some means that the public key in a certificate <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> belong to the person or entity claiming it. From its first release, PGP products have included an internal certificate 'vetting scheme' to assist with this, a trust model which has been called a web of trust. A given public key (or more specifically, information binding a user name to a key) may be digitally signed by a third party user to attest to the association between someone (actually a user name) and the key. There are several levels of confidence which can be included in such signatures. Although many programs read and write this information, few (if any) include this level of certification when calculating whether to trust a key.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually think much of the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E

25|$|Jain texts tell a very {{different}} version of the Rama legend than the Hindu texts such as by Valmiki. According to the Jain version, Lakshmana (Vasudeva) {{is the one who}} kills Ravana (Prativasudeva). Rama, after all his participation in the rescue of Sita and preparation for war, he <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> not kill, thus remains a non-violent person. The Rama of Jainism has numerous wives as does Lakshmana, unlike the virtue of monogamy given to Rama in the Hindu texts. Towards the end of his life, Rama becomes a Jaina monk then successfully attains siddha followed by moksha. His first wife Sita becomes a Jaina nun {{at the end of the}} story. In the Jain version, Lakshmana and Ravana both go to the hell of Jain cosmology, because Ravana killed many, while Lakshmana killed Ravana to stop Ravana's violence.|$|E
25|$|The {{root cause}} of FAP is {{understood}} to be a genetic mutation—a flaw in the body's tumour suppressor genes that prevent development of tumours. The flaw allows numerous cells of the intestinal wall to develop into potentially cancerous polyps when they would usually {{reach the end of}} their life; inevitably one or more will eventually progress and give rise to cancer (7% risk by age 21, rising to 87% by age 45 and 93% by age 50). The flawed genes do not trigger cancer, but rather, they reduce the body's ability to protect against the risk of aged cells becoming cancerous. Even with the flawed gene, it may still take time before a cell <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> develop that is cancerous as a result, and the gene may in some cases still partially operate to control tumours, therefore cancer from FAP takes many years to develop and is almost always an adult-onset disease.|$|E
25|$|One day, {{a police}} {{inspector}} (Chevvalai Rasu) who had insulted the Zamindar is tracked down and punished by Kumbudren Samy and Walter. While Walter takes the police truck and dumps {{it in the}} forest, Kumbudren Samy is caught by the police inspector. He acts like he swallowed a blade so he can see Thenmozhi once before going to jail. He is {{rushed to the hospital}} sees her and fools the entire police force even though Baby is quite suspicious. Kumbudren Samy tries to bribe the doctor to lie but she tells the police constable who only pleads with the him but later gives up and releases him. Actor Suriya attends a school function in the town to promote educational awareness through his Agaram Foundation. Just as he is about to leave the Zamindar requests him to stay and witness Walter's acting skills, who shows off his depictions of the nine emotions (Navarasas) and impresses everyone, including Kumbedren Samy. The drunk Kumbredren Samy then reveals to the drunk Zamindar that he <b>actually</b> <b>does</b> love his brother and that all the anger and hate it is just an act.|$|E
