5|$|In the 19th century, a politico-economic {{discourse}} emerged. It concerned {{itself with}} distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying {{the place of}} Greek slavery. The influence of Marx is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production. The Positivists represented by the historian Eduard Meyer (Slavery in Antiquity, 1898) were soon to oppose the Marxist theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomenon, and not economic.|$|E

25|$|All {{cells have}} {{proteins}} {{attached to their}} membranes, often serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> communication or signaling between the cell and the surrounding environment. These signaling proteins are physically attached to the cell membrane in various ways, commonly anchored by glycolipids such as glycosyl phosphatidylinositols (GPI). PNH {{occurs as a result}} of a defect in the assembling of these glycolipid-protein structures on the surface of blood cells.|$|E

25|$|The issues {{concerning}} sexual objectification became first problemized during the 1970s by feminist groups. Since then, {{it has been}} argued that the phenomenon of female sexual objectification has increased drastically since its problematization in all levels of life, and has resulted in negative consequences for women, especially in the political sphere. However, a rising form of new third-waver feminist groups have also taken the increased objectification of women as an opportunity to use the female body <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> power.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> inquiry Rabinow {{distinguishes the}} Anthropology of the Contemporary from Michel Foucault’s History of the Present. As Rabinow {{describes}} it, the History of the Present consists in formulating {{an understanding of}} the past as “a means of showing the contingency of the present and thereby contribute to making a more open future.” The current challenge is to be specific about which inquiries and what objects are best engaged with an approach that is drawn from a History of the Present orientation.|$|E
25|$|A {{defining}} {{feature of}} the venues Rabinow has called for and worked on is collaboration. Understood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> work, Rabinow defines collaboration in distinction to cooperation. A cooperative mode of work consists in “demarcated tasking on distinct problems and objects, with occasional if regular exchange.” Cooperation does not entail either a common definition of problems or shared techniques of remediation. A collaborative mode of work, by contrast, proceeds from an interdependent division of labor on shared problems. It entails a common definition of problems (or acceptance of a problem-space).|$|E

Endocrine disrupting chemicals are known to accumulate in body tissue and are highly persistent in the environment. Many toxicants are known EDCs including pesticides, phthalates, phytoestrogens, some industrial/commercial products, and pharmaceuticals. These chemicals are known to cause endocrine disruption via a few different mechanisms. While the mechanism associated with the thyroid hormone receptor is not well understood, two more established mechanisms involve the inhibition of the androgen receptor and activation of the estrogen receptor.|$|E

Programming languages {{can be used to}} create programs that specify the behavior of a machine, to express algorithms precisely, or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> human communication. The first {{programming language}}s predate the modern computer. In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda calculus, also written as λ-calculus, is a formal system designed to investigate function definition, function application and recursion. It was invented by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics, but has now emerged as a useful tool in the investigation of problems in computability, recursion theory, and as a fundamental basis and a modern paradigm to computer programming and software languages.|$|E

25|$|A {{new plan}} emerged in 1852 and was {{presented}} before Parliament the following year. The Sleaford, Boston and Midlands Counties Railway would pass through Boston, Sleaford and Grantham. The proposals met with considerable support from businessmen in Sleaford, including {{a number of}} Navigation officials; they envisaged it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> transporting coal and stone. The Bill passed in August 1853. Constructed by Smith, Knight & Co. {{under the supervision of}} the engineers W. H. Brydone and Edward Harrison, the line between Barkston, near Grantham, and Sleaford opened on 15 June 1857. An elaborate set of celebrations were organised for the opening day of the new Sleaford railway station, which saw all of the town's businesses close to allow their employees chance take part in the festivities; over 700 men from the area were invited to a free lunch on the cricket fields.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} define modernism <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> thinking—one or more philosophically defined characteristics, like self-consciousness or self-reference, {{that run}} across all the novelties {{in the arts}} and the disciplines. More common, especially in the West, are those who see it as a socially progressive trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology. From this perspective, modernism encouraged the re-examination of every aspect of existence, from commerce to philosophy, with the goal of finding that which was 'holding back' progress, and replacing it with new ways of reaching the same end. Others focus on modernism as an aesthetic introspection. This facilitates consideration of specific reactions to the use of technology in the First World War, and anti-technological and nihilistic aspects of the works of diverse thinkers and artists spanning the period from Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) to Samuel Beckett (1906–1989).|$|E
25|$|Castlefield {{is an area}} in {{the extreme}} {{southwest}} between Deansgate and the River Irwell with the sites of the Roman fort and Liverpool Road Railway Station. It retains much of its industrial character {{and is the only}} Urban Heritage Park in the United Kingdom. and is marked by its mercantile 19th warehouses and adjoining wharfs which were used to transport goods from Manchester during the Manchester's industrial era. Today, Castlefield is quiet and noted for its waterside bars and pubs. Notable structures include Manchester Liverpool Road station which was the first inter-city railway station on the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830. Today the station frontage remains and is Grade I listed, as is the adjoining 1830s warehouse. The structure now forms part of the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI). For many years Castlefield was on a tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Status for its industrial past – particularly in regards {{to the development of the}} canal <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> transportation and the railway.|$|E

50|$|The Charter of Seville was {{launched}} during Velo-city 2011 {{in preparation for}} the International Transport Forum held in Leipzig, Germany in May 2011. The document aimed at the national and transnational level underlining the benefits <b>of</b> cycling <b>as</b> <b>a</b> daily <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> transport, citing improved health, reduced traffic congestion, significantly cheaper infrastructure, and lowered transport emissions among many other advantages. Rather than setting targets, it demanded an overarching and broad political commitment from recognizing the bicycle <b>as</b> <b>a</b> viable <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> transport. The charter specifically called upon all Ministers of Transport convening at the ITF “to promote cycling at international level and to invest substantially in cycling in their own countries during the years to come”.|$|R

The Oregon–California routes were highly organized with planned rendezvous locations and essential supplies. The settlers in the United States used these wagon trains – sometimes made up of 100 of more Conestoga wagons – for westward emigration during the 18th and the 19th centuries. Among the challenges faced by the wagon route operators were crossing rivers, mountains and hostile Native Americans. Preparations were also made according to the weather and protection of trade and travelers was ensured by a few guards on horseback.|$|E
