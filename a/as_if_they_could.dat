500|$|Frank Kameny soon {{realized}} the pivotal change {{brought by the}} Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, {{he was used to}} persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> work for the U.S. government. Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, [...] "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{worked with}} {{multiple}} guest vocalists and musicians, {{many of which}} were not included on the album's final cut. In working with vocalists, the Avalanches wanted to create vocals that meshed seamlessly with the music <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be samples. Jonathan Donahue of Mercury Rev provided vocals and musical saw instrumentation on multiple tracks. In addition, Kevin Parker of Tame Impala provided additional drumming on [...] "Going Home" [...] and violinist Warren Ellis was featured on [...] "Stepkids". Jean-Michel Bernard also provided some orchestration to a handful of tracks. Both Danny Brown's and Biz Markie's vocals on [...] "Frankie Sinatra" [...] and [...] "The Noisey Eater" [...] respectively were done remotely. For Brown's vocals on [...] "The Wozard of Iz", he visited Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne and had an all-night recording session with the group. Chater was a fan of MF DOOM, specifically the album Madvillainy (2004) he made with Madlib. He sent him a track and received a reply 18 months later from DOOM stating he loved the track and wanted to provide vocals. The group was thrilled to work with Camp Lo on the track [...] "Because I'm Me". The Avalanches would always play Camp Lo's first record, Uptown Saturday Night (1997), at shows and even sampled it on Since I Left You. Other guest vocalists on Wildflower include Father John Misty, Toro Y Moi, Jennifer Herrema, Rye Rye, Jonti, David Berman, and A.Dd+.|$|E
60|$|Granny Fox didn't {{wait for}} any more. She started off {{as fast as}} she could go, with Reddy Fox after her, and every few steps they rubbed their ears and shook their heads <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> thought <b>they</b> <b>could</b> shake out the pain.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's what I say,' {{observed}} Pleasant. 'Where's {{the reason}} for it? Bless the sailors, it ain't <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> ever <b>could</b> keep what <b>they</b> have, without it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The sun {{was just}} dipping behind the tall cliffs, and his parting rays were kissing {{the top of}} Minnie's head <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{positively}} <b>could</b> not help it, and had recklessly made up their mind to do it, come what might! ...|$|R
2500|$|By 1974, the Phillies {{began their}} quest for a {{championship}} that would be theirs 6 years later. That year second baseman Dave Cash coined the phrase [...] "Yes We Can" [...] for the Phils. Indeed, for a while, it looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> They led the division for 51 days; however, in August and September, the Phillies went 25–32 and it was [...] "No They Couldn't".|$|E
2500|$|Rather than sculpture, she {{preferred}} {{the use of}} the word structure to refer to her work. She applied the term to her paintings and prints as well. A critic compared Falkenstein's work of the 1950s to [...] "a Jackson Pollock in three dimensions". Some of her work has a structure which appears as if it could grow, infinitely expanding, similar to the way Pollock's paintings may appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> continue beyond the canvas.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his piece}} [...] "A Ladies' Man and Shameless", Barlow professes {{his love of}} many women at the same time, and {{summarizes}} the relationships in his personal life, [...] "I doubt I’ll ever be monogamous again... I want to know as many more women as time and their indulgence will permit me... There are probably twenty-five or thirty women—I certainly don’t count them—for whom I feel an abiding and deep emotional attachment. They’re {{scattered all over the}} planet. They range in age from less than half to almost twice my own. Most of these relationships are not actively sexual. Some were at one time. More never will be. But most of them feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> become so. I love the feel of that tension, the delicious gravity of possibilities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God help her, then," [...] {{said his}} lordship gloomily. [...] "Her captain must be mad. What can he {{hope to do}} against two such heavy hulks <b>as</b> these? <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> so easily blow the Royal Mary out of the water, what will they do to this vessel? Look at that devil Don Miguel. He's utterly disgusting in his glee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{going to}} have a skirmish," [...] Peter said. [...] "I know these Highlanders. Instead of jest firing a bit and then falling back, they'll be {{sticking}} here and fighting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> thought <b>they</b> <b>could</b> lick the hull army of the Yankees." ...|$|R
30|$|Tasks {{were defined}} <b>as</b> routine <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be {{performed}} {{more or less}} easily by computers or new types of (computerized) production technologies, and were considered nonroutine otherwise. Since routine tasks are disproportionally located {{in the middle of}} the occupational hierarchy, the TBA argued 4 that this mechanism should result in reduced employment and lower wages for this middle group, whereas employment prospects and wages should improve (or remain stable, at least) in the higher and the lower qualified groups.|$|R

2500|$|Young Apprentice {{received}} a generally positive response from critics. Writing for The Guardian, Tim Lusher was complimentary of the programme's tone {{by claiming that}} [...] "for once, even the losers look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be winners one day" [...] and Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that from the opening minutes of the first episode {{it was clear that}} [...] "this spinoff series isn't going to be any softer or less entertaining than the original". The Daily Telegraphs Benji Wilson also praised the series and argued that it [...] "had all of the staggering self-regard and dim-witted hilarity we have come to expect from the contestants on the grown-up Apprentice". The online version of Heat magazine, heatworld.com, praised the series and said that it was [...] "amazing...might just be the best show we’ve seen all year", while The Guardians Johnny Dee claimed that the programme was of better quality than its adult counterpart and proved that reality television [...] "doesn't have to be nasty to be entertaining".|$|E
60|$|There is more {{sympathy with}} {{humanity}} in Francia's angels: they look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> weep {{as well as}} love and sing.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't know," [...] she said, [...] "what {{a strong}} feeling there is. Mind, {{it has to go}} to numbers of parsonages, Mr. Vigil. Our {{principle}} has always been to be very careful. And you have been plainer than usual in stating the case. It's not <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> really <b>could</b> put themselves in her position; that's impossible. Not one woman in a hundred could, especially among those who live in the country and have never seen life. I'm a squire's daughter myself." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the best}} ways of management, the {{directors}} saw this <b>as</b> an opportunity: <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> connect to the E&GR with its more efficient connections to Edinburgh and elsewhere, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> enhance the traffic they carried. At Causewayend they were close to the E&GR and a connecting line there was the solution.|$|R
60|$|All {{passed to}} the {{locality}} indicated, and each youth looked at the hoofmarks with interest. They were made {{by a number of}} horses, probably six or eight, and though the marks were washed a little, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> by rain, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> still be plainly seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, do {{you think}} so?" [...] softly murmured Mrs. Pasmer. [...] "It seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have kept it up all night if they liked." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{surprised}} {{them out}} of their self possession at last. Both started, and looked at him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not believe the evidence of their ears.|$|E
6000|$|... “It did duty {{very well}} for a party,” said Mrs. Westgate. “All the women were décolletées, {{and many of the}} figures looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> almost speak.” ...|$|E
50|$|Some online listing systems {{internally}} sort POA {{items as}} being either very cheap or very expensive meaning they will {{appear at the}} start of a price-sorted list. This might lead users of such listing systems to intentionally enter their item <b>as</b> POA (even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> give a price) in order to stand out.|$|R
60|$|And {{the group}} surged {{to and fro}} outside, and talked, and questioned, and rejoiced; and smart gents forgot their vulgar pleasures, and looked for a moment <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> too <b>could</b> have fought--had fought--at Alma; and sinful girls forgot their shame, and looked more {{beautiful}} than they had done for many a day, as, beneath the flaring gas-light, their faces glowed for a while with noble enthusiasm, and woman's sacred pity, while they questioned Tom, taking him for an officer, {{as to whether he}} thought there were many killed.|$|R
60|$|Now Black Pussy {{hates to}} be the center of so much attention. She knew that, now she had been discovered, there wasn't a chance in the world for her to catch one of those Old Orchard folks. So, with tail still {{twitching}} angrily, she turned and, with such dignity as she could, left the Old Orchard. Clear to the edge of it the birds followed, shrieking, screaming, calling her bad names, and threatening to do all sorts of dreadful things to her, quite <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> really <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Slugger and Nappy had come up, and {{they stared at}} Jack and his cousins <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not believe the evidences of their senses.|$|E
6000|$|... 'On {{the shore}} we saw {{an old man}} who was busily engaged in {{drowning}} some little black pigs, talking to them all the while, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> understand him.|$|E
60|$|The girls looked serious, but {{a little}} sly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> smile if the boys looked their way or {{if one of the}} old women should cough her store teeth out.|$|E
50|$|Historical {{documents}} do record {{numerous examples}} of same-sex couples living in relationships that functioned <b>as</b> marriages even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be legally sanctified as such. Historian Rachel Hope Cleves documents one such relationship, that of 19th-century Vermont residents Charity Bryant and Sylvia Drake, in her 2014 book Charity and Sylvia: A Same-Sex Marriage in Early America.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, Barbara's {{attention}} {{began to}} be occupied at home with Yewsholt Lodge, the house that her kind-hearted father was preparing for her residence when her husband returned. It was a small place on the plan of a large one--a cottage built {{in the form of}} a mansion, having a central hall with a wooden gallery running round it, and rooms no bigger than closets to follow this introduction. It stood on a slope so solitary, and surrounded by trees so dense, that the birds who inhabited the boughs sang at strange hours, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> hardly <b>could</b> distinguish night from day.|$|R
50|$|Before {{checking}} into the Pit Stop, teams had {{to identify what}} the Pit Stop greeter was dressed as, who was hidden from view. They had 2 minutes to ask 21 yes or no questions to try to identify which well-known French icon he was dressed <b>as</b> (a Baguette). <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not guess correctly, they would serve a 15-minute penalty before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> try again.|$|R
6000|$|... "It did duty {{very well}} for a party," [...] said Mrs. Westgate. [...] "All the women were decolletes, {{and many of the}} figures looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> speak if they tried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My crew is complete," [...] {{said the}} captain, doubtfully, [...] "except, indeed, that my chief {{engineer}} is just dead, {{but none of}} your men look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> fill his shoes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Headache?" [...] asked Pinney, {{with the}} jocose sympathy men show one another's sufferings, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be joked away. [...] "Better take {{something}} substantial. Nothing like ham and eggs for a headache." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{may be on}} the level," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{not saying}} {{anything}} against any one. But I've seen a lot of crooks in my time, and it's not the ones with the low brows and the cauliflower ears that you want to watch for. It's the innocent Willies who look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do was to lead the cotillon and wear bangles on their ankles. I've {{had a lot to do}} with them, and it's up to a man that don't want to be stung not to go by what a fellow looks like." ...|$|R
50|$|The French government/colonisers or protectors opened French {{public schools}} (from pre-kindergarten through the Baccalaureat II) staffed by all native French {{speakers}} {{to take care}} of their compatriots/expatriates' children's education. Vietnamese children were admitted <b>as</b> well <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> pass the entrance examination tailored to their age and grade level. The Vietnamese elite class spoke French, and those with French Baccalaureat diplomas could attend French universities in France and in its colonies. After France's withdrawal from Indochina in 1954, Tây Bồi ceased to be used as a common language as standard French was used and is believed to have become extinct around the 1980s. Today standard French continues to be taught at schools and universities in Vietnam as a second language.|$|R
5000|$|With the 1911 Act {{the author}} of a {{contribution}} would regain copyright after 25 years, but this would be concurrent with the publisher's right in the collective work. It was argued that reversion of full rights to the author would have been [...] "a great hardship to proprietors of collective works, particularly of those permanent in nature, such <b>as</b> ecyclopaedias, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have acquired from the author an unfettered right to produce the work at any future time as part of the collective work."The author could, however, restrain the publisher from transferring or licensing their work to others.Under the Copyright Act 1956 employees retained copyright in their work unless there was an agreement to the contrary.The CDPA removed the waiver on employee rights.|$|R
