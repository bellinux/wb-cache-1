One {{of the most}} successful hard candies is the penny <b>apple</b> <b>sucker.</b> The sticks are placed in by hand and the pop is sold unwrapped. Chocolate {{equipment is}} also purchased, which eliminates the need to hand dip chocolate items. A variety of 60 products are being made and shipped from Spangler Candy Company.|$|E
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1920 the writer was engaged in {{studying}} the bionomics of the <b>Apple</b> <b>Sucker,</b> Psyllia Mali, in Nova Scotia, and, having occasion to make numerous dissections, {{he was struck by}} the lack of literature dealing with the anatomy of any members of this family, particularly with regard to the internal organs. Investigation showed many interesting and unusual features in the morphology of the insect and so the entire anatomy was chosen as the subject for this thesis. The field is a wide one, and it has not been found possible to follow out all points in full detail in the time available, with only preserved material with which to work. If {{there appears to be a}} hesitancy and uncertainty in describing certain structures, it must be borne in mind that the body of this insect is only 2. 5 m. m. long, so that the individual organs and sclerites are in most cases extremely minute, rendering the work of dissection very delicate and trying. The writer hopes to follow up those points which have only been lightly touched upon, extending the field of investigation to related species, with the object of producing a more complete and valuable piece of work...|$|E
40|$|The organic {{market has}} grown {{exponentially}} in Europe {{during the last}} ten years. However, the organic fruit industry has shown the lowest growth rates (1 - 5 % market share) compared to other commodities. One major reason is the high production risk due to high disease and pest pressure in humid climates. Key pests and diseases in apple and pear include scab, sooty blotch, and fire blight as well as rosy <b>apple</b> aphid, pear <b>sucker,</b> and codling moth. In cherry, damages due to brown rot (Monilinia) and the cherry fruit fly make organic production almost unfeasible. In an ideal organic system, all possible measures that lead to improved stability of the system must be implemented. In fruit production, such measures include (i) use of resistant varieties (scab), (ii) active promotion of predators (rosy apple aphid), (iii) sanitation (cherry monilinia), (iv) microclimate management (planting density, covering trees), and (v) strengthening the plant self-defence system (e. g. building up of soil fertility, bio-dynamic preparations). At present, most organic orchards have been designed for conventional production and, therefore, lack most stabilising components. In consequence, organic fruit production still depends largely on direct pest and disease control methods. These include traditional pesticides such as copper, sulphur, and lime sulphur, pyrethrin, oil and soap preparations. More recently, new pest control compounds and techniques have been developed including neem products, granulosis virus, and mating disruption. New tools for disease control are less spectacular {{and focus on the}} replacement of copper (e. g. with clay powders and resistance inducers). The introduction of new equipment, materials, and Decision Support Systems (DSS) will further improve yield stability. However, other limiting factors such as weed competition, crop load regulation, and conventional market demands need innovative solutions...|$|R
