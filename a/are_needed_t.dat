The full hydrodynamic model, a simplified hydrodynamic model and drift-diffusion model are considered. The method, which reduces to the well-known Scharfetter-Gummel discretization for the conventional drift-diffusion model in one space dimension, proves to be a robust numerical tool. It performs well also when the solution has layers of rapid variation across junctions which are not aligned with mesh lines. Comparisons are made for the different models.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Exposure {{to the industrial}} solvent, styrene, induces locomotor and cognitive dysfunction in rats, and parkinsonian-like manifestations in man. The antipsychotic, haloperidol (HP), well known to induce striatal toxicity in man and animals, and styrene share a common metabolic pathway yielding p-fluoro phenylglyoxylic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA), respectively. Using an exposure period of 30 days and the vacous chewing movement (VCM) model {{as an expression of}} striatal-motor toxicity, we found that incremental PGA dosing (220 – 400 mg/kg) significantly increased VCMs up to day 25, but decreased to control levels shortly after reaching maximum dose. However, a diminishing dose of PGA (400 – 200 mg/kg) did not evoke an immediate worsening of VCMs but precipitated a significant increase in VCMs following dosage reduction to 200 mg/kg on day 22. PGA exposure, therefore, compromises striatal-motor function that is especially sensitive to changes in exposure dose.

To identify factors contributing to differential quinine responses in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, we have conducted comparative quantitative trait locus analyses on the susceptibility to quinine and also its stereoisomer quinidine, and on the initial and steady-state intracellular drug accumulation levels in the F 1 progeny of a genetic cross. These data, together with genetic screens of field isolates and laboratory strains associated differential quinine and quinidine responses with mutated pfcrt, a segment on chromosome 13, and a novel candidate gene, termed MAL 7 P 1. 19 (encoding a HECT ubiquitin ligase). Despite a strong likelihood of association, episomal transfections demonstrated a role for the HECT ubiquitin-protein ligase in quinine and quinidine sensitivity in only a subset of genetic backgrounds, and here the changes in IC 50 values were moderate (approximately 2 -fold).

Guided by the lifecourse perspective, the authors examined how mother-daughter relationships were renegotiated across the life course; focusing on the later stages of the life course when support exchanges and future care plans may be needed for older mothers. Emotional and instrumental supports were exchanged between all dyads regardless of relationship quality, with only emotionally close dyads exchanging financial support. The flow of support was predominantly downward, although it was more reciprocal in dyads with mothers in poor health. Most dyads had emotionally close relationships and had assumptions for future care, most often informal care; only 1 dyad had concrete plans. Results indicate that mothers {{may be reluctant to}} discuss future health constraints and daughters may be less inclined to consider future caregiving responsibilities.

These characteristic classes have values in an arithmetic Chow ring constructed by means of differential forms with certain log-log type singularities.

Then, we introduce the notion of log-singular hermitian vector bundles, which is {{a variant of the}} good hermitian vector bundles introduced by Mumford, and we develop the theory of arithmetic characteristic classes. Finally we prove that the hermitian metrics of automorphic vector bundles considered by Mumford are not only good but also log-singular.

30|$|Half-Fourier single-shot RARE (HASTE) generates {{sequences}} with {{a strong}} T 2 -weighting. The acquisition times are short so breathing artefacts are minimal. Normal bowel wall has low signal intensity on HASTE images. Due to oedema (in inflammation), the signal intensity can increase. Flow artefacts due to peristaltic motion can occur with the HASTE sequence, but an anti-spasmolytic agent can be given to prevent this. To distinguish fat from oedema (both have high T 2 signal intensity), fat-suppression can be used. Balanced steady-state free precession (true-FISP) is a sequence that combines tissue contrast from both T 1 - and T 2 -weighting. The bowel wall has an intermediate to low signal intensity, and fluids have a high signal intensity.

While policy makers hail the success in meeting the povery reduction target of the MDGs, social unrests in the Middle East and North African regions and some parts of Asia and Europe question current economic growth models. Developing countries have been catching up economically at unprecended rates, but economic growth does not automatically translate into positive social outcomes. Widening inequalities within countries, especially in fast-growing economies, threaten social cohesion. This issue paper describes the opportunities and challenges faced by developing countries due to the shift in economic gravity. It argues that reducing absolute povety is not enough and that inequality limits social mobility and restrict individual choice. Inequalities reinforce circumstantial factors such as inherited poverty, gender, ethnicity and location (Watkins, 2013).

Such sequences of controls and solutions are not usually tight in the Skorokhod topology, the usual one in weak-covergence work.
