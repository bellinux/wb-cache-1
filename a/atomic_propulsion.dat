5000|$|Red Ronin {{possesses}} immense {{strength and}} speed, is highly durable and can fly at subsonic speed using the <b>atomic</b> <b>propulsion</b> units in its legs. It is {{armed with a}} pulsating [...] "rotary discus" [...] shield, with a solar powered [...] "solar blade" [...] laser-blade sword and doubles as an ultraviolet laser Gatling gun device, on its right arm. Red Ronin also has a magnetic field generator in its shoulder epaulets and arm-mounted power blasters capable of firing blasts of concussive force equivalent to 100 tons of TNT. Additionally, the shield is also capable of firing missiles, which Red Ronin used during its battle against Yetrigar in the Grand Canyon, {{and can be used}} as a detachable thrown weapon, containing a homing device that enables it to return to the robot. Red Ronin's left hand also has the ability to convert to an energy cannon that projects energy blasts. In addition, it could release [...] "Magneclamp cables" [...] from its boot units, which were strong enough to hold and support a being as massive as Godzilla.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen and atomic oxygen play an {{important}} role in high temperature gas systems. Their Zeldovich reaction product nitric oxide not only affects aerothermal loads and emissions of hypersonic vehicles, but also has the possibility to influence the efficiency of hypersonic <b>propulsion.</b> <b>Atomic</b> oxygen induced nitrogen dissociation is another reaction mechanism of the N 2 +O system. However, due to the difficulty of conducting ground tests, there are no experimental data for this reaction now. Thermo-chemical nonequilibrium could make the problem more difficult since experiments could only track macroscopic gas properties instead of internal energy distribution. On the other hand, current reaction and internal energy exchange models are able to reproduce equilibrium condition. Whether their predictions at nonequilibrium conditions are reliable is still questionable. The work in this thesis employs quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method based on an ab-initio chemistry calculated potential energy surface for the N 2 +O system. Through QCT calculations of different initial condition, high fidelity cross sections and rates are obtained. The cross sections are further used to generate a ME-QCT-VT model for vibrational excitation/relaxation, a state-specific exchange (SSE) model and a state-specific dissociation (SSD) model. These models are verified by comparison with direct QCT calculated rates and other experimental data or models. Although there are no flowfield calculations in this work, the models are able to be applied easily in DSMC calculations. ...|$|R
