25|$|Others, like Mark Bauerlein, {{argue that}} professors in the {{humanities}} have increasingly abandoned proven methods of epistemology (I care only {{about the quality of}} your arguments, not your conclusions.) in favor of indoctrination (I care only about your conclusions, not the quality of your arguments.). The result is that professors <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>students</b> adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, or understanding of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second and}} third {{buildings}} were constructed in 1857 and 1865-1867 respectively.
