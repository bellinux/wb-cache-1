50|$|Accommodation and vergence. <b>Accommodation</b> is <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> If one eye is {{open and}} the other closed, and one focuses on {{something}} close, <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> closed <b>eye</b> will become <b>the</b> same as that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open <b>eye.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> closed <b>eye</b> will tend to converge to point at the object.

50|$|Laser blended vision {{treatment}} {{is suitable for}} people suffering from presbyopia. People mostly begin to suffer from presbyopia, refractive error {{between the ages of}} 40-45 years. As we age, the natural lens inside the eye grows, leading to a decrease in the ability of the eye to change its focus from distance to near, a process called accommodation (accommodation (eye)). There is still much controversy amongst experts as to the mechanism of <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> which is probably why the actual reversal of presbyopia is still not medically possible.|$|E
40|$|Accommodation is {{considered}} to be a symmetrical response and to be driven by the least ametropic and nonamblyopic eye in anisometropia.

40|$|Introduction International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has {{provided}} a comprehensive discussion on threshold dose for radiation-induced cataract in ICRP publication 116. Accordingly, {{various parts of the}} eye lens have different radio-sensitivities. Recently, some studies have been performed to develop a realistic eye model with the aim of providing accurate estimation of fluence-to-dose conversion coefficients for different parts of the eye. However, the effect of accommodation, which changes the lens shape and pupil size, on dose conversion coefficients has not been considered yet. In this study, we purport to develop an accommodation-dependent eye model and to study the effects of accommodation on the electron and proton fluence-to-dose conversion coefficients. Materials and Methods Herein, a modified eye model was developed by considering the effects of accommodation on the lens shape and pupil size. In addition, MCNPX 2. 6 Monte Carlo transport code was used to calculate the effects of  eye lens accommodation on electron and proton fluence-to-dose conversion coefficients. Results Calculation of dose conversion coefficients demonstrated that the accommodation causes up to 40 % discrepancy for fluence-to-dose conversion coefficients of electrons in the range of 600 to 800 keV, which is due to the change of eye lens shape during the <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> Conclusion Since the <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> change the lens shape and pupil size, it has considerable effect on fluence-to-dose conversion coefficients of electrons at some ranges of incident particle energies that should be considered in simulation. However, the fluctuation of dose conversion coefficients of protons is negligible...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the potential effect that odd and even-order monochromatic aberrations {{may have on}} <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>eye.</b> METHODS: Eight healthy subjects with astigmatism below 1 D, best corrected visual acuity 20 / 20 or better and normal findings in an ophthalmic examination were enrolled.

RESULTS: The accommodative lag was greater for <b>the</b> accommodative demands <b>of</b> 1. 5, 3, 3. 5 and 4 D for the condition in which the even-order aberrations were corrected, in comparison to that obtained for the natural aberrations and corrected odd-order aberrations for the same accommodation demands.

40|$|Unintended {{intravascular}} injection from inferior alveolar nerve blocks {{can result}} in frustrating distant complications affecting such structures as the middle ear and eyes. Possible complications affecting the eyes include blurring of vision, diplopia, mydriasis, palpebral ptosis and amaurosis (temporary or permanent). In this article, we present a complication that has been reported only rarely. Two patients developed transient loss of power of <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> resulting in blurred vision after routine inferior alveolar nerve blocks on the ipsilateral side. Clear vision returned within 10 - 15 minutes after completion of the blocks. The possible explanation for this phenomenon is accidental injection into the neurovascular bundle of local anesthetic agents, which were carried via the blood to the orbital region. This resulted in paralysis of a branch of cranial nerve III, the short ciliary nerves that innervate the ciliary muscle, which controls accommodation.

40|$|The optical {{function}} of the human eye {{is based on the}} combination of the cornea (as a fixed lens), an adjustable lens and the vitreous fluid. The <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> which is meant to focus an image, is based on the movement of the ciliary muscle, which alters the shape and thus dioptric strength of the adjustable lens. In the case of cataract disease, the adjustable lens becomes milky, causing a blurred vision. The most common cure is to surgically replace the natural lens by a static artificial one. However, better restoration would require a lens with the capability of automatic accommodation. The development of such a lens {{is the subject of this}} research. The concept comprises an intraocular lens with electro-optically controlled refractive power that can be surgically inserted. By making use of dual lenses and a hybrid lens design, based on electronically controlled liquid crystal alignment and a curved shape, the complete lens will adaptively focus every image, independent on the polarisation of the light, and of the distance of the object. The control signal for the lens is derived from a sensor measuring the position of a marker moving together with the ciliary muscle. The research designed, built and tested the electro-optic lens. High importance was given to modelling the physics of the optics of the curved, inhomogeneous and anisotropic system. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{accommodation}} {{response to}} changing levels of longitudinal spherical aberration (LSA) was measured. The LSA {{of the eye}} is known to change from positive to negative {{as the level of}} <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> increases. However {{little is known about the}} effect of these changes in spherical aberration on the overall accommodation response. Methods The existing monochromatic aberrations of three young subjects were measured using the objective aberroscope procedure across a range of accommodation levels. LSA was induced through the use of aspheric surface, rigid contact lenses (in-air) positioned over a 5 mm aperture at a distance of 12 mm from the eye. Seven levels of LSA were induced ranging from - 3 D and + 3 D of LSA. The subjects viewed a high contrast Maltese cross with the right eye at distances of 33 cm and 67 cm in photopic conditions. Measurements of accommodation level for each LSA condition were made from the left (occluded) eye using the Canon Autoref R- 1, a free-space objective infra-red optometer. Results For the three subjects who were tested, negative LSA caused an increased accommodation response and positive LSA a decreased accommodation response. Pooling the data across subjects and test distances, a linear regression on induced LSA versus accommodation response gave: Accommodation response (D) = 0. 23 – 0. 25 LSA (D) (r 2 = 0. 90). Therefore for every 1 D of LSA there was approximately 0. 25 D of accommodation response. Some individual variations occurred and there was some apparent flattening of the slope at the extremes of induced LSA. Conclusions These findings suggest that the accommodation response of the eye will be influenced by the natural changes in spherical aberration of the eye associated with accommodation and by optical corrections of the eye which induce spherical aberration...|$|E

40|$|When viewing a real object, {{our eyes}} will {{accommodate}} to focus at the object. At the same time, our eyes will also verge so that <b>the</b> visual axis <b>of</b> both eyes will point towards that object. In other words, <b>the</b> vergence <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> will change {{in accordance to}} <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> However this relationship may be disturbed when viewing stereo images with changing stereo depths presented on a binocular display with fixed lens focus. The incompatibility between the varying stereo depth and the fixed lens focus can post an unnatural demand on human vergence eye movements. This may cause eye fatigue. An experiment has been conducted to investigate <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> fatigue caused by viewing stereo images with changing stereo depths on a binocular display with compatible and incompatible lens focuses. Four viewing conditions have been studied and they exhaust <b>the</b> factorial combinations <b>of</b> two lens focus (40 cm and 200 cm) and two changing stereo depth cues (40 cm ± 0. 3 dioptres and 200 cm ± 0. 3 dioptres). This design examines <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> lens focus, stero depth, and their interactions (i. e., compatibility between lens focus and stereo depth). In this study, {{we are interested in}} the compatibility effects when the lens focus or stereo depth is controlled at 40 cm and 200 cm, respectively. When using a binocular display with fixed lens focus of 200 cm, viewing stereo images with incompatible stereo depths (40 cm) can significantly increase <b>the</b> rated levels <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> fatigue (p 0. 5, F 1, 383 = 0. 36, ANOVA). <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> benefits is due to an opposite confounding effects <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> on <b>eye</b> fatigue: as <b>the</b> lens focus is reduced to match with the stereo depth, the accommodative demand on <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> is increased. <b>The</b> former reduces <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> fatigue while <b>the</b> latter does the opposite. Data also indicate that when <b>the</b> confounding effect <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> is in agreement with the compatibility effects between lens focus and stereo depth, very significant reduction in rated levels of eye fatigue are reported when lens focus is changed from 40 cm to 200 cm in order to match with images of stereo depths of 200 cm ((p< 0. 001, F 1, 383 = 55. 5, ANOVA).

40|$|Purpose: Phenylephrine {{hydrochloride}} (PHCl), {{a commonly}} used mydriatic agent, causes {{a small but}} significant deterioration <b>of</b> <b>accommodation.</b> <b>The</b> relative roles <b>of</b> pharmacology and optics in this deterioration, however, remain unascertained.

This protocol was repeated once without PHCl and once each with 2. 5 %, 5 %, and 10 % PHCl. Consensual <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>eye</b> was recorded using infrared photorefraction (60 Hz). Results : Relative to no PHCl, the horizontal pupil diameter of left eye was significantly larger (P 0. 4 for all). The response magnitude and peak velocity also decreased significantly with pupil diameter, at similar rates for the no PHCl and the three PHCl conditions (P < 0. 001 for all). Conclusion: The reduction in accommodative performance with all drug concentrations and with pupil diameter suggests independent roles of pharmacology and optics in determining accommodative performance with PHCl. The reduction in accommodative performance is, however, modest and may be clinically irrelevant in Indian eyes...|$|R
