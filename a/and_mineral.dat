40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{a lesson}} developed to help {{junior high school}} students understand rocks <b>and</b> <b>minerals.</b> The lesson contains a class on the differences between terminological structure and material structure of rocks <b>and</b> <b>minerals.</b> One hundred <b>and</b> forty-seven junior high school students of first-grade {{were divided into two}} groups: a control group and an experimental group. The students of the control group received a normal lesson on rocks <b>and</b> <b>minerals.</b> The students of the experimental group recieved the normal lesson as well as an additional lesson on the differences between material structure and the terminological structure of rocks <b>and</b> <b>minerals.</b> Analysisi of student understanding of rocks <b>and</b> <b>minerals</b> showed thet more students understoodrocks <b>and</b> <b>minerals</b> correctly in the experimental group (71. 8 %) than in the control group (55. 1). 「岩石と鉱物の物質的な構造の学習に加え，それらの用語の構造の学習をすれば，より多くの中学生が岩石と鉱物の違いを正しく理解することができる」という仮説を検証した．中学 1 年生 147 名を統制群と実験群に分け，統制群には岩石と鉱物に関する通常の授業を行ない，実験群には通常の学習に加え，岩石と鉱物の物質的な構造と用語の構造の違いの学習を組み込んだ授業を行った．そして，両軍における岩石と鉱物の理解度の差を岩石名調査，コンセプトマップ調査およびアンケート調査により調べた．その結果，岩石と鉱物を正しく理解した生徒の割合は実験群が 71. 8 ％，統制群が 55. 1 ％と，実験ぐんのほうが有意に多いことがわかった...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to mollusk shells, various other natural history specimens {{are susceptible to}} this form of decay, including eggshells and some fossils <b>and</b> <b>mineral</b> samples that are composed of calcium carbonate. This condition is of concern for museum scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent realocation to an archival setting.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar's natural {{resources}} include {{a variety of}} unprocessed agricultural <b>and</b> <b>mineral</b> resources. Agriculture (including raffia), fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy. Madagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang. Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and Madagascar currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Riesling is a {{versatile}} wine for pairing with food, {{because of its}} balance of sugar and acidity.
