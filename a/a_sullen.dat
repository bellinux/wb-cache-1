500|$|One of {{the more}} {{important}} performances in Cooper's early career was his portrayal of <b>a</b> <b>sullen</b> legionnaire in Josef von Sternberg's 1930 film Morocco with Marlene Dietrich in her introduction to American audiences. During production, von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated Cooper dismissively. Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled directions at Cooper in German. The [...] actor approached the [...] director, physically picked him up by the collar and said, [...] "If you expect to work in this country you'd better get on to the language we use here." [...] Despite the tensions on the set, Cooper produced [...] "one of his best performances", according to Thornton Delehanty of the New York Evening Post. In 1931, after returning to the Western genre in Zane Grey's Fighting Caravans with French actress Lili Damita, Cooper appeared in the Dashiell Hammett crime film City Streets playing a westerner who gets involved with big-city gangsters in order to save the woman he loves. Cooper concluded the year with appearances in two unsuccessful films: I Take This Woman with Carole Lombard, and His Woman with Claudette Colbert. The demands and pressures of making ten films in two years left Cooper exhausted and in poor health, suffering from anemia and jaundice. He had lost [...] during that period, and felt lonely, isolated, and depressed by his sudden fame and wealth. In May 1931, Cooper left Hollywood and sailed to Algiers and then Italy, where he lived for the next year.|$|E

[...] There was good reason for this; for it is also said that the local people attached themselves to Balliol more from fear than love.

She also noted the Persians had [...] "with a characteristic lack of foresight...left everything to the last", but they acted [...] "like people preparing for amateur theatricals...sustained by the conviction that it would be all right on the day". People from all over Persia had come for the coronation of the new Shah, and Sackville-West noted how the capital was full of Baluchi, Turkoman, and Kurdish tribesmen all dressed in their best colorful clothing, adding to the air of excitement. At night, all of Tehran was lit up by vast array of candlesticks and oil lamps burning in many buildings while the main streets were lit up by special oil lamps put up for the coronation and the night sky was illuminated by fireworks. Sackville noted how the streets and even buildings were covered with brightly woven Persian carpets, turning a city of [...] "bricks and plaster" [...] into a [...] "a great and sumptuous tent open to the sky".|$|E
