40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop an}} {{inexpensive}} and easily adaptable semi-quantitative exposure assessment method to characterize exposure to pesticide in <b>applicators</b> <b>and</b> re-entry farmers and farm workers in Ethiopia. METHODS: Two specific semi-quantitative exposure algorithms for pesticides <b>applicators</b> <b>and</b> re-entry workers were developed {{and applied to}} 601 farm workers employed in 3 distinctly different farming systems [small-scale irrigated, large-scale greenhouses (LSGH), and large-scale open (LSO) ] in Ethiopia. The algorithm for applicators was based on exposure-modifying factors including application methods, farm layout (open or closed), pesticide mixing conditions, cleaning of spraying equipment, intensity of pesticide application per day, utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE), personal hygienic behavior, annual frequency of application, and duration of employment at the farm. The algorithm for re-entry work {{was based on an}} expert-based re-entry exposure intensity score, utilization of PPE, personal hygienic behavior, annual frequency of re-entry work, and duration of employment at the farm. RESULTS: The algorithms allowed estimation of daily, annual and cumulative lifetime exposure for <b>applicators,</b> <b>and</b> re-entry workers by farming system, by gender, and by age group. For all metrics, highest exposures occurred in LSGH for both <b>applicators</b> <b>and</b> female re-entry workers. For male re-entry workers, highest cumulative exposure occurred in LSO farms. Female re-entry workers appeared to be higher exposed on a daily or annual basis than male re-entry workers, but their cumulative exposures were similar {{due to the fact that}} on average males had longer tenure. Factors related to intensity of exposure (like application method and farm layout) were indicated as the main driving factors for estimated potential exposure. Use of personal protection, hygienic behavior, and duration of employment in surveyed farm workers contributed less to the contrast in exposure estimates. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that farmers' and farm workers' exposure to pesticides can be inexpensively characterized, ranked, and classified. Our method could be extended to assess exposure to specific active ingredients provided that detailed information on pesticides used is available. The resulting exposure estimates will consequently be used in occupational epidemiology studies in Ethiopia and other similar countries with few resources...|$|R

40|$|The multielectrode {{current source}} (MECS) {{interstitial}} hyperthermia (IHT) system uses thermocouple thermometry. To obtain a homogeneous temperature distribution and {{to limit the}} number of traumas due to the implanted catheters, most catheters are used for both heating and thermometry. Implications of temperature measurement inside applicators are discussed. In particular, the impact of self-heating of both the <b>applicator</b> <b>and</b> the afterloading catheter were investigated. A one-dimensional cylindrical model was used to compute the difference between the temperature rise inside the <b>applicators</b> (deltaTin) <b>and</b> in the tissue just outside the afterloading catheter (deltaTout) as a function of power absorption in the afterloading catheter, self-heating of the <b>applicator</b> <b>and</b> the effective thermal conductivity of the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, the relative artefact (ERR), i. e. (deltaTin - deltaTout) /deltaTin, was measured in a muscle equivalent agar phantom at different positions in a dual-electrode <b>applicator</b> <b>and</b> for different catheter materials. A method to estimate the tissue temperature by power-off temperature decay measurement inside the applicator was investigated. Using clinical dual-electrode applicators in standard brachytherapy catheters in a muscle-equivalent phantom, deltaTin is typically twice as high as deltaTout. The main reason for this difference is self-heating of the thin feeder wires in the centre of the applicator. The measurement error caused by energy absorption in the afterloading catheter is small, i. e. even for materials with a high dielectric loss factor it is less than 5 %. About 5 s after power has been switched off, Tin in the electrodes represents the maximum tissue temperature just before power-off. This delay time (t(delay)) and ERR are independent of Tin. However, they do depend on the thermal properties of the tissue. Therefore, ERR and t(delay) and their stability in perfused tissues have to be investigated to enable a reliable estimation of the tissue temperatures around electrodes in clinical practic...|$|R
