40|$|In a {{double-blind}} trial bupivacaine 0. 125, 0. 25 and 0. 5 % and lignocaine 0. 5, 1 and 2 % were given intradermally to 31 volunteers. Vasoconstriction was observed more frequently at low concentrations of each drug, and vasodilatation at high concentrations. These observations were highly significant (P< 0. 001). Duration of action was unaffected by concentration, {{except in the}} case of bupivacaine 0. 5 %, the effect of which was longer lasting than that of other solutions. In a recent intradermal study of local anaesthetic agents, prilocaine, mepivacaine and <b>aptocaine</b> pro-duced vasoconstriction more frequently at lower con-centrations and vasodilatation at higher concentrations (Reynolds, Bryson and Nicholas, 1976). Moreover, the duration of action was no greater at higher con-centrations. Also in that study, bupivacaine 0. 5 % and lignocaine 2 % were found to produce vasodilatation. The present work was undertaken in order to study the vasoactivity of different concentrations of intra-dermal bupivacaine and lignocaine...|$|E
