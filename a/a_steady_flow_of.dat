5|$|Alexander I Aldea (14311436) was {{the first}} Romanian ruler {{to be forced to}} render {{military}} service to the Ottomans. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 14561462, 1476), notorious as the model for the Dracula legend, turned against the Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 14611462. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (14621475). Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily depopulated {{after the end of the}} 14thcentury.

5|$|Various {{concepts}} were mooted for the A-4's deployment in a March 1942 {{study by}} Walter Dornberger, {{the head of}} the A-4 development project at the Peenemünde Army Research Center. He suggested that the missiles should be based in heavily defended fixed sites of a bunker-style design similar to the massive submarine pens then under construction in occupied France and Norway. The rockets could be stored in such sites, armed, fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant, and launched. This offered significant technical advantages; not only would the LOX loss be minimised, but the complex process of pre-launch testing would be simplified. A high rate of fire could be sustained as the facility could effectively operate like a production line, sending <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> missiles to the launch pads.|$|E
5|$|Vigorous {{degassing}} {{of carbon}} dioxide occurs from several vents in two bogs near Nazko Cone. These vents are {{in the form of}} small isolated travertine mounds on the bog surface. A mound with a partially submerged vent had been identified in 2013 with <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide. Several new vents with no travertine mound were actively releasing carbon dioxide gas in 2015. Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the carbon dioxide gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be very deep underground.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1925, Pflueger {{designed}} a , 28-story, step-back skyscraper made of brick framed with steel, {{along the lines}} of his just-completed Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building. Its main decorative theme was neo-Gothic, expressed strongly in the three Gothic arches which formed the main street-level entrance for the church. The Great Hall, the large worship area located within the second, third and fourth floors was to seat 1,500 churchgoers and a smaller chapel was designed for 125 more. A grand pipe organ from Skinner Organ Company was installed with four manuals controlling 3,881 pipes. A stained glass window was placed 80 feet above the sanctuary, representing Faith, Love and Hope in three tall, narrow panels. Two assembly halls could be combined to hold 1,100 attendees for theatrical or athletic events. Some 500 guest rooms and 32 tower apartments were intended to bring <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> visitors and a source of profit to the church.

40|$|Niche {{markets of}} {{agricultural}} products are experiencing rapid growth. One such niche market is organic pork. Organic pork production {{is a relatively}} new and expanding segment of the pork industry. Similar to some other niche markets, it has also experienced rapid growth (Organic Trade Association). It is well known that the cost of organic pork production is greater than for traditional pork production due to increased feed costs and decreased swine performance. The industry has dealt with this by paying premiums to induce producers to produce the organic product. However, it is not clear on what level or how the premiums should be paid to producers to provide an incentive to produce and market <b>a</b> <b>steadier</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> product throughout the year. With premium structures currently used for organic pork production there are more hogs being produced using summer farrowing than with winter farrowing. This uneven pig <b>flow</b> causes instability <b>of</b> supply and creates product flow problems throughout the industry. This instability can lead to problems of slaughter capacity scheduling and/or utilization as the industry grows and matures. Also, at certain time periods the demand for fresh organic pork products may not be met. During other times, the availability of fresh organic pork may exceed demand. These issues create problems for a developing industry, which is attempting to establish and maintain a reliable consumer base...|$|R
