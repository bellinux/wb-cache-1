50|$|Helmholtz {{resonance}} or wind throb is {{the phenomenon}} of <b>air</b> <b>resonance</b> in a cavity, such as when one blows {{across the top of}} an empty bottle.

50|$|Essentially, {{the goal}} of the {{transmission}} line is to minimize acoustical or mechanical impedance at frequencies corresponding to the driver's fundamental free <b>air</b> <b>resonance.</b> This simultaneously reduces stored energy in the driver's motion, reduces distortion, and critically damps the driver by maximizing acoustic output (maximal acoustical loading or coupling) at the terminus. This also minimizes the negative effects of acoustic energy that would otherwise (as with a sealed enclosure) be reflected back to the driver in a sealed cavity.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to conduct a parametric investigation on the aeromechanic stability of modern bearingless rotors. To ensure aeromechanic stability, modem bearingless; rotors use elastomeric dampers to augment the blade inplane damping. The augmented dampers are necessary to avoid aeromechanic instabilities such as <b>air</b> and ground <b>resonance</b> on soft-inplane rotors. The prevention of <b>air</b> and ground <b>resonance</b> depends largely on the damping level of the rotor-fuselage system during the critical frequency-crossing between the rotor and the fuselage inplane motions. The blade inplane damping, critical in ensuring aeromechanic stability of a rotor, depends {{not only on the}} damper sizes but also on the aeroelastic properties of the rotor blade. The results of this investigation provide insight into the source of inplane damping. The parametric study is carried out analytically using the University of Maryland Advanced Rotorcraft Code, or UMARC...|$|R
50|$|Damping {{means to}} reduce {{resonance}} in the room, by absorption or redirection (reflection or diffusion).

40|$|The aeromechanical stability, {{including}} <b>air</b> <b>resonance</b> in hover, <b>air</b> <b>resonance</b> in forward flight, {{and ground}} resonance, {{of a helicopter}} with elastically tailored composite rotor blades is investigated. Five soft-inplane hingeless rotor configurations, featuring elastic pitch-lag, pitch-flap and extension-torsion couplings, are analyzed. Elastic couplings introduced through tailored composite blade spars can have a powerful effect on both air and ground resonance behavior. Elastic pitch-flap couplings (positive and negative) strongly affect body, rotor and dynamic inflow modes. <b>Air</b> <b>resonance</b> stability is diminished by elastic pitch-flap couplings in hover and forward flight. Negative pitch-lag elastic coupling has a stabilizing effect on the regressive lag mode in hover and forward flight. The negative pitch-lag coupling has a detrimental effect on ground resonance stability. Extension-torsion elastic coupling (blade pitch decreases due to tension) decreases regressive lag mode stability in both airborne and ground contact conditions. Increasing thrust levels has a beneficial influence on ground resonance stability for rotors with pitch-flap and extension-torsion coupling and is only marginally effective in improving stability of rotors with pitch-lag coupling...|$|E

40|$|The {{tiltrotor}} {{offers the}} best mix of hovering and cruise flight {{of any of the}} current V/STOL configurations. One possible improvement on the tiltrotors of today designs would be using a soft-inplane hingeless hub. The advantages to a soft-inplane hingeless hub range from reduced weight and maintenance to reduced vibration and loads. However, soft-inplane rotor systems are inherently in danger of the aeromechanical instabilities of ground and <b>air</b> <b>resonance.</b> Furthermore tiltrotors can be subject to whirl flutter. At least {{in part because of the}} potential for air and ground resonance in a soft-inplane rotor, the Bell XV- 15, the Bell-Boeing V- 22 Osprey, and the new Bell Augusta 609 have stiff-inplane, gimballed rotors which do not experience these instabilities. In order to design soft-inplane V/STOL aircraft that do not experience ground or <b>air</b> <b>resonance,</b> it is important to be able to predict these instabilities accurately. Much of the research studying the stability of tiltrotors has been focused on the understanding and prediction of whirl flutter. As this instability is increasingly well understood, air and ground resonance for a tiltrotor need to be investigated. Once we understand the problems of air and ground resonance in a tiltrotor, we must look for solutions to these instabilities. Other researchers have found composite or kinematic couplings in the blades of a helicopter helpful for ground and <b>air</b> <b>resonance</b> stability. Tiltrotor research has shown composite couplings in the wing to be helpful for whirl flutter. Therefore, this project will undertake to model ground and <b>air</b> <b>resonance</b> of a soft-inplane hingeless tiltrotor to understand the mechanisms involved and to evaluate whether aeroelastic couplings in the wing or kinematic couplings in the blades would aid in stabilizing these instabilities in a tiltrotor...|$|E
40|$|Some {{of drums}} have two {{membranes}} {{on both sides}} of a hollow trunk or a barrel. In this type of the drum structure, the two membranes interact with each other through the air inside the body. Even if the two membranes have an identical resonance frequency, there exist two resulting resonance frequencies. At the lower resonance, the two membranes vibrate in phase. Since the membranes must move the internal <b>air,</b> the lower <b>resonance</b> is lower than the original <b>resonance</b> frequency (without <b>air</b> loading). At the higher resonance, they vibrate out-of-phase squeezing or expanding the <b>air</b> simultaneously. This <b>resonance</b> is higher than the original <b>resonance</b> since the <b>air</b> works as a spring. In this paper, resonance frequencies and mode shapes of two membranes coupled with each other through the air inside the body are investigated using an analytical model. The membranes are assumed to be ideal (i. e., no stiffness) and the body is assumed to be ideally rigid. Since it is a common practice that the two membranes are slightly (intentionally) miss-tuned, the main interest {{of this paper is to}} simulate the effect of this miss-tuning on the resulting resonance frequencies and mode shapes...|$|R

The thin circular MoS 2 nanomembrane with an approximate 8 -nm thickness was transferred onto the endface of a ferrule with an inner diameter of 125 μm, which created a low finesse F-P interferometer with a cavity length of 39. 92 μm.

Further, a maximum quality (Q) factor of 1. 35 for the resonator was observed at 0 °C due to viscous dissipation, in relation to the lower Knudsen number of 0. 0025 ~ 0. 0034 in the tested temperature range. Moreover, measurements of Q factor revealed little dependence of Q on resonance frequency and temperature. These measurements shed light on the mechanisms behind viscous air damping in MoS 2, graphene, and other 2 D resonators...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{safety and}} reduced {{workload}} {{are two main}} goals for helicopter pilot assistance systems. Feedback control is one possible mean to get towards these goals. In conjunction with hinge- and bearingless main rotor concepts further improvement of the handling qualities are expected. But this rotor concept suffers from air resonance: a self-excited oscillation caused by the coupling of the rotor blades' (regressive) lead-lag especially with body roll motion. Excellent handling quality ratings may require aggressive maneuvering with high agility that is often realized using relatively large feedback gains. Especially the roll rate feedback gain was found to excite <b>air</b> <b>resonance.</b> This paper shows a possible solution consisting in suppressing <b>air</b> <b>resonance</b> {{by means of a}} disturbance observer-based control.
