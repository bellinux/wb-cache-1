25|$|Most of {{the retail}} {{gasoline}} now sold in the United States contains about 10% fuel ethanol (or E10) by volume. Burning <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> E10 produces about 17.68 pounds of CO2 that is emitted from the fossil fuel content. If the CO2 emissions from ethanol combustion are considered, then about 18.95 pounds of CO2 are produced when <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> E10 is combusted.

Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at {{the time of}} the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population. The cost of <b>a</b> <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.|$|E
