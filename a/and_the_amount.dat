5|$|As Christopher Landsea et al. point out, many {{tropical}} cyclones {{that formed}} {{on the open}} sea and did not affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s. They estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910.

5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of polar flattening.|$|E

5000|$|Who Funds You? is a British {{project that}} seeks to rate and promote {{transparency}} of funding sources of think tanks.

5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> {{of water}} in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is {{the percentage of the}} total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
