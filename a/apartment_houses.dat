5|$|In Elmhurst, the {{destruction}} of {{almost all of the}} century-old buildings {{in the heart of the}} village were destroyed for the construction of the subway. Land was taken on the west side of the Broadway to avoid the demolition of the Saint James Episcopal Church and the Reformed Church. Many nineteenth century residences and the Wandowenock Fire Company buildings had to be torn down. To allow the subway line to curve into Queens Boulevard from Broadway, the northeast corner of the two streets was removed, in addition to some stores and an old Presbyterian chapel. New buildings were built behind a new curb line once the subway was completed, bringing a new face to Elmhurst. The introduction of the subway stimulated local growth in Elmhurst. Commercial buildings and <b>apartment</b> <b>houses</b> replaced existing structures.|$|E

25|$|In 1929, Monroe Warren, Sr. {{approached}} Edgar S. Kennedy {{about the}} possibility of constructing a large apartment house on a tract that Kennedy owned on Connecticut Avenue. Kennedy was a partner with two brothers, William and Gordon, in Kennedy Brothers Company, a real estate development firm that had built a number of <b>apartment</b> <b>houses</b> in Washington, D.C., including 2400 16th Street, N.W., facing Meridian Hill Park. Warren owned a construction firm, Monroe and R. B. Warren, Inc., that built co-operative <b>apartment</b> <b>houses,</b> including Tilden Gardens.|$|E

25|$|While {{the square}} boasts some modern architecture, its main {{character}} {{is defined by}} the numerous 19th- and early 20th-century buildings that still stand. Throughout its buildings, the square is host to a multitude of shops, restaurants, business offices, churches and <b>apartment</b> <b>houses,</b> making it a major shopping and business destination in the city.|$|E
25|$|Hell's Kitchen begins {{northwest}} of Penn Station.

25|$|The {{older and}} simpler kind of {{incinerator}} was a brick-lined cell with a fixed metal grate over a lower ash pit, with one {{opening in the}} top or side for loading and another opening in the side for removing incombustible solids called clinkers. Many small incinerators formerly found in <b>apartment</b> <b>houses</b> have now been replaced by waste compactors.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose an optimal design method for the energy system in <b>apartment</b> <b>house</b> using a genetic {{algorithm}} and to examine the possibility for the energy conservation of a designed energy system. The energy demand for cooling and heating in <b>apartment</b> <b>house</b> is determined by using TRNSYS. By a modified genetic algorithm called multi-island genetic algorithm, the optimal running pattern of building equipment systems is decided to minimize the energy consumption. An optimal design method for the energy system of the <b>apartment</b> <b>house</b> was proposed using both genetic algorithm and data of cooling/heating demand load simulated by TRNSY. The results show that this proposed method is significantly capable of determining optimal system design for saving energy in <b>apartment</b> <b>house...</b>|$|R
25|$|The quiet streets {{perpendicular}} to Irving Place have maintained {{their status as}} fashionable residential blocks reminiscent of London's West End. In 1912, a multiple dwelling planned specifically for bachelors appeared at 52 Irving Place.

25|$|The {{city centre}} is typified by {{the streets with}} intact {{architecture}} from the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the old town, around the Church of St. Michael, there are ensembles of buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries. Of particular note is the Hornschuch Promenade with Gründerzeit and Jugendstil <b>apartment</b> <b>houses.</b> The Südstadt, {{the southern part of}} the town, also has many historic buildings, but these tend to be former workers' tenements, so the house fronts are less grand.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the estate}} in the Bakhrushins’ estate in Bolshaya Dmitrovka was built up with <b>apartment</b> <b>houses</b> {{and the other was}} let on lease. Even after the Merchants Club moved to Malaya Dmitrovka the former mansion was still used for {{entertainment}} purposes. In 1909 a Theatre Casino with a terrace and garden was opened there. Then part {{of the estate}} was rented by Stephen Adel for a recreational establishment. In 1912 he completed the construction of a summer Variety Theatre “Chanticleer”, opened the bandstand and a cinema house, and set up pavilions with attractions in the garden.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{structures}} within the neighborhood were built after 1870, beginning with modest cottages. Larger structures were built later, including the James Scripps house (now demolished {{and turned into a}} city park), built in 1879. The Eighth Precinct Police Station, built in 1901, was architecturally designed to blend in with the lavish upper-class homes in the neighborhood. As the automotive industry boomed, there was an increased demand for housing in the city of Detroit, and new buildings and <b>apartment</b> <b>houses</b> were constructed behind and between the existing homes in the neighborhood. During World War II, owners rented rooms and divided homes into apartments to house defense industry workers.|$|E

25|$|During the 20th century, {{the rural}} {{character}} of Westchester would transform into the suburban county known today. The Bronx River Parkway, completed in 1925, {{was the first}} modern, multi-lane limited-access roadway in North America. The development of Westchester's parks and parkway systems supported existing communities and encouraged the establishment of new ones, transforming the development pattern for Westchester. With the need for homes expanding after World War II, multistory <b>apartment</b> <b>houses</b> appeared in the urbanized areas of the county, while the market for single-family houses continued to expand. By 1950, the total County population was 625,816. Major interstate highways were constructed in Westchester during the 1950s and 1960s. The establishment of these roadways, along {{with the construction of}} the Tappan Zee Bridge, led to further growth in the county.|$|E
500|$|In North Korea, {{rainfall}} from Goni exceeded 300mm (11.8in) in Kangwon Province. The rains caused flash {{flooding in}} Rason near the country's borders with China and Russia, killing 40people in the town. The floods wrecked 1,070houses and 99public buildings, including schools, hospitals, and nurseries. Floodwaters inundated [...] of farmlands, while bridges and railroads were washed out. One {{road to the}} Chinese border was damaged, leaving 484Chinese tourists stranded in North Korea; officials from the two countries worked to restore road access. With the 70th annual Foundation Day of the Workers' Party of Korea looming, Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un ordered troops to promptly repair the flood damage by building 1,800new <b>apartment</b> <b>houses</b> and restoring 4,000impacted homes. The Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea provided tarps, water purification tablets, and other emergency supplies to affected residents. On September8, the agency set up two water treatment units to provide Rason residents with clean water for a month.|$|E
500|$|George N. Shorey's {{review of}} the initial seven reel Broadway release {{declared}} it another masterpiece of Mack's writing and notes that the film {{would be the best}} example to go before the courts to argue for [...] "free speech" [...] in films. Shorey notes that the propaganda film [...] "is bold, clear, tremendous in the force of its convincing showing that to drive the scarlet woman from a restricted district into the hotels and <b>apartment</b> <b>houses</b> of a city is a worse crime than it seeks to cure." [...] The only complaint was found that it [...] "does not sufficiently misrepresent the ease and luxury of the underworld. It shows a scarlet woman who finds the [...] "easiest way" [...] truly easy. She does not die, nor even suffer. The intended moral of the picture, that once abandoned to that life a woman finds it to her taste to remain in it and cannot be [...] "reformed," [...] necessarily does include the above corollary to that proposition." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film [...] "deals with a question that has perplexed the sages from the beginning of time and it traverses life's scroll, writing with thought and deed certain actions of everyday application. There are tense dramatic scenes, and above all there is the question that must be faced, [...] "Who's Your Neighbor?"" ...|$|E
