25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|After {{two days}} of being {{available}} on YouTube, the video garnered 2.2 million views. Upon release, the music video for [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] received negative reviews from critics, receiving criticism for gender stereotypes. Kelly Lawler of USA Today wrote, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} gender stereotypes. There is a very, very catchy melody", and compared the nature of the video to that of Taylor Swift's music video for [...] "Blank Space" [...] (2014). The video received accusations of sexism, and backlash from feminists. In a negative review of the video, Julia Shumway of State Press wrote, [...] "The video calls back to a romanticized version of the 1950s or '60s, featuring a yellow version of a little pink house, complete with gramophone and groovy colors". MTV News' Christina Garibaldi criticized the video, writing [...] "the video depicts Meghan going back to the 1950s, scrubbing floors and working hard in the kitchen". Trainor responded to the criticism of the video, saying, [...] "Just surprised the random places people are <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was being sexist. But no, I don’t believe I was." ...|$|E

[...] When asked why, Speck shrugged and jokingly said, [...] "It just wasn't their night." [...] Asked {{how he felt about}} himself in the years since, he said, [...] "Like I always felt ... had no feeling. If you're <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> felt sorry, no." [...] He also described in detail the experience of strangling someone: [...] "It's not like TV ... it takes over three minutes {{and you have to have}} a lot of strength." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his final}} days in Geneva, Borges began {{brooding}} {{about the possibility}} of an afterlife. Although calm and collected about his own death, Borges began probing Kodama as to whether she inclined more towards the Shinto beliefs of her father or the Catholicism of her mother. Kodama [...] "had always regarded Borges as an Agnostic, as she was herself", but given the insistence of his questioning, she offered to call someone more [...] "qualified". Borges responded, [...] "You are <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> want a priest." [...] He then instructed her to call two clergymen, a Catholic priest, in memory of his mother, and a Protestant minister, in memory of his English grandmother. He was visited first by Father Pierre Jacquet and by Pastor Edouard de Montmollin.|$|E
