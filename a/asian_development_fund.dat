2500|$|In {{the first}} year of Kishi's term, Japan joined the United Nations Security Council, paid reparations to Indonesia, signed a new {{commercial}} treaty with Australia, and signed peace treaties with Czechoslovakia and Poland. In 1957, Kishi presented a plan for a Japanese-dominated <b>Asian</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Fund</b> (ADF), which was to operate under the slogan [...] "Economic Development for Asia by Asia", calling for Japan to invest millions of yen in Southeast Asia. For most Japanese Asia had meant Korea and China, especially Manchuria, but in the 1950s, Korea and China were off fines. Japan did not have diplomatic relations with South Korea until 1964 when the South Korean dictator General Park Chung-hee who had served as an officer with the Manchukuo Army in World War II established relations and even then, it caused riots in South Korea. Japanese relations with North Korea and China in the 1950s were even worse. For all these reasons, Kishi turned towards Southeast Asia as an alternative market for Japanese goods and a source of raw materials. Additionally, the Americans wanted more aid to Asia to spur economic growth that would stem the appeal of Communism, but the Americans were disinclined to spend the money themselves. The prospect of Japan spending some $500 million US in low interest loans and aid projects in Southeast Asia had the benefit from Kishi's viewpoint of improving his standing in Washington, and giving him more leverage in his talks to revise the U.S-Japan Security Treaty.|$|E

50|$|Abedin {{initiated}} the $230 million deal with Unocal Corporation (now Chevron Corporation) in 2004, after getting approval from Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. He {{was also a}} senior National committee member for International Clean Cities program of the United States Department of Energy in Bangladesh. Bangladesh was getting very polluted due to extreme use of fuels. In 2001, Abedin {{was the first to}} initiate the national plan to decrease the use of using liquid fuels, by introducing natural gas conversion. He thought if cars could be converted to use cooking gas instead of rather harmful fuels, the carbon emission would decrease exponentially. He was given the permission by the Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to carry out his plans. As a result, <b>Asian</b> <b>Development</b> Bank <b>funded</b> his scheme and today more than 80% of Bangladeshi vehicles are run on gas which has lessened pollution significantly.|$|R

The GIS was composed of a regional geographical data base and a collection of spatial models. The regional geographical data base contained data sets from terrestrial-based sources including thematic maps and statistical records, and remote sensed data. A series of spatial models have been developed by experts in various disciplines such as soil erosion, economics, rural development and arid land management. These models were then implemented into the GIS environment and an extensive mapping tasks were conducted. As the result, a regional development plan was produced to balance the demand from different interest group of land use to achieve an optimum, environmentally sound economic development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{influence}} of Japan and the United States over the geographic distribution of <b>Asian</b> <b>Development</b> Bank (ADB) <b>funds.</b> Although nominally an independent, multilateral organization, the ADB {{is widely regarded as}} bowing to the interests of its two most influential donors. Estimation using panel data for less developed Asian countries from 1968 to 2002 reveals significant donor influence with inconsistent weight placed on humanitarian criteria given limited funding for the region’s largest countries, China and India. Comparing the results with research on World Bank loan allocation suggests donor interests are more important in the ADB. This finding justifies the existence of regional development banks on political grounds but calls into question their relative merits on economic grounds. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{the basis for}} monetary and exchange rate coordination in Asia {{as part of a}} package of monetary integration that could support growth and poverty reduction. This could be achieved directly through coordinated exchange rate stabilization, and indirectly through the implications of this for reserve pooling and investment in an <b>Asian</b> <b>development</b> <b>fund</b> (ADF) and through development of the Asian bond market (ABM). Macro policy coordination could be viewed as a necessary condition for further development of both reserve pooling via the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) and of the ABM. The paper analyzes the trade structure of ASEAN and China in terms of both geographic sources of imports and markets for exports, and of the commodity structure of trade. The similarities of the geographic and commodity trade structures across the region are consistent with adoption of a common currency basket for stabilization, and with an argument for monetary integration across the region along the lines of Mundell (1961) on optimum currency areas. The paper constructs currency baskets and real effective exchange rates (REERs) for the countries in the region. Since their trade patterns are quite similar and their policies are already implicitly coordinated, their REERs tend to move together. This means that ASEAN and China are alread...|$|E

40|$|In 2011, {{more than}} 75, 000 {{people died in}} road crashes in the ten member {{countries}} of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and many times this number sustained long term injuries. Improving road safety outcomes in ASEAN is not only important for the welfare and economic benefit of these countries, but given that {{a significant proportion of}} the world’s population lives in ASEAN, it will strongly influence whether the aims of the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety and the Sustainable Development Goals are reached. For this reason, the <b>Asian</b> <b>Development</b> Bank, <b>funded</b> by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, has funded a package of action to improve road safety in ASEAN, including the development of a regional road safety strategy. The diversity of the member nations of ASEAN poses significant challenges {{for the development of the}} strategy. For example, the road fatality rates per 100, 000 population in Malaysia and Thailand are about 5 times greater than in Singapore. In addition, the importance of particular road safety issues varies across the ASEAN countries and for countries which are undergoing rapid motorization, the order of importance may change over the life of the strategy. The development of the ASEAN Regional Road Safety Strategy has adopted the five pillars of road safety of the UN Decade of Action but focused on those aspects which are most relevant at the regional level and where a regional approach will support and facilitate actions taken by individual countries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Human {{resources}} for health are non-existent {{in many parts}} of the world and the outer islands of Marshall Islands in Micronesia are prime examples. While the more populated islands with hospital facilities are often successful in recruiting qualified health professionals from overseas, the outer islands generally have very limited health resources, and are thus less successful. In an attempt to provide reasonable health services to these islands, indigenous people were trained as Health Assistants (HA) to service their local communities. In an effort to remedy the effectiveness of health care delivery to these islands, a program to train mid-level health care workers (Hospital Assistants) was developed and implemented by the Ministry of Health in conjunction with the hospital in Majuro, the capital city of the Marshall Islands. Methods A physician instructor with experience and expertise in primary health care in these regions conducted the program. The curriculum included training in basic health science, essentials of endemic disorders and their clinical management appropriate to the outer islands. Emphasis was given to prevention and health promotion as well as to the curative aspects. For clinical observation, the candidates were assigned to clinical departments of the Majuro hospital for 1 year during their training, as assistants to the nursing staff. This paper discusses the details of the training, the modalities used to groom the candidates, and an assessment of the ultimate effectiveness of the program. Results Out of 16 boys who began training, 14 candidates were successful in completing the program. In 1998 a similar program was conducted exclusively for women under the auspices of <b>Asian</b> <b>Development</b> Bank <b>funding,</b> hence women were not part of this program. Conclusion For developing countries of the Pacific, appropriately trained human resources are an essential component of economic progress, and the health workforce is an important part of human {{resources for}} sustainable progress and development. </p...|$|R

It is important to note that unlike other ADB technical assistance projects, this assignment adopted a capacity building approach, which promoted and encouraged the local road safety team in the government to step up and take action. The research capacity building approach adopted in this project highlighted the feasibility of increasing participation from existing stakeholders, especially the government in identifying existing human resources, building the capacity of relevant government officials and supporting them to take the ownership of the project.
