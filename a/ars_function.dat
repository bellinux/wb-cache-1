40|$|Two {{adjacent}} but non-overlapping restriction fragments that {{encompass the}} replication {{origin of the}} macronuclear copy of rDNA from Tetrahymena thermophila allow autonomous replication of plasmids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; i. e. they function as autonomously replicating segments (ARS). Deletions generated in vitro into these fragments yield an 82 bp segment from each as the smallest sequence specifying <b>ARS</b> <b>function.</b> These 82 bp segments are at the 5 ' end of a 220 bp region of homology between the two original ARS restriction fragments. A 39 bp region of almost complete sequence identity between the two 82 bp fragments is suggested to be a core sequence element necessary for <b>ARS</b> <b>function.</b> This 39 bp sequence contains a region identical or nearly identical to the 11 bp yeast ARS consensus sequence (T/ATTTATPuTTTA/T) which is suggested to be essential for <b>ARS</b> <b>function.</b> Detailed comparisons of the 82 bp segments and of the 39 bp core with other ARS sequences reveal no extensive homologies aside from the consensus...|$|E

To {{determine whether the}} DNA sequences required for <b>ARS</b> <b>function</b> on plasmids are required for chromosomal origin function, the chromosomal copy of ARS 306 was deleted and the chromosomal copy of ARS 307 was replaced with mutant derivatives of ARS 307 containing single point mutations in domain A within the ARS core consensus sequence. The chromosomal origin function of these derivatives was assayed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. Deletion of ARS 306 deleted the associated replication origin. The effects on chromosomal origin function of mutations in domain A paralleled their effects on <b>ARS</b> <b>function,</b> as measured by plasmid stability.

40|$|Yeast {{autonomously}} replicating sequence (ARS) {{elements are}} composed of a conserved 11 -base-pair (bp) core consensus sequence and a less well defined 3 '-flanking region. We have investigated {{the relationship between the}} H 4 ARS core consensus sequence and its 3 '-flanking domain. The minimal sequences necessary and sufficient for function were determined by combining external 3 ' and 5 ' deletions to produce a nested set of ARS fragments. Sequences 5 ' of the core consensus were dispensable for function, but at least 66 bp of 3 '-flanking domain DNA was required for full <b>ARS</b> <b>function.</b> The importance of the relative orientation of the core consensus element with respect to the 3 '-flanking domain was tested by precisely inverting 14 bp of DNA including the core consensus sequence by oligonucleotide mutagenesis. This core inversion mutant was defective for all <b>ARS</b> <b>function,</b> showing that a fixed relative orientation of the core consensus and 3 '-flanking domain is required for function. The 3 '-flanking domain of the minimal functional H 4 ARS fragment contains three sequences with a 9 -of- 11 -bp match to the core consensus. The role of these near-match sequences was tested by directed mutagenesis. When all near-match sequences with an 8 -of- 11 -bp match or better were simultaneously disrupted by point mutations, the resulting ARS construct retained full replication function. Therefore, multiple copies of a sequence closely related to the core consensus element are not required for H 4 <b>ARS</b> <b>function...</b>|$|E
40|$|As locally {{converted}} estrogen from testicular testosterone {{contributes to}} apparent androgen activity, the physiological significance of androgen receptor (<b>AR)</b> <b>function</b> in the beneficial effects of androgens on skeletal tissues has remained unclear. We show here that inactivation of AR in mice using a Cre-loxP system-mediated gene-targeting technique caused bone loss in males {{but not in}} females. Histomorphometric analyses of 8 -week-old male AR knockout (ARKO) mice showed high bone turnover with increased bone resorption that resulted in reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass without affecting bone shape. Bone loss in orchidectomized male ARKO mice was only partially prevented by treatment with aromatizable testosterone. Analysis of primary osteoblasts and osteoclasts from ARKO mice revealed that <b>AR</b> <b>function</b> was required for the suppressive effects of androgens on osteoclastogenesis supporting activity of osteoblasts but not on osteoclasts. Furthermore, expression of the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) gene, which encodes a major osteoclastogenesis inducer, {{was found to be}} up-regulated in osteoblasts from AR-deficient mice.

We then used these clones to assess the reliability of the S. cerevisiae assay for detecting ARS elements in heterologous DNA.

40|$|Several {{members of}} a {{repetitive}} DNA family in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans {{have been shown to}} express ARS and centromeric function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The repetitive family, denoted CeRep 3, consists of dispersed repeated elements about 1 kilobase in length, present 50 to 100 times in the nematode genome. Three elements were sequenced and found to contain DNA sequences homologous to yeast ARS and CEN consensus sequences. Nematode DNA segments containing these repeats were tested for ARS and CEN (or SEG) function after ligation to shuttle vectors and introduction into yeast cells. Such nematode segments conferred <b>ARS</b> <b>function</b> to the plasmid, as judged by an increased frequency of transformation compared with control plasmids without <b>ARS</b> <b>function.</b> Some, but not all, also conferred to the plasmid increased mitotic stability, increased frequency of 2 +: 2 - segregation in meiosis, and decreased plasmid copy number.

40|$|Transcription {{directed}} into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) causes high-frequency loss of minichromosomes. Conditionally stable artificial yeast chromosomes {{were constructed}} that contain an inducible GAL promoter upstream of ARS 1. Under growth {{conditions in which}} the promoter was inactive, these chromosomes were mitotically stable; however, when the GAL promoter was induced, the chromosomes became extremely unstable {{as a result of}} transcriptional impairment of <b>ARS</b> <b>function.</b> This interference by the GAL promoter occurred only in cis but can occur from either side of ARS 1. Transcriptional interference of <b>ARS</b> <b>function</b> can be monitored readily by using a visual colony-color assay (P. Hieter, C. Mann, M. Snyder, and R. W. Davis, Cell 40 : 381 - 392, 1985), which was further developed as a sensitive in vivo assay for sequences which rescue ARS from transcription. DNA fragments from the 3 ' ends of genes, inserted downstream of the GAL promoter, protected <b>ARS</b> <b>function</b> from transcriptional interference. This assay is expected to be independent of both RNA transcript stability and processing. Philippsen et al. have shown that transcription into a yeast centromere inhibits CEN function in vivo (L. Panzeri, I. Groth-Clausen, J. Shepard, A. Stotz, and P. Philippsen, Chromosomes Today 8 : 46 - 58, 1984). We identified two 200 - to 300 -base-pair DNA fragments flanking CEN 4 that rescued ARS 1 from transcription. Both of these fragments protected ARS from transcription when inserted in either orientation. The 3 ' ends of stable transcripts are encoded by fragments that protected the ARS from transcription, suggesting that the protection was achieved by transcription termination. It is suggested that protection of elements important for the replication and segregation of eucaryotic chromosomes from transcription is necessary for their proper function in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{promotion}} and progression {{of prostate cancer}} (PCa) are associated with androgen receptor (<b>AR)</b> signalling. <b>AR</b> <b>functions</b> are modulated {{by a variety of}} co-factors amongst which we identified the nucleophosmin (NPM/B 23), a member of the histone chaperone family. Here, we show that NPM is overexpressed in PCa compared to normal adjacent tissues. AR and NPM interact in vitro and in vivo, and NPM is critical for androgen-dependent transcriptional activation in LNCaP cells as an anti-NPM siRNA downregulates transcription of a transfected androgen response element (ARE) -containing reporter promoter as well as expression of the endogenous androgen responsive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene. By investigating the effect of NPM on AR, we have also observed that NPM enhances AR binding to an ARE in vitro in electrophoretic gel mobility-shift assay experiments. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies further demonstrated that both AR and NPM associate with AREs of the PSA gene in vivo. Altogether, our data suggest that the molecular histone chaperone NPM could regulate <b>AR</b> <b>functions</b> by promoting assembly of AR-containing regulatory complexes and that high levels of NPM might alter <b>AR</b> <b>functions</b> in PCa.

Under normal circumstances, asthmatic airway obstruction improves spontaneously or characteristically briskly in response to inhaled beta(2) -adrenergic receptor (beta(2) AR) agonists. During virus-associated exacerbations, an impaired response to beta(2) AR agonists is observed; {{the reason for this}} is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of RV infection on airway smooth muscle beta(2) <b>AR</b> <b>function.</b> The human cell line Beas- 2 B and primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were infected with RV (multiplicity of infection = 1). After 1 or 5 days for primary and Beas- 2 B cells, respectively, cell culture supernatants were harvested, UV-irradiated to inactivate RV, and applied to human airway smooth muscle cells for 3 days to assess modifications of beta(2) <b>AR</b> <b>function.</b> RV conditioned medium from Beas- 2 B and HBECs decreased beta(2) AR agonist-induced cAMP by 50 and 65 %, respectively (n = 5; P < 0. 05). When cAMP was induced independently of the beta(2) AR using forskolin, no impairment was found. Using flow cytometry, we demonstrated that this decrease was likely the result of beta(2) AR desensitization because membrane but not total cell receptor beta(2) AR was decreased. Pretreatment of HBECs and Beas- 2 B cells but not human airway smooth muscle cells with the corticosteroids dexamethasone or fluticasone abolished virus-mediated beta(2) <b>AR</b> loss of <b>function.</b> This study shows that epithelial infection with RV induces a decrease of beta(2) <b>AR</b> <b>function</b> on airway smooth muscle cells, potentially explaining the clinical observation of loss of beta(2) <b>AR</b> agonist <b>function</b> during RV-induced asthma exacerbations...|$|R

The contribution of each position within this sequence to ARS activity was tested by creating all possible single-base mutations within the core consensus sequence of ARS 307 (formerly called the C 2 G 1 ARS) and testing their effects on high-frequency transformation and on plasmid stability. Of the 33 mutations, 22 abolished <b>ARS</b> <b>function</b> as measured by high-frequency transformation, 7 caused more than twofold reductions in plasmid stability, and 4 {{had no effect on}} plasmid stability. Mutations that reduced or abolished ARS activity occurred at each position in the consensus sequence, demonstrating that each position of this sequence contributes to <b>ARS</b> <b>function.</b> Of the four mutations that had no effect on ARS activity, three created alternative perfect matches to the core consensus sequence, demonstrating that the alternate bases allowed by the consensus sequence are, indeed, interchangeable. In addition, a change from T to C at position 6 did not perturb wild-type efficiency. To test whether the essential region extends beyond the 11 -base-pair consensus sequence, the effects on plasmid stability of point mutations one base 3 ' to the T-rich strand of the core consensus sequence (position 12) and deletion mutations that altered bases 5 ' to the T-rich strand of the core consensus sequence were examined.

Here we describe transgelin {{as the first}} ARA 54 -associated negative modulator for AR. Transgelin suppressed ARA 54 -enhanced <b>AR</b> <b>function</b> in ARA 54 -positive, but not in ARA 54 -negative, cells. Transgelin suppressed AR transactivation via interruption of ARA 54 homodimerization and AR-ARA 54 heterodimerization, resulting in the cytoplasmic retention of AR and ARA 54. Stable transfection of transgelin in LNCaP cells suppressed AR-mediated cell growth and prostate-specific antigen expression, whereas this suppressive effect was abolished {{by the addition of}} ARA 54 -small interfering RNA. Results from tissue surveys showing decreased expression of transgelin in prostate cancer specimens further strengthened the suppressor role of transgelin. Our findings reveal the novel mechanisms of how transgelin functions as a suppressor to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth.

In the present investigation, we demonstrate that cyclin D 3 and the 58 -kDa isoform of cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK 11 p 58) repressed AR transcriptional activity as measured by reporter assays of transformed cells and prostate-specific antigen expression in PCa cells. AR, cyclin D 3, and CDK 11 p 58 formed a ternary complex in cells and were colocalized in the luminal epithelial layer of the prostate. AR activity is controlled by phosphorylation at specific sites. We found that AR was phosphorylated at Ser- 308 by cyclin D 3 /CDK 11 p 58 in vitro and in vivo, leading to the repressed activity of AR transcriptional activation unit 1 (TAU 1). Furthermore, androgen-dependent proliferation of PCa cells was inhibited by cyclin D 3 /CDK 11 p 58 through AR repression.

The results demonstrated that deletion of the natural bending locus impaired ARS activity which was restored to a near wild-type level with synthetic bent DNA.

Despite the dependence of PCa on AR activity throughout the course of disease, delineation of the AR-dependent transcriptional network that governs disease progression remains elusive, and the <b>function</b> of <b>AR</b> in mitotically active cells is not well understood. Analyzing AR activity as a function of cell cycle revealed an unexpected and highly expanded repertoire of AR-regulated gene networks in actively cycling cells.

The core consensus sequence, A/TTTTATPuTTTA/T, is conserved at all ARSs sequenced to date. A fragment containing only element A and 8 flanking nucleotides enables autonomous replication of centromeric plasmids.

We have purified this protein to homogeneity using conventional and oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. The protein has an apparent molecular weight of 135 kDa and is present at about 700 molecules per diploid cell, based on the yield of purified protein and in situ antibody staining. DNaseI footprinting reveals that ABF-I binds sequence-specifically to an approximately 24 bp sequence that overlaps element Bat ARSl. This same protein binds to and protects a similar size region at the HMR-E ARS. We also find evidence for another ARS binding protein, ABF-III, based on DN asei footprint analysis and gel retardation assays. The protein protects approximately 22 bp adjacent to the ABF-I site. There {{appears to be no}} interaction between ABF-I and ABF-III despite the proximity of their binding sites. To address the function of ABF-I in DNA replication, we have cloned the ABF-I gene using rabbit polyclonal anti-sera and murine monoclonal antibodies against ABF-I to screen a λgt 11 expression library. Four EcoRI restriction fragments were isolated which encoded proteins that were recognized by both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. A gene disruption can now be constructed to determine the in vivo function of ABF-I. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nuclei {{isolated}} from eukaryotic cells can be depleted of histones and most soluble nuclear proteins to isolate a structural framework called the nuclear scaffold. This structure maintains specific interactions with genomic DNA at sites known as scaffold attached regions (SARs), which {{are thought to}} be the bases of DNA loops. In both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, genomic ARS elements are recovered as SARs. In addition, SARs from Drosophila melanogaster bind to yeast nuclear scaffolds in vitro and a subclass of these promotes autonomous replication of plasmids in yeast. In the present report, we present fine mapping studies of the Drosophila ftz SAR, which has both SAR and ARS activities in yeast. The data establish a close relationship between the sequences involved in ARS activity and scaffold binding: ARS elements that can bind the nuclear scaffold in vitro promote more efficient plasmid replication in vivo, but scaffold association is not a strict prerequisite for <b>ARS</b> <b>function.</b> Efficient interaction with nuclear scaffolds from both yeast and Drosophila requires a minimal length of SAR DNA that contains reiteration of a narrow minor groove structure of the double helix...|$|E
40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR), a nuclear transcription factor, mediates male sexual differentiation, and its excessive action {{is associated with}} prostate cancer. We have characterized a negative regulatory domain in the AR hinge region, which interacted with filamin A (FLNa), an actin-binding cytoskeletal protein. FLNa interfered with AR interdomain interactions and competed with the coactivator transcriptional intermediary factor 2 to specifically down-regulate <b>AR</b> <b>function.</b> Although full-length FLNa was predominantly cytoplasmic, a C-terminal 100 -kDa fragment of FLNa colocalized with AR to the nucleus. This naturally occurring FLNa fragment repressed AR transactivation and disrupted AR interdomain interactions and transcriptional intermediary factor 2 -activated <b>AR</b> <b>function</b> in a manner reminiscent of full-length FLNa, raising {{the possibility that the}} inhibitory effects of cytoplasmic FLNa may be transduced through this fragment, which can localize to the nucleus and form part of the pre-initiation complex. This unanticipated role of FLNa adds to the growing evidence for the involvement of cytoskeletal proteins in transcription regulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExpansion of a polyglutamine-encoding trinucleotide CAG repeat in the {{androgen}} receptor (AR) {{to more than}} 37 repeats {{is responsible for the}} X-linked neuromuscular disease spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Here we evaluated the effect of polyglutamine length on <b>AR</b> <b>function</b> in Xenopus oocytes. This allowed us to correlate the nuclear AR concentration to its capacity for specific DNA binding and transcription activation in vivo. AR variants with polyglutamine tracts containing either 25 or 64 residues were expressed in Xenopus oocytes by cytoplasmic injection of the corresponding mRNAs. The intranuclear AR concentration was monitored in isolated nuclei and related to specific DNA binding as well as transcriptional induction from the hormone response element in the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. The expanded AR with 64 glutamines had increased capacity for specific DNA binding and a reduced capacity for transcriptional induction as related to its DNA binding activity. The possible mechanism behind these polyglutamine-induced alterations in <b>AR</b> <b>function</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|SummarySpinobulbar {{muscular atrophy}} (SBMA) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). This mutation confers toxic <b>function</b> to <b>AR</b> through unknown mechanisms. Mutant AR toxicity requires binding of its hormone ligand, suggesting that pathogenesis involves ligand-induced changes in AR. However, whether toxicity is mediated by native <b>AR</b> <b>function</b> or a novel <b>AR</b> <b>function</b> is unknown. We systematically investigated events downstream of ligand-dependent AR activation in a Drosophila model of SBMA. We show that nuclear translocation of AR is necessary, but not sufficient, for toxicity and that DNA binding by AR is necessary for toxicity. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that a functional AF- 2 domain is essential for toxicity, a finding corroborated by a genetic screen that identified AF- 2 interactors as dominant modifiers of degeneration. These findings indicate that SBMA pathogenesis is mediated by misappropriation of native protein function, a mechanism that may apply broadly to polyglutamine diseases...|$|R
