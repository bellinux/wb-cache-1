40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in linear optics quantum computing is to find the origin of its computational complexity. We claim in this work that the majorization of photon distributions is a crucial factor that affects the complexity of linear optics. Our analysis concentrates on the boson sampling problem, an exemplary model of linear optics. Prior to the main discussion, <b>a</b> majorization-dependent <b>quantity</b> that can measure the quantum complexity of identical particle distributions is introduced, which we call the Boltzmann entropy of elementary quantum complexity S_B^q. It decreases as the majorization of the photon distribution vector increases. Using the properties of majorization and S_B^q, we analyze two quantities that are the criteria for the computational complexity, <b>T</b> (the runtime <b>of</b> a generalized classical algorithm for calculating the permanent) and E (the additive error bound for an approximated permanent estimator). The runtime T becomes shorter as the input and output distribution vectors are more majorized, and the error bound E decreases as the majorization difference of input and output states increases. In addition, S_B^q turns out to be <b>an</b> underlying <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> and E, which implies that S_B^q is an essential resource of the computational complexity of linear optics. We expect our findings would provide a fresh perspective to answer the fundamental questions of quantum supremacy. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Neurons in {{the spinal}} cord do not spontaneously regenerate, which often leads to {{debilitating}} injuries. One method proposed to promote axonal regeneration is the injection of viruses carrying genes for growth factors into the injured spinal cord. One such virus, the adeno-associated virus (AAV), has shown promise in gene therapy medical research. However, injecting AAV into rhesus macaques with C 7 spinal cord hemisection lesions actually leads to motor neuron loss in the gray matter of {{the spinal cord}}, rather than contributing to the preservation or regeneration of axons. This unexpected result highlights the necessity of further testing with therapeutic approaches for axon regeneration in nonhuman primate models before moving into clinical trials. It is possible that an immune-related T cell response to the AAV-transfected cells causes this motor neuron loss. T cells are white blood cells that {{play a role in}} attacking cells infected with viruses. It is unknown whether such a response of the immune system to respond with an up-regulation <b>of</b> <b>T</b> cells may be taking place over a relatively short period (weeks) or over many months. This question was tested here: T cells were stained in spinal cord sections caudal (below) the lesion in the spinal cord and near AAV injection sites to determine whether there was <b>a</b> greater <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> cells in these areas compared to the subject’s baseline levels. Subjects that had AAV therapeutic injections and that were examined 6 months after the injection were found to have greater <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> cells {{than those who did not}} have injections containing AAV. It was also found that the AAV-injected subjects examined only 6 weeks post injection did not have greater <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> cells than control subjects. These results suggest that there may be a delayed immune response to the AAV injections in nonhuman primates with spinal cord injury, which occurs over a period of months. Pinpointing the mechanism that causes this cell death would allow researchers to create a safer therapeutic that could promote axonal growth in people with spinal cord injuries...|$|R
40|$|Polyetheral {{additives}} {{were found}} to be efficient promoters to enhance the rate of H 2 -release from ammonia borane (AB) at various temperatures. In particular, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (T 4 EGDE, 29 wt% relative to AB + T 4 EGDE) exhibited significantly improved activities for AB dehydrogenation, with the material-based hydrogen storage capacity of 10. 3 wt% at 125 °C within 40 min. In situ FT-IR spectroscopy indicated the formation of B-(cyclodiborazanyl) amino-borohydride (BCDB), borazine, and μ-aminodiborane as gaseous byproducts. In addition, 11 B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy further revealed that diammoniate of diborane (DADB) was initially formed to give polyaminoborane as liquid and/or solid spent-fuel, consistent with previous reports. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggested that hydrogen bonding interactions between AB and a polyetheral promoter initially {{played an important role in}} increasing the reactivity of B–H bonds of AB by transferring electron density from oxygen atoms of the promoter into B–H bonds of AB. These partially activated, hydridic B–H bonds were proposed to help promote the formation of diammoniate of diborane (DADB), which is considered as a reactive intermediate, eventually enhancing the rate of H 2 -release from AB. In addition, our in situ solid state 11 B magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements further confirmed that the rate of DADB formation from AB with <b>a</b> small <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>T</b> 4 EGDE was found to be much faster than that of pristine AB even at 50 °C. This metal-free method for H 2 -release from AB with <b>an</b> added, small <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> polyethers would be helpful to develop feasible hydrogen storage systems for long-term fuel cell applications...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a mathematical model for the regulation of the growth <b>of</b> autoreactive <b>T</b> cells (the T cells responsible for autoimmunity). The model is very simple {{in that it is}} based only on the fundamental properties <b>of</b> <b>T</b> cells. However, despite this simplicity, it can account for a variety of phenomena referred to as T-cell vaccination. The purpose of T-cell vaccination is to create resistance to autoimmunity. This can be achieved by injecting either <b>a</b> subpathogenic <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> autoreactive <b>T</b> cells, or attenuated autoreactive cells, or cells that recognize the autoreactive cells. The results of our model are {{based on the assumption that}} the self antigens involved in T-cell vaccination are normally not expressed; thus the autoreactive T lymphocytes are neither activated nor negatively selected. Self tolerance, therefore, corresponds to a 'passive' state. T-cell vaccination induces a transition from this passive state of tolerance to an active state of tolerance. In this state the autoreactive cells are controlled by regulator cells which recognize the autoreactive cells. The model predicts a qualitative difference between vaccination with normal autoreactive cells and vaccination with attenuated autoreactive cells. Normal cells may give rise to a permanent switch to the vaccinated state; attenuated cells, however, can provide only transient protection, which is dose dependent. Preliminary experimental data confirm this prediction. Finally, we propose a speculative explanation for relapsing autoimmune disease...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae (Medical Bioscience) - MSc(MBS) The {{blood brain barrier}} (BBB) is a {{signaling}} {{interface between}} the blood and {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), which prohibits the entry of harmful blood-borne substances into the brain micro-environment, thus maintaining brain homeostasis. The crucial role of the BBB is protecting the CNS, which may adversely be affected by alcohol. The central component of the BBB, endothelial cells (ECs), regulates BBB transport by regulating the permeability both transcellularly and through their paracellular junctions, by structures called tight junctions (TJs) that are composed of proteins. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the in vitro effects of ethanol (EtOH) and fermented rooibos (Rf) on a monolayer of bEnd 5 mouse brain ECs, by determining the effects of EtOH and Rf on bEnd 5 (i) cell viability (ii) cell proliferation (iii) rate of cell division (iv) cell toxicity (v) claudin- 5 transcription (vi) permeability across a monolayer of bEnd 5 ECs and (vii) morphology, for a selected experimental timeline of 24, 48, 72, and 96 hrs. We then investigated if the simultaneous exposure of Rf and EtOH could reverse or alleviate the EtOHinduced effects on the bEnd 5 ECs. EtOH metabolism induces oxidative stress and results in a range of adverse physiological effects. Aspathalus linearis (rooibos) contains many phenolic compounds, of which the main antioxidant activity is attributed to aspalathin. Our underlining hypothesis is that the antioxidants in an aqueous rooibos extract may therefore protect against the potential oxidant damaging effects of alcohol on the BBB. Cells were exposed for 24 hrs to selected concentrations of EtOH (25 mM and 100 mM), a concentration of Rf containing equivalent of 1. 9 nM aspalathin, and the combinations of EtOH and Rf. Cell viability and cell toxicity was determined, while cell proliferation and rate of cell division was estimated using the trypan blue exclusion assay. Real time quantitative PCR was implemented to quantify claudin- 5 transcription, normalized against housekeeping genes, GAPDH and HPRT. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured using the Ohm Millicell-electrical resistance system, while bEnd 5 monolayer morphology was analysed using the Zeiss scanning electron microscope. Both concentrations of EtOH led to an overall decrease in cell viability, and a decreased number of live cells across 72 hrs. Consistent with this, EtOH resulted in increased cell toxicity across the 96 hr experimental timeframe and a diminished rate of cell division. The transcription of claudin- 5 in bEnd 5 ECs exposed to 25 mM and 100 mM EtOH varied dramatically across the 96 hr timeframe. While 25 mM EtOH resulted in an overall decrease in TEER, cells exposed to 100 mM EtOH only decreased TEER between 48 and 96 hrs. Morphologically, both concentrations of EtOH led to compromised paracellular spaces as endorsed by high definition SEM analysis. The administration of Rf on its own resulted in an initial decrease in viability, followed by recovery between 72 and 96 hrs. Exposure to Rf diminished live cell numbers at 72 and 96 hrs, accompanied by a compromised rate of cell division and an overall increase in cell toxicity. In addition, Rf down-regulated claudin- 5 transcription across the course of the experiment, particularly between 24 and 48 hrs. In alignment with this, Rf also led to an increase in BBB permeability from 24 to 96 hrs. However, SEM studies were not able to discriminate any differences between control and Rf treated cells. Our study showed that the BBB could be protected against the adverse effects of EtOH, and this at the plasma concentration induced by 500 ml’s of Rooibos tea. The simultaneous exposure of Rf and EtOH was able to negate the effects of EtOH on cell viability, cell proliferation, and cell toxicity but exacerbated the effects of EtOH on claudin- 5 transcription and paracellular permeability. Morphologically, co-exposure with Rf only reversed the effects of 25 mM EtOH while exacerbating the effects of 100 mM EtOH at 96 hrs. In conclusion, EtOH was shown to be detrimental to the integrity of bEnd 5 ECs, and the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minuscule <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>t</b> h e Rf extract was able to partially alleviate excess ROS-induced effects.
