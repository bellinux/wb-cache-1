500|$|Sawyer and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) {{were the}} least-liked {{characters}} by viewers {{during the first}} few episodes, because, according to Lindelof, [...] "they were just really obnoxious, bad guys". In later episodes, however, Sawyer and Jin changed to be more likable. Towards the beginning of [...] "Confidence Man", Sawyer is seen reading the novel Watership Down by Richard Adams (this is the book that caused Boone to think that Sawyer took Shannon's inhaler). The novel has numerous similarities to Lost, including [...] "letting go", and building a society. Furthermore, the protagonists of Watership Down are rabbits – a recurring motif in Lost. The episode ends with a montage of various characters performing different activities, featuring the song [...] "I Shall Not Walk Alone", written by Ben Harper and performed by The Blind Boys of Alabama. One lyric from the song is, [...] "I just reach for mother Mary"; Sawyer's mother's name is Mary, and, according to reviewer Therese Odell from the Houston Chronicle, the lyric may be alluding to this. Also, percussionist Ryan McKinnie of The Blind Boys of Alabama said of many members of the group's blindness, [...] "Our disability doesn’t have to be a handicap. It's not about what you can't do. It's <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> And what we do is sing good gospel music." [...] This quotation is very similar to the oft-repeated quotation by many characters (especially Locke), [...] "Don't tell me what I can't do." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Moslem courtier retired {{somewhat}} disconcerted by this Catholic but {{not very}} courteous reply, and reported it to a renegado of Antiquera. The latter, eager, like all renegados, to show devotion to his newly-adopted creed, volunteered to return with the courtier and have a tilt of words with the testy diplomatist. They found Don Juan playing a game of chess with the alcayde of the Alhambra, and took occasion to indulge in sportive comments {{on some of the}} mysteries of the Christian religion. The ire of this devout knight and discreet ambassador began to kindle, but he restrained it within the limits of lofty gravity. [...] "You would do well," [...] said he, [...] "to cease talking <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not understand." [...] This only provoked light attacks of the witlings, until one of them dared to make some degrading and obscene comparison between the Blessed Virgin and Amina, the mother of Mahomet. In an instant Don Juan sprang to his feet, dashed chess-board and chess-men aside, and, drawing his sword, dealt, says the curate of los Palacios, such a [...] "fermosa cuchillada" [...] (such a handsome slash) across the head of the blaspheming Moor as felled him to the earth. The renegado, seeing his comrade fall, fled for his life, making the halls and galleries ring with his outcries. Guards, pages, and attendants rushed in, but Don Juan kept them at bay until the appearance of the king restored order. On inquiring into the cause of the affray he acted with proper discrimination. Don Juan was held sacred as an ambassador, and the renegado was severely punished for having compromised the hospitality of the royal palace.|$|E

5000|$|Vedder about [...] "Given to Fly":imagined {{the song}} as a 20-page {{cardboard}} (children's) {{book with a}} line on each page and a picture to go with it. It's a fable, that's all.

5000|$|I {{think the}} notion of {{traditional}} anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore.

5000|$|Superfamilys second album, Warszawa was {{released}} on 21 May 2007. The recording of the album took six months.

5000|$|Armstrong, who {{has taught}} courses at Leo Baeck College, a rabbinical college and centre for Jewish {{education}} located in North London, says she has been particularly inspired by the Jewish tradition's emphasis on practice as well as faith: [...] "I say that religion isn't about believing things. It's <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> It's ethical alchemy. It's about behaving {{in a way that}} changes you, that gives you intimations of holiness and sacredness." [...] She maintains that religious fundamentalism is not just a response to, but is a product of contemporary culture and for this reason concludes that, [...] "We urgently need to make compassion a clear, luminous and dynamic force in our polarized world. Rooted in a principled determination to transcend selfishness, compassion can break down political, dogmatic, ideological and religious boundaries. Born of our deep interdependence, compassion is essential to human relationships and to a fulfilled humanity. It is the path to enlightenment, and indispensable {{to the creation of a}} just economy and a peaceful global community." ...|$|E
