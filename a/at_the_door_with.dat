5|$|The {{last of the}} Texians to die {{were the}} 11 men manning the two 12-pounder cannon in the chapel. A shot from the 18-pounder cannon {{destroyed}} the barricades {{at the front of}} the church, and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>With</b> no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. Had he succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and children hiding in the sacristy.|$|E
500|$|The book's launch {{party was}} held at Sala One-Nine, a tapas {{restaurant}} at 35 West 19th Street in Manhattan, which existed {{on the site of}} Slater's Magickal Childe store. The event was reported on by a journalist from The New York Times, Corey Kilgannon, who noted that there was a [...] "strapping man" [...] dressed in a headdress and loincloth working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>with</b> around 80 attendees inside, most of whom were Pagans. Among them included Bennie Geraci, Carol Bulzone, Kaye Flagg and Margot Adler, a number of whom gave speeches before a memorial service to Buczynski was held, in a ritual that Kilgannon thought resembled something from Stanley Kubrick's film Eyes Wide Shut.|$|E
2500|$|Cantrell is a {{recovering}} addict and alcoholic {{and has been}} sober since 2003. He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, [...] "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [...] was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> my brother, so my choices were {{open the door and}} go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush {{at the bottom of a}} cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." [...] Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, [...] "We really miss Layne [...] and Mike , and we carry them with us in our hearts".|$|E

2500|$|The embattled under-marshal {{would try}} hard to retain {{his power and}} after two months of being accused of the felonies, at last, on 16 December, he showed his poorly written [...] "answer" [...] spread on 9 pages of foolscap. The {{document}} is {{a record of the}} names of all those places mentioned above, where Hitchen met the thieves and organised crimes with them. It also gives the examples of social details, one of which explains how Lord Barnard's bills through a chain of accidents appeared in Hitchen's hands. If one did not tip the porter in the General Post Office, he would throw the letter out. Pickpockets, visiting the Office for their own purpose in the midnight, saw the other one <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> the bills inside. Seeing the boys with the papers on the one side of the tavern and a sad victim on the other, set Hitchen to assist him. Certainly, this rather comic justification with others added to his main reason of being maliciously persecuted by the robbers was not to blindfold the Court of Aldermen, who were reluctant to take decision against him anyway for the clear reasons discussed above. On the other hand, they could not utterly ignore the Lord Mayor's reminder to the committee, that marshal's behaviour humiliated the City and reflected other officers' behaviour under the Mayor. All they did, though, was rather cynical. After waiting for Hitchen's written defence, presented itself as late as 16 December, they did not read it until 16 January 1713. As for their decision on marshal's suspension, it came over five months late, that was 24 June 1713 and [...] "forbade him attendance on the Lord Mayor" [...] while retaining his power as a constable to obtain warrant when needed and apprehend.|$|E
