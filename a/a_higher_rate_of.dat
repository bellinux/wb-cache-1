5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of a machine gun.

While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used.

5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E
5|$|Bohlinia entered China and {{northern}} India {{in response to}} climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and, around 7mya, entered Africa. Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1mya in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G. jumae; others find G. gracilis a more likely candidate. G. jumae was larger and more heavily built while G. gracilis was smaller and more lightly built. The main driver {{for the evolution of}} the giraffes {{is believed to have been}} the changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8mya. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern {{and northern}} Africa and western India. Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.|$|E

5|$|Most polar {{molecules}} {{have low}} solubility in the hydrocarbon {{core of a}} lipid bilayer and, as a consequence, have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer. This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules. Anions typically have <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> diffusion through bilayers than cations. Compared to ions, water molecules actually have a relatively large permeability through the bilayer, as evidenced by osmotic swelling. When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able {{to pass through the}} bilayer with relative ease. The anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate. Small uncharged apolar molecules diffuse through lipid bilayers many orders of magnitude faster than ions or water. This applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether. Regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{reproductive}} {{policies were}} {{a significant factor}} behind their anti-tobacco campaign. Women who smoked {{were considered to be}} vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family. Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's Rassenpolitisches Amt (Office of Racial Politics) said that a smoking mother's breast milk contained nicotine, a claim that modern research has proven correct. , a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> stillbirths and miscarriages. This opinion was also supported by well-known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm, whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.|$|E
5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} {{is the amount of}} energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, energy loss via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> reaction than would otherwise take place. This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest binding energy per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by degeneracy pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is so dense that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
