40|$|Retrocopies {{have been}} shown {{to play a major role}} in the origin of novel genes in <b>animal</b> <b>genomes.</b> While their impact on the {{evolution}} of distinct genomes has been studied, comparisons of retrocopy occurrence, age, and distribution between genomes have yet to be completed large-scale. In order to assess the impact of retrocopies on inter-species events or generalize their trends in <b>animal</b> <b>genomes</b> on the whole, a standard methodology for identifying retrocopies needs to be established. Because previous methodologies are fine-tuned for specific genomes and rely heavily on existing annotation information, extensive and sensible retrocopy comparison between species is difficult. We present here an annotation-independent methodology for identifying retrogenes, retropseudogenes, and chimeric genes in any <b>animal</b> <b>genome,</b> and summarize some major difficulties in identifying retrocopies in a large-scale study...|$|R
40|$|Continuing {{advances}} in genome sequencing technologies and computational methods for comparative genomics currently allow inferring the evolutionary history of entire plant and <b>animal</b> <b>genomes.</b> Based on {{the comparison of}} the plant and <b>animal</b> <b>genome</b> paleohistory, major differences are unveiled in 1) evolutionary mechanisms (i. e., polyploidization versus diploidization processes), 2) genome conservation (i. e., coding versus noncoding sequence maintenance), and 3) modern genome architecture (i. e., genome organization including repeats expansion versus contraction phenomena). This article discusses how extant <b>animal</b> and plant <b>genomes</b> {{are the result of}} inherently different rates and modes of genome evolution resulting in relatively stable animal and much more dynamic and plastic plant genomes...|$|R

Applications such as xenotransplantation, increased livestock productivity, bioengineering new materials, products and even fabrics are several reasons for thriving farm <b>animal</b> <b>genome</b> activity. Currently mined in rapidly growing data warehouses, completed genomes of chicken, fish and cows are available but are largely stored in decentralized data repositories. In this paper, we provide an informatics primer on farm <b>animal</b> bioinformatics and <b>genome</b> project resources which drive attention {{to the most recent}} advances in the field.

40|$|In eukaryotes, the {{transcription}} of tRNA genes is {{initiated by the}} concerted action of transcription factors IIIC (TFIIIC) and IIIB (TFIIIB) which direct the recruitment of polymerase III. While TFIIIC recognizes highly conserved, intragenic promoter elements, TFIIIB binds to the non-coding 5 ′-upstream regions of the tRNA genes. Using a systematic bioinformatic analysis of 11 multicellular eukaryotic genomes we identified a highly conserved TATA motif followed by a CAA-motif in the tRNA upstream regions of all plant genomes. Strikingly, the 5 ′-flanking tRNA regions of the <b>animal</b> <b>genomes</b> are highly heterogeneous and lack a common conserved sequence signature. Interestingly, in the <b>animal</b> <b>genomes</b> the tRNA species that read the same codon share conserved motifs in their upstream regions. Deep-sequencing analysis of 16 human tissues revealed multiple splicing variants {{of two of the}} TFIIIB subunits, Bdp 1 and Brf 1, with tissue-specific expression patterns. These multiple forms most likely modulate the TFIIIB–DNA interactions and explain the lack of a uniform signature motif in the tRNA upstream regions of <b>animal</b> <b>genomes.</b> The anticodon-dependent 5 ′-flanking motifs provide a possible mechanism for independent regulation of the tRNA transcription in various human tissues...|$|R
40|$|SelenoDB ([URL] aims {{to provide}} {{high-quality}} annotations of selenoprotein genes, proteins and SECIS elements. Selenoproteins are proteins that contain the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) {{and the first}} release of the database included annotations for eight species. Since the release of SelenoDB 1. 0 many new <b>animal</b> <b>genomes</b> have been sequenced. The annotations of selenoproteins in new genomes usually contain many errors in major databases. For this reason, we have now fully annotated selenoprotein genes in 58 <b>animal</b> <b>genomes.</b> We provide manually curated annotations for human selenoproteins, whereas we use an automatic annotation pipeline to annotate selenoprotein genes in other <b>animal</b> <b>genomes.</b> In addition, we annotate the homologous genes containing cysteine (Cys) instead of Sec. Finally, we have surveyed genetic variation in the annotated genes in humans. We use exon capture and resequencing approaches to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in more than 50 human populations around the world. We thus present a detailed view of the genetic divergence of Sec- and Cys-containing genes in animals and their diversity in humans. The addition of these data sets into the second release of the database provides a valuable resource for addressing medical and evolutionary questions in selenium biology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Comparative {{sequence}} analysis {{is an effective}} and increasingly common way to identify cis -regulatory regions in <b>animal</b> <b>genomes.</b> Results We describe three tools for comparative analysis of pairs of BAC-sized genomic regions. Paircomp is a tool that does windowed (ungapped) comparisons of two sequences and reports all matches above a set threshold. FamilyRelationsII is a graphical viewer for comparisons that enables interactive exploration of several different kinds of comparisons. Cartwheel is a Web site and compute-cluster management system used to execute and store comparisons for display by FamilyRelationsII. These tools are specialized for the discovery of cis -regulatory regions in <b>animal</b> <b>genomes.</b> All tools and their source code are freely available at [URL].

40|$|Eukaryotic <b>genomes,</b> {{particularly}} <b>animal</b> <b>genomes,</b> have a complex, nonuniform, and nonrandom internal compositional organization. The compositional {{organization of}} <b>animal</b> <b>genomes</b> {{can be described}} as a mosaic of discrete genomic regions, called "compositional domains," each with a distinct GC content that significantly differs from those of its upstream and downstream neighboring domains. A typical <b>animal</b> <b>genome</b> consists of a mixture of compositionally homogeneous and nonhomogeneous domains of varying lengths and nucleotide compositions that are interspersed with one another. We have devised IsoPlotter, an unbiased segmentation algorithm for inferring the compositional organization of genomes. IsoPlotter has become an indispensable tool for describing genomic composition and has been used in the analysis {{of more than a dozen}} genomes. Applications include describing new genomes, correlating domain composition with gene composition and their density, studying the evolution of genomes, testing phylogenomic hypotheses, and detect regions of potential interbreeding between human and extinct hominines. To extend the use of IsoPlotter, we designed a completely automated pipeline, called IsoPlotter(+) to carry out all segmentation analyses, including graphical display, and built a repository for compositional domain maps of all fully sequenced vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. The IsoPlotter(+) pipeline and repository offer a comprehensive solution to the study of genome compositional architecture. Here, we demonstrate IsoPlotter(+) by applying it to human and insect genomes. The computational tools and data repository are available online...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a new {{prominent}} class of gene regulatory factors that negatively regulate expression of approximately one-third of the genes in <b>animal</b> <b>genomes</b> at post-transcriptional level. However, it is still unclear why some genes are regulated by miRNAs but others are not, i. e. what principles govern miRNA regulation in <b>animal</b> <b>genomes.</b> In this study, we systematically analyzed the relationship between transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs in gene regulation. We found that the genes with more TF-binding sites {{have a higher probability}} of being targeted by miRNAs and have more miRNA-binding sites on average. This observation reveals that the genes with higher cis-regulation complexity are more coordinately regulated by TFs at the transcriptional level and by miRNAs at the post-transcriptional level. This is a potentially novel discovery of mechanism for coordinated regulation of gene expression. Gene ontology analysis further demonstrated that such coordinated regulation is more popular in the developmental genes. Comment: supplementary data available at [URL]...|$|R
