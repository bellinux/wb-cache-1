50|$|Two of {{the main}} types of smart antennas include {{switched}} beam smart antennas and <b>adaptive</b> <b>array</b> smart antennas. Switched beam systems have several available fixed beam patterns. A decision is made as to which beam to access, at any given point in time, based upon {{the requirements of the}} system.

Beamdirection can be estimated using the so-called direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>adaptive</b> antenna <b>arrays</b> {{in the presence}} of weak interfering signals (below thermal noise) is studied. It is shown that a conventional <b>adaptive</b> antenna <b>array</b> sample matrix inversion (SMI) algorithm is unable to suppress such interfering signals. To overcome this problem, the SMI algorithm is modified.

50|$|Smart antennas (also {{known as}} <b>adaptive</b> <b>array</b> antennas, digital antenna arrays, {{multiple}} antennas and, recently, MIMO) are antenna arrays with smart signal processing algorithms {{used to identify}} spatial signal signatures such as the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal, {{and use them to}} calculate beamforming vectors which are used to track and locate the antenna beam on the mobile/target.

50|$|L. C. van Atta {{was first}} to {{describe}} a retrodirective antenna, which redirects (rather than reflects) a signal back in the direction from which it came, in his 1959 patent. The signal can be modulated by the redirecting host for purposes such as radio-frequency identification and traffic control (radar target echo enhancement).The first <b>adaptive</b> <b>array,</b> the side-lobe canceller, was developed by Paul Howells and Sid Applebaum at General Electric in 1959 to suppress radar jamming signals. Building on Norbert Wiener’s work with analog filters, in 1960 Stanford University professor Bernard Widrow and PhD student Ted Hoff developed the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm that automatically adjusts an antenna’s directivity pattern to reinforce desired signals.Ted Compton at Ohio State University developed an adaptive antenna technique for recovering direct sequence spread spectrum signals {{in the presence of}} narrowband co-channel interference. Compton’s method, reported in 1974, only requires knowledge of the desired signal’s pseudorandom noise (PN) code—not its direction of arrival. In the late 1970s, Kesh Bakhru and Don Torrieri developed the maximin algorithm for recovering frequency hopping signals in the presence of narrowband co-channel interference.A 1977 paper by Bell Labs researchers Douglas O. Reudink and Yu S. Yeh described the advantages of scanning spot beams for satellites. The authors estimated that scanning spot beams could save 20 dB in link budget which in turn could be used to reduce transmit power, increase communication capacity, and decrease the size of earth-station antennas. Satellite spot beams are used today by direct broadcast satellite systems such as DirecTV and Dish Network.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} for an <b>adaptive</b> <b>array</b> that {{is suitable}} for a multi-carrier transmission will be proposed in this paper. In an <b>adaptive</b> <b>array,</b> signals received by antenna elements are weighted and combined together. In the proposed algorithm, distortion of a spectrum of the combined signal is detected and weight coefficients for each antenna element are controlled so that the spectrum of the combined signal becomes flat. Concept of the proposed algorithm {{can be interpreted as}} the CMA which is applied to signals sampled in the frequency domain. Furthermore, a configuration of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>array</b> will be shown. Signals separated in a receiver of the multi-carrier transmission are utilized to detect the distortion of the signal spectrum. By adopting the proposed configuration, the spectrum of the multi-carrier signal can be easily detected. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed <b>adaptive</b> <b>array,</b> computer simulation has been carried out. Numerical results show that; 1) A desired wave is captured well even if an interference wave is narrow band signal and is stronger than the desired wave. 2) Suppression performance for a co-channel interference wave depends on both a symbol timing and SIR of arrival waves. If the symbol timing of the interference wave greatly differs from the timing of FFT window of the receiver, the desired wave can be captured even if the co-channel interference wave is stronger more than 10 dB compared with the desired wave. The conventional CMA <b>adaptive</b> <b>array</b> has a serious problem that the narrow band interference wave is captured when it is stronger than the desired wave. On the other hand, it is extremely rare that the proposed <b>adaptive</b> <b>array</b> captures the narrow band interference wave. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} the proposed <b>adaptive</b> <b>array</b> is a robust system compared with the conventional system...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 87) In modern {{radar and}} communication systems, {{the presence of}} unwanted noise sources and jammers continually presents an obstacle to signal detection. A {{means by which the}} undesirable effects of jamming can be minimized is by the use of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>array.</b> An <b>adaptive</b> <b>array</b> is an antenna system which can readily alter its pattern characteristics according to some given criteria. This criteria should be such that the jamming effects are minimized without affecting the main beam of the antenna. A basic understanding of phased array antenna theory is needed and is, therefore, presented. The theory of adaptive arrays is then presented thus providing an insight into the choice of criteria that should be used to form the governing algorithm. The <b>adaptive</b> <b>array</b> is a closed loop converging system. The various algorithms presented will illustrate this concept. The viability of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>array</b> in a jamming environment is analyzed with respect to its ability to improve the signal-to-jammer ratio...|$|E
