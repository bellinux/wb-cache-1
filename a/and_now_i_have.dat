500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{a little bit of a}} launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 2006, Tom Vilsack {{became the}} second Democrat (after Mike Gravel) to officially {{announce}} intentions {{to run for}} the presidency in the 2008 election. In his announcement speech, he said [...] "America's a great country, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity to begin the process, the legal process of filing papers to run for President of the United States." [...] Vilsack dropped out of the race on February 23, 2007 citing monetary constraints.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the week}} {{following}} the race, Jones gave his {{view on the}} circumstances surrounding the race and whether championship points should be awarded, writing in Motor magazine [...] "My job is to drive racing cars, not to get involved in politics. As far as I'm concerned, the Spanish GP was no different from normal: it required the same amount of effort, it covered the same distance and I gave it the same dedication that I give to any other Grand Prix. These things would have been the same whether I'd won or lost. As it happened, I won the race, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to wait and see if I'll be given the points." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll go as escort. The {{doctor has}} been wanting {{me to leave}} for a week, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ve</b> no desire to stay," [...] he said eagerly.|$|R
60|$|And {{this man}} was Romayne! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> last met with him among his {{delightful}} works of art; an enthusiast in literature; the hospitable master of a house filled with comforts and luxuries to its remotest corner. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen what Rome had made of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can imagine}} with what eagerness I listened to him, Watson, {{for the very}} chance for which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been panting during all those months of {{inaction}} seemed to have come within my reach. In my inmost heart I believed that I could succeed where others failed, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity to test myself.|$|R
2500|$|After the Boxer Campaign, {{the couple}} had at first {{exchanged}} letters, which Beatty signed 'Jack', as Ethel was still a married woman and discretion was advised. Ethel became involved with another man and the exchange of letters ceased but on Beatty's return she sent him a telegram and letter inviting him to resume their friendship. Beatty did not respond until after surgery on his arm in September 1900 when he wrote, [...] "I landed from China with my heart full of rage, and swore I did not care if I ever saw you again, or if I were killed or not. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> arrived with the firm determination not to see you at all in my own mind... Unfortunately I shall go on loving you to the bitter end... To me always a Queen, if not always mine, Good-bye." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{dispute between}} Geldof and Hutchence family members over Tiger continued. Geldof legally adopted Tiger, against {{the wishes of}} Patricia and Tina, who {{disagreed}} with Geldof changing her surname to Hutchence-Geldof. In July 2009, Patricia protested that Geldof had prevented access to her granddaughter for three years, [...] "It's totally cruel and unnecessary. I've lost my husband <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a granddaughter who doesn't even know her beloved Grandpa Ross [...] has died. We have been completely cut {{out of her life}} by Bob Geldof." [...] Patricia requested a visit with Tiger from Geldof for what would have been Hutchence's 50th birthday (22 January 2010) and indicated that she accepted her son's death as being a suicide. Patricia died on 21 September 2010; Tiger was not in attendance at her grandmother's funeral due to Geldof's fear of the attention that would be generated. Her uncle Rhett indicated that Geldof had sent condolences, that he had spoken to Tiger and agreed it was advisable to keep the 14-year-old out of the media.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on April 8, 2009 Khan would {{move up to}} the light welterweight division to fight Andreas Kotelnik (31-2-1, 13 KOs) at the MEN Arena in Manchester for the WBA light welterweight title on 18 July. Khan Said, [...] "This is the best news that I could have received. To fight for the world title in only my 22nd fight and at the age of just 22 is fantastic. Frank has done a great job getting the world title fight for me in Britain <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to go out win it." [...] This would be Kotelnik's fourth title defense. Khan won by a unanimous decision, 120–108, 118–111, 118–111, in front of 10,000, and became the third-youngest Brit to win a world title, at the age of 22. Khan's lightning hand speed and fitness gave him the advantages to go well ahead on points in the first ten rounds. Kotelnik rallied in the closing rounds but could not land a decisive punch on Khan, Kotelnik throwing everything he had in the final two stanzas. After the fight, Khan said, [...] "It's the best feeling ever. I want to thank Freddie Roach and my team for making this happen. I'm a world champion and I'm going to enjoy it. I'm still young and I've got big things to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{let us see}} if {{you will}} give the same account to-morrow; I shall ask you {{whenever}} I see you particularly amiable. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> kept you out quite late enough." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was good}} to have a rest--and peace. But nothing is quite perfect in this life, at any time. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made a pipe a while back, and also some pretty fair tobacco; not the real thing, but what some of the Indians use: the inside bark of the willow, dried. These comforts had been in the helmet, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> them again, but no matches.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> awakened, {{without any}} {{assignable}} cause, hours before my usual time. I tried to compose myself to sleep again. The effort was useless. Such a restlessness possessed me that I {{was not even}} able to lie still in the bed. My husband was sleeping soundly by my side. In the fear of disturbing him I rose, and put on my dressing-gown and slippers.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{done with}} the {{privileges}} when I have removed one objection.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{done with}} the subject in the present letter, and have little left to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went on to}} {{the village}} after leaving your garden; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come back again: that's all. Which way are you walking, may I ask?" ...|$|E
60|$|I lived {{two years}} in this dismal condition, wasting that little <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> weeping {{continually}} over my dismal circumstances, and, as it were, only bleeding to death, without the least hope or prospect of help from God or man; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> cried too long, and so often, that tears were, as I might say, exhausted, and I began to be desperate, for I grew poor apace.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{speaking}} of the captain's old clothes, I may as well speak of mine.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in New York {{ever since}} Christmas, you know, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> to work like sin {{to catch up}} my correspondence.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> only {{myself to}} speak of, {{and in that}} I shall be {{exceedingly}} brief. My happiness is far too great to speak of--too perfect to describe.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lawyer, sir, {{will do as}} I bid him, {{and will}} require no {{suggestion}} from you. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> another matter to treat of. Mr. Bertram, where is Lady Harcourt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have killed}} two cows which I {{tried to keep}} here, and one young horse--a foal you call him, I think; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no cattle remaining, they are so bad." ...|$|E
60|$|When I heard how she {{was using}} old Van Hunker's wealth--in {{providing}} for our poor loyal folk, and especially for the clergy, pensioning some, hospitably receiving others in her own house, and seeking employment for others--I had to repent of all the scorn with which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> looked on Millicent Wardour as a poor fickle creature, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to own that my brother's love had been as nearly worthy of him as any creature could be.|$|R
60|$|Old John Fenwick was {{not much}} better pleased about Mark and me than Father was, though he didn't go {{to the length of}} forbidding it; he just acted grumpily and disagreeably. Things were {{unpleasant}} enough all round without a quarrel between Mark and me; yet quarrel we did--and over next to nothing, too, you understand. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to set out for Prince Edward Island without even seeing him, for he was away in Toronto on business.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] said Andre. [...] "Yet I {{think it}} {{very likely that}} <b>I</b> shall. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better see Rougane again at once, and obtain from him the other two permits required. Then perhaps it will be best that I take them to Paris myself, in the morning. If you will give me a bed, monsieur, I shall be grateful. I... I confess that I am hardly in case to do more to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My own fault. Yes;--I don't doubt that. I {{know it was}} my own fault, my dear, to {{have had}} {{anything}} to do with it. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got to pay for it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not fear, Suzanne. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{heard what}} you had to say, and I claim your promise. If it be your will I will kiss you, Suzanne, but not in farewell." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{mentioned}} watermen, give {{me leave}} to complain of the insolences and exactions they daily commit {{on the river}} Thames, and in particular this one instance, which cries aloud for justice.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all right}} then, my little Venus. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some dinner I'd {{sit down and}} make myself {{comfortable}} for the evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It sounds obvious, but {{the very}} {{intensity}} of love makes love soft <b>and</b> blind. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> another, which <b>I</b> am convinced {{that you will not}} agree with.' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} no time to give way. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> (by God's single mercy) got myself alive out of that fortress; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to try to get the}} others, my comrades. There was about a fathom of rope to spare; I got it by the end, and searched the whole ground {{thoroughly}} for anything to make it fast to. In vain: the ground was broken and stony, but there grew not there so much as a bush of furze.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, once I had six sons, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> only one. It is you, whom I {{called a}} fool, {{who have given}} me the dates: as for the others, I want none of them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have loved}} them so all my life," [...] she sobbed; [...] "the pictures, and the house, and the gardens, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to go away! I don't know where! Nobody seems to know!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Swallow," [...] he said, [...] "in {{three days}} I begin my homeward march, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to ask whither {{you wish to}} go, since you cannot stop here in the veldt alone." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> had my {{nightingale}} days, my cuckoo and blackbird and tree-pipit days, {{with others}} {{too numerous to}} mention, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> was <b>having</b> my greenfinch days; and these were the last.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said slowly; [...] "there was a {{time when}} they took a very {{secondary}} place. Every one has his weaknesses, <b>and</b> even <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not quite got over mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My meaning is, that I like {{earrings}} best just <b>now,</b> because <b>I</b> {{lost one}} of my prettiest pair last year, and papa {{said he would not}} buy any more, or allow me to myself, because <b>I</b> was careless; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some like them--that's what my meaning is--indeed it is, Mr. Knight.' ...|$|R
