5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{recording}} of March 16–20, 1992, Mike Heidorn had secured a steady job at a Belleville newspaper company and was dating <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> two children from a previous marriage. Uncle Tupelo had planned a tour of Europe, but Heidorn wanted to stay in Belleville with his girlfriend, whom he married in August 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Category A listed ruined Old St Peter's Church (St. Peter's Kirk) {{is one of}} {{the older}} churches in Scotland, dated to at least 1125, and at one time it was the {{principal}} church for the county, administered by the Bishops of Caithness. The church held hearings against criminal activity and determined how those caught should be punished. In 1701, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a relationship with a Dutch sailor had her head shaved and was publicly shamed, paraded through the town by the local hangman.|$|E
5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E
5000|$|The gravida/para/abortus (GPA) system, or {{sometimes}} just gravida/para (GP), {{is one such}} shorthand. For example, when recording the history of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> had two pregnancies (both of which resulted in live births), it would be noted as G2P2. The obstetric history of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> had four pregnancies, {{one of which was}} a miscarriage before 20 weeks, would be noted as G4P3A1 (in the UK this is written as G4P3+1). That of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> had one pregnancy of twins with successful outcomes would be noted as G1P1.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> never carried <b>a</b> {{pregnancy}} beyond 20 {{weeks is}} nulliparous, and {{is called a}} nullipara or para 0. <b>A</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> given birth once before is primiparous, and {{is referred to as}} a primipara or primip; moreover, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> given birth two or more times is multiparous and is called a multip. Finally, grand multipara describes the condition of having given birth three or more times.|$|R

5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing {{that the cause of}} her death could not be determined.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|In 1688, the Spanish sent {{three more}} expeditions, two by sea {{and one by}} land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, {{discovered}} Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{been shot in the}} back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, , wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location.|$|E

5|$|Marriages {{were highly}} ritualized, {{particularly}} for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as bridewealth and dowry, were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife, but as a concubine. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered {{more important than the}} mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry. However, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death. In order to remarry, the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee. Her children {{would not be allowed to}} go with her.|$|E

Rather, they gave the perjurer 40 lashes. If the perjurers testified that a person was guilty of a charge punishable by banishment, they did not banish the perjurers. Rather, they gave the perjurer 40 lashes.|$|E
