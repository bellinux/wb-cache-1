50|$|A {{central issue}} in {{qualitative}} research is trustworthiness (also known as credibility or dependability, or in quantitative studies, validity). There {{are many different}} ways of establishing trustworthiness, including: member check, interviewer corroboration, peer debriefing, prolonged engagement, negative case analysis, <b>auditability,</b> confirmability, bracketing, and balance. Most of these methods are described in Lincoln and Guba (1985). As exemplified by researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg, data triangulation and eliciting examples of interviewee accounts are two of the most commonly used methods of establishing trustworthiness in qualitative studies.|$|E
50|$|Such {{software}} {{helps to}} organize, manage and analyse information. The advantages of using this software include saving time, managing {{huge amounts of}} qualitative data, having increased flexibility, having improved validity and <b>auditability</b> of qualitative research, and being freed from manual and clerical tasks. Concerns include increasingly deterministic and rigid processes, privileging of coding, and retrieval methods; reification of data, increased pressure on researchers to focus on volume and breadth rather than on depth and meaning, time and energy spent learning to use computer packages, increased commercialism, and distraction from the real work of analysis.|$|E
50|$|Some {{allege that}} voting {{locations}} that used electronic voting machines {{that did not}} issue a paper receipt or offer <b>auditability</b> correlate geographically with areas that had unilateral discrepancies between exit poll numbers and actual results. Exit polling data in these areas show significantly higher support for Kerry than actual results (outside the margin of error). Some are concerned that, from a statistical perspective, this may be indicative of vote rigging, because the likelihood of this happening by chance is less than 1 in 50,000. Others point out this {{could be explained by}} poor exit polling techniques or all discrepancies may be within the margin of error.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{particular}} implementation, e-voting may use standalone electronic machines (also called EVM) or computers connected to the internet. It encompasses a range of Internet services, from basic data transmission to full-function online voting through common connectable household devices. Similarly, the degree of automation may vary from simple chores to a complete solution that includes voter registration & authentication, vote input, local or precinct tallying, vote data encryption and transmission to servers, vote consolidation and tabulation, and election administration. A worthy e-voting system must perform most of these tasks while complying {{with a set of}} standards established by regulatory bodies, and must also be capable to deal successfully with strong requirements associated with security, accuracy, integrity, swiftness, privacy, <b>auditability,</b> accessibility, cost-effectiveness, scalability and ecological sustainability.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Rebecca Mercuri, {{the creator}} of the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) concept (as {{described}} in her Ph.D. dissertation in October 2000 on the basic voter verifiable ballot system), proposes to answer the <b>auditability</b> question by having the voting machine print a paper ballot or other paper facsimile that can be visually verified by the voter before being entered into a secure location. Subsequently, this is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Mercuri method." [...] To be truly voter-verified, the record itself must be verified by the voter and able to be done without assistance, such as visually or audibly. If the voter must use a bar-code scanner or other electronic device to verify, then the record is not truly voter-verifiable, since it is actually the electronic device that is verifying the record for the voter. VVPAT is the form of Independent Verification most commonly found in elections in the United States and other countries such as Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{cryptographic}} protocols go beyond the traditional goals of data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication to also secure {{a variety of other}} desired characteristics of computer-mediated collaboration. Blind signatures can be used for digital cash and digital credentials to prove that a person holds an attribute or right without revealing that person's identity or the identities of parties that person transacted with. Secure digital timestamping can be used to prove that data (even if confidential) existed at a certain time. Secure multiparty computation can be used to compute answers (such as determining the highest bid in an auction) based on confidential data (such as private bids), so that when the protocol is complete the participants know only their own input and the answer. End-to-end auditable voting systems provide sets of desirable privacy and <b>auditability</b> properties for conducting e-voting. Undeniable signatures include interactive protocols that allow the signer to prove a forgery and limit who can verify the signature. Deniable encryption augments standard encryption by making it impossible for an attacker to mathematically prove the existence of a plain text message. Digital mixes create hard-to-trace communications.|$|E

40|$|During {{recent decades}} audits {{have taken on}} a more {{prominent}} role in governance, in Sweden and in the Western world as a whole. Audit is used in this context as an umbrella designation for control methods such as inspection, auditing, evaluation, accreditation and certification. What these control methods {{have in common is}} that they entail external, (presumably) independent authorities or companies inspecting and assessing various phenomena. A number of auditing bodies scrutinise and provide assessments, and in so doing govern organisations at a distance. This dissertation is about audit in the making. It describes what takes place when operations are made the object of auditing and what happens in organisations while being audited. The question that is answered is: how is <b>auditability</b> achieved? In distinction from many other studies on audits, the auditees have a prominent position in answering this question. The auditing that is at the centre of the study is state inspection within schools and elderly care. In the dissertation episodes and events in the realisation of these audits are described. The analysis is based on ethnographically inspired fieldwork. Building on Miller and Rose’s perspective on governmentality, the study has as its starting-point the technologies and the varying contexts in which these are manifested: in reports, on websites, in everyday routines and meetings between the auditors and the auditees etc. The study shows that being the subject of audit requires extensive work. <b>Auditability</b> is achieved through a large portion of predictability where each step in the process is acknowledged. This predictability entails much more than providing advance notification of audits. It is a way of organising and executing the audit, where the auditees are not just a part of the object being audited, but also the extended arm of the audit authority. They supply the representations that the audit authority needs in order to describe and assess the operation. In achieving <b>auditability</b> the auditees do more than deliver information about the organisation. <b>Auditability</b> also entails making the audit meaningful and useful (it is for our benefit). This is done mainly by (re) interpreting the auditing as an educational opportunity which also normalises the process (it is nothing to be afraid of). Technically <b>auditability</b> is a question of how the object being audited and the benchmarks used are made comparable. The study shows that <b>auditability</b> is achieved through the construction of an object that is defined on the basis of benchmarks and is consequently comparable. In the audit studied there is no formalised report that can be e-mailed to the audit authority, printed out, submitted or put in an envelope. Rather, describing and defining the operation is an important aspect of auditing. The description is undertaken for a specific purpose, namely to act as underlying data for the assessment. It is therefore not surprising that the object and the benchmark are comparable, as the object is defined precisely for this purpose. What the study contributes to previous research is, firstly, bringing the auditees into the debate on how <b>auditability</b> is created. The study also contributes to a less static picture of how organisations are made receptive to auditing: that receptibility entails much more than installing systems that continuously supply the information about the organisation that the auditors need. The study also contributes to problematise the division into auditors and audited by showing that the boundaries are by no means always clear-cut. Finally the study shows that how <b>auditability</b> is achieved partially explains what is being auditable...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{the emerging}} technology {{which makes it}} possible for you to access your data from anywhere at any time. Where in traditional method computers setup requires you {{to be in the same}} location as your data storage service. A distinct feature of the cloud services is that user’s data are remotely proceeds in unknown machines that user do not own or operate. Data handling goes through complex and dynamic hierarchical chain through various abstraction layers. While enjoying this new emerging technology, user’s fear of losing control of their data particularly (health & financial data, etc.). Hence cloud computing can become a significant barrier to the wide acceptance of cloud services. To solve this problem data should be shared and used in cloud environment with the help of trust components such as privacy, security, accountability & <b>auditability</b> techniques in order to achieve the customer’s confidence level and long term customer relationship.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Department of Defense (DOD) has some problems in its contracting workforce {{that make the}} department susceptible to procurement fraud. In fiscal year (FY) 2014, $ 285 billion was spent on federal contracts. In FY 2015, the DOD increased its obligation to $ 290 billion. The DOD committed more money than all other government agencies combined. In total, the U. S. Department of Justice in its annual evaluation stated that there were 4, 801 United States government-wide fraud investigations in 2015. The purpose {{of this research was}} to evaluate the knowledge level of Navy contracting professionals regarding procurement fraud. The research method included a survey that contained questions regarding contract management processes, internal control components, and procurement fraud schemes. The results of this research identified differences in levels of fraud knowledge and perceptions of an organization's vulnerability to procurement fraud. The other two aspects of <b>auditability</b> are effective internal controls and capable processes. Having strong <b>auditability</b> in an organization would help to identify susceptibilities to procurement and assist in reducing vulnerabilities.
