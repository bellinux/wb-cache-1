5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that this bridge was used by George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under construction and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull helping their horses across.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 3rd {{millennium}} BC, Erbil {{is mentioned}} in historical records of the Ur III period as Urbilum. King Shulgi destroyed Urbilum in his 43rd regnal year, and during the reign of his successor Amar-Sin, Urbilum was incorporated into the Ur III state. In the 18th century BC, Erbil appears in a list of cities that were conquered by Shamshi-Adad of Upper Mesopotamia and Dadusha of Eshnunna during their campaign against the land of Qabra. Shamshi-Adad installed garrisons in all the cities of the land of Urbil. During the 2nd millennium BC, Erbil was incorporated into Assyria. Erbil served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> departure for military campaigns toward the east.|$|E

Commercial concerts have continued into the 21st century, such as Live 8 in 2005.|$|E

Costume designer Jany Temime designed Sévérine's wardrobe using concepts from film noir as well as contemporary fashion, with close attention paid to the black dress she wears when meeting Bond in a Macau casino.|$|E

5|$|Florida State earned its bid to the ACC Championship game by {{fighting}} through an Atlantic Division schedule that included several nationally ranked teams.

Additional losses to North Carolina State and Clemson {{at the end of}} the season almost eliminated the Seminoles from contention for a spot in the championship game, but losses by Clemson and the other Atlantic Division leaders gave the Seminoles a second chance and set up an ACC Championship game between Florida State and Virginia Tech. The two teams had previously played in the 2000 National Championship Game, and the rematch served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> public interest.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong is the world's {{eleventh}} largest trading entity, {{with the}} total value of imports and exports exceeding its gross domestic product. It is the world's largest re-export centre. Much of Hong Kong's exports consist of re-exports, which are products made outside of the territory, especially in mainland China, and distributed via Hong Kong. Its physical location has allowed the city to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure that includes the world's second busiest container port and the world's busiest airport for international cargo. Even before the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong had established extensive trade and investment ties with the mainland, which now enable it to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> entry for investment flowing into the mainland. At the end of 2007, there were 3.46million people employed full-time, with the unemployment rate averaging 4.1% for the fourth straight year of decline. Hong Kong's economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounts for over 90% of its GDP, while industry constitutes 9%. Inflation was at 2.5% in 2007. Hong Kong's largest export markets are mainland China, the United States, and Japan.|$|E

5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria. This was {{intended}} to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.|$|E
