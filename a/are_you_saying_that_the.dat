5000|$|What are {{you saying}} when you mention the {{fundraising}} scandals or the fundraising charges that involve Vice President Gore? What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> voters should take from that that's relevant to this election? ...|$|E
50|$|During {{the same}} session, {{she saw a}} group of {{soldiers}} at the Brandenburg Gate, then a topographic map with miniature American and Japanese flags. Stanisław Hadyna, a witness of the session, asked then: What are you talking about? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese-American war will complete the Polish-German war? This is absurd. Pilchowa did not answer, and kept on talking: I do not understand what it is. I see something terrible. It is a giant mushroom, made of clouds, which is growing in the skies. Where is it? What is it? Then {{she opened her eyes}} widely and said that it was impossible: It will result in the death of the planet, she added.|$|E

2500|$|When the {{president}} <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Senator Kerry is emboldening enemies and <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{we could get}} hit again if voters make the wrong choice in November, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> it would <b>be</b> a dangerous thing to have John Kerry as president? ...|$|R

"Mad or sane," [...] said Geoffrey, [...] "say {{those words}} {{once more and}} I will stamp {{the life out of}} <b>you</b> where <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God promised her to you--promised that woman to a hound like <b>you.</b> Ah, <b>be</b> careful!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> so strange," [...] she protested. [...] "Over {{the hills}} {{there are the}} steam cars. They would take you {{to some of our}} {{beautiful}} cities where all is light and gaiety. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> safe here, whatever your troubles may have <b>been.</b> <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have money, and if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> lonely," [...] she added, dropping her voice, [...] "you need not go alone." ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2017, Herbst criticized Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick for {{supporting}} the controversial [...] "bathroom bill", which would require Texas residents to use bathrooms according to their sex designation on their birth certificate. Herbst wrote [...] "Mr. Patrick: Let me get this straight, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> right now, without your bill being passed, anyone can assault someone in the bathroom without breaking the law? That's some kind of weird screwed-up loophole if so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Come,’ she said, ‘this <b>is</b> unlike <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not wont to <b>be</b> afraid. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> admire my husband: in his name, be honest.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} better, David; but it were best {{to see how}} she goes on. It may <b>be,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> she will shortly gain her {{strength}} and spirits again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Papa. If I did, I {{should be}} false. I will not <b>be</b> false. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he <b>is</b> false. I {{do not know}} that, but I will not be false. Let me speak to you for one minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet your laws {{allow him}} to hold any number of human beings subject to his {{absolute}} will, without even a shadow of protection; and, low as he <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> cannot <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> not many such." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not believe}} you, Eustace," [...] he said. [...] "Do you {{understand}} what you make out this lady to <b>be</b> when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she could kiss {{me and tell me}} that she loved me--for she did both yesterday--and promise to marry you to-day?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would think that in all that <b>you</b> do <b>you</b> <b>are</b> dealing with my feelings, with my heartstrings, with my reputation. You cannot divide {{yourself}} from me; nor, for the value of it all, would I wish that such division <b>were</b> possible. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I <b>am</b> thin-skinned." ...|$|R
2500|$|My {{response}} {{is that when}} Creationists talk about God creating every individual species as a separate act, they always instance hummingbirds, or orchids, sunflowers and beautiful things. But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through {{the eye of a}} boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, [...] that's going to make him blind. And , 'Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who <b>you</b> also <b>say</b> <b>is</b> an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball? Because that doesn't seem to me to coincide with a God who's full of mercy'.|$|R
6000|$|LADY BROCKLEHURST. Thank <b>you,</b> Henry. I <b>am</b> glad <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> for I {{have just}} taken {{the liberty of}} asking {{two of them to}} step upstairs. (There is an uncomfortable silence, which the {{entrance}} of CRICHTON with TWEENY does not seem to dissipate. CRICHTON is impenetrable, but TWEENY hangs back in fear.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{will not}} now pursue this old controversy, my dear Ferrars, {{particularly}} if it <b>be</b> true, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Canning now lies upon his deathbed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{footstool}} of silk is {{more comfortable}} {{to sit on}} than a state chair fashioned of blood-stained swords. Hearken <b>you,</b> Kaku! I <b>am</b> afraid. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the greatest of seers, and can read the future.

6000|$|... "No, I {{am certain}} that these upper four are the same which the expert {{pronounced}} to be genuine, for I observed yesterday that little discoloration {{on the edge of}} the emerald.

2500|$|The fifth Republican {{debate was}} held at Florida State Fair Grounds in Tampa, Florida, {{sponsored}} by CNN and Tea Party Express. It was moderated by Wolf Blitzer, and was notable for being the first Tea Party debate in history. Rick Perry was booed by the audience for defending his use of an executive order to mandate young girls have the HPV vaccine, which he defended by saying, [...] "I will always {{err on the side}} of life". The debate also engendered controversy when Blitzer asked Ron Paul a hypothetical question about a young man who could afford health insurance but refused to purchase any and went into a coma. When Blitzer asked Paul [...] "Congressman, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> society should just let him die?", a few audience members shouted [...] "Yeah!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Frank, that is ill-natured, {{and almost}} unmanly,--and false also. When have I <b>been</b> fickle? <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> one before with <b>you.</b> I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{there has never}} really been one with me at all. No one knows that better than yourself. I cannot afford {{to be in love}} till I am quite sure that the man is fit to be, and will be, my husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For your sake, my darling; {{for your}} sake,--for your sake! How shall I comfort you when all those around <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not my wife?' ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE [testily] I {{wish you}} would come to your point. Half the time <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must have {{principles}}; and when I offer <b>you</b> principles <b>you</b> <b>say</b> they wont work.|$|R
6000|$|... "'You're damn right,' says I. 'Some of 'em <b>are.</b> But <b>you</b> can't <b>say</b> <b>that</b> about men. WHEN YOU KNOW ONE MAN YOU KNOW 'EM ALL! That settles the human-race question.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} smoked all the evening," [...] he confessed, [...] "I cannot. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> right when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we <b>are</b> not beaten, but I {{like to look}} ahead. I want to know your terms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit," [...] said Pepper warmly. [...] "No {{man could}} ever have a harder or more unfeeling wife than <b>you</b> <b>was.</b> I’ll <b>say</b> <b>that</b> for <b>you,</b> willing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear! You don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>You</b> forget <b>that</b> this self-abandonment, and extravagant grief {{would be wrong}} in any one; and, if nothing else, the display is unbecoming in you.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "One word, sir," [...] cried Raffles Haw in a quivering voice. [...] "Do I entirely {{understand}} <b>you?</b> Let me <b>be</b> {{sure that}} there <b>is</b> no mistake. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{engaged to be married}} to Miss McIntyre?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Liu Ji was an {{important}} official, and his behavior should have been appropriate. How could he have begun to scheme when the emperor was ill?
