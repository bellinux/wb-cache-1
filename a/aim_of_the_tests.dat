25|$|In February 1946, {{around the}} same time as the {{termination}} of the M.52's development, Frank Whittle resigned from Power Jets, stating that this was due to his disagreement with official policy. At the point of cancellation, the first of the three M.52s had been 82 per cent completed and it had been scheduled to commence the first test flights within only a few months. The test programme would have involved the progressive testing and development of the M.52 by the RAE, initially without reheat installed. The ultimate <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> would have been to have achieved Mach 1.07 by the end of 1946.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{national}} research program an experimental campaign was carried out on a real scale mock-up consisting of a steel-concrete composite frame equipped with dissipative bracings, based on High Damping Rubber (HDR) devices and elasto-plastic buckling restrained devices also called Buckling Restrained Braces (BRBs). With reference to HDR devices free vibration tests, followed by force-controlled and displacement-controlled cyclic tests were performed. The experimental tests aim at studying the dynamic response of the coupled system in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of HDR devices in increasing the stiffness and dissipation capacity of the frame. With regards to BRBs only displacement controlled tests are performed, since their behavior is not time dependent. In this case the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> is to investigate the dissipative properties of the devices and their fatigue behavior...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a system}} for {{repairing}} damaged flat plates {{as a result of}} punching shear is presented. The system depends mainly on repairing the damaged concrete and the addition of vertical studs with different arrangements through holes drilled in the plates.
