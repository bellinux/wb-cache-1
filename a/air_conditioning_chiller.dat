It is focused on improve the {{building}} envelope through insulation materials, low density concrete, reflective coatings and low SHGC windows. The design is done by computer simulations using TRNSYS and POLYSUN software. Passive technologies are able to reduce the cooling load to 80 %, which represents a 55 % reduction of the total electricity consumption in the original building. Adding active technologies such as high efficient <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>chiller</b> and solar water heater, total electricity consumption {{of the house is}} reduced to 70 %. The remaining cooling load is covered by 6. 5 kW PV system which is placed on the available roof area...|$|E

Improvements to the ship’s diesel engines, onboard networks, engineering control systems, and power management, and improved capacity for <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> and <b>chilled</b> water distribution were made.

50|$|The {{most widely}} used form of this {{technology}} {{can be found in}} campus-wide <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> or <b>chilled</b> water systems of large buildings. <b>Air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems, especially in commercial buildings, are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads seen on hot summer days in various countries. In this application, a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile. Water then circulates through the pile during the day to produce chilled water that would normally be the chiller's daytime output.|$|R
50|$|In <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems, <b>chilled</b> {{water is}} {{typically}} distributed to heat exchangers, or coils, in air handlers or {{other types of}} terminal devices which cool the air in their respective space(s). The water is then recirculated to the chiller to be recooled. These cooling coils transfer sensible heat and latent heat from the air to the chilled water, thus cooling and usually dehumidifying the air stream. A typical <b>chiller</b> for <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> applications is rated between 15 and 2000 tons, {{and at least one}} manufacturer can produce chillers capable of up to 5,200 tons of cooling. Chilled water temperatures can range from 35 to 45 F, depending upon application requirements.|$|R

It is Australia’s first major high-rise building with a full double-skin façade with external louvres. These conserve energy, eliminate sky glare and optimise user comfort. The angle of the louvre blades is automatically adjusted according to their orientation to the sun. A naturally ventilated, full height atrium, on the southern side of the building, maximises natural light to each office level.|$|R
50|$|Free cooling is an {{economical}} {{method of}} using low external air temperatures {{to assist in}} chilling water, which can then be used for industrial processes, or <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems.

Faults need to be diagnosed early to prevent further deterioration of the system behaviour and energy losses. Since {{it is not a}} common practice to collect historical data regarding unforeseen phenomena and abnormal behaviours for HVAC installations, in this paper a semi-supervised, data-driven approach is employed for fault detection and isolation that makes no use of a priori knowledge. The proposed method exploits Principal Component Analysis to distinguish between anomalies and normal operation variability and a reconstruction-based contribution approach to isolate variables related to faults. The diagnosis task is then tackled by means of a decision table. The fault diagnosis algorithm performance is assessed by exploiting an experimental dataset from a frictionless centrifugal chiller system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In a {{conventional}} <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system, <b>chilled</b> water flow and air quantity supplied to air conditioned area is constant {{irrespective of the}} building load. The building load will generally vary from 60 % to 100 % for 10 hours operation per day during the year. Maintaining the continuous chilled water flow of air quantity in an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system will consume more power during part load conditions. Thus by supplying variable chilled water flow by using constant primary pumps, variable flow secondary pumps, VAVs(variable air volumes) and variable frequency drives in air handling units in the air circuit, we can decrease the energy consumption during part load conditions. In the present project attempt {{has been made to}} calculate the energy savings and payback period of existing system. This is done by introducing primary and secondary pumping with VFDs. The VFDs are in turn provided AHUs and VAVs in the duct. In many conventional air conditioned buildings, the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system generally consumes the maximum power. This can be minimized by taking proper care during the selection, design and erection of <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> equipment ultimately leading to substantial savings in long run. By introducing secondary pumping with VFDs, VAVs in the duct and VFDs in AHUs, the power consumption has been reduced to 12. 25 % over existing constant flow pumping, constant airflow systems. Payback period is 2. 69 years for introducing VAVs in the duct and VFDs in the AHUs and payback period is 3. 73 years for primary and secondary pumping system.

The experiment works on 80 TR capacity Air Cooled Scroll Chiller systems. Vapour compression refrigeration cycle is used for cooling chilling water. Capacity of compressor is taken same for the different refrigerants used for experimental analysis. During experimental work used R- 22 and R- 407 C as refrigerants. Theoretical COP of system with R- 22 refrigerant is 4. 166 and actual COP is 2. 227. For 80 TR capacity scroll air cooled chiller, theoretical COP of system with R- 407 c refrigerant is 3. 465 and actual COP is 2. 745 respectively. Based on the result analysis the same capacity of air cooling system with scroll compressor Actual COP of R- 407 C is higher than R- 22. It means R- 407 C is also a alternative refrigerant for air cooled chilling system and also for HVAC system...|$|R
