40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the reproductive physiology of brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) differed between <b>acidic</b> and neutral <b>lakes.</b> Charr were collected from neutral (pH 3 ̆e 6. 5) and acidic (pH 3 ̆c 6. 5) lakes in the Sault Ste Marie and Blind River areas of Northern Ontario from June to November of 1981 to 1983. Female brook charr from neutral lakes initiated exogenous vitellogenesis in July. Charr from <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes</b> began exogenous vitellogenesis approximately one month later than neutral lake charr. Charr from <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes</b> had fewer yolky oocytes and more oil droplet oocytes than those from neutral lakes in July and August. However, oocyte development was accelerated from September onwards and the abundance of all oocyte stages was the same in charr from <b>acidic</b> and neutral <b>lakes</b> by October. Charr from the <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes</b> produced significantly more mature ova than charr from neutral lakes, but the average weight and diameter of the ova were decreased. Plasma estrogen and vitellogenin levels did not differ among charr from <b>acidic</b> and neutral <b>lakes.</b> Male brook charr from neutral lakes initiated rapid spermatogenesis in June, as measured by the increase in spermatocyte and spermatozoa cyst diameter and percent of testis area. Charr from <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes</b> initiated rapid spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis in July, one month later than charr from the neutral lakes. The rate of spermatogenesis increased in charr from <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes</b> in September, so by October, the quantity of spermatozoa in their testes was the same as in charr from neutral lakes. Histological evidence indicates that charr from <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes</b> did not spawn in October and November, as did those in neutral lakes. Spawning activity was observed in the neutral lakes by mid-October, but spawning still had not occurred by mid-November in the <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes.</b> This study is the first to demonstrate a change in the reproductive physiology of fish due to pH under natural conditions...|$|R
40|$|An {{association}} between acidification of lakes and high mercury concentrations in fishes has been reported.

50|$|This {{freshwater}} microalgal {{species is}} globally distributed. It usually occurs in small, <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes</b> with {{high concentrations of}} dissolved organic carbon, which result in sharp gradients of light intensity due to rapid attenuation of light with depth. During the last decades, G. semen has spread in northern Europe to many non-humic lakes with higher pH. There is evidence that brownification of lakes in these areas, decreasing pH and higher water temperature initiated the spreading of this species.|$|R

Comprehensive autecological analysis has not been published for either B. longirostris or C. sphaericus but according to (Błędzki and Rybak 2016) Chydorus cf. spahericus and Bosmina spp. are wide spread and abundant in many types of water bodies both in littoral and pelagial zone with high stress tolerance.|$|R
50|$|The Kawah Putih {{site was}} opened to {{visitors}} in 1987. The lake is 2,430 meters {{above sea level}} so the local climate is often quite chilly (temperatures are frequently around 10 degrees Celsius). This makes a brisk change from the humidity of the north Java plain and {{the capital city of}} Jakarta. Kawah Putih is a sizeable highly acid lake (pH 0.5-1.3) which changes colour from bluish to whitish green, or brown, depending on the concentration of sulfur and the temperature or the oxidation state. The sand and rocks surrounding the lake have been also leached into whitish colours through interaction with the <b>acidic</b> <b>lake</b> waters (with possible mineral precipitation as well).|$|E
50|$|Before the {{operation}} of Northland Pyrite Mine in the early 1900s, water levels of James Lake increased and decreased. The cause of this alternation could {{have been caused by}} beavers building dams in the lake's outlet, eventually causing the water levels to rise. This rise in water levels began to cease in 1906 when operations of the Northland Pyrite Mine began to dump volcanic waste rock along the southwestern shore of James Lake. This began with the construction of the 91 m shaft and the several open-cuts north of the shaft, but the mine site was originally discovered in 1903. Erosion of the volcanic waste rock resulted in the development of <b>acidic</b> <b>lake</b> wastewaters next to the waste pile, causing organisms around the mine to disappear. The name Harris Mine was coined for Northland Pyrite Mine by E.L. Fraleck in 1907 when Northland was actively operating for a year.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{problems}} with the RNA world hypothesis is to discover the pathway by which RNA became upgraded to the DNA system. Geoffrey Diemer and Ken Stedman, at Portland State University in Oregon, may have found a solution. While conducting a survey of viruses in a hot <b>acidic</b> <b>lake</b> in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, they uncovered evidence that a simple DNA virus had acquired a gene from a completely unrelated RNA-based virus. Virologist Luis Villareal of the University of California Irvine also suggests that viruses capable of converting an RNA-based gene into DNA and then incorporating it into a more complex DNA-based genome might have been common in the Virus world during the RNA to DNA transition some 4 billion years ago. This finding bolsters the argument for the transfer of information from the RNA world to the emerging DNA world before the emergence of the Last Universal Common Ancestor. From the research, the diversity of this virus world is still with us.|$|E

In Britain is usually found in lakes with limestone, marl or basalt geology, and it is absent from <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes</b> such as are common in Wales. It also occurs in slow-flowing rivers and disused canals. Long-stalked pondweed {{tends to be a}} rather rare plant within its range; for example, in a study of more than 3,500 British lakes, it occurred in only 88, most of which had low-moderate alkalinity and were dominated by isoetids. The seeds require a cold period to encourage germination.|$|R
50|$|The Naruko volcano {{was formed}} through two {{pyroclastic}} flows, which occurred 73,000 and 45,000 years ago. The first lava domes were formed approximately 20,000 years ago. The rocks {{produced by the}} pyroclastic flows and lava domes vary in composition, but are generally dacitic. Subsequent volcanic activity continued to create more lava domes, while also resulting in explosive eruptions that destroyed such domes. Tephra created by an explosive eruption approximately 18,000 years ago {{is said to be}} related to the formation of Katanuma lake. The lake is located in the center of the volcano, and is known as one of the most <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes</b> in Japan, with a pH around 1.6.|$|R
50|$|From February 1906 to March 1911, the Northland Pyrite Mine was {{in nearly}} {{continuous}} production. According {{to a former}} report from the Ontario Northland Railway, 76,067,050 pounds were sent throughout this epoch and was shipped {{to the town of}} Cobalt further north. A.A. Cole, who was the former manager of the former Temiskaming Testing Laboratories facility in Cobalt, stated the closure of Northland was due to the mine transporting pyrrhotite instead of pyrite for three days. The mined pyrrhotite was said to be in a parallel lens to the mined pyrite and its quality was unnoticed. During mine closer in March 1911, the 91 m shaft was filled in with logs and waste rock and the adjacent waters of James Lake has since flooded the mine to create more <b>acidic</b> <b>lake</b> wastewater. Colours of the wastewater range from orange to dark red in the central portion of the mine site and green in a narrow open-cut {{at the southern end of}} the mine site just west of the mine shaft.|$|E
40|$|Laon-chain, singly-branched anteiso-alkanes, anteiso-alcohols and anteirso-fatty acids {{have been}} found in {{moderately}} acidified lake sediments (Fukushima et al., 1991 a, b, 1993). In this paper, we made an attempt to find these compounds in core samples taken from 3 acidic lakes, Fudo, Rokkannon and Onami in the Kirishima volcanos, and we analyzed the dredge samples from <b>acidic</b> <b>lake</b> Kutcharo and nonacidic lake Akan in Hokkaido for comparison. Four consecutive 2 cm thick sections from <b>acidic</b> <b>Lake</b> Fudo were analyzed for hydrocarbons, alcohols, sterols and fatty acids. In section 4 cm to 6 cm and 6 cm to 8 cm, anteiso-alkanes and anteiso-alcohols were identified, with anteiso-alkanes represent-ing 7. 8 % of the n-alkanes and anteiso-alcohols representing 1. 7 % of the n-alcohols. In these 4 - 8 cm sections, anteiso-fatty acids were also present. However, anteiso-com-pounds were not present in the 0 - 4 cm sections. These anteiso-compounds may have been derived from microbial synthesis related to the specific conditions of this <b>acidic</b> <b>lake.</b> In the 0 - 10 cm sections from <b>acidic</b> <b>Lake</b> Rokkannon and <b>acidic</b> <b>Lake</b> Onami, anteiso-compounds were not found. In Lake Fudo, sediments show a unimodal n-alkanes distribution, maximizing at C 29 and an n-alcohols distribution pattern maximized in the C 22 -C 28 region both of which have been attributed to higher plant sources. Predominant 4 -desmethyl-sterols are stigmasterol(Q), β-sitosterol (U) both of which may also be attributed to higher plant detritus. The dominant 4 -methyl-sterol is dinostanol (c).

40|$|The magmatic-hydrothermal {{system of}} Kawah Ijen volcano {{is one of}} the most exotic on Earth, {{featuring}} the largest <b>acidic</b> <b>lake</b> on the planet, a hyper-acidic river and a passively degassing silicic dome. While previous studies have mostly described this unique system from a geochemical perspective, to date there has been no comprehensive geophysical investigation of the system. In our study, we surveyed the lake using a thermocouple, a thermal camera, an echo sounder and CO 2 sensors. Furthermore, we gained insights into the hydrogeological structures by combining self-potential surveys with ground and water temperatures. Our results show that the hydrothermal system is self-sealed within the upper edifice and releases pressurized gas only through the active crater. We also show that the extensive hydrological system is formed by not one but three aquifers: a south aquifer that seems to be completely isolated, a west aquifer that sustains the acidic upper springs, and an east aquifer that is the main source of fresh water for the lake. In contrast with previous research, we emphasize the heterogeneity of the <b>acidic</b> <b>lake,</b> illustrated by intense subaqueous degassing. These findings provide new insights into this unique, hazardous hydrothermal system, which may eventually improve the existing monitoring system. SCOPUS: ar. kinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
50|$|There are two crater lakes {{near the}} summit.

50|$|A {{quaking bog}} or schwingmoor {{is a form}} of bog {{occurring}} in wetter parts of valley bogs and raised bogs, and sometimes around the edges of <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes.</b> The bog vegetation, mostly sphagnum moss anchored by sedges (such as Carex lasiocarpa), forms a floating mat approximately half a metre thick, {{on the surface of the}} water or on top of very wet peat. White spruces are also common in this bog regime. Walking on the surface causes it to move - larger movements may cause visible ripples on the surface, or they may even make trees sway. In the absence of disturbance from waves, the bog mat may eventually cover entire bays, or even entire small lakes.|$|R
30|$|Aso Volcano, {{also known}} as Nakadake, in north-central Kyushu has been {{characterized}} by a transition from phreatic–phreatomagmatic activity to Strombolian and vice versa.

We have analyzed the thermal signature during unrest episodes by combining the MODIS-MIROVA data set (2000 – 2017) with high-resolution images (LANDSAT 8 OLI and Sentinel 2) together with ground-based thermal observations (2013 – 2017).|$|E

40|$|One-summer-old {{whitefish}} {{were released}} into three small lakes: a circumneutral lake (mean water pH 6. 09, Ca 2 + 0. 06 mmol l– 1 and total aluminium 11 mg l– 1) and a moderately <b>acidic</b> <b>lake</b> (pH 5. 17, Ca 2 + 0. 05 mmol l– 1 and Altot 36 mg l– 1), both with abundant perch and earlier introduced whitefish, {{and a highly}} acidified lake (pH 4. 53, Ca 2 + 0. 03 mmol l– 1 and Altot 145 mg l– 1) with a sparse perch population. Three years later, when the released whitefish were expected to become sexually mature, whitefish were sampled from the lakes near the spawning time to evaluate their reproductive and physiological status. In the circumneutral lake, 72 % of the captured whitefish were mature, while in the moderately <b>acidic</b> <b>lake</b> all seven captured fish were immature. Among the 27 captured whitefish in the highly acidified lake, all except one were mature. However, the ovaries {{of two of the}} 11 females (18 %) contained a high proportion of atretic oocytes, and only 54 % of the males had running milt compared with 94 % in the circumneutral lake. This deterioration of gonadal maturation had probably resulted from physiological stress caused by the high Al and low Ca 2 + concentration in the acidic water, which also appeared as a disturbed ion balance, an increased blood glucose and haemoconcentration, and a low length increment in relation to the weight increase. Apart from the imbalance in the length and weight increase, {{the results of the present}} study are consistent with those from laboratory experiments. By interfering with whitefish physiology, the acidification of freshwater lakes may also impair their reproduction...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the benthic invertebrate communities were investigated in terms of composition, abundance, and biomass from extremely <b>acidic</b> <b>lakes</b> with pH values from 2 to 3 in areas where coal was intensively mined in the Lusatian region in the eastern region of Germany. Benthic invertebrates colonisation on leaves and the breakdown rate processing of the three deciduous leaf: Betula pendula (birch), Fraxinus excelsior (ash), and Juglans regia (walnut) were investigated. Also, the main key-species of these acidic environments were investigated, in terms of description of pupal exuviae of Chironomus crassimanus and the feeding habit of this acid-resistant species through analysis of their gut content. The benthic food web in extremely <b>acidic</b> mining Lusatian <b>lakes</b> is very short in terms of species richness, trophic relationship, guilds and functional feeding groups. Collector-filters and scraper-grazers were absent in extremely <b>acidic</b> mining <b>lakes</b> (AML 107, AML 111 and AML 117). Shredders as Limnophyes minimus (Diptera, Chironomidae, Orthocladiinae) and Hydrozetes lacustris (Acari, Hydrozetidae) occurred in low abundance in AML 107 and AML 111, {{and it may be}} in response to slow leaf breakdown process in these ecosystems, except in AML 117 where the H. lacustris contributed most to ecosystems functioning via the processing of litter. Aquatic insects as Sialis lutaria (Megaloptera, Sialidae), Orectochilus villosus (Coleoptera, Gyrinidae), Coenagrion mercuriale (Odonata, Coenagrionidae), and Phryganeidae (Trichoptera) are the top-predators of these ecosystems. They did not depend on the level of pH in the lakes, but on the availability of food resources. (orig.)

40|$|The Microviridae are {{increasingly}} becoming {{recognized as one}} of the most globally ubiquitous and highly diverse virus families, and as such, provide an advantageous model for studying virus evolution and adaptation. Here, we utilize microvirus sequences from diverse physiochemical environments, including novel sequences from a high-temperature <b>acidic</b> <b>lake,</b> to chart the outcome of natural selection in the main structural protein of the virus. Each icosahedral microvirus virion is composed of sixty identical capsid proteins that interact along twofold, threefold and fivefold symmetry axis interfaces to encapsidate a small, circular, single-stranded DNA genome. Viable assembly of the virus is guided by scaffolding proteins, which coordinate inter-subunit contacts between the capsid proteins. Structure-based analysis indicates that amino acid sequence conservation is predominantly localized to the twofold axis interface. While preservation of this quaternary interface appears to be essential, tertiary and secondary structural features of the capsid protein are permissive to considerable sequence variation...|$|E
