5|$|Discarding one's {{corrective}} lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses {{weaker than}} one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially {{when one is}} operating <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> vehicle.

His college studies were curtailed by the outbreak of World War I, by which time he had accumulated three years part-time military service, firstly in cadets and later in a militia unit, the 29th Light Horse Regiment.|$|E
5|$|If {{the police}} {{identified}} Bostic {{even before the}} shooting occurred, he would have faced a two-year prison sentence for violating the terms of his parole, since he was out past his curfew. After the shooting, police discovered the BMW had been stolen from the Five Towns Mitsubishi car dealership in Inwood, Long Island, where Bostic worked as a salesman. <b>A</b> <b>motor</b> vehicle theft or gun possession conviction would have been Bostic's third felony, likely resulting in a lengthy prison sentence.|$|E

50|$|A mass driver uses {{some sort}} of {{repulsion}} to keep a payload separated from the track or walls. Then it uses <b>a</b> linear <b>motor</b> (<b>an</b> alternating-current <b>motor</b> such as in a coil gun, or <b>a</b> homopolar <b>motor</b> as in <b>a</b> railgun) to accelerate the payload to high speeds. After leaving the launch track, the payload would be at its launch velocity.|$|R

5|$|In {{starting}} <b>a</b> <b>motor,</b> a VFD initially applies a {{low frequency}} and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows <b>a</b> <b>motor</b> to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E
