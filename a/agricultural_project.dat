Hamdan had formerly worked in Afghanistan on an <b>agricultural</b> <b>project</b> that Bin Laden had developed.

5|$|Just {{north of}} the Lexicon-Tirtur {{junction}} was the village of al-Galaa. Prior to the 1967 Six Day War, the village had been {{the site of an}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>project.</b> This agricultural station incorporated several irrigation ditches and specialized Japanese-made machinery. When the Sinai came under Israeli occupation, Israeli soldiers unwittingly mistook the Japanese characters for Chinese ones, leading to the location being labeled 'Chinese Farm' on military maps. Just north and north-west of Chinese Farm was a hill mass known by its Israeli codename 'Missouri'. During Operation Badr, al-Galaa and the Chinese Farm fell within the designated bridgehead of the 16th Infantry Division. Abd el-Hamid's 16th Infantry Brigade occupied and defended these locations. After partaking in the initial canal-crossing, the brigade, {{along with the rest of}} the division, faced an attack by Raviv's brigade on October 9. The Israelis achieved some initial gains, but were repelled by the end of the day. Also located within 16th Division's bridgehead, as of October 13, was the 21st Armored Division. Its units were positioned in the center and the {{north of the}} bridgehead. The 14th Brigade had been involved in the crossing and, along with the 1st Brigade, participated in the Egyptian offensive on October 14; as a result, it had lost half of its operational tank strength. In the aftermath, Oraby's efforts to reorganize and replace armored losses were hampered by frequent artillery barrages and air strikes. On October 15, there were 136 tanks in the Egyptian bridgehead, unevenly split among Oraby's brigades: 66 with the 1st Armored Brigade, 39 with the 14th Armored Brigade, and 31 in the 18th Mechanized Brigade. Despite their heavy losses, the Egyptian forces in the bridgehead outnumbered Reshef's force.|$|E

40|$|This study {{considered}} {{the most important factors}} determining the success of any <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects.</b> These include planning; follow up, job satisfaction, organisation environment, training and scheduling. The major problems in this study are low productivity in <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects</b> due to low performance. The objectives of the study are (i) to determine the perspective of workers on labour motivation and timing of operations factors in <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects</b> in Libya. (ii) to study the perspective of managerial and supervisors on labour motivation and timing of operations factors in <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects</b> in Libya. (iii) to analyse the relationship between the elements in labour motivation and timing of operations in this study. (iv) to develop the <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects</b> productivity framework in Libya. Meanwhile, the research method used consists of secondary information through library study and primary data collected through questionnaire. The study had chosen five <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects</b> in Libya to conduct this research. The total collected sample size was 231 participants, 52 of them were managers and supervisors, and 179 workers. Two sets of questionnaire were used, the first includes 59 questions for the managers and supervisors and the second includes 35 questions for workers and staff. The results obtained from the reliability test, arithmetic mean, standard deviation and percentages showed that the biggest problem was the follow-up factor followed by-training factor, in addition to the weakness was evident in other factors. Finally, {{the findings of this study}} suggests that these factors (job satisfaction, organisation environment, training, planning, scheduling and follow up), should be improved in order to increase the efficiency and the performance of Libyan <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects,</b> which will lead to increasing agricultural production...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the investment efficiency of the specialized <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects</b> considering different dimensions. These dimensions include: capital turnover, pay back period, return to investment, production safety ratio and price safety ratio. Data have been obtained from unpublished technical and economic feasibility studies recorded at the Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank. Cross-section data covering the period 1982 / 1986 for 176 projects or about 20 % of the total specialized <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects</b> in the Kingdom has been utilized to represent the majority of the specialized <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects</b> in the Kingdom. Due to the non-availability of actual data on the productivities of projects, the average pay back ratio of every kind of projects was used as a base to calculate the criteria of investment efficiency. It is concluded that according to the return of capita, milk projects rank first among other activities practiced in the Kingdom. Broiler, wheat production, layers production, Iamb fattening, Iamb breeding and vegetable production in green houses all followed milk projects. The ranking was not the same for the financed <b>agricultural</b> <b>projects</b> till 1987.
