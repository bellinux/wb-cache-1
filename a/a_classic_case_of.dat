500|$|The {{origin of}} the English word [...] (Old English catt) and its {{counterparts}} in other Germanic languages (such as German Katze), descended from Proto-Germanic *kattōn-, is controversial.

The Late Latin word is generally thought to originate from an Afro-Asiatic language, but every proposed source word has presented problems. Many references refer to [...] "Berber" [...] (Kabyle) kaddîska [...] "wildcat" [...] and [...] "Nubian kadīs" [...] as possible sources or cognates, but M. Lionel Bender says the Nubian term is a loan from Arabic قِطَّة qiṭṭa. Jean-Paul Savignac suggests the Latin word is from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic [...] (šau) [...] "tomcat" [...] or its feminine form suffixed with , but John Huehnergard says [...] "the source [...] was clearly not Egyptian itself, where no analogous form is attested." [...] Huehnergard opines it is [...] "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic". Guus Kroonen also considers the word to be native to Germanic (due to morphological alternations) and Northern Europe, and suggests that it might ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami gađfe [...] "female stoat" [...] and Hungarian hölgy [...] "stoat; lady, bride" [...] from Proto-Uralic *käďwä [...] "female (of a fur animal)".

Secondary issues that are complicit to construction failures are:- attempts to severely minimize construction cost, neglect of inspection and monitoring by local authorities, influence peddling by proprietors.

The research comes from his fieldwork and time spent with the Maring tribe of Papua New Guinea, who lacked hereditary chiefs or officials. Instead of treating whole cultures as separate units, he focused [...] "on populations in the ecological sense, that is, {{as one of the}} components of a system of trophic exchanges taking place within a bounded area." [...] (Biersack,1999,5). Rappaport explained his reasoning behind using populations as opposed to cultures, [...] "Cultures and ecosystems are not directly commensurable. An ecosystem is a system of matter and energy transactions among unlike populations or organisms and between them and the non-living substances by which they are surrounded. 'Culture' is the label for the category of phenomena distinguished from others by its contingency upon symbols." [...] (Biersack,1999, 6). Throughout his work, he studied how an ecosystem maintains itself through a regulatory force. He aimed to show the adaptive value of different cultural forms in maintaining the pre-existing relationship with their environment. In this case, it was ritual acting as the regulator, when pigs were sacrificed during times of warfare. This was done by the tribal members to acquit themselves of debts to the supernatural. Herds of pigs were maintained and fattened until the required work load pushed the limits of the tribes carrying capacity, in which case the slaughter began.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pythiosis is {{a serious}} life- and limb-threatening {{infection}} endemic to Thailand, but rarely seen in the Western hemisphere. Here, we present a unique <b>case</b> <b>of</b> vascular pythiosis initially managed with limb-sparing vascular bypass grafts complicated by a pseudoaneurysm in our repair. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The patient is a 17 year-old Jamaican male with severe aplastic anemia. He sustained a minor injury to his left leg while fishing in Jamaica, which evolved to become an exquisitely tender inguinal swelling. His physical exam and imaging were significant for arteriovenous fistula with limb ischemia. Pathology obtained during surgery for an extra-anatomic vascular bypass showed extensive invasion by Pythium insidiosum. He later developed a pseudoaneurysm {{at the site of}} proximal anastomosis and required urgent intervention. DISCUSSION: This patient presented with <b>a</b> rare, but <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> vascular pythiosis, which was unrecognized at the time of presentation. A variety of therapeutic modalities have been used to treat this disease, including antibiotics, antifungals, and immunotherapy, but the ultimate management of vascular pythiosis is surgical source control.

5000|$|In her {{sixth year}} in Taiwan she was badly {{injured in a}} {{motorcycle}} accident and was profoundly touched by an immense outpouring of love, affection, support and care from the community. Welbon's friends not only rallied around her for emotional support, but raised funds {{to pay for her}} care and rehabilitation. In an odd twist it later emerged, as a very small footnote to a congressional review of CIA operations against Taiwan's nuclear weapons program, much of Welbon's medical care had been anonymously financed by an undercover male Caucasian intelligence operative active in the still largely classified program. A wrinkle in this link is the fact Welbon's motorcycle accident took place on a remote off-shore island where Taiwan's nuclear waste was stored; if indeed the CIA had been collecting isotopic evidence of the ROC's nuclear ambitions, they would have been doing it in the precise highly isolated location where Welbon's motorcycle accident occurred. A number of signal intercepts by the Taiwan counter-intelligence services relating to Welbon's relationship with the Caucasian male intelligence officer in question strongly suggested the two harbored romantic feelings for one another. During her residence in Taiwan an epic birthday party was staged in her honor in the diplomatic quarter of Taipei at the rented home of an individual widely thought to have extensive connections to MI6 and who had a career encompassing activities in Indonesia, China, Taiwan and North Korea. Somewhat humorously Welbon's connections to those involved in intelligence activities inspired a Master's dissertation by a Chinese student at Taipei's Fu Hsing Kang College ( [...] 政治作戰學校, the famed and feared ROC college of Political Warfare [...] ) in 1999 examining Welbon's [...] "Bang !"
