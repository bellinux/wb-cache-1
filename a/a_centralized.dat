5|$|On 11 September 1940, George Stibitz {{transmitted}} {{problems for}} his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a teletype, {{and received the}} computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This configuration of <b>a</b> <b>centralized</b> computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate packet switching, a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through <b>a</b> <b>centralized</b> mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting {{the beginnings of the}} ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of Request for Comment documents, other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the local area network (LAN) developments of Ethernet (1983) and the token ring protocol (1984).|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts {{on the rest of the}} body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of <b>a</b> <b>centralized</b> brain.|$|E

5|$|This {{alliance}} {{was probably}} a weakly centralized state, with a military organization {{similar to the one}} of the Hellenistic Kingdoms. The exact degree of centralization is a matter of debate, with archaeologists, such as archeologist Kris Lockyear, denying the existence of a state, because the archaeological evidence shows regional diversity and only a few region-wide trends. Others, such as historian Alexandru Diaconescu, dispute this and conclude that there was <b>a</b> <b>centralized</b> political structure.|$|E

The personal appeal of Sihanouk, and widespread US aerial bombardment helped recruitment. This task was made even easier for the communists after 9 October 1970, when Lon Nol abolished the loosely federalist monarchy and proclaimed the establishment of <b>a</b> <b>centralized</b> Khmer Republic.|$|E

He performed various duties, including translating an article by the Italian air power theorist Giulio Douhet into English. In 1934, he was involved with drafting legislation that granted the Air Corps {{a greater degree of}} independence. This legislation prompted the Army to create GHQ Air Force, <b>a</b> <b>centralized,</b> air force-level command headed by an aviator answering directly to the Army Chief of Staff. Lieutenant Colonel Frank M. Andrews was chosen to command it, and selected Kenney as his Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans and Training.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia's Communist regime became {{severely}} splintered into a liberal-decentralist nationalist faction led by Croatia and Slovenia {{that supported}} a decentralized federation to give greater autonomy to Croatia and Slovenia, versus a conservative-centralist nationalist faction led by Serbia that supported <b>a</b> <b>centralized</b> federation to secure Serbia's and Serbs' interests across Yugoslavia – {{as they were}} the largest ethnic group in {{the country as a}} whole. From 1967 to 1972 in Croatia and 1968 and 1981 protests in Kosovo, nationalist doctrines and actions caused ethnic tensions that destabilized Yugoslavia. The suppression by the state of nationalists is believed to have had the effect of identifying nationalism as the primary alternative to communism itself and made it a strong underground movement.|$|E

In 1835, Santa Anna began consolidating power; in response federalists launched armed rebellion in several Mexican states. Travis, an ardent foe of centralism, led an attack on Anahuac in June 1835 and forced the Mexican garrison to surrender.
