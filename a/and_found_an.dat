5|$|Hurricane Greta {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Jamaica on October30, 1956. A Navy reconnaissance plane recorded sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> area of low pressure. Around this time, the system was classified as a tropical depression. Although a ship near the system discovered a cold-core circulation—a feature of non-tropical cyclones—it was classified as tropical. By October31, the depression passed near {{the western edge of}} Haiti and later crossed the eastern tip of Cuba before entering the Atlantic Ocean. By the afternoon of November1, the depression had moved through the central Bahamas and turned towards the northeast.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, after Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party won {{the federal}} election, Edith Frank and the {{children}} went to stay with Edith's mother, Rosa, in Aachen. Otto Frank remained in Frankfurt, but after receiving an offer to start a company in Amsterdam, he moved there to organize the business and to arrange accommodations for his family. He began working at the Opekta Works, a company that sold fruit extract pectin, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> apartment on the Merwedeplein (Merwede Square) in the Rivierenbuurt neighbourhood of Amsterdam. By February 1934, Edith {{and the children}} had joined him in Amsterdam. The Franks were among 300,000 Jews who fled Germany between 1933 and 1939.|$|E

When Wolfgang Gerhard {{returned}} to Germany in 1971 to seek medical treatment for his seriously ill wife and son, he gave his identity card to Mengele. The Stammers had a falling out with Mengele in late 1974 and {{bought a house}} in São Paulo; Mengele was not invited. The Stammers bought a bungalow in the Eldorado neighbourhood of São Paulo, which they rented out to Mengele. Rolf, who had not seen his father since the ski holiday in 1956, visited him there in 1977 <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> unrepentant Nazi who claimed he had never personally harmed anyone and had only done his duty.|$|E
5|$|Newton House was {{originally}} built during the medieval period at {{some distance from}} the castle. It is documented to have been later modified in 1595 and 1603. The current Newton House was completed in 1660 under the command of Edward Rice. In the late 1700s, George Rice and his wife Cecil began the construction of a landscape garden, and hired eminent architect Capability Brown in 1775 to assume responsibility for the development. Turrets and battlements were added between 1760 and 1780, giving the property a more romanticised appearance. During the Rebecca Riots of 1843, Colonel George Rice was awoken one night in September <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> empty grave dug in the grounds, warning him that he would be buried in it by October 10.|$|E

5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, only {{weeks before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city, Wendell Willkie soon learned to love it. He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie {{and his wife had}} little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.|$|E

After taking into account fine particle levels (PM 2.5 and less), the association with coarse particles remained but was no longer statistically significant, which means the effect is due to the subsection of fine particles.|$|E
25|$|The Norwegian sealing vessel Spidsbergen with captain Nils Fredrik Rønnbeck and harpooner Johan Petter Aidijärvi aboard sailed {{northeast}} from Svalbard in 1865 {{in search}} of suitable sealing sites <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> archipelago that was most likely Franz Josef Land. They named the area Nord-Øst Spidsbergen (Northeast Spitsbergen) or Rønnebeck Land. However, an announcement of the discovery was never made and the archipelago remained unknown until the following expedition. It {{was at that time}} common to keep newly discovered areas secret to avoid competition for sealing and whaling from other vessels.|$|E

However, the saint appeared {{to him in a}} dream to say {{that it would be better}} to remain in Brittany <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> abbey. So, with eleven of Budoc's other disciples, he set up a small monastery on the Île de Tibidy, at the mouth of the Faou. However it was so inhospitable that after three years, he miraculously opened a passage through the sea to found another abbey on the opposite bank of the Landévennec estuary.|$|E
25|$|Iraqi {{artists have}} {{consistently}} {{been at the}} forefront of new and innovative works of creative genius in the Middle East. From poets to scholar, sculptors to painters, the community of Iraqi artists, local and international, experimented with avant-garde and cutting-edge art, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> insatiable audience that was often blind to gender, socio-economic status, or identity. However, during the past 40 years, the art of Iraq and the voices of the artists has certainly paralleled the tumultuous political and social history of the country, creating an inextricable union that has been displayed in all forms of art.|$|E
25|$|Like other antidepressants, {{paroxetine}} {{may increase}} the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in children and adolescents. The FDA conducted a statistical analysis of paroxetine clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004 <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> increase in suicidality and ideation as compared to placebo, which was observed in trials for both depression and anxiety disorders. In 2015 a paper published in The BMJ that reanalysed the original case notes argued that in Study 329, assessing paroxetine and imipramine against placebo in adolescents with depression, the incidence of suicidal behavior had been under-reported and the efficacy exaggerated for paroxetine.|$|E

Singh concealed his revolver in his jacket pocket (which he received from Puran Singh Boughan from Malsian, Punjab), entered the hall, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> open seat. As the meeting concluded, Singh shot O'Dwyer twice as he moved towards the speaking platform, killing him immediately. Others hurt in the shooting include Louis Dane, Lawrence Dundas, 2nd Marquess of Zetland, and Charles Cochrane-Baillie, 2nd Baron Lamington. Singh {{did not attempt to}} flee and was arrested on site.|$|E
25|$|The first {{settlers}} {{came to the}} Salt Springs area in the 1790s, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> area of unbroken {{forest that}} was dominated by the eastern hemlock tree. The settlers focused on clearing the land for farming. Many of the trees were simply burned, while others were used to build log cabins. Eventually the settlers began stripping the hemlocks of their bark for use in tanneries, while other trees were harvested for the lumber industry. Sawmills soon appeared on Silver Creek and other streams in the area. However, not all the old hemlocks were harvested. Those still standing in and about Fall Brook Gorge were left because the area had become a recreation destination {{as soon as the}} early 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 the Chief Scout of Switzerland, Walther von Bonstetten, visited Kandersteg {{on holiday}} <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> old empty chalet. It {{was built in}} 1908 to house the {{construction}} workers for the Lötschberg Tunnel. In 1913, when the tunnel was finished, the chalet was left unused by the railway company. Von Bonstetten felt that this location could be the permanent international meeting place that Robert Baden-Powell had in mind where Scouts {{from all over the}} world could meet. Von Bonstetten wrote to him to let him know what he had found. The response was positive and on 12 February 1923 the Scouts International Home Association was set up; on 12 April 1923 the chalet and adjacent land were bought for CHF 15,100, and the International Scout Centre came into existence. In 1930 Baden-Powell visited the site himself.|$|E

25|$|This {{was brought}} to {{national}} attention on October 7, 2003 when Philadelphia Police conducted a sweep of Mayor John F. Street’s office <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> electronic listening device. It was later discovered that the “bug” had been planted by the FBI {{as part of a}} city corruption investigation. Street was never charged in the investigation. Philadelphia officials and the mayor were outraged, especially with the timing coinciding with the Philadelphia mayoral election on November 4, 2003. Street’s campaign spokesman {{went so far as to}} accuse the federal government of attempting to influence the election (which Street ended up winning anyway). Meehan was applauded in the press and in the city for his handling of the situation, which resulted in twelve indictments including that of Street confidant Ronald White (who died before he could stand trial) and city treasurer Corey Kemp, who was convicted and sentenced to ten years in federal prison.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, two reporters for the Niagara Falls Gazette, David Pollak and David Russell, tested several {{sump pumps}} near Love Canal and found toxic {{chemicals}} in them. The Gazette published reports, once in October 1976 {{and once in}} November 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal dumpsite indicated presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons. The matter went quiet {{for more than a}} year and was resurrected by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by carrying forth an informal door-to-door survey in early 1978, finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group, which was led by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a dozen) birth defects. The New York State Health Department followed suit <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> abnormal incidence of miscarriages.|$|E
25|$|According to the Dhërmi police post's chief, V. Kordhishta, at 17:40 his {{superiors}} were notified about the watercraft seen on radar, moving {{away at a}} mere 200 m from the shore. Afterwards, with other policemen, {{he went to the}} place where the embarkation occurred on the northern shores of Dhërmi <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> abandoned Peugeot car and some empty plastic cans of fuel. At 18:30, the radar in Vlorë tracked two watercraft, 3 miles off Karaburun's coast, publicly confirmed by a spokesman of the Ministry of Order during a transmission on Top-Channel. At 18:40 a patrol boat of the Delta Force unit, an inflatable dinghy of the Border Patrol and another patrol boat set off toward Dhermi. Due to the bad weather they could not progress beyond Mezokanal between Sazan Island and Karaburun Peninsula and docked in Shën Jan bay, near Cape of Gjuhëz. At 19:00 the boat's approximate coordinates were determined, and at 21:40 the Italian representatives of NATO in Durrës were notified. They additionally sent several watercraft and two helicopters. At 1 a.m. the search was stopped, to be resumed in the morning.|$|E
