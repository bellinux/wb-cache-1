40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn {{this study}} an {{assessment}} {{has been made}} of the present <b>and</b> possible future <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> eutrophication of natural and semi-natural terrestrial ecosystems, and riverine nitrogen transport to estuaries, coastal seas and continental shelves. The major objectives were to delineate areas potentially affected by depostition of nitrogen and sulphur compounds, to estimate the severity of <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> eutrophication problems, and to identify research and data gaps. The results indicate that the critical loads for <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> eutrophication are exceeded in 6 - 15 % and 7 - 18 % of the global area of natural and semi-natural ecosystems, respectively. Currently, most serious risks are found in the heavily industrialised regions of eastern USA, Europe and the Former Soviet Union, but risks were also found for parts of South America, large parts of ASIA and parts of Western, Eastern and Southern Africa. Scenario analysis shows that both <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> eutrophication risks could significantly increase in the second group of regions...|$|R

50|$|Ocean {{acidification}} from increasing {{level of}} atmospheric CO2 represents a major global threat to coral reefs, {{and in many}} regions acidification is exacerbated by local smaller-scale disturbances such as overfishing. Studies have shown that severe <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> warming alone can lower reef resilience even under high grazing intensity and low nutrients. Furthermore, the threshold at which herbivore overfishing (reduced grazing) leads to a coral-algal phase shift was lowered by <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> warming. Also, increasing temperature <b>and</b> ocean <b>acidification</b> are predicted to have a synergistic effect; ocean warming will further magnify ocean acidification changes.|$|R

40|$|Concrete {{is a major}} {{material}} used in {{the construction}} industry that emits a large amount of substances with environmental impacts during its life cycle. Accordingly, technologies for the reduction in and assessment of the environmental impact of concrete {{from the perspective of a}} life cycle assessment (LCA) must be developed. At present, the studies on LCA in relation to greenhouse gas emission from concrete are being carried out globally as a countermeasure against climate change. However, the studies on the impact of the substances emitted in the concrete production process on <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> eutrophication are insufficient. As such, assessing only a single category of environmental impact may cause a misunderstanding about the environmental friendliness of concrete. The substances emitted in the concrete production process have an impact not only on global warming but also on <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> eutrophication. <b>Acidification</b> <b>and</b> eutrophication are the main causes of air pollution, forest destruction, red tide phenomena, and deterioration of reinforced concrete structures. For this reason, the main substances among those emitted in the concrete production process that have an impact on <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> eutrophication were deduced. In addition, an LCA technique through which to determine the major emissions from concrete was proposed and a case analysis was carried out. The substances among those emitted in the concrete production process that are related to eutrophication were deduced to be NOx, NH 3, NH 4 +, COD, NO 3 â, and PO 43 â. The substances among those emitted in the concrete production process that are related to acidification, were found to be NOx, SO 2, H 2 S, and H 2 SO 4.

The effect of heneicosane and 1 -phenylnaphthalene on hydrolysis <b>and</b> <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> {{its impact on}} the microbial community structure was also investigated. The optimum conditions for hydrolytic acidification include an initial pH of 5.0 and an SRT of 6 Â days. Maximum hydrogen production was achieved at a pH of 6.5 and SRT of 8 Â days. The thermophilic hydrolysis <b>and</b> <b>acidification</b> of PREAS performed well in the presence of high concentrations of heneicosane and 1 -phenylnaphthalene. Coprothermobacter, Fervidobacterium, Caldisericum and Tepidiphilus were the dominant bacterial strains during hydrolytic <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> contributed to the degradation of oil compounds and the generation of VFAs.

The mean elimination half-life of cinoxacin in plasma was 1. 1, 2. 0, and 0. 6 h in control subjects <b>and</b> with <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> alkalinization of urine, respectively. Recovery of intact cinoxacin in samples of urine collected 0 to 36 h after cinoxacin administration represented 65 % of the dose in control subjects <b>and</b> urine <b>acidification</b> <b>and</b> 80 % of the dose with alkalinization of urine. The mean renal clearance of cinoxacin was 76, 118, and 278 ml/min with <b>acidification,</b> control, <b>and</b> alkalinization, respectively, and renal clearance was highly correlated with urinary pH. Urine concentrations of cinoxacin were significantly higher with alkalinization compared with control values during the first 4 h after drug administration. Urine cinoxacin concentrations were reduced somewhat by acidification, but these tended not to be significantly different from control values. Changes in cinoxacin elimination owing to urine pH are less pronounced in humans than in dogs. The antibacterial activity of cinoxacin against some common urinary tract pathogens was pH dependent. A four- to eightfold reduction in cinoxacin activity was generally observed at pH 8 compared with lower pH values. However, in view of the high levels of cinoxacin which are obtained in both acidic and basic urine, the impact of urine pH on cinoxacin antibacterial efficacy would be of minor clinical importance...|$|R
