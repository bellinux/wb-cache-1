2500|$|The fatal {{accident}} was {{the crash of}} Flight 1030X on 14 April 1965. BUA (Channel Islands) Douglas C-47B-20-DK (registration: G-ANTB) was operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Paris Orly to Jersey. Despite the deteriorating weather conditions at Jersey's States Airport, the crew decided to continue its approach to runway 27. This approach was abandoned because runway visual range fell below minima. When the aircraft made a second approach, it struck the outermost pole of the <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> <b>system</b> at a height of , [...] short of the runway threshold. This caused the aircraft to crash into the approach lights and catch fire, which killed 26 of the 27 occupants (three out of four crew members and all 23 passengers).|$|E
50|$|The {{required}} minimum visibility for instrument approaches {{is influenced}} by the presence and type of approach lighting system. In the U.S., a CAT I ILS approach without approach lights will have a minimum required visibility of 3/4 mile, or 4000 foot runway visual range. With a 1400-foot or longer <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> <b>system,</b> the minimum potential visibility might be reduced to 1/2 mile (2400 runway visual range), and the presence of touchdown zone and centerline lights with a suitable <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> <b>system</b> might further reduce the visibility to 3/8 mile (1800 feet runway visual range).|$|E

50|$|Hudson Valley Regional Airport covers {{an area of}} 640 acre which {{contains}} three runways, {{two of which are}} paved. The main runway (6-24) is 5,001 by 100 feet (1,524 by 30 m) and is equipped with an ILS system to the northeast-facing runway along with a medium intensity <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> <b>system</b> with runway alignment lights. The crosswind runway (15-33) was originally 3,003 feet (915 m) long but is now shortened to 2,744 by 100 feet (836 by 30 m) due to displaced thresholds at both ends. A turf/dirt runway (7-25) measures 1,358 by 100 feet (414 by 30 m).|$|E
50|$|In 1994 {{the runway}} was {{extended}} from 5801 ft to its present 6977 ft and a new, 33,000 square foot (3,000 m²) terminal building opened, replacing the cramped original building. The airport got its current name on March 20, 2001. Runway 32 has an {{instrument landing system}} and a medium intensity <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> <b>system</b> with runway alignment lights. Runway 14 has an instrument approach based on the VOR/DME at the airport. A short turf runway was commissioned parallel to the paved runway, but during the 1980s a north-south turf runway was west of the terminal building,about 1802 ft long and 100 ft wide.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. In the past airfields were designed and built by architectural and engineering companies without due regard and consideration to flight operational requirements. This deficiency was recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Federation of Air Line Pilots (IFALPA). Both leading aviation controlling bodies advocated the incorporation of flight operational considerations in the overall airfield layout and pavement design. Pertinent issues {{to be addressed in}} the paper include: <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> <b>system</b> design and consideration, aircraft maneuvering area design and construction, taxiway and runway markings, runway skid resistance, runway length and width consideration, runway end safety area (RESA) and safety strip considerations, rapid exit taxiway designs, apron lighting, taxiway design consideration and control over foreign object debris (FOD). Some case studies (e. g. King Shaka International Airport, OR Tambo International Airport, Lanseria International, Arusha and Mwanza Regional Airports, East London, Nairobi and Kilimanjaro International Airports) will be used to illustrate that by proper consideration to the flight operations factor, these airports could have been planned and designed/upgraded/maintained in a much more efficient and safe manner, that could have ensured an increased availability factor. Major high risk pavement failures have been recorded (asphalt surfacing being blown out and loose stones) by not considering aircraft related factors (jet blast, oil spillages).

50|$|M. Graham Clark Downtown Airport covers {{an area of}} 40 acres (16 ha) at an {{elevation}} of 940 feet (287 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 12/30 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,738 by 100 feet (1,139 x 30 m). A GPS Approach is published and runway is also equipped with a medium intensity <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some {{installations}} include medium- or high-intensity <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> (abbreviated ALS). Most often, {{these are}} at larger airports but many small general aviation airports in the U.S. have <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> {{to support their}} ILS installations and obtain low-visibility minimums. The ALS assists the pilot in transitioning from instrument to visual flight, and to align the aircraft visually with the runway centerline. Pilot observation of the <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> at the Decision Altitude allows the pilot to continue descending towards the runway, even if the runway or runway lights cannot be seen, since the ALS counts as runway end environment. In the U.S., an ILS without <b>approach</b> <b>lights</b> may have CAT I ILS visibility minimums as low as 3/4 mile (runway visual range of 4,000 feet) if the required obstacle clearance surfaces are clear of obstructions. Visibility minimums of 1/2 mile (runway visual range of 2,400 feet) are possible with a CAT I ILS approach supported by a 1400 to 3000 ft ALS, and 3/8 mile visibility 1800 ft visual range is possible if the runway has high-intensity edge lights, touchdown zone and centerline lights, and an ALS that is at least 2400 ft long (see Table 3-5a in FAA Order 8260.3b). In effect, ALS extends the runway environment out towards the landing aircraft and allows low-visibility operations. CAT II and III ILS approaches generally require complex high-intensity <b>approach</b> <b>light</b> <b>systems,</b> while medium-intensity systems are usually paired with CAT I ILS approaches. At many non-towered airports, the pilot controls the lighting system; for example, the pilot can key the microphone 7 times {{to turn on the}} lights on the high intensity, 5 times to medium intensity or 3 times for low intensity ...|$|R
25|$|The {{investigation}} commission {{found no}} fault of the pilot or air traffic control, instead focusing on short-cuts being taken by the Swedish Air Force and the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) to not configure military airports in line with civilian regulations. The finding caused a surge of funding which subsequently caused military airports to change their instrument landing <b>system</b> and <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> to meet civilian requirements.|$|R
