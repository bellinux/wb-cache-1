50|$|An {{integral}} part of the thermoforming process is the tooling which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge thermoforming as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires molds, plug assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge thermoforming also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well <b>as</b> <b>machined</b> aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated thermoforming machine is limited {{to the quality of the}} tooling. Some large thermoforming manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe most {{important}} property of {{austenitic stainless steels}} is corrosion resistance. In these steels, the transition between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic conditions occurs at low temperatures. Therefore, the use of austenitic stainless steels in conditions in which ferromagnetism absence is important can be considered.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} play {{an important}} role in the performance of machined components. Tensile residual stress on the surface of a component is undesirable. It causes fatigue failure, quench cracking and stress corrosion cracking. Meanwhile, compressive residual stress is usually beneficial to surface layers as it increases fatigue strength and resistance to stress corrosion cracking. To measure tensile and compressive residual stresses on machined surfaces and beneath, x-ray diffraction (XRD) is used. This research focuses on inclined and flat end milling. An initial study was conducted to investigate only numerical factors, such <b>as</b> <b>machined</b> surface inclination angle, axial depth of cut, spindle speed and feed rate in the inclined end milling process. The Taguchi optimization method was used to achieve the best cutting parameter level for minimum residual stress, surface roughness and maximum microhardness.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} effects of laser surface alloying with Si 3 N 4 powder on the microstructural changes and properties of vacuum sintered stainless steels, both austenitic X 2 CrNi 17 - 12 - 2, ferritic X 6 Cr 13 and duplex X 2 CrNiMo 22 - 8 - 2. Design/methodology/approach: High power diode laser (HPDL) was applied to surface modification of sintered stainless steels with Si 3 N 4 powder. The influence of laser alloying conditions on the width, penetration depth of alloyed surface layer were studied and analysed via FEM simulation. The microstructure of alloyed layers was examined using light and scanning electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. The microhardness and wear resistance of studied surface layers were also evaluated. Findings: The hardness increased with addition of Si 3 N 4 due to strong solution hardening effect of nitrogen and silicon that dissolved in the steel matrix during laser alloying. The strong austenite stabilizer effect of nitrogen was observed in ferritic stainless steel that revealed duplex microstructure. The hardness increased with addition of Si 3 N 4 due to strong solution hardening effect of nitrogen and silicon dissolved in the steel matrix during laser alloying. The hardening effect of Si 3 N 4 was strongest in case of ferritic stainless steel where microhardness increased to 450 HV 0. 1 for 2. 1 kW of laser beam power. The duplex stainless steel shows the regular microhardness on the whole penetration depth. Laser surface alloying with Si 3 N 4 improved wear resistance of sintered stainless steels compared to not processed stainless steel as well as comparing layers prepared <b>as</b> <b>machined</b> grooves and surface with pre-coated paste. Practical implications: Laser surface alloying with Si 3 N 4 powder can be an efficient method of surface layer hardening of sintered stainless steels and produce improvement of surface layer properties in terms of hardness and wear resistance. Moreover, application of high power diode laser HPDL and surface prepared <b>as</b> <b>machined</b> grooves can guarantee uniform heating of treated surface, thus uniform thermal cycle across processed area and uniform penetration depth of alloyed surface layer. Originality/value: Application of high power diode laser can guarantee uniform heating of treated surface, thus uniform thermal cycle across processed area and uniform penetration depth of alloyed surface layer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that shot peening has a marked benefit both in crack {{initiation}} and in early crack propagation. This effect is attributed to the compressive residual stress state at the component’s surface due to shot peening. However, little information is published about the possible effect of shot peening in long crack propagation. The fatigue behaviour under crack propagation of an advanced nickel base superalloy has been studied at elevated temperature. Two specimen’s geometries were tested representing critical regions of a compressor disc in a gas turbine aero engine. Also, two types of surface conditions were considered: <b>as</b> <b>machined</b> and shot peened, with shot peening parameters based on previous optimization studies. A set of da/dN vs ΔK curves were obtained at elevated temperature for both specimen’s surface conditions and geometries, using ΔK solutions computed via FEM related to the crack front geometries identified by beach marking imposed to the fracture surface during experimental testing. The comparative analysis of the obtained experimental data seems to evince some beneficial effect for crack sizes deeper than the compressive residual stress layer due to shot peening, even for long crack propagation...|$|E
