5000|$|The most succinct {{guide is}} the [...] "AFP over TCP" [...] chapter of <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> Programming Guide.|$|E
50|$|On August 12, 1999, GroupLogic {{announced}} ExtremeZ-IP (EZ-IP), an <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> server {{that runs}} on Windows operating systems and enables Mac clients to access files via the <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> (AFP 3.3). ExtremeZ-IP also provides access to other Windows services such as single-sign-on (SSO) via Active Directory, printing, searching bridging Apple's Network Spotlight to Microsoft's Windows Search, file system archiving, distributed file system (DFS) and Volume Shadow Service (VSS).|$|E
50|$|The {{products}} {{enable users}} both to send files {{to each other}} and to a user's own devices through a simple drag/drop process. The data is transferred by connecting directly to the recipient in a peer-to-peer configuration, as opposed to the server-centric model used by cloud services. The service has been reported to be faster than the competitive solutions, including <b>Apple's</b> local <b>file</b> transfer <b>protocol</b> AirDrop. In addition, the files are encrypted before being transferred and are never stored in the cloud (on a third-party machine). Files are encrypted before leaving the sender's computer so that third-parties cannot view the files; only the recipient can decrypt them.|$|R
5000|$|This utility enabled Macs to read PC disks, {{but only}} if they were {{inserted}} after launching <b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> Exchange. If <b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> Exchange was not launched while inserting PC-formatted floppy, the Mac would complain that the disk inserted [...] "was not a Macintosh disk" [...] and requested initialisation.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, <b>Apple</b> <b>filed</b> {{patent for}} its own HMD device.|$|R
50|$|The Data Stream Interface (DSI) is {{a session}} layer {{used to carry}} <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> traffic over Transmission Control Protocol.|$|E
50|$|File-sharing server — As a server, {{the system}} can share files using only the <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> (over TCP/IP), HTTP, SSH, and FTP.|$|E
50|$|Netatalk is a free, {{open-source}} {{implementation of}} the <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol.</b> It allows Unix-like operating systems to serve as file, print and time servers for Macintosh computers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> System (APFS) is a {{proprietary}} file system for macOS, iOS, tvOS and watchOS, developed and deployed by Apple Inc. It aims to fix core problems of HFS+ (also called Mac OS Extended), APFS's predecessor on these operating systems. <b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> System is optimized for flash and solid-state drive storage, with a primary focus on encryption.|$|R
2500|$|... 2010, Jan 15: <b>Apple</b> <b>files</b> an ITC {{complaint}} against Nokia over 9 patents.|$|R
50|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> System (APFS) replaces HFS Plus as {{the default}} file system in macOS.|$|R
50|$|Scality {{released}} version 4.2 in October 2013 which added native {{file access}} protocols including Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB), <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> (AFP), and FTP.|$|E
50|$|File-sharing client — The {{system can}} only use TCP/IP, not AppleTalk, {{to connect to}} servers sharing the <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol.</b> The System cannot use SMB to connect to Windows or Samba servers.|$|E
50|$|On a Time Capsule, {{the backup}} data {{is stored in}} an HFS+ disk image and {{accessed}} via <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol.</b> Although it is not officially supported, users and manufacturers have configured FreeBSD and Linux servers and network-attached storage systems to serve Time Machine-enabled Macs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> System {{supports}} snapshots {{for creating}} a point-in-time, read-only instance of the file system.|$|R
50|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> System uses {{checksums}} {{to ensure}} data integrity for metadata, but not user data.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> System {{natively}} supports full disk encryption, {{and file}} encryption {{with the following}} options: ...|$|R
50|$|Edge's {{main focus}} is the {{information}} technology industry, in particular heterogeneous directory services integration, Apple Open Directory, <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol,</b> security, mail and groupware and SAN file systems, with Xsan in particular. He has written several books on Mac OS X Server, networking, security and scripting.|$|E
50|$|Crax Commander {{improves}} productivity {{by offering}} user configurable keyboard shortcuts, built-in text editor with sync coloring, full user interface customizing including fonts and colors, archive support, and built in File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Server Message Block (SMB), <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> (AFP), SSH File Transfer Protocol (SSH), and SSH File Transfer Protocol (sFTP).|$|E
50|$|For {{distributed}} remote file {{systems with}} multiple users, protocols such as <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol,</b> Network File System and Server Message Block {{are more often}} used. SSHFS is an alternative to those protocols only in situations where users are confident that files and directories will not be targeted for writing by another user, at the same time.|$|E
50|$|On July 3, 2008, <b>Apple</b> <b>filed</b> {{a lawsuit}} against Psystar in the District Court of Northern California.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> System is {{available}} in macOS Sierra, albeit with numerous limitations; it is considered experimental. Among its limitations: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> Exchange {{could read}} floppy disks from DOS/Windows and ProDOS (Apple II) systems, {{as well as}} disks from Macs.|$|R
50|$|Apple is also {{migrating}} to SMB2 (from their own <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol,</b> now legacy) with OS X 10.9. This transition was fraught with compatibility problems though. Non-default support for SMB2 appeared {{in fact in}} OS X 10.7, when Apple abandoned Samba in favor of its own SMB implementation called SMBX. Apple switched to its own SMBX implementation after Samba adopted GPLv3.|$|E
5000|$|NFS {{is often}} used with Unix {{operating}} systems (such as Solaris, AIX, HP-UX), Apple's macOS, and Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux and FreeBSD). It is also available to operating systems such as Acorn RISC OS, the classic Mac OS, OpenVMS, MS-DOS, [...] Microsoft Windows, Novell NetWare, and IBM AS/400. Alternative remote file access protocols include the Server Message Block (SMB, also termed CIFS), <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> (AFP), NetWare Core Protocol (NCP), and OS/400 File Server file system (QFileSvr.400).|$|E
50|$|ExtremeZ-IP, an <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> server from GroupLogic, Inc, (Arlington, Virginia, USA), runs on Windows {{operating}} systems enabling Mac clients to access files via the Apple Filing (AFP 3.3) protocol. Starting with version 8.0, the Network Reshare capability allows an ExtremeZ-IP server to proxy {{access to file}} shares on a secondary file server or NAS device such as NetApp or Isilon. ExtremeZ-IP also provides access to other Windows services such as printing, searching, file system archiving, distributed file system and volume shadow service.|$|E
2500|$|... 2012, Jan 17: <b>Apple</b> <b>files</b> {{a lawsuit}} in Düsseldorf {{regional}} court, Germany against Samsung claiming the Galaxy S2 infringes on Apple patents.|$|R
50|$|EFTP (various {{expansions}} of {{this have}} been given, including Easy <b>File</b> Transfer <b>Protocol,</b> Ether <b>File</b> Transfer <b>Protocol,</b> and Experimental <b>File</b> Transfer <b>Protocol)</b> {{was a very}} simple <b>file</b> transfer <b>protocol</b> developed {{as part of the}} PUP protocol suite at Xerox PARC in the late 1970s. It was part of the inspiration for the Trivial <b>File</b> Transfer <b>Protocol</b> (TFTP) in the TCP/IP suite.|$|R
40|$|Filing {{protocols}} {{are essential}} for the management and dissemination of shared information within computer systems. This is {{a survey of the}} current state of the art in <b>filing</b> <b>protocols.</b> Five popular <b>filing</b> <b>protocols</b> were selected and subjected to a rigorous comparison. FTAM, FTP, UNIX rep, XNS Filing, and NFS are compared in the following areas: exported interface, concurrency control, access control, error recovery, and performance. The coverage of background material includes a taxonomy and a brief history of <b>filing</b> <b>protocols...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> (AFP), {{formerly}} AppleTalk Filing Protocol, is {{the protocol}} for communicating with AppleShare file servers. Built {{on top of}} AppleTalk Session Protocol (for legacy AFP over DDP) or the Data Stream Interface (for AFP over TCP), it provides services for authenticating users (extensible to different authentication methods including two-way random-number exchange) and for performing operations specific to the Macintosh HFS filesystem. AFP is still in use in macOS, even though most other AppleTalk protocols have been deprecated.|$|E
5000|$|Netatalk was {{originally}} {{developed by the}} Research Systems Unix Group at the University of Michigan and moved to SourceForge in 2000. In October 2004 Netatalk 2.0 was released, which brought major improvements, including: support for <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> version 3.1 (providing long UTF-8 filenames, file sizes > 2 gigabytes, full Mac OS X compatibility), CUPS integration, Kerberos V support allowing true [...] "single sign-on", reliable and persistent storage of file and directory IDs and countless bug fixes compared to previous versions.|$|E
50|$|TOPS was {{implemented}} in the 1980s, an era where each computer system featured its own networking protocol and were generally unable {{to talk to each}} other. At the time Apple {{was in the midst of}} the Macintosh Office effort, and was working with two external companies to develop the <b>Apple</b> <b>Filing</b> <b>Protocol</b> (AFP), built on top of AppleTalk. The Macintosh Office effort ultimately failed, and one of the two companies, Centram, decided to implement a similar system on their own. This became the first version of TOPS.|$|E
5000|$|... macOS 10.13 High Sierra was {{announced}} on June 5, 2017. High Sierra uses the new <b>Apple</b> <b>File</b> System, and includes enhancements to Safari, Photos and Mail, among other changes.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, <b>Apple</b> <b>filed</b> a patent-infringement {{claim against}} Kodak. On May 12, 2011, Judge Robert Rogers {{rejected}} Apple's claims {{that two of}} its digital photography patents were being violated by Kodak.|$|R
2500|$|... 2011, Jul 01: <b>Apple</b> <b>files</b> for {{preliminary}} injunction against 4 Samsung products: Infuse 4G, Galaxy S 4G, Droid Charge, and Galaxy Tab 10.1 {{based on}} 3 design patents and 1 utility patent.|$|R
