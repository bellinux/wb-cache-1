5|$|Like other platinum-group metal, bulk Pd {{is quite}} inert. Although contact {{dermatitis}} has been reported, {{data on the}} effects are limited. It {{has been shown that}} people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel, making it <b>advisable</b> to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic.|$|E
5|$|Windows Mobile 5.0 {{requires}} {{at least}} 64 MBs of ROM (it's <b>advisable</b> to have 64 MBs of RAM), and the device must run an ARM compatible processor {{such as the}} Intel XScale or the Samsung and Texas Instruments ARM compatibles.|$|E
5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is <b>advisable</b> to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. Therefore, it is not <b>advisable</b> to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E
5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be <b>advisable</b> for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E
5|$|In South Asia, it is <b>advisable</b> to {{take the}} snake which has bitten a person, if it has been killed, and carry it along to the {{hospital}} for possible identification by medical staff using scale diagrams so that an informed decision can be taken them as to whether and which anti-venom is to be administered. However, attempts to catch it or kill the venomous snake are not advised as the snake may bite more people.|$|E
5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not <b>advisable</b> with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, {{it does not have}} dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E
5|$|This fungus is inedible, as it {{contains}} the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. Although much of the gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of water, consumption is not <b>advisable</b> due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{exchange}} {{project of the}} late 1980s, activity to export the Finnhorse has been minimal. However, a 2008 study stated that increased international interest and demand for the Finnhorse was <b>advisable</b> to ensure {{the survival of the}} breed. To this end, the objectives of the national breeding program, as of 2008, include increasing international recognition of the Finnhorse and generating demand for the breed for recreational and educational uses such as in Pony Club; to make it the standard breed used in Finland for equestrian tourism; and to improve the opportunities for Finnhorse trotters to participate in Swedish and Norwegian heats.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the expedition, Champollion wrote the French Consul General Bernardino Drovetti for {{advice on how to}} secure permission from the Egyptian Khedive and Ottoman Viceroy Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Drovetti had initiated his own business of exporting plundered Egyptian antiques and did not want Champollion meddling in his affairs. He sent a letter discouraging the expedition stating that the political situation was too unstable for the expedition to be <b>advisable.</b> The letter reached Jacques Joseph Champollion {{a few weeks before the}} expedition was scheduled to leave, but he conveniently delayed in sending it on to his brother until after the expedition had left.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that {{there exists a}} problem if a {{government}} minister simply needs to state that a national security interest {{is involved in a}} matter, upon which the rules of natural justice are immediately compromised. Thio Li-ann has commented that when important constitutional rights such as the freedom to religion are curtailed by legislation, it may be <b>advisable</b> for the court to impose a duty on a public authority to give reasons establishing that an order imposed by the authority is objectively valid.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play {{that members of the}} opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less <b>advisable</b> when the game is close.|$|E
5|$|Species {{identification}} using scales {{requires a}} fair {{degree of knowledge}} about snakes, their taxonomy, snake-scale nomenclature as well as familiarity with and access to scientific literature. Distinguishing by using scale diagrams whether a snake is venomous or not in the field cannot {{be done in the}} case of uncaught specimens. It is not <b>advisable</b> to catch a snake to check whether it is venomous or not using scale diagrams. Most books or websites provide an array of traits of the local herpetofauna, other than scale diagrams, which help to distinguish whether a snake in the field is venomous or not.|$|E
5|$|The Brooksville Tunnel is {{the most}} {{difficult}} work of the kind, I have seen any record of: at the Western entrance, the pressure of the big slides actually causes the bottom to surge up, as is sometime the case in coal mines; in view of the sliding tendency and immense pressure of this ground, it will be <b>advisable</b> to enter on that side with an invested arch to prevent a collapse...This work is vastly more difficult than the Greenwood Tunnel was, though it was not, by any means, an easy safe job.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer from the side reaction described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is <b>advisable</b> to conduct the sulfurization step prior to the capping step.|$|E
5|$|Various authors regard Suillus collinitus as edible with a sour odor and nondescript taste. It is <b>advisable,</b> as for {{all species}} of Suillus, to pick only young {{specimens}} and to peel the cuticle before preparation. The mushroom contains several tocopherols, {{a class of}} chemical compounds collectively known as vitamin E, and which confer antioxidant activity. They also contain several organic acids, most predominantly the pairs malic and quinic acids, and citric and ketoglutaric acid, which respectively make up 42% and 30% of total organic acids. The composition and concentration of organic acids in mushrooms are major factors in influencing their flavour; some organic acids contribute to antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the morning}} of 1 September had passed, reports coming into US 2nd Division {{headquarters}} {{made it clear that}} North Koreans had penetrated to the north–south Changnyong-Yongsan road and cut the division in two; the 38th and 23d Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser decided that this situation made it <b>advisable</b> to control and direct the divided division as two special forces. Accordingly, he placed the division artillery commander, Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes, in command of the northern group. Southward, in the Yongsan area, Keiser placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, Assistant Division Commander, in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, most of the 72nd Tank Battalion, and other miscellaneous units of the division. This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley.|$|E
5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were most likely to have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is <b>advisable</b> to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief who approves the number of feathers worn by members of the clan.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Queensland at 17 against Victoria in December 1933, having never previously attended a first-class match as a spectator. He conceded only six byes {{and took a}} catch in an innings of 542 in a tidy performance, and made 17 and three in an innings defeat, but was dropped after the match. Queensland officials had ruled {{that it was not}} <b>advisable</b> to take such a young player on away trips to Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. Tallon reclaimed his position when Queensland returned for their home games and from then on was the first-choice wicket-keeper for the state. He played in only one other first-class match for the 193334 season, scoring 13 and taking a catch and a stumping in an eight-wicket win over South Australia.|$|E
5|$|In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants, {{which were}} in Hong Kong, {{challenged}} {{the jurisdiction of the}} High Court to hear a defamation suit brought by the respondents on the ground, among others, that the service of the writ should have been effected in accordance with the civil procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China. Thus, although this was not a judicial review case, the Court had to consider the justiciability of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong, and whether the Court could depart from the views of the executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Court held that the present case did not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy. Rather, it was concerned with the effect, and not the making, of the treaty or whether it was <b>advisable.</b> Thus, the letter from the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power, but merely a statement of opinion.|$|E

25|$|A local {{guide is}} <b>advisable</b> {{although}} not required, {{since there are}} no signposts or marked trails to the most attractive parts of the park.|$|E
25|$|For all {{recreation}} {{activities within}} the park, it is <b>advisable</b> to contact Riding Mountain National Park administration {{for information and}} to acquire necessary permits.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>advisable</b> for {{tourists}} not {{to travel in}} Mumbai local trains from 07:00 to 11:00 and 17:00 to 22:00 during weekdays because of overcrowding.|$|E
25|$|Additional processes, such as {{planning}} for communications and for scope management, identifying roles and responsibilities, determining what to purchase {{for the project}} and holding a kick-off meeting are also generally <b>advisable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Effective {{treatment}} for anorgasmia {{depends on the}} cause. In the case of women suffering from psychological sexual trauma or inhibition, psychosexual counselling might be <b>advisable</b> and could be obtained through general practitioner (GP) referral.|$|E
25|$|Before {{conducting}} salah, a Muslim has {{to perform}} a ritual ablution. The minor ablution is performed using water (wudu), or sand (tayammum) when water is unavailable or not <b>advisable</b> to use for reasons such as illness.|$|E
25|$|Liver biopsy can verify {{inflammation}} and necrosis of hepatocytes and detect viral antigens. Because of the bleeding tendency of yellow fever patients, a biopsy is only <b>advisable</b> post mortem {{to confirm the}} cause of death.|$|E
25|$|Measures of {{adherence}} {{may need}} to be modified for different ethnic or cultural groups. In some cases, it may be <b>advisable</b> to assess patients from a cultural perspective before making decisions about their individual treatment.|$|E
25|$|When {{propagating}} strawberries, {{one should}} avoid {{using the same}} soil or containers that were previously used for strawberry cultivation. After cultivating strawberries, rotating to another culture is <b>advisable,</b> because diseases that attack one species might not attack another.|$|E
25|$|The risk to asplenic {{patients}} {{has been}} expressed as equivalent {{to an adult}} dying in a road traffic accident (in every 100 people without spleens, 1 to 5 would develop a severe infection per decade) (reference UK Splenectomy Trust Advice)hence sensible precautions are <b>advisable.</b> Increased platelet counts {{can be seen in}} individuals without a functioning spleen.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{varieties}} of Hebrew for which Tiberian vocalization is not suitable are the Hebrew of the Qumran community (as {{known from the}} Dead Sea Scrolls) and of the Samaritans. For romanizations of Samaritan pronunciation, it is <b>advisable</b> to take quotations directly from a Samaritan edition of the Hebrew Bible, which has approximately 6,000 textual variations from Jewish editions.|$|E
25|$|When the Dorrigo {{was ready}} to leave Brisbane on Thursday {{afternoon}} it was reported to the master {{that one of the}} firemen was ill. He was given attention, but his condition was such that it was deemed <b>advisable</b> to take him ashore. In his stead J. Wrench, a well-known seafarer, of Brisbane, joined the ship ten minutes before it sailed.|$|E
25|$|The group {{remained}} active until December 2000 {{and a final}} gig at Margate Winter Gardens. After that date, Garrity {{was told}} by his doctor that due to his pulmonary hypertension it was not <b>advisable</b> for him to continue working, and he officially retired from all work in February 2001. He died in Bangor, North Wales, on 19 May 2006 aged 69.|$|E
25|$|A more {{practical}} {{choice is to}} drop the two-port approach altogether, and use various alternatives based on signal flow graph theory, including the Rosenstark method, the Choma method, and use of Blackman's theorem. That choice may be <b>advisable</b> if small-signal device models are complex, or are not available (for example, the devices are known only numerically, perhaps from measurement or from SPICE simulations).|$|E
