5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. They are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet Earth. They <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> {{in the eastern}} Pacific Ocean and generally form only once every several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|The OBRC Checklist {{divides the}} {{province}} into the Lowlands, Central, and South review zones and requests documentation of sightings of birds which <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> or accidental in one, two, {{or all of}} the zones. Of the 496 species on the list, 167 are noted as rare anywhere in the province and another 108 <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> in {{one or two of the}} zones. Eight species have been introduced to North America. One species has been extirpated, one is extinct, and another might be.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that cause}} extreme destruction <b>are</b> <b>rare,</b> although when they occur, {{they can cause}} great amounts of damage or thousands of fatalities.|$|E

5|$|However, floral synapomorphy (shared characteristics) <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> {{since most}} {{conform to the}} general monocot pattern. This pattern is ancestral (plesiomorphic) for the lilioid monocots. Structural monosymmetry <b>is</b> <b>rare,</b> except for Orchidaceae.|$|R

5|$|A {{wider variety}} of {{patterns}} were used from the 11thcentury. Abstract 6- and 8-point shapes appear in the Tower of Kharaqan at Qazvin, Persia in 1067, and the Al-Juyushi Mosque, Egypt in 1085, again becoming widespread from there, though 6-point patterns <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reports of}} {{poisoning}} in humans <b>are</b> <b>rare,</b> ingestion of ferric chloride {{can result in}} serious morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis. Early diagnosis is important, especially in seriously poisoned patients.|$|E
5|$|Auks are seabirds {{which are}} superficially similar to {{penguins}} with their black-and-white colours, their upright posture {{and some of}} their habits, but the living species are able to fly. There are about 23 species worldwide, four of which <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> vagrants in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

50|$|Cortinarius glaucopus {{is found}} in Western North America (both the United States and Canada), and is common in the Rocky Mountains. It <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> east of the Great Plains; it <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> in the British Isles.|$|R
40|$|I criticize Kuhn’s (1962 / 1970) taxonomic incommensurability thesis as follows. (i) His {{argument}} {{for it is}} neither deductively sound nor inductively correct. (ii) It clashes with his account of scientific development that employs evolutionary theory. (iii) Even if two successive paradigms are taxonomically incommensurable, they have some overlapping theoretical claims, as selectivists point out. (iv) Since scientific revolutions <b>were</b> <b>rare</b> in the recent past, as historical optimists observe, they will also <b>be</b> <b>rare</b> in the future. Where scientific revolution <b>is</b> <b>rare,</b> taxonomic incommensurability <b>is</b> <b>rare,</b> and taxonomic commensurability is common. For these reasons, taxonomic commensurability rather than incommensurability should be advanced as an image of science...|$|R
5|$|CYP2C9 polymorphisms explain 10% of {{the dose}} {{variation}} between patients, mainly among Caucasian patients as these variants <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> in African American and most Asian populations. These CYP2C9 polymorphisms do not influence time to effective INR as opposed toVKORC1, but does shorten {{the time to}} INR >4.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta's {{individual}} cult is not widespread, {{but she is}} {{well known}} and important among Tantrikas (a type of Tantric practitioner) and is worshipped and depicted {{as part of the}} Mahavidya group in goddess temples.

5|$|Even {{though many}} species of Stylidium may coexist in the same location, natural hybrids between species have not often been reported. Both natural {{hybridisation}} {{in the field and}} artificial hybridisation in cultivation <b>are</b> <b>rare.</b> The first natural hybrid, S.petiolare × S.pulchellum, was reported by Sherwin Carlquist in 1969 between Capel and Boyanup in Western Australia.|$|E

5|$|In captivity, {{domestic}} ducks come in wild-type plumages, white, {{and other}} colours. Most of these colour variants are also known in domestic mallards not bred as livestock, but kept as pets, aviary birds, etc., where they <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> but increasing in availability.|$|E

These light-gathering membranes may even form enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Lava flows <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> in Japan—the high silica {{content of}} the magmas there mean that {{explosive}} eruptions are far more common—but the lava flows at Sakurajima continued for months.|$|E
5|$|Most people recover uneventfully {{following}} a mild local reaction {{and up to}} about 3% of individuals suffer a severe localised reaction.
