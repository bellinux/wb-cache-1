25|$|Recently my {{work with}} color has led me, {{in spite of}} myself, to search little by little, with some {{assistance}} (from the observer, from the translator), for the realization of matter, and I have decided to end the battle.

25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to state that {{there are quite a few}} Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E

500|$|Shahid Kapoor {{was cast}} in the film's lead role. Several media outlets {{reported}} that Bhardwaj considered many actors before casting Kapoor in the role, which he refused. Bhardwaj refuted the claims, saying, [...] "There is a huge difference between discussing and narrating and offering someone a film <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to clear up the rumour by saying that Kaminey was never offered to anyone else and so no one rejected it." [...] Kapoor said that he accepted the role after reading the script. Priyanka Chopra was cast to play Sweety, the lead female role. She initially turned down the role, saying she {{felt it was a}} boys' film and her eight-scene part did not seem good enough. However, Bhardwaj persuaded her to accept the role.|$|E

500|$|Kim Manners called [...] "Grotesque" [...] his {{favorite}} third-season episode and praised David Duchovny's performance on this episode, saying [...] "Duchovny drove himself, {{and he was}} brilliant in that show." [...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. I {{think it is a}} disturbing show, and I think that's why—for me—it's such a good show. We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, it was a pretty dark hour of television <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to listen to that (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E
