In the valleys there was {{scarcely}} sufficient water for any irrigation; and the intermediate land was quite bare, not supporting even goats. In the spring, after the winter showers, a thin pasture rapidly springs up, and cattle are then driven down from the Cordillera to graze for a short time. It is curious to observe how the seeds of the grass and other plants seem to accommodate themselves, as if by an acquired habit, to the quantity of rain which falls upon different parts of this coast. One shower far northward at Copiapó produces as great an effect on the vegetation, as two at Guasco, and three or four in this district. At Valparaiso a winter so dry as greatly to injure the pasture, would at Guasco produce the most unusual abundance. Proceeding northward, the quantity of rain does not appear to decrease in strict proportion to the latitude. At Conchalee, which is only 67 miles north of Valparaiso, rain is not expected till the end of May; whereas at Valparaiso some generally falls early in April: the <b>annual</b> <b>quantity</b> is likewise small in proportion to the lateness of the season at which it commences.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to estimate and forecast {{the cost of}} energy conservation in the transportation sector to the year 2000. It stipulates conservation as a depleting resource industry so that the costs tend to increase as additional quantities of energy are conserved. The methodology is that of regression equations and the data are from the US Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy. The regressions of annual costs on corresponding <b>annual</b> <b>quantities</b> of conservation have a good fit and positive and statistically significant coefficients. Hence the theory of energy conservation as a depleting resource industry or that of increasing cost is vindicated. The elasticity of cost with respect to conservation is 1 Â· 12 so that an increase in conservation by 1 per cent tends to increase cost by 1 Â· 12 per cent. ...|$|R
