25|$|Vitamin E was co-discovered by UA <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Chemistry</b> Professor Barnett Sure (1920–51). Sure, {{along with}} fellow {{professor}} Marinus C. Kik (1927–67) made major advances in nutrition science during their long tenures at the University of Arkansas. Sure co-discovered vitamin E, and extended {{knowledge of how}} vitamin E, amino acids and B-vitamins function on reproduction and lactation. Kik developed the process for parboiling rice (a major agricultural crop in the state) to increase retention of vitamins and shorten cooking time. He documented benefits of adding fish and chicken to rice and grain diets to provide adequate protein for a growing world population. Sure and Kik were Agricultural Experiment Station scientists and professors in the UA Department of <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Chemistry,</b> which merged in 1964 with Home Economics, now the School of Human Environmental Sciences.|$|E

25|$|In 1860 Grüneberg {{finished}} his doctoral studies {{and received a}} Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig. His research was {{in the field of}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>chemistry,</b> in particular mineral fertilizers. In 1864 the factory began the production of the fertilizer superphosphate, produced from phosphorite from a newly acquired mine in Nassau an der Lahn. One year later the production of the fertilizer ammonium sulfate begins. In 1866 the factory begins to use the Leblanc process to produce potassium carbonate from sodium chloride. During the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, the company was awarded a gold medal for having first manufactured Potash and Potash salts, according to Leblanc's process, on a manufacturing scale , and for the purity of the products exhibited.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Government's {{first step}} towards {{agricultural}} research stations was {{the development of}} ETH Zurich, where the first two federal agricultural experimental stations were established in 1878: the Swiss Federal Seed Control Station and the Swiss Federal <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Chemistry</b> Experimental Station. Both stations grew very quickly. The Seed Control Station in particular developed into a world-renowned institute. Its founder, Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler led it expertly and successfully for 42 years. The topics studied included fertilisers and feedstuffs, soils, milk, wines, farm fertilisers etc.. A focal point was the further development of analysis methods. This provided {{the starting point for}} the subsequent founding of the Reckenholz location of the present-day Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon Research Station (ART). However, the second location, Tänikon TG, was only opened in 1970, at that time as a research station for rural economics and agricultural engineering.|$|E
