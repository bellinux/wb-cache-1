From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after private training she went to study in Paris where Krøyer began to court her. It is believed Marie was subsequently reluctant to paint as she looked up to Krøyer as <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> accomplished artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived.|$|E

The field goals, kicked from 39,51,and28yards away and two extra points made Coutu Georgia's leading scorer in the game, earning 11points. Ely-Kelso netted 264yards in punts, {{an average of}} 37.7yards per kick. Though not long, the punts were high enough {{in the air to}} allow Georgia's special teams to get downfield and prevent long punt returns. Only two of Ely-Kelso's punts were {{returned}} by Tech kick returner Eddie Royal, and one return was for negative yardage.|$|E
5|$|In 121 BC, Rome {{came into}} contact with two Celtic tribes (from a region in modern France), both of which they {{defeated}} with apparent ease. The Cimbrian War (113–101 BC) was <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC. The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutons migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories, and clashed with Rome and her allies. At the Battle of Aquae Sextiae and the Battle of Vercellae both tribes were virtually annihilated, which ended the threat.|$|E

He began planning <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> ambitious advance into Libya. This was delayed by a year due to Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel's defeat of the British Eighth Army in the Battle of Gazala, and the subsequent German and Italian advance into Egypt. Leclerc was promoted to Général de brigade in August 1941, and pinned two metal stars captured from the Italians on his kepi.|$|E

Sediments also indicate that there existed a rich habitat, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain massive Cretaceous dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{is similar}} to some other species in its genus. The Syrian woodpecker lacks its relative's black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts, although juvenile {{great spotted woodpecker}}s often have an incomplete cheek bar, so can potentially be misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged woodpecker has <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> extensive white wing patch than the great spotted woodpecker. The Sind woodpecker {{is very similar to}} the Syrian species, and can be distinguished from great spotted woodpecker in the same way.|$|E
5|$|The three known Deinocheirus {{specimens}} {{were recovered}} from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of}} the Late Cretaceous about 70 million years ago. The rock facies of the Nemegt Formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Such large river channels and soil deposits are evidence of <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> humid climate than those found in the older Barun Goyot and Djadochta formations. However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts occurred. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers.|$|E

5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet. It was a radical departure from the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{the party}} adopted the Winnipeg Declaration, <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> {{moderate}} proposal than its previous governing document, the 1933 Regina Manifesto. For example, the Regina Manifesto pledged the CCF to {{the eradication of}} capitalism; the Winnipeg Declaration recognized the utility of private ownership of business, and stated {{that the government should}} own business only when it was in the public interest. In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes, and to eliminate sales tax on food, clothing, and other necessities of life. It also promised to raise taxes on the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, {{experiments}} by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on {{the newly}} reactor-produced plutonium from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site {{showed that it}} contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced material on which the original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> difficult engineering task.|$|E

5|$|In {{his major}} {{theoretical}} statement, 'Opera and Drama' (1852), Wagner {{objected to the}} music of Meyerbeer, asserting its superficiality and incoherence in dramatic terms; this work contains Wagner's well-known put-down of Meyerbeer's operas as 'effects without causes'. It also contains the sardonic crack that ' never could have dreamt that it would some day occur to the Bankers, for whom he had always made their music, to make it for themselves'. 'Jewishness in Music' was reissued in 1869, (after Meyerbeer's death) in an extended form, with <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> explicit attack on Meyerbeer. This version was under Wagner's own name – and as Wagner had by now a far greater reputation, his views obtained far wider publicity. These attacks on Meyerbeer (which also included swipes at Felix Mendelssohn) are regarded by Paul Lawrence Rose as a significant milestone in the growth of German anti-Semitism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 732, Marwan led 40,000 men north into Khazar lands. The {{accounts}} of this campaign are confused: Ibn A'tham records that he reached Balanjar and returned to Derbent with much captured livestock, but the campaign is described in terms strongly reminiscent of Maslama's expeditions in 728 and 731, and its veracity is open to doubt. Ibn Khayyat {{on the other hand}} reports that Marwan led <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> limited campaign on the country immediately to the north of Derbent and then retired there to spend the winter. Marwan was more active in the south, where he raised Ashot III Bagratuni to the position of presiding prince of Armenia, effectively granting the country broad autonomy in exchange for the service of its soldiers alongside the Caliphate's armies. This unique concession points, according to Blankinship, to the worsening manpower crisis faced by the Caliphate. At about the same time, the Khazars and Byzantines strengthened their ties and formalized their alliance against their common enemy with the marriage of Constantine V to the Khazar princess Tzitzak.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1963, the Iraqi Regional Branch, led by Ali Salih al-Sa'di, {{took power}} in Iraq by overthrowing Abd al-Karim Qasim. He was <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> {{formidable}} opponent than al-Kudsi, and the Iraqi Regional Branch {{managed to take}} power through an alliance not only with military officers, but also with segments of the middle class. Qasim's downfall changed the rules of Arab politics – the Nasserists had monopolised the Arab nationalist movement since the UAR, but the takeover made the Ba'ath Party {{a force to be}} reckoned with. In contrast to the Iraqi regional branch, the Syrian regional branch did not have mass support or a significant support base in the middle class. While Aflaq cautioned the plotters because of the party's lack of support, they failed to share his worries, and launched the coup on 7 March. However, that day the military intelligence raided the apartment where the plotters were planning to assemble. Assad was given the task of reporting to other units that the coup had been postponed to 8 March.|$|E

5|$|Taking up his {{part-time}} professorship at the Institute of Archaeology, {{he began}} to lecture to students almost every day. There, he found that he developed a relationship of mutual respect with the director, Childe, despite their strong personal and professional differences. In April 1949, after the retirement of Cyril Fox, Wheeler was nominated for the Presidency of the Society of Antiquaries, but lost to James Mann; many archaeologists, including Childe and O. G. S. Crawford, resigned from the Society in protest, deeming Wheeler to have been <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> appropriate candidate for the position. Wheeler was nevertheless elected director of the Society. In 1950 {{he was awarded the}} Petrie Medal, and in 1952 was knighted. That same year he was invited to give the Norton lectures for the Archaeological Institute of America, and while in the United States was also awarded the Lucy Wharton Drexel medal at Pennsylvania. He nevertheless disliked the country, and in later life exhibited anti-Americanism.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{instrument}} had been originally {{designed for use}} in a church, Hammond realized that the amateur home market was <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> lucrative business, and started manufacturing spinet organs in the late 1940s. Outside of the United States, they were manufactured in greater numbers than the consoles, and hence were more widely used. Several different types of M series instruments were produced between 1948 and 1964; they contained two 44-note manuals with one set of drawbars each, and a 12-note pedalboard. The M model was produced from 1948 to 1951, the M-2 from 1951 to 1955, and the M-3 from 1955 to 1964. The M series was replaced by the M-100 series in 1961, which used a numbering system to identify the body style and finish as used on earlier console series. It included the same manuals as the M, but increased the pedalboard size to 13 notes, stretching a full octave, and included a number of presets.|$|E
5|$|West further broadened {{his musical}} palette on Graduation by not {{limiting}} {{himself to his}} customary use of samples and interpolation from classic soul records and instead drew influences from <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> eclectic range of music genres. Along with house music, Graduation contains samples and music elements of euro-disco, hard rock, electronica, lounge, progressive rock, synth-pop, electro, krautrock, dub, reggae, and dancehall. Also, {{for much of the}} third studio album, Kanye West modified his style of rapping and adopted a dilatory, exuberant flow in emulation of Bono's operatic vocal stylings. West altered his vocabulary, he utilized less of the percussive, rhythmic consonants in favor of the more smoother, melodic vowel sounds. In addition to U2, West drew inspiration from other arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin for the melodies and chord progressions of his songs. In terms of lyricism, he simplifies some of his rhymes after touring with The Rolling Stones on their A Bigger Bang concert tour and discovering he could not captivate the audiences as well with his most complex lyrical themes.|$|E
