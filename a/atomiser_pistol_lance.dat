50|$|The {{night of}} August 27, 1780, in Luján {{there had been}} an Indians attack {{composed}} of thousands of pampas warriors. The Consejo de guerra of Buenos Aires had appointed to Captain Casimiro Alegre, to lead the punitive expeditions against raids. These military expeditions were properly equipped with flintlocks, carbines, <b>pistols,</b> <b>lances</b> and sabers. In the decades of 1780 and 1790 Casimiro Alegre served as alcalde de la hermandad in the towns of Almirante Brown (current territory), San Vicente, Magdalena and La Matanza (three times-1790, 1795, 1796). The alcaldes had to fulfill both administrative, judicial and also policial functions, dedicating themselves to the persecution of bandits in the rural areas of the province.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{people in}} the {{universe}} rely on personal body shields, which have made all forms of projectile weapons [...] semi-obsolete. Only a slow-moving weapon can penetrate a shield, putting knives and similar weapons in common use. The beam of energy weapons called lasguns react violently with a shield, creating an unpredictable explosion comparable to sub-atomic fusion which can kill the operator, shield wearer, and surrounding individuals. Fremen do not use shields because they also attract the native giant sandworms of Arrakis and drive them into a killing frenzy. As a result, the Fremen {{have the advantage of}} being trained to not slow their knives when attacking, as those battling a shielded opponent do. Fremen use different archaic weapons such as maula <b>pistols,</b> <b>lances</b> and crossbows to great effect, but the most deadly and prized possession of a Fremen warrior is the crysknife.|$|R
50|$|Sala Mică de Arme (The Small Armory) {{is where}} {{predominantly}} Oriental (mostly Indo-Persian, Ottoman and Arab) arms and armor pieces are on exhibit, {{many of them}} made of gold and silver, and inlaid with precious stones. Included are chainmail armor, helmets, scimitars, yataghans, daggers, matchlocks, <b>lances,</b> <b>pistols,</b> shields, axes, and spears.|$|R
50|$|The Spanish tercio {{and later}} {{formations}} relegated cavalry to a supporting role. The pistol was specifically developed {{to try to}} bring cavalry back into the conflict, together with manoeuvres such as the caracole. The caracole was not particularly successful, however, and the charge (whether with sword, <b>pistol,</b> or <b>lance)</b> remained as the primary mode of employment for many types of European cavalry, although by this time it was delivered in much deeper formations and with greater discipline than before. The demi-lancers and the heavily armored sword-and-pistol reiters were among the types of cavalry whose heyday was in the 16th and 17th centuries, as for the Polish winged hussars, a heavy cavalry force that achieved great success against Swedes, Russians, and Turks.|$|R
2500|$|In September 1922, an army board met at RMC {{to look at}} the {{possibility}} of creating a museum in Fort Frederick. In January 1926, the Quartermaster General wrote the RMC commandant: “It is the desire of National Defence Headquarters to make the museum at the Royal Military College the principal storehouse for military relics of all natures...” In February 1926, a 12 page inventory of RMC’s holdings included hundreds of small arms, bayonets, scabbards, swords, <b>lances,</b> <b>pistols,</b> machine guns, grenades and bombs, clothing, trench stores, artillery ammunition, engineering models, and other miscellaneous articles. Many of these holdings were of the 1914-1918 vintage, and, many had been captured from the Germans, particularly during 1918.|$|R
5|$|Zahir's initial {{military}} forces consisted of his Zaydani kinsmen {{and the local}} inhabitants of the areas he ruled. They numbered about 200 men in the early 1720s, but grew to about 1,500 in the early 1730s. During this early period of Zahir's career, he also had the key military backing of the Bani Saqr and other Bedouin tribes. As he consolidated his hold over Galilee, his army rose to over 4,000 men, many of the later recruits being peasants who supported Zahir for protecting them against Bedouin raids. This suppression of the Bedouin in turn caused the tribes to largely withdraw their military backing of Zahir. The core of his private army were the Maghrebi mercenaries. The Maghrebis' commander, Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, also served as Zahir's top military commander from 1735 until al-Dinkizli's defection during the Ottoman siege of Acre in 1775. From the time Zahir reconciled with Sheikh Nasif al-Nassar of Jabal Amil in 1768 until most of {{the remainder of his}} rule, Zahir also had the support of Nasif's roughly 10,000 Metawali cavalrymen. However, the Metawalis did not aid Zahir during the Ottoman offensive of 1775. Zahir's fortified villages and towns were equipped with artillery installments and his army's arsenal consisted of cannons, matchlock rifles, <b>pistols</b> and <b>lances.</b> Most of the firearms were imported from Venice or France, and by the early 1770s, from the Russian imperial navy.|$|R
2500|$|Gallery no. 1 and 2 {{also known}} as Armoury wing A and B houses the armoury. This gallery is rich in {{technical}} skills and is used to display the various weapons like knives, guns, <b>pistols,</b> revolvers, cannons, <b>lances,</b> spears, shields, bows, arrows, rifles and so on. They are inscribed with holy verses from the Holy Quran. [...] Some weapons which need special attention are the Jamadhara and a bifurcated sword known as Zulfikar. [...] Both of them are associated with Mir Qasim. Some of the other most important artifacts are the swords of Alivardi Khan, Siraj ud-Daulah and so on. The dagger by which Muhammad i-Beg killed Siraj ud-Daulah {{can also be seen}} here. The magic mirrors (as discussed above) are kept just outside the gallery on the landing area of the staircase which leads to the upper floors. A huge cannon known as the Dutch cannon can be seen here which was given to Alivardi Khan by the Dutch Government in 1745. It is generally known as the Mir madan Cannon. Mir Madan was a trusted lieutenant of Siraj ud-Daulah who died in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 due to the bursting of this cannon.|$|R
30|$|The erect penis is {{likened to}} a weapon: weapon, sword, (vagina is Latin for “sheath, scabbard”), <b>pistol,</b> gun, rod, <b>lance,</b> bill, pike, dart, chopper, prick. 29 The very common prick {{in the sense}} “penis” is arguably a literal sense rather than a nonliteral one. The verb prick names {{the effect of a}} certain kind of event in which a sharp object penetrates a membrane; with little {{stretching}} of the imagination that describes the effect of inserting the penis into the vagina: intromission is an act in which the penis is the instrument of pricking, i.e. a prick, which makes this noun deverbal. According to the Oxford English Dictionary the noun and verb have co-existed since the earliest records in English. In addition to its current meaning, the verb prick has meant “to spur or urge a horse on” (OED 9 – 12) which links up with the copulation-as-riding metaphor, with the man as rider; “to thrust a stick (or pointed object) into something” (OED 25) which links up with the metaphor of the man as tailor stitching the woman—the man as tailor turns up in many bawdy folk songs, and in Grose et al. (1811); and prick up still means “to rise or stand erect with the point directed upward” (OED 28). It is hardly surprising, then, that the noun prick was used variously for (a) a thorn, a sting, and figuratively as a vexation or torment (OED 12); this could be partly responsible for some interpretations nonliteral prick; (b) a dagger or pointed sword (OED 15) links with the penis as weapon metaphor; (c) the upright pole of a tent (1497, OED 16); (d) it has long been a term for the penis. Although the earliest record for prick “penis” in the OED is 1592, there is the record of it being used as a term for a lover in 1540 (OED 17 b), which suggests at least a contemporary sense “penis”, too. In all probability, prick was used much earlier in this sense.|$|R
