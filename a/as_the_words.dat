25|$|Beginning in 1935, a {{group of}} {{prominent}} mathematicians collaborated under the pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki to publish a series of encyclopedic mathematics texts. These texts, written in an austere and axiomatic style, emphasized rigorous presentation and set-theoretic foundations. Terminology coined by these texts, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> bijection, injection, and surjection, and the set-theoretic foundations the texts employed, were widely adopted throughout mathematics.|$|E

Then these sutras may be properly regarded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the Buddha (Skt. buddhavacana).|$|E

The final uniformity of liturgical services became solidified after the church established a Biblical canon, being based on the Apostolic Constitutions and Clementine literature.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of Moses {{delivered}} {{before the}} conquest of Canaan, a broad consensus of modern scholars see its origin in traditions from Israel (the northern kingdom) brought south to the Kingdom of Judah {{in the wake of}} the Assyrian conquest of Aram (8th century BC) and then adapted to a program of nationalist reform in the time of Josiah (late 7th century BC), with the final form of the modern book emerging in the milieu of the return from the Babylonian captivity during the late 6th century BC. Many scholars see the book as reflecting the economic needs and social status of the Levite caste, who are believed to have provided its authors.|$|E
25|$|Rowling {{invented a}} great number of words and phrases for the books such as spells, incantations, magical words, items, and place names. Many of these words involve wordplay, rhyming, and {{historical}} references that are difficult to translate. A large number of spells are drawn from or inspired by Latin, and have a certain resonance with English speakers due to its relatively large proportion of Latinate-derived vocabulary. For example, priori incantatem (a spell which causes the last spells performed by a wand to be reproduced in reverse order) would be familiar to many English-speaking readers <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> prior (previous) and incantation (spell, charm). To create a similar effect in the Hindi version, the Sanskrit, typical in mantras, has been used for the spells. Some translators have created new words themselves; others have resorted to transliteration.|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt to}} redefine praeching {{in terms of}} Reformational {{theology}} In the field of biblical studies and hermeneutics, modern research, in many aspects results in questioning the authority of <b>the</b> Bible <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> of God. <b>The</b> consequences of these results often undermine preaching <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> of God. Within {{the theology of the}} re formation, preaching is based upon sound exegetical study and expository of the biblical text. Hence scientific exegetical research brings the authority of preaching to a crisis. This paper is an attempt to redefine preaching in order to incorporate the results of modem research, as well <b>as</b> to conserve <b>the</b> fundamental concept of preaching <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> of God...|$|R

500|$|A {{charitable}} trust created from a gift must be exclusively charitable; {{if there are}} any purposes which would not be charitable on their own, the trust fails. Trust instruments should ideally identify that the money is to be used for [...] "charitable purposes". The use of other words such as [...] "beneficial" [...] or [...] "benevolent" [...] causes the trust to fail at creation, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> are not synonymous with charity. An example is the Privy Council decision in Attorney General of the Cayman Islands v Wahr-Hansen, where the Council held that gifts to [...] "organisations or institutions operating for the public good" [...] and acting [...] "for the good or for the benefit of mankind" [...] failed, because the definition given was not exclusively charitable.|$|E
500|$|The Nahuatl noun has a {{relatively}} complex structure. The only obligatory inflections are for number (singular and plural) and possession (whether the noun is possessed, as {{is indicated by}} a prefix meaning 'my', 'your', etc.). Nahuatl has neither case nor gender, but Classical Nahuatl and some modern dialects distinguish between animate and inanimate nouns. In Classical Nahuatl the animacy distinction manifested with respect to pluralization, as only animate nouns could take a plural form, and all inanimate nouns were uncountable (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "bread" [...] and [...] "money" [...] are uncountable in English). Now, many speakers do not maintain this distinction and all nouns may take the plural inflection. One dialect, that of the Eastern Huasteca, has a distinction between two different plural suffixes for animate and inanimate nouns.|$|E

Robyn does not appear in the video. Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork said that the video is [...] "complete with awkward/sexy dancing and footage of bustling city life". Erika Brooks Adickman of Idolator wrote a mixed review of the clip, stating, [...] "We’re guessing Robyn didn’t want the “hassle” of appearing, so instead we’re treated to—seemingly—random grainy footage of the streets of Japan and gyrating women <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the chorus appear karaoke-style on the screen.

Cheerleaders M.I.A. and Minaj then sing the opening lyrics in a suburban neighborhood alongside other cheerleaders wearing animegao masks. Madonna sings the first verse as she exits {{a house with a}} baby stroller and wears a trench coat and sunglasses, all of which are soon discarded. Emerging football players protect her from obstacles, golden raindrops and destroy a car that gets in her way. They hold her perpendicular to a wall and she walks horizontally. Throughout the video, Madonna can be seen dancing and singing in front of a brick wall, and in one scene she holds a baby doll.|$|E
500|$|The film's abrupt cuts, {{artificial}} scenery, extreme close-ups, {{and twisted}} angles all metaphorically amplify {{the dark and}} somber narrative. Shots of film producers and critics in A Hollywood Extra are shot from low angles with dark backdrops, giving the characters a powerful and foreboding ambiance. Gregg Toland would make use of similar camera techniques in his later work on Citizen Kane. Due to the lighting, close-ups of the actors' faces are often shadowed, shrouding some of their features and depriving the characters of wholeness. The all-black backdrops in these close-ups also derive the film of a real-world presence. During {{a scene in which}} the protagonist await phone calls to learn about casting decisions, the image of a telephone is superimposed directly onto the actor's forehead, symbolizing his growing obsession with finding work. His failure to achieve success mocks him even after his death, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "No Casting Today" [...] appear next to his gravestone.

500|$|The clip portrays {{sexual assaults}} mostly against women, {{and how they}} cope after the incident. The {{black-and-white}} video opens with a warning message: [...] "The following contains graphic content that may be emotionally unsettling but reflects {{the reality of what}} is happening daily on college campuses." [...] It then shows a girl walking through an empty corridor, followed by young people in various activities in a college campus: reading (portrayed by actress Nikki Reed), a trans man adjusting his chest binder in the bathroom, attending a party (one of the partygoers being portrayed by actress Kiersey Clemons). However they are all sexually assaulted, with one of the scenes showing a couple of young girls being drugged and raped at the party. The heartbroken girls and the trans man cry, while alternate images show them expressing their emotions by inscribing words on themselves. Ultimately they find solace and hope in friendship, and leave the college with their friends, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> inscribed on their bodies change to positive messages. Near its ending, the music video displays the message: [...] "One in five college women will be sexually assaulted this year unless something changes", following which the message points the audience to the Facebook page for The Hunting Ground and Itsonus.org, the White House support website for people who have endured a sexual crime. A portion of the earnings from the song's digital sales will be donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault.|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a rating}} out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave the}} album a [...] rating of {{four and a half}} stars, stated that [...] "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [...] so well, no matter how many bands try." [...] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: [...] "The guitar solos ring out as joyful <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board {{was one of the best}} ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying [...] "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll." [...] The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's Toxicity and Mogwai's Rock Action. Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.|$|E
