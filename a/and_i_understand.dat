25|$|Would {{you ask me}} how I dare {{to compare}} the civil rights {{struggle}} with the struggle for lesbian and gay rights?

And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
25|$|On August 6 and August 7, the Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader visited Dubrovnik, {{which was}} {{followed}} by fires in that area. It prompted some county officials to make arson accusations against {{the nearby town of}} Trebinje in the neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mario Magud, the firefighting commander in Konavle, said: There are no firemen on the Trebinje side. Everything indicates that they set the fire themselves with the intention to burn Konavle and beyond. It's not a coincidence that, as soon as we localize one fire, a new fire breaks out.. Luka Korda, the chief of Konavle municipality, made similar accusations. The Bosnian civil defense secretary Stanko Slišković said it was not true that the Bosnian firemen did not do anything to prevent fires in the border area near Dubrovnik: Our people made the greatest effort to fight every fire where it was possible. Nobody can say with certainty where a fire started... I'm sorry this happened <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the indignation of the citizens of Dubrovnik, but it's not our fault. He claimed that the Bosnian civil defense cooperated well with their Croatian counterparts and said that the Bosnian forces could not fight the fires in the inaccessible or mined areas.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Bass {{stated that}} he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 {{decision}} to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has {{also said that he}} has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has [...] "made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon." [...] Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: [...] "At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, I’m really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don’t hate him at all. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> what he was going through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to some of}} these criticisms, Coto stated that he personally considered the two-part story [...] "" [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] that preceded [...] "These Are the Voyages..."

Berman said [...] "I've read a lot of the criticisms <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> how some people feel, but [...] and I {{spent a lot of time}} coming up with the idea and a somewhat, I would say, unique ending to a series, especially when you’re ending it prematurely. [...] You never like to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense to say that it was more a Next Generation episode than an Enterprise episode. The only elements of [...] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after [...] "Terra Prime"." ...|$|E

2500|$|Newkirk has {{replied to}} the {{criticism}} {{that no one is}} being exploited, the women taking part are volunteers, and if sexual attraction advances the cause of animals, she is unapologetic. Asked in 2007 how she feels when criticized from within the movement, she said: [...] "Somebody has to push the envelope. If you say something that someone already agrees with, then what's the point, and so we make some more conservative animal protection organizations uncomfortable; they don't want to be associated with us because it will be embarrassing for them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> that. Our own members write to us sometimes and say, 'Oh why did you do this? I don't want anyone to know I'm a PETA member.'" ...|$|E

I have never participated in acts of violence nor of bloodshed, nor have I killed anyone. And what I would like to clarify here is that I know that my mere participation, {{even though it was}} secondary in one incident, if it contributed to the violence in society, I am deeply sorry and I regret it ... I was in prison for almost 15 years. I have reflected a great deal over it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> that violence did harm to society; I understand it and I regret that I participated in it. I believe that things, a better society, are achieved by building and not by destroying ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2009, a {{blog post}} {{from the band}} {{expressed}} the hope that [...] "these songs will strike a chord and make a similar impact on all {{of you out there}} that were moved by this band in the first place." [...] Kinney said that the music on the album doesn't deviate too far from the band's past music, adding, [...] "It's nice to sound like yourself...It's not really that hard, actually. I know people are blown away that we really sound like ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the apprehension, but it's not really that big a stretch to sound the way that you sound." [...] There are hard rock as well as acoustic songs featured on the album. In addition, Elton John appears on the album's title track.|$|E

2500|$|Abbas then {{spoke to}} Captain De Rosa, he apologized to him saying [...] "We are truly sorry, because we didn't intend to hijack you, but our {{situation}} {{was such that}} we had to assume control for several hours." [...] De Rosa replied [...] "I am familiar with your situation <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it well. We understand the Palestinians, we understand the Palestinian aspirations, and for that reason we are all with you." [...] The radio contact allowed the International community to pinpoint the location of the vessel. The Israelis were able to provide information about Abba's radio discussions with the ship to the Reagan administration and notified them that it was Abbas' faction behind the hijacking. Fearing that the terrorists threat to kill passengers had been followed through, and not wanting a repeat of the TWA Flight 847 terrorist incident where the administration looked impotent to act, the American special forces staged in Cyprus were ordered to make preparations to storm the vessel.|$|E
2500|$|Scott {{wrote to}} the Liberal Party's Lloyd George who {{set up a meeting}} for a {{reluctant}} Weizmann with Herbert Samuel, President of the Local Government Board, who was now converted to Zionism. [...] On 10 December 1914 at Whitehall, Samuel offered Weizmann a Jewish home land complete with funded developments. [...] Ecstatic, Weizmann returned to Westminster to arrange a meeting with Balfour, who was also on the War Council. [...] He had first met the Conservatives in 1906, but after being moved to tears at 12 Carlton Gardens, on December 12, 1914, Balfour told Weizmann [...] "it is a great cause <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it". [...] Weizmann had another meeting in Paris with Baron Edmond Rothschild before a crucial discussion with Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George, on January 15, 1915. Whilst some of the leading members of Britain's Jewish community regarded Weizmann's program with distaste, the Herbert Samuel Memorandum as it came to be known was a watershed moment in the Great War and annexation of Palestine.|$|E

In the Alone in the Dark DVD commentary, he {{responds}} to criticism that his adaptations make significant changes to the plot and style of the source material: [...] "Fans are always totally flipping out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> that the fan of a video game has his own agenda {{in his head and}} has his ideas about what is a good movie and what is a bad movie." [...] Referring to House of the Dead, Boll said: [...] "I think I made a perfect House of the Dead movie, because it really shows how the game is. It's a lot of fun, it's over-the-top action." [...] Boll is especially critical of his Internet detractors. Referring to two Ain't It Cool News critics who negatively reviewed his work, Boll said, [...] "Harry (Knowles) and Quint (Eric Vespe) are retards." [...] Boll later claimed Knowles was being [...] "played" [...] by film studios that [...] "kissed his ass" [...] with set visits and pretend offers to produce large-budget films and suggested to Knowles the reason he did not like him was because, [...] "I never kissed your ass, Harry." ...|$|E

The University of Tennessee released a statement that it was investigating Reynolds as it does not condone language that encourages violence. [...] On September 27, 2016, the law school's Dean Melanie Wilson issued a statement to announce that the University had ended its short-lived investigation with a recommendation that no disciplinary action be taken. [...] Dean Wilson wrote that Reynolds' tweet [...] "...was an exercise of his First Amendment rights. Nevertheless, the tweet offended many members of our community and beyond, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the hurt and frustration they feel." [...] USA Today said that Reynolds had violated the newspaper’s standards and suspended his column for one month. Reynolds issued an apology at the request of USA Today saying:Wednesday night one of my 580,000 tweets blew up. I didn’t live up to my own standards, and I didn’t meet USA TODAY’s standards. For that I apologize, to USA TODAY readers and to my followers on social media. ... Those words can easily be taken to advocate drivers going {{out of their way to}} run down protesters. I meant no such thing, and I'm sorry it seemed I did. What I meant is that drivers who feel their lives are in danger from a violent mob should not stop their vehicles. I remember Reginald Denny, a truck driver who was beaten nearly to death by a mob during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.|$|E
