A testbattery was designed to capture high-level measures of visual working memory and low-level measures of visuospatial attention and memory. To answer questions of how cognitive ageing affects specific aspects of visual processing capacity, we used confirmatory factor analyses in Structural Equation Modelling (SEM; Model 2), informed by functional structures that were modelled with path analyses in SEM (Model 1). The results show that <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> were selective to measures of visual processing speed compared to visual short-term memory (VSTM) capacity (Model 2).

Relative <b>Age</b> <b>Effect</b> researches are categorized and examined with respect to the developmental differences among birth-month, sporting event, historical change, change of sport-career, international comparison, gender difference, etc. The Relative <b>Age</b> <b>Effect</b> varies with sporting events, countries, gender and playing level etc. The Relative <b>Age</b> <b>Effect</b> is not similar historically even in the same event because it is influenced by the social conditions around sports at any given time.

The performance of these monitored drift tubes (MDTs), in particular their spatial resolution of 80 Âµm, determines the precision of the spectrometer. If <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> occur, the precision of the drift tubes will be degraded. Hence <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> have to be minimized or avoided altogether if possible.

Then, the papers devoted to scheduling problems combining the effects of learning and ageing are discussed.

After thorough analysis it turned out that both scheduling problems with learning effect, and with ageing effect, as well as, in particular, the problems with models merging learning and <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> do not have any reasonable real-life applications. This is because the learning and <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> are in general long time horizon phenomena observed in repetitive systems and scheduling theory concerns either with repetitive short-horizon planning problems or single long-horizon projects.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{addresses}} the strain <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> on the mechanical {{properties of the}} partially damaged structural mild steel. Since repairing partly damaged structures may not occur immediately, the strain ageing effect can significantly influence the structural behaviour. The changes due to this effect have not so far been considered in the civil engineering design guidelines. In order to investigate strain <b>ageing</b> <b>effects,</b> two-stage experimental tests are carried out on the mild-steel specimens. In the first stage, partial damage is made using quasi-static loading. During the second stage, the strength and ductility of the specimens are examined after 2 and 7 days âageingâ at room temperature {{and the results are}} compared with the corresponding no-age samples. The microstructure of the specimens is examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To illustrate the effect of strain ageing on the global behaviour of steel structures, a numerical example is provided in which strain ageing impacts on loading capacity and deflection of a steel beam. Finally, the stressâstrain relation of partially damaged mild-steel material incorporating strain <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> is expressed by calibrating the parameters of RambergâOsgood model. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum {{insulation}} panels (VIPs) are a {{high performance}} thermal insulation material offering {{an alternative to}} thick wall sections and large amounts of traditional insualtion in modern buildings. Thermal performance over time {{is one of the}} most important properties of VIPs, and the <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> on the thermal properties have been studied. Laboratory studies of <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> are conducted over a relatively limited time frame. To be able to effectively evaluate <b>ageing</b> <b>effects</b> on thermal conductivity accelerated ageing experiments are necessary. As of today, no standardized methods for accelerated ageing of VIPs exist. By studying the theoretical relationship between VIP properties and external environmental factors possible factors for accelerated ageing are proposed. Sample experiments have been performed to study whether the theoretical relationship can be replicated in practice. These experiments are still ongoing. The factors that are found to contribute most to ageing of VIPs are elevated temperature, moisture and pressure. By varying these factors a substantial acceleration of ageing of VIPs can be achieved. However, due to variation of air transmission rates (ATR) and water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) for varying external climate an exact evaluation of accelerating effect is difficult.

Using 6 novel DNAmethylation data sets, we show that HIV infection leads to an increase in epigenetic age both in brain tissue (7. 4 years) and blood (5. 2 years).
