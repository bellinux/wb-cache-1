5|$|Race {{relations}} were tense during the Reconstruction era, <b>as</b> <b>whites</b> resisted freedmen {{being allowed to}} choose their labor, vote, and have freedom of movement. Following a fire that damaged many businesses, the riot of 1871 erupted, with whites attacking blacks in the community. The black community had expanded after the war, as people moved to the city for more opportunity and to create community away from white supervision.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and race {{relations}} in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation <b>as</b> <b>whites</b> imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E
5|$|As Southern {{states began}} the process of forming governments, Johnson's {{policies}} received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners {{to ensure that the}} war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African Americans be improved. Voting rights were less important—after all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave African-American men the right to vote on the same basis <b>as</b> <b>whites,</b> and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's inaction on black suffrage as an experiment, to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners felt emboldened. A number of Southern states passed Black Codes, binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit, and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor. Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the most prominent being Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory annual message to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Biracial and Multiracial {{people are}} {{one of the fastest growing}} racial groups in the United States. Individuals with a mixed {{identity}} have the ability to choose endless racial/ethnic designations that best exemplify their racial/ethnic social identity. However, people who are racially/ethnically mixed may receive criticism if their proclaimed identity does not coincide with the societal perceptions of their racial/ethnic identity. People who identify with more than one race or ethnicity and have White ancestry can be perceived <b>as</b> <b>White</b> by society. Therefore, Biracial and Multiracial people have the ability to pass <b>as</b> <b>White</b> if they have White ancestry and appear White. This study explored racially/ethnically mixed peoples' perceptions of passing <b>as</b> <b>White.</b> Qualitative surveys were conducted to find if Biracial and Multiracial people thought they could pass <b>as</b> <b>White.</b> When Biracial and Multiracial people have the ability to pass <b>as</b> <b>White,</b> they are associated with the White group. Association with the White group equates to being afforded advantages and benefits. Thus, White privilege may be afforded to racially/ethnically mixed people who pass <b>as</b> <b>White.</b> Qualitative interviews were used to explore if Biracial and Multiracial people identified with having White privilege. The research also examined the connection between Multiracial/ethnic people who can pass <b>as</b> <b>White</b> and White privilege. Findings suggest racially/ethnically people who can pass <b>as</b> <b>White</b> identified with having White privilege. Moreover, participants and a research team evaluation identified factors that contribute to passing <b>as</b> <b>White.</b> The findings presented in this study are significant as it explores the intersection between Biracial and Multiracial identity, passing <b>as</b> <b>White,</b> and White privilege. The information presented in this study implies that the phenomenon of passing is an important concept toward social justice and racial equity...|$|R
5|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{believed that}} security would {{come with a}} larger population, {{but was unable to}} attract colonists from Spain or from other New World colonies. By the late 18th century, Texas was one of the least populated regions of New Spain, with fewer than two inhabitants per square league. The population was relatively stagnant, having grown only to 3,169individuals in 1790 from 3,103 in 1777. Over half of the population was classified as Spaniards, with settled Indians making up the next largest category. Blacks, mostly slaves, made up less than 1% of the population in 1777, and only 2.2% of the 1793 census. Over two-thirds of the adults in Texas were married, and single men outnumbered single women, although there was a high percentage of widows. Intermarriage was fairly common, mostly between white men and women of mixed origin. Children from these unions often passed <b>as</b> <b>whites.</b> Illegitimate births increased steadily throughout the century, reaching 20% of all births in 1799. Despite the small population, however, Spain actively discouraged immigration to Texas, and a permanent garrison was placed in Nacogdoches in 1790 to keep foreigners from settling in the area. Immigrants from the United States were allowed to settle in Louisiana and Florida after taking an oath of allegiance, but were not required to convert to Roman Catholicism.|$|E

25|$|After {{slavery was}} abolished, segregationist attitudes {{in both the}} North and the South {{discouraged}} and even prevented African Americans from worshiping in the same churches <b>as</b> <b>whites.</b> Freed blacks most often established congregations and church facilities separate from their white neighbors, who were often their former masters. These new churches created communities and worship practices that were culturally distinct from other churches, including unique and empowering forms of Christianity that creolized African spiritual traditions.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: We {{explore the}} {{relationships}} between socially assigned race (‘‘How do other people usually classify you in this country?’’), selfidentified race/ethnicity, and excellent or very good general health status. We then take advantage of subgroups which are discordant on self-identified race/ethnicity and socially assigned race to examinewhether being classified by others <b>as</b> <b>White</b> conveys an advantage in health status, {{even for those who}} do not self-identify <b>as</b> <b>White.</b> Methods: Analyses were conducted using pooled data from the eight states that used the Reactions to Race module of the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Results: The agreement of socially assigned race with self-identified race/ethnicity varied across the racial/ethnic groups currently defined by the United States government. Included among those usually classified by others <b>as</b> <b>White</b> were 26. 8 % of those who self-identified as Hispanic, 47. 6 % of those who self-identified as American Indian, and 59. 5 % of those who self-identified with More than one race. Among those who self-identified as Hispanic, the age-, education-, and language-adjusted proportion reporting excellent or very good health was 8. 7 percentage points higher for those socially assigned <b>as</b> <b>White</b> than for those socially assigned as Hispanic (P 5. 04); among those who self-identified as American Indian, that proportion was 15. 4 percentage points higher for those socially assigned <b>as</b> <b>White</b> than for those socially assigned as American Indian (P 5. 05); and among those who self-identified with More than one race, that proportion was 23. 6 percentage points higher for those socially assigned <b>as</b> <b>White</b> than for those socially assigned as Black (P,. 01). On the other hand, no significant differences were found between those socially assigned <b>as</b> <b>White</b> who selfidentified <b>as</b> <b>White</b> and those socially assigned <b>as</b> <b>White</b> who self-identified <b>as</b> Hispanic, as American Indian, or with More than one race. Conclusions: Being classified by others <b>as</b> <b>White</b> is associated with large and statistically significant advantages in health status, no matter how one self-identifies...|$|R

The material culture depicted with these figures includes multi-barbed spears, spear-throwers, and woven bags. This is the most recent style. The anatomical detail common in the earlier styles is missing, and many of the images are shown in aggressive stances. At least one panel shows a battle with opponents arrayed in ranks opposite each other.|$|E
25|$|The Rhodesian economy {{experienced}} a modest {{boom in the}} early 1970s. Real per capita earnings for blacks and whites reached record highs, although the disparity in incomes {{between blacks and whites}} remained, with blacks earning only about one-tenth as much <b>as</b> <b>whites.</b> After 1975, however, Rhodesia's economy was undermined by the cumulative effects of sanctions, declining earnings from commodity exports, worsening guerilla conflict, and increasing white emigration. When Mozambique severed economic ties, the Ian Smith regime was forced to depend on South Africa for access to the outside world. Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined between 1974 and 1979, before full independence in 1980. An increasing proportion of the national budget, an estimated 30%–40% per year, was allocated to defence, and a large budget deficit raised the public debt burden substantially.|$|E
