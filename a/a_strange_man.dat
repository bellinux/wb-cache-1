Apparently the sultan found interest in the person and took the strange man as his servant. Some years had passed and the man had finally learned to talk in Javanese. According to him, he was a Portuguese (or in Javanese, Portegis) who was stranded from a shipwreck. He also claimed to have been a housebuilder, so the sultan ordered him to erect a fortress. Satisfied by the man’s work, the sultan gave him the title [...] "demang." [...] From then on that person was known as Demang Portegis or Demang Tegis.|$|E

2500|$|More than a {{week after}} the death of Mr. Starks, police {{departments}} {{on both sides of the}} city were still being swamped with excited calls about prowlers and gunshots. Reports arranged from the possible to the ridiculous, yet officers diligently checked every report. On Friday, May 10, officers rushed to a home on Olive street with reports of strange noises coming from an upstairs room. Officers found a cat thrashing about in a trash can. Again on Olive street, officers checked a report that <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>man</b> was on someone's porch. It turned out that he had stepped out of the rain to wait for a bus. On Magnolia street, a report of a prowler bumping up against a house turned out to be hedges being blown against it. On Sixteenth street, a family called in that they heard a tapping at their door. It was later discovered that a messenger was delivering a special letter. At one point, when white-faced calves broke loose around County Avenue and slept on lawns, frightened residents called to report [...] "white-faced things in the dark". Gunshots that were heard turned out to be someone shooting at something they thought was a prowler (usually a shadow), accidental discharges from people loading their guns, and even backfires from vehicles.|$|E

2500|$|When Owen's own {{anonymous}} {{review of}} the Origin appeared in the April Edinburgh Review he praised himself and his own axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things, and showed his anger at {{what he saw as}} Darwin's caricature of the creationist position and ignoring Owen's pre-eminence. To him, new species appeared at birth, not through natural selection. As well as attacking Darwin's [...] "disciples" [...] Hooker and Huxley, he thought that the book symbolised the sort of [...] "abuse of science to which a neighbouring nation, some seventy years since, owed its temporary degradation." [...] Darwin had Huxley and Hooker staying with him when he read it, and he wrote telling Lyell that it was [...] "extremely malignant, clever & I fear will be very damaging. He is atrociously severe on Huxley's lecture, & very bitter against Hooker. So we three enjoyed it together: not that I really enjoyed it, for it made me uncomfortable for one night; but I have got quite over it today. It requires much study to appreciate all the bitter spite of many of the remarks against me; indeed I did not discover all myself.– It scandalously misrepresents many parts..... It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me." [...] He commented to Henslow that [...] "Owen is indeed very spiteful. He misrepresents & alters what I say very unfairly..... The Londoners says he is mad with envy because my book has been talked about: what <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>man</b> to be envious of a naturalist like myself, immeasurably his inferior!" ...|$|E
