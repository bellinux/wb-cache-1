5|$|Ginobili is {{credited}} with being <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player,</b> over his personal performance, such as his accepting the Spurs' coaches decision of playing off the bench rather than being a starter. He is also known for his tough to defend passes such as the no-look pass and the pick-and-roll.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev was {{adept at}} the {{politics}} within the Soviet power structure. He was <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player</b> and never acted rashly or hastily; unlike Khrushchev, {{he did not}} make decisions without substantial consultation from his colleagues, and was always willing to hear their opinions. During the early 1970s, Brezhnev consolidated his domestic position. In 1977, he forced the retirement of Podgorny and became once again Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, making this position equivalent to that of an executive president. While Kosygin remained Premier until {{shortly before his death}} in 1980 (replaced by Nikolai Tikhonov as Premier), Brezhnev was the dominant driving force of the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s to his death in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; she was <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player</b> {{within the administration}} and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E

5|$|Drogba {{is renowned}} for {{performing}} in big games, with a goalscoring record at club level of 10 goals in 10 finals winning 10 trophies. Aside from his goalscoring ability, Drogba is also {{capable of providing}} assists to his teammates. Between the 2009–10 and 2011–12 seasons, he managed 24 assists in the Premier League, with an average pass success rate of 61.4 percent, owing to his vision and creativity on the ball. He provided 71 assists to teammates {{over the course of}} his entire career at Chelsea until May 2012, showing that he is also <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} women soccer players of all time, and by many as the best ever, Hamm was an athletic, dynamic, and technically gifted striker, renowned for her speed, skill, footwork, stamina, and ability on the ball, as well as her consistency. An excellent, agile dribbler, she was highly regarded for her control, as well as her grace, pace, and elegance in possession. A prolific goalscorer, she was known for her powerful and accurate striking ability, although she was also a creative and hard-working forward, and <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player,</b> who was equally capable of assisting many goals for her teammates, due to her accurate passing, and was also willing to aid her teammates defensively when possession was lost. She was capable of playing in any offensive position.|$|E
5|$|In the evenings, {{he coached}} the University of Toronto varsity team. It was through his {{coaching}} {{of this team}} that he {{became involved in the}} NHL. The team traveled regularly to the Boston area for games against colleges from that area, with great success. In 1926, Boston Bruins owner Charles Adams recommended him to Col. John S. Hammond, representing the owners of the new New York Rangers franchise, who was looking for someone to build his team. Smythe was hired to recruit a team, which he would then manage. But on October 27, 1926, before the Rangers had played a regular season game, Hammond fired Smythe in favour of Lester Patrick. Smythe believed that he lost his job by refusing to sign two-time NHL scoring champion Babe Dye, against Hammond's wishes. Smythe thought Dye was not <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E

5|$|Jackson quickly built a {{track record}} of never missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer was able to slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness that makes it difficult to view him as <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player.</b> Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E
5|$|The top ten in {{the general}} {{classification}} finished together {{in the next five}} stages, which were mostly friendly to sprinters and breakaways. Stage 20 was another time trial, one with an uphill finish. This time trial was won convincingly by Leipheimer, as only Contador and Valverde were within a minute of his winning time. This ride put Leipheimer 46 seconds off Contador's time. With the Vuelta's final stage flat and largely ceremonial, akin to the Champs-Élysées stage in the Tour de France, this stood as the final result, with Contador winning the Vuelta to complete his career triple; he also won the combination classification and its white jersey. Minor controversy followed the Vuelta; Contador alleged that Leipheimer was not being <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player</b> by seeming to ride the Stage 20 time trial with the aim of winning the Vuelta, after Contador had apparently been decided as the team's leader, though the team had not firmly chosen a leader as the race began.|$|E
5|$|The year's {{following}} the Carling O'Keefe era {{were marked by}} increasingly short ownership stints. Canadian businessman Harry Ornest bought the team off Carling O'Keefe for $5 million {{at the end of}} 1988 and then sold to the trio of McNall (60%), Candy (20%), and Gretzky (20%) for the same amount in 1991. Of the three, Candy is best remembered for his emotional investment in the team and <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player</b> award continues in his honour. Given McNall's indictment and Candy's early death, the era was tumultuous and the last in which the club regularly made front page headlines. The now money-losing team was sold to the Labatt Brewing Company through its TSN unit in 1994 for $4.5 million. At the time, Labatt also owned the Toronto Blue Jays. In 1995, Labatt was acquired by Interbrew; The Interbrew years saw two championships but also the worst Argo attendance of the modern era. Interbrew soon lost interest in sports ownership and the team was sold again at the end of 1999 to New York businessman Sherwood Schwarz.|$|E

25|$|While picking LaHood drew {{praise for}} its {{bipartisan}} symbolism {{there was also}} a sense that LaHood’s lack of expertise would diminish the department’s role in 2009 major policy debates and leave him as more of a ceremonial figure. James Oberstar, the Democratic Congressman who chaired the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, was expected to hold more influence and will likely play a stronger leading role. Oberstar praised LaHood’s “temperament” and “managerial talent,” but when asked to cite an issue LaHood championed during his time on the Transportation Committee in the 1990s, Oberstar seemingly drew a blank. “I can’t point to any specific legislation that he authored,” he said. “He was <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player</b> all the way through.” Oberstar said LaHood would play a supporting role on tough policy calls.|$|E
25|$|Bryant was {{assigned}} by the Lakers {{to play in the}} 1997 NBA Summer League to improve as <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player</b> and learn where to send the ball when he drew double teams. The following season, Bryant was voted as a starter in the 1998 All-Star Game though he was a reserve on the Lakers. The Lakers struggled after the All-Star break, losing seven of their first 12 games, and Bryant had a stretch where he made only 30 of 100 shots. O'Neal wanted a championship immediately, and {{he did not want to}} wait for Bryant to mature as a player. Harris thought the NBA and its television broadcaster, National Broadcasting Company (NBC), were overexposing Bryant and that he became more of a one-on-one player after the break. Bryant's playing time became reduced. The Lakers were eliminated in the 1998 playoffs in the conference finals after they were swept by the Jazz, 4–0.|$|E

25|$|A classic number 10, Maradona was {{renowned for}} his {{dribbling}} ability, vision, close ball control, passing and creativity, {{and is considered}} one of the most skillful players ever. He had a compact physique, and with his strong legs and low center of gravity he could withstand physical pressure well while running with the ball. Dutch legend Johan Cruyff saw similarities between Maradona and Lionel Messi with the ball seemingly attached to their body when dribbling. His physical strengths were illustrated by his two goals against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup. He was a strategist and <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player,</b> as well as highly technical with the ball. He could manage himself effectively in limited spaces, and would attract defenders only to quickly dash out of the melee (as in the second 1986-goal against England), or give an assist to a free teammate. Being short, but strong, he could hold the ball long enough with a defender on his back to wait for a teammate making a run or to find a gap for a quick shot. He showed leadership qualities on the field and captained Argentina in their World Cup campaigns of 1986, 1990 and 1994.|$|E
500|$|Thierry Henry {{paid tribute}} to Larsson's {{contribution}} to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, [...] "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player.</b> You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>player.</b> He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision."
