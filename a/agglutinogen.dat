40|$|The {{existence}} of certain structures designated as <b>agglutinogens</b> {{on the red}} cell envelope has been inferred from the reactions, hemolysis and agglutination, which occur on contact with specific antisera.

40|$|Strains of Bordetella {{pertussis}} {{in which}} all the organisms contain <b>agglutinogens</b> 1 and 3 or 1, 2 and 4 are easy to identify as serotypes 1, 0, 3, 0 and 1, 2, 0, 4 respectively; and similarly, stable strains of serotype 1, 0, 3, 4 are occasionally found. During repeated subcultures, passage in vivo, and lyophilization and preservation for many years, these serotypes do not change. Mixing 1, 0, 3, 0 and 1, 2, 0, 4 serotypes and culturing them together in vivo and in vitro produces cultures from which organisms of the same two serotypes can be isolated. In contrast, strains which type as 1, 2, 3, 4 are often a heterogeneous group. We have attempted to classify these as "stable", "variable" and "mixed" cultures. Some strains comprise organisms all of which contain the four <b>agglutinogens</b> and are as easy to type as the strains described above. These we have called "stable" 1, 2, 3, 4 strains.

40|$|Bordetella {{pertussis}} expresses {{factors such}} as filamentous hemagglutinin, <b>agglutinogens,</b> pertactin, and pertussis toxin, which participate in bacterial adhesion; pertussis toxin, dermonecrotic toxin, lipopolysaccha-ride, and tracheal cytotoxin, which are responsible for toxic effects; and adenylate cyclase-hemolysin, which is required to initiate infection. By using a murine respiratory model, we showed that the RGD sequences of filamentous hemagglutinin and pertactin are important for bacterial persistence. However, mutants deficient in filamentous hemagglutinin and <b>agglutinogens</b> or in pertactin and the RGD sequence of filamentous hemagglutinin behaved as did wild-type B. pertussis, i. e., induced bronchopneumonia, alveolitis, and an influx of macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes into bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. These results suggest that these adhesins {{are not involved in}} the induction of pulmonary lesions following infection. The intensity of inflammation was markedly reduced after infection with mutants deficient in either hemolytic activity or pertussis toxin expression, whereas a mutant devoid of adenylate cyclase activity behaved as did the avirulent mutant. Pertussis toxin and adenylate cyclase-hemolysin may act indirectly by altering immune cell functions and thus allowing other factors, such as filamentous hemagglutinin, <b>agglutinogens,</b> and pertactin, to trigger adhesion and lipopolysaccharide, dermonecrotic toxin, and tracheal cytotoxin to induce their toxic effects.

Immunoelectrophoretic analysis of ether-water extracts of B. abortus revealed only two components, a lipopolysaccharide protein component, which was correlated with the A <b>agglutinogen,</b> and component 1. Component 1 from B. melitensis and B. abortus showed identity in gel diffusion tests, whereas component M from B. melitensis and component A from B. abortus showed partial identity with unabsorbed antisera and no cross-reactions with monospecific sera. Attempts to prepare monospecific sera directly by immunization of rabbits with cell walls or ether-water extracts were unsuccessful. Absorption of antisera with heavy fraction of ether-water extracts did not always result in monospecific sera. It was concluded (as has been described before) that the A and M antigens are present on a single antigenic complex, in different proportions depending upon the species and biotype, and that this component is a lipopolysaccharide protein complex of high molecular weight that diffuses poorly through agar gel.

Since any one of these may contain antigens in water-soluble form (secretors) or in alcohol-soluble form (non-secretors), there are now 160 X 2, 320 groups. The recently-discovered Rh antigens are combined into eight types...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} done to {{determine}} the major antigenic factors of Bordetella pertussis strains isolated throughout Canada and whether these isolates have the same antigenic structure as the bacilli in the currently used vaccines. Testing for the major pertussis antigens, factors 1, 2 and 3, was conducted with 440 freshly isolated strains of B. pertussis received from seven canadian provinces between August 1976 and February 1978 and six batches of pertussis vaccine or immunizing agents containing pertussis vaccine. With the aid of specific antisera prepared in rabbits, the antigenic factors were detected by a slide agglutination technique. Almost all (98. 9 %) of the pertussis strains examined were serotype 1, 3. All six batches of pertussis vaccine or immunizing agents containing pertussis vaccine proved to be rich {{in each of the}} three main pertussis <b>agglutinogens...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the partial {{saturation}} of precipitins with antigens related in derivation to the homologous one give no conclusive evidence of the regular existence in a single immune serum of multiple antibodies which act specifically on various chemical groups of the antigenic proteins. It seems possible to explain at least {{a part of the}} facts by the assumption that a single antibody will react to different degrees with several similar substances. By the partial absorption of hemagglutinins with heterologous blood, specific fractions were obtained. By such means one may readily differentiate the blood of related species, even when precipitins show but little difference. The peculiarities in specificity manifested by precipitinogens and <b>agglutinogens</b> suggest an essential difference in the chemical structures which determine the specificity of the two kinds of antigens...|$|R
