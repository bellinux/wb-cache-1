5|$|The genus Durio {{is placed}} by some taxonomists {{in the family}} Bombacaceae, or by others in <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> defined Malvaceae that {{includes}} Bombacaceae, and by others in a smaller family of just seven genera Durionaceae.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, George Bentham {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia in his Flora Australiensis. In Bentham's arrangement, {{the number of}} recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia dentata was placed in section Eubanksia alongside B.marginata and <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> defined B.integrifolia.|$|E
5|$|More taxonomic {{changes have}} {{occurred}} at the genus level, although these revisions have proven more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and brown lemurs due {{to a host of}} morphological differences.|$|E

5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread of cold viruses are {{physical}} measures such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E
5|$|Bouvet was {{the last}} member {{of a group of}} five battleships built to <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels.

5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as <b>a</b> <b>broadly,</b> or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E
5|$|Masséna was {{the fourth}} member {{of a group of}} five battleships built to <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. The first ship was Charles Martel, which formed the basis for Masséna and three other ships. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship Brennus, but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel Magenta, which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings. The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E

5|$|The present building, {{dating from}} around 1283 to 1537, mostly {{replaced}} the earlier monastic church founded in 1093 {{which was built}} in the Norman style. It is believed that the newer church was built around the older one. That the few remaining parts of the Norman church are of small proportions, while the height and width of the Gothic church are generous would seem to confirm this belief. Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept, which retains wall arcading and <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> moulded arch leading to the sacristy, which was formerly a chapel. The transept has retained an early 16th-century coffered ceiling with decorated bosses, two of which are carved with the arms of HenryVIII and Cardinal Wolsey.|$|E
5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, {{the bulk of the}} {{organism}} lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of , and has <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near the margin of the cap, and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of the cap. The cap surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from the cap, and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Elite Force, Wildstorm {{published}} a graphic novel based on Raven Software's story. The graphic novel was released in July 2000 as part of a Star Trek: Voyager graphic novel series produced by Wildstorm, written by British comic book authors Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. The book's artwork was produced by Jeffrey Moy and W.C. Carani. The book follows <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> similar storyline to that of the game, predominantly focusing on USS Voyager being trapped by the Forge, which is controlled by an ancient race, the Tarlus, for the purpose of creating an army to conquer the galaxy. The Elite Force graphic novel focuses on a limited number of the Hazard Team, and does not expand on the plot points created by the Etherians and the scavengers in the game, instead using the Borg to fill in these roles.|$|E

5|$|Uruguay had a {{very low}} {{population}} density and a weak government. Ordinary citizens were compelled by circumstances to seek the protection of local caudillos—landlords who were either Colorados or Blancos and who used their workers, mostly gaucho horsemen, as private armies. The civil wars between the two factions were brutal. Harsh tactics produced ever-increasing alienation between the groups, and included seizure of land, confiscation of livestock and executions. The antagonism caused by atrocities, along with family loyalties and political ties, made reconciliation unthinkable. European immigrants, who came in great numbers during {{the latter half of}} the nineteenth century, were drawn into one party or the other; both parties had liberal and conservative wings, so the social and political views of newcomers could be reconciled with either. The feuding blocs impeded development of <b>a</b> <b>broadly</b> supported central national administration.|$|E
