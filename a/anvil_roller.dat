50|$|The {{depth of}} the C-shaped frame is called the throat. The largest {{machines}} have throat sizes of 120 cm (48 inches), while smaller machines have throat sizes of about 60 cm (24 inches). The C stands vertically and {{is supported by a}} frame. The throat size usually determines the largest size of metal sheet that the operator can place in the machine and work easily. On some machines, the operator can turn the top wheel and anvil 90 degrees to the frame to increase the maximum size of the work piece. Because the machine works by an amount of pressure between the wheels through the material, and because that pressure changes as the material becomes thinner, the lower jaw and cradle of the frame that holds the <b>anvil</b> <b>roller</b> is adjustable. It may move with a hydraulic jack on machines designed for steel plate, or a jackscrew on machines designed for sheet metals. As the material thins, the operator must adjust the pressure to compensate.|$|E

The {{imprinter}} {{bottom roller}} is under very high linear pressure during the work, which often causes wear and damage between bottom roller and <b>anvil</b> <b>roller.</b> Traditionally, the extra strength design method is frequently {{used in the}} design of imprinter bottom roller, which leads to the waste of materials and increase of weights. So, reasonable processing craft and appropriate theoretical analysis method should be adopted to improve the manufacturing of bottom roller and make the material strength into full use, in the condition of meeting the structure safety standard. This paper gives a brief analysis of the process craft of bottom roller and uses finite element technique to give the bottom roller numerical simulation and FEA of its deflection and strength. The results show that: in the process of work, the distribution of stress changes largely and unevenly. The stress and deformation in middle part prove the largest with decreasing to both sides successively. The imprinter bottom roller produces a maximum displacement of 0. 0516 mm, which meets the work requirements...|$|E
25|$|To make {{glass from}} {{materials}} with poor glass forming tendencies, novel techniques {{are used to}} increase cooling rate, or reduce crystal nucleation triggers. Examples of these techniques include aerodynamic levitation (cooling the melt whilst it floats on a gas stream), splat quenching (pressing the melt between two metal <b>anvils)</b> and <b>roller</b> quenching (pouring the melt through rollers).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to determine the}} durability of Quad Flat No-Lead (QFN) package. The QFN package is useful for improving {{the reliability of the}} package. A mechanical fatigue test namely three points bending cyclic test and signal analysis were proposed in this paper. The three points bending cyclic test method is a test assembly that supports a specimen on two <b>anvils</b> or <b>rollers,</b> and symmetrically loads the specimen on the opposite surface with an <b>anvil</b> or <b>roller</b> using micro-tester machine. For strain signal collection, a strain gauge was connected to the dynamic data acquisition system, and it was used for each tested QFN package for determining the response of the captured cyclic strain signal. It was found that the sinusoidal amplitude pattern of signal response has been obtained during the constant three points bending cyclic test. The obtained response signals were then analysed using the Power Spectral Density...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a new cyclic {{test for the}} QFN package using the oxidised leadframe and good leadframe, namely the three-point assembly fixture with a rounded contact surface test method. The fixture of the test method is a test assembly that supports a specimen on two <b>anvils</b> or <b>rollers</b> and symmetrically loads the specimen on the opposite surface with an <b>anvil</b> or <b>roller</b> using Micro Tester; a micro tensile tester incorporating a deflection measuring device shall be used to generate a controlled board deflection rate. The validity of the mechanical test method can then be verified based on the stress analysis results and also be obtained in the experiments. Considering the QFN package delamination, lead cracking, package body cracking and cracking between the various lead statistically based on the experiments, it was shown during cyclic loads and the temperature conditions for the QFN package for delamination can be observed...|$|R
