5000|$|Tata Ace, India's first indigenously {{developed}} sub-one-ton minitruck, {{was launched}} in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed {{the dynamics of the}} light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport. By October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by <b>Autoline</b> Industries. [...] By 2005, <b>Autoline</b> was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors.|$|E

50|$|In late 2011, TrueCar raised {{significant}} {{debt and}} equity capital (>$200m) which enabled it to advertise nationally on television. Consumer usage increased {{in response to}} the television campaign that was developed in conjunction with TrueCar investor Guthy-Renker, but dealer and industry criticism was significant and well documented in a series of Automotive News articles. Painter, who is commonly associated with vehicle pricing transparency, up-front pricing and the value of big data in auto retail, received pushback from auto dealers and manufacturers over the fear that TrueCar was responsible for significant retail price discounting. The industry resistance led to nearly a dozen states launching investigations into the company's practices and policies. As a result, Painter and TrueCar underwent a nine-month regulatory compliance overhaul and initiated industry outreach programs. TrueCar went through a business turnaround in 2012 that resulted in the company reporting in its S-1 filing that it had generated positive adjusted EBITDA in 2013 after having lost over $40 million in 2012. In November 2012, Painter spoke directly to the industry about the current status of TrueCar in an <b>Autoline</b> TV interview and Painter was also recently featured in Forbes. In November 2012, TrueCar went back on television with new commercials and a completely new version of its web experience for both dealers and consumers.|$|E
5000|$|On February 22, 2010, ABC News {{broadcast}} a report which apparently demonstrated how unintended acceleration could {{be caused by}} inducing a short circuit in the throttle control. In the segment, Dave Gilbert, a PhD engineer and professor of automotive technology at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, was shown in a late-model Avalon with ABC News reporter Brian Ross. By [...] "inducing a short" [...] in an unspecified circuit, Gilbert was able to cause the Avalon to accelerate dramatically. After the car was stopped, a diagnostic tool connected to the cars ECU displayed no fault code. According to Dr. Gilbert, proper design of the ETC should not have permitted a short like the one he induced to open the throttle; the ECU should have detected a fault and cut the throttle. Tests on GM vehicles, Gilbert said, did not expose a similar flaw. Autoblogs analysis queried the tests real-world accuracy, noting that the short circuit method was not disclosed outside of wiring normally independent sensors together, the ECU could {{not be expected to}} detect unrealistic scenarios, and questioning ABC News and Brian Rosss objectivity. Autoblog also uncovered that Gilbert was being paid by parties in lawsuits against Toyota. Automotive analyst John McElroy on <b>Autoline</b> Detroit pointed to network news history of [...] "rigged" [...] car demonstrations, including the 60 Minutes acceleration demo and the Dateline NBC exploding truck scandal, and noted that BBC News report did not include opposing views or disclose interviewees financial ties. Toyota responded by inviting ABC News to be present at its evaluation of the test.|$|E
5000|$|On March 12, 2010, <b>Autoline</b> Detroit {{argued that}} {{searches}} for additional vehicle defects were likely fruitless, as driver error {{was the primary}} cause of the 0.009 per million rate of Toyota sudden acceleration incidents from 1999 to 2009, with [...] "demographics and psychographics", namely elderly drivers and pedal misapplication as factors. Also noted was that drivers with Type II diabetes (adult onset), which is more common among the elderly, are subject to reduced sensation in their lower extremities (peripheral neuropathy) with related impairment in positional knowledge of foot placement (proprioception). Wired wrote that since investigators have been [...] "unable to find evidence supporting drivers’ claims their Toyotas suddenly raced out of control" [...] operator error is the most likely explanation. However, victims and relatives of sudden acceleration cases are commonly unwilling to suspect involved loved ones, and blame the vehicle instead. [...] Analysis of alleged Toyota acceleration reports in The Atlantic and other sources have found the highest distribution of involved drivers between 70 and 80 years old, with the average age skewing over 55; with elderly susceptibility to [...] "neuronal misfiring" [...] and pedal misapplication as a possible cause. While many alleged cases lack exact details, over half of reported incidents occurred from a complete stop or low speed, providing a window for the pedal misapplication to occur. A prior GM study found that 60- and 70-year-olds were six times more likely to experience sudden acceleration than 20- to 30-year-olds. In the New York Times, Richard Schmidt concluded that a brake override system could prevent acceleration cases where a vehicle defect existed, but would not prevent sudden acceleration cases caused by pedal misapplication.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with changes in map work at the U. S. Geological Survey {{during the period from}} 1950 to 1974. At the start of this period, mapmaking at USGS was dominated by manual techniques organized to conform to twentieth-century advances in photogrammetry, drafting techniques, materials, and industrial organization. During the 1950 s and 1960 s, technologies that had been developed in other sectors of American science and industry were inserted into mapping processes with hopes of huge productivity gains and added efficiencies. The development paths of two in-house devices, Autoplot and <b>Autoline,</b> illustrate the ways in which cartographic automation became an agency policy as well as a powerful ideology...|$|E
40|$|This survey {{took place}} {{over a period of}} 12 days in November and December 1999 on the western slope of the Porcupine Bank and the western and eastern slopes of the Porcupine Seabight. Fishing was carried out in five {{separate}} areas, in depths between 400 and 2, 000 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish for the Marine Institute (MI) deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagase National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on a commercial long-liner, using commercial deep-water <b>autoline</b> gear. In total 18 species of chondricthyan, 24 species of teleost fish and 1 species of cephalopod were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were bird beak dogfish, leafscale gulper shark, Portuguese dogfish and mora. Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated as 42 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were birdbeak dogfish, black mouth dogfish and greater lantern shark. Catch per 1, 000 hooks (CPU E) was highest abundances were found in the western and northwestern slope of the Porcupine Bank. The catch rates in the slopes of the Porcupine Seabight were considerable lower. CPUE compared with rates from previous years in the northwestern slope, showed a reduction for the commercial species Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper shark...|$|E
40|$|A {{deepwater}} survey programme {{has been}} operated since 1993 by the Marine Institute (MI), {{in the deep}} waters of the Rockall Trough and Porcupine Bank. The first leg of the present survey took place {{over a period of}} 12 days in August 2000 on the Western slope of the Porcupine Bank and the western slopes of Rockall Bank and Hatton Bank. The second leg took place on the slopes and shelves of the Porcupine Bank. Fishing was carried out in depths between 150 and 1, 800 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain biological samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagase National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on the commercial long-liner "An Capall Bán," using commercial deepwater <b>autoline</b> gear. In total 26 species of chondricthyan and 24 species of teleost fish were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were birdbeak dogfish (22 %), leafscale gulpershark (14 %), Portuguese dogfish (8 %), tusk (17 %) and mora (8 %). Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated at 43 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were bird beak dogfish and greater lantern shark. Catch per unit effort showed that highest abundances were found in the northwestern slope of the Porcupine Bank at 600 - 700 metres and in the western slopes of Rockall Bank and Hatton Bank at 1, 000 to 1, 200 metres depths...|$|E
40|$|South Georgia is a large, old, and {{isolated}} oceanic archipelago in the Atlantic {{sector of the}} Southern Ocean. It {{is surrounded by a}} wide continental shelf which is highly productive, rich in biodiversity and one of the world’s largest Marine Protected Areas. Most of its ~ 1450 species live on the seabed, many are endemic or at the edge of their geographic ranges, but are still quite poorly known. This UK overseas territory is administered by the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and its waters are designated Food & Agricultural Organisation (FAO) area 48. 3. They form an important fishing ground for a well established fishery for the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides, a high value fish endemic to the Southern Hemisphere. There are many more fishing than scientific vessels visits to South Georgia and fishing boats, deploy lines at locations too steep or rough for most scientific sampling gear. This thesis investigates the potential for this fishery {{to be a source of}} much needed biodiversity information and evaluates how benthic invertebrate bycatch data is collected by fishing observers. After a general introduction, chapter 2 describes and compares the two longline systems (<b>autoline</b> and Spanish system) used around South Georgia. It also investigates how technical changes in the gear imposed through legislation was responsible for one of the best examples worldwide of successful management on reducing seabirds mortality from nearly 6000 birds yearly to almost zero in the recent years. Historical data was used to show how both gear types have evolved and new weighting regimes adopted. Chapter 3 investigated a method to potentially improve collection of benthic bycatch information by observers, by reducing routine workload. An electronic monitoring system (EM) was designed and installed on a longline vessel to record footage of fishing activity. Data collected was compared to that from human observers, which could optimise that during settings by ~ 89 % of the time spent by the observer. Hauling monitoring operations were reduced by ~ 56 %. Species identification agreement across techniques was high for vertebrate, and for some groups of invertebrates, especially larger specimens. For detection of small benthic bycatch the video technique showed clear limitations but with the expected reduction in workload, more time will be available for observers identify through direct collection of VME taxa by the crew during hauling operations. Chapter 4 examines the composition of benthic bycatch particularly those constituting Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) from trials in well known fishing grounds. Bycatch composition collected did not differ with gear type but significantly varied with area and depth. In total 199 taxa were found in the study period, of which 28 represented new records for South Georgia and at least one species of Holothuroidea (Laetmogonidae) was previously undescribed. These new records are compared with previous distribution and maps showing the previous and new range are shown. Chapter 5 shows the spatial and bathymetric distribution of the most important VME groups using information collected by observers. The amount (CPUE) of bycatch of each fishing gear is compared and differed significantly with gear type system where invertebrate bycatch is higher on Spanish than <b>autoline</b> system. The quality of the data collected by these observers are then assessed and compared with longline trials in the same area. Two methods of observation used by observers are also evaluated showing significant differences in CPUE and numbers of VME groups identified. The general findings, implications and recommendations are then given in a general discussion...|$|E
40|$|The present survey {{took place}} {{over a period of}} 12 days in August 1997 along the eastern slope of Rockall Trough between 53 and 58 ºN {{including}} the Northern slope of the Porcupine Bank. Fishing was carried out in six separate areas, in depths between 300 and 2, 925 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish for the Marine Institute (MI) deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagasc National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on the Norwegian commercial long-liner "Skarheim," using commercial deep-water <b>autoline</b> gear. In total over 70, 000 hooks were set during the trip and on average 80 % of these were baited. In total 20 species of chondricthyan and 18 species of teleost fish were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus (36 %), bird beak dogfish Deania calcea (21 %), Portuguese dogfish Centrascyflium coefofepis (13 %), tusk, Brosme brosme (11 %) and mora, Mora mora (6 %). Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated as 30 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were bird beak dogfish and greater lantern shark Etmopterus princeps. Catch per 1, 000 hooks showed that highest abundances were found at 600 - 1, 100 metres throughout the whole fishing area. Three settings were made at depths between 2, 000 and 3, 000 meters. These shots gave valuable information about depth distribution of different species and also brought up species that have never been recorded in the Rockall Trough before...|$|E
40|$|The {{longline}} fisheries for ling (Molva molva) and tusk (Brosme brosme) {{have long}} traditions in Norway. Blue ling (Molva dipterygia) {{was always a}} by-catch in Norwegian slope waters but about 15 years ago this species became {{the target of a}} deep-water gill-net fishery. In recent years 5 - 10 % of the firsthand value of Norwegian landings was attributed to these species. This report provides an overview of the fisheries and population biology of the three species, with emphasis on aspects of relevance to future stock assessments, based on results from Norwegian investigations in 1993 - 95 and literature reviews. The Norwegian fleets which target ling, tusk and blue ling are the high-seas <b>autoline</b> vessels which operate in waters to the west and north of the British Isles, in the North Sea and at the Faroes and Iceland, and longline and gill-net vessels of various sizes fishing in home waters along the Norwegian slope. Exploitation occurs {{in all parts of the}} distribution area of the species. It is still unclear whether separate stocks occur in different sub-areas. Spawning areas are wide-spread, also the distribution of eggs and larvae. Very little is known about migrations. The age and size structure of the catches in various fishing areas show only minor variation. New studies by electrophoresis of tissue enzymes and hemoglobins indicate that tusk from all areas sampled in the northeastern Atlantic belong to the same gene pool, where the results for ling and blue ling are inconclusive. Estimates of mortality show that exploitation rates are high, and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) analyses of ling and tusk based on both private and official logbooks from the longliners indicate a considerable decline in the population sizes since the 1970 s. The catch per unit of effort may have declined by about 70 %. Strategies and requirements for future monitoring by improved CPUE measures and age-based assessement models are discussed. NORSK SAMMENDRAG:Linefisket etter lange og brosme har lange tradisjoner i Norge. Blålange har alltid vært tatt som bifangst i fisket på Eggakanten, men for rundt 15 år siden startet et direkte garnfiske etter denne arten på dypt vann. De sener år har disse artene gitt 5 - 10 % av førstehåndsverdien i norske landinger. Denne rapporten gir en oversikt over fisket og bestandsbiologien til disse tre artene med spesiell vekt på ting som er relevante for framtidige bestandsberegninger basert på resultat fra norske undersøkelser fra 1993 - 95 og relevant litteratur. Lange, brosme og blålange fiskes av den havgående autolineflåten i områdene vest og nord av de Britiske øyer, i Nordsjøen og ved Færøyane og Island. Dessuten av line- og garnbåter av forskjellig størrelse i hjemlige farvann langs Eggakanten...|$|E
