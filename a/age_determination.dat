5|$|Males {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of 15, but do not {{typically}} reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years. One male, known as Old Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia. This would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of <b>age</b> <b>determination</b> is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we present nine {{radiocarbon}} <b>age</b> <b>determinations</b> producing a minimum age and a minimum age range for a regionally distinct rock art style known as the Northern Running Figures from Red Lily Lagoon, western Arnhem Land Australia. These radiocarbon <b>determinations</b> provide <b>age</b> constraints for both Pleistocene and early Holocene rock art in western Arnhem Land. The radiocarbon <b>age</b> <b>determinations</b> are produced from extracting calcium oxalate contained within mineral crusts associated with the rock art. Significantly this study employs a novel separation technique, designed to effectively isolate the oxalate compounds from the mineral crust sample using chemical pre-treatment, and demonstrates significant time offsets between radiocarbon <b>age</b> <b>determinations</b> for the calcium oxalates and other carbon inclusions contained within mineral crusts. © 2016, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{hypothesis is that}} it was formed {{at the same time as}} the large crater Odysseus which lies near a pole of the Ithaca Chasma. When the impact that created Odysseus occurred, the shockwave may have traveled through Tethys and produced a circumcircular fracture analogous to outer ring graben of multiring impact basins. However, <b>age</b> <b>determination</b> based on crater counts in high resolution Cassini images showed that Ithaca Chasma is older than Odysseus, making the impact hypothesis unlikely.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that Ithaca Chasma formed as Tethys's {{internal}} liquid water solidified, causing the moon to expand and cracking the surface to accommodate the extra volume within. The subsurface ocean may have resulted from a 2:3 orbital resonance between Dione and Tethys early in the Solar System's history that led to orbital eccentricity and tidal heating of Tethys's interior. The ocean would have frozen after the moons escaped from the resonance. There is another theory about the formation of Ithaca Chasma: when the impact that caused the great crater Odysseus occurred, the shock wave traveled through Tethys and fractured the icy, brittle surface. In this case Ithaca Chasma would be the outermost ring graben of Odysseus. However, <b>age</b> <b>determination</b> based on crater counts in high-resolution Cassini images showed that Ithaca Chasma is older than Odysseus making the impact hypothesis unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Although {{physical}} characteristics and sizes at various instars {{have been used}} to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in gene expression. Three genes were measured in an experiment with Drosophila melanogaster: bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because {{they are likely to be}} in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed. However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high confidence level. Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique. One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of <b>age</b> <b>determination</b> is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages. The hope is that with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Major, {{trace element}} and K-Ar <b>age</b> <b>determinations</b> are {{reported}} for a suite from the Yamadağı volcanics in the Eastern Anatolia. The exposed rocks mainly consist of medium-potassium calc-alkaline basaltic andesites, andesites and dacites. Petrographical data exhibit disequilibrium mineral textures, such as resorption of the ferromagnesian phases, clinopyroxene-mantled orthopyroxene, and sieve-textured plagioclases. The Yamadağı volcanics have a calk-alkaline character, and trace element characteristics exhibit that the volcanics resemble subduction zone volcanics and/or volcanics assimilated by continental crust. K/Ar <b>age</b> <b>determinations</b> {{show that the}} Yamadağı volcanics were formed during the 12 ± 0. 5 − 15 ± 0. 5 Ma time interval.

500|$|The {{half-life}} of carbon-14 is 5,730±40 years. Libby {{realized that}} when {{plants and animals}} die they cease to ingest fresh carbon-14, thereby giving any organic compound a built-in nuclear clock. He published his theory in 1946, and expanded on it in his monograph Radiocarbon Dating in 1955. He also developed sensitive radiation detectors that could use the technique. Tests against sequoia with known dates from their tree rings showed radiocarbon dating to be reliable and accurate. The technique revolutionised archaeology, palaeontology and other disciplines that dealt with ancient artefacts. In 1960, {{he was awarded the}} Nobel Prize in Chemistry [...] "for his method to use carbon-14 for <b>age</b> <b>determination</b> in archaeology, geology, geophysics, and other branches of science".

2500|$|<b>Age</b> <b>determination</b> of {{this star}} shows some {{variation}} {{based on the}} method used. Statistically, for stars hosting a debris disk, the luminosity of this star suggests an age of about 20–150 million years.

Given the star's position on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of luminosity versus temperature, it has an estimated age {{in the range of}} 30–1,128 million years. λ Boötis stars like this are generally young, {{with a mean age of}} a billion years. More accurately, asteroseismology also suggests an age of approximately a billion years. [...] However, this is disputed because it would make the planets become brown dwarfs to fit into the cooling models. [...] Brown dwarfs would not be stable in such a configuration.
