5|$|A third bore of the tunnel, {{replacing}} the old Victorian northbound bore, was proposed by Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson in 1989, but {{had yet to}} see <b>any</b> <b>progress</b> towards construction over a decade later. This option is not currently favoured by TfL due to technical problems with construction and engineering, difficulty tying in with the existing road network, and concern about increased traffic on the A12.|$|E
5|$|It {{originally}} {{started as}} a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it has retained its current, much shorter route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it {{became the subject of}} much concern for local residents regarding expansion which slowed down <b>any</b> <b>progress</b> for capacity improvement. By the late 2000s, the delays have come and gone and it has emerged as a state route that has been largely modernized to deal with heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{launched}} repeated {{assaults on}} Vukovar {{but failed to}} make <b>any</b> <b>progress.</b> Its armour, designed for combat in open country, was barely able to enter Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry was lacking, and the TO's poorly trained and motivated troops were inadequate substitutes. The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little {{understanding of how to}} conduct urban operations and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground.|$|E

5|$|The NATO-Russia Council {{meeting was}} mostly {{noted by the}} absence of both Russian {{president}} Vladimir Putin and of <b>any</b> <b>progress</b> concerning the ratification of the adapted CFE treaty or the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia and Moldova. NATO leaders further welcomed progress made by Ukraine towards membership in the NATO-Ukraine Commission meeting and discussed some general and mostly symbolic topics with its non-NATO counterparts during the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council meeting.|$|E
5|$|Though Scott drew heavily {{upon his}} wife's intense {{personality}} in his writings, {{much of the}} conflict between them stemmed from the boredom and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing. She would often interrupt {{him when he was}} working, and the two grew increasingly miserable throughout the 1920s. Scott had become severely alcoholic, Zelda's behavior became increasingly erratic, and neither made <b>any</b> <b>progress</b> on their creative endeavors.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials. The end result of this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors. Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting social situation is devoid of <b>any</b> <b>progress.</b> Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E

The regiment and brigade {{were part of the}} force assigned to attack Shunet Nimrin. Once again they advanced through Turkish artillery fire, and confronted by Turkish strong points in the foothills, were unable to make <b>any</b> <b>progress.</b> That night they moved back across the Jordan, having suffered three dead and eleven wounded.|$|E
5|$|Zachary Taylor (November 24, 1784 – July 9, 1850) was the 12th President of the United States, serving from March 1849 {{until his}} death in July 1850. Before his presidency, Taylor was a career officer in the United States Army, rising to the rank of major general. Taylor's status as a {{national}} hero {{as a result of his}} victories in the Mexican–American War won him election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs. His top priority as president was preserving the Union, but he died sixteen months into his term, before making <b>any</b> <b>progress</b> on the status of slavery, which had been inflaming tensions in Congress. He is the first and only President to come from Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00, {{delayed by}} {{the effect of}} the Rock of Gibraltar on the wind, the British {{squadron}} rounded Gibraltar and found the French and Spanish ships still assembling at Cabrita Point. The light wind prevented any rapid movement, and Saumarez began to slowly tack towards the combined squadron in line of battle formation. The delay with Moreno's departure had been due to the state of the captured Hannibal, renamed Annibal, which was unable to make <b>any</b> <b>progress</b> under its jury masts and had been taken under tow by the frigate Indienne. Sighting Saumarez's force, Moreno instructed Indienne and Hannibal to return to Algeciras and at 19:45 issued orders {{for the remainder of the}} squadron to sail eastwards through the Gut of Gibraltar towards Cadiz. He also, following Spanish naval tradition, disembarked his flagship Real Carlos and transferred to the frigate Sabina, persuading Linois to quit Formidable and do the same.|$|E

5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed into public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators could not make <b>any</b> <b>progress</b> with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started to take an active interest in the restoration {{of the canal}} from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the lock gates to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or <b>any</b> <b>progress.</b> The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|Late {{one night}} in 1997, Boston Herald {{reporter}} Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn by William Youngworth {{to see what was}} purported to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. Youngworth was a career criminal and associate to New England art thief Myles Connor Jr. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting. It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit speaking to Youngworth after not making <b>any</b> <b>progress.</b> The painting has since disappeared.|$|E

5|$|The Bourbon Spanish and French land force {{continued}} to bombard Gibraltar, inflicting further {{damage on the}} town's somewhat weak fortifications but were unable to make <b>any</b> <b>progress</b> against the reinforced garrison. They were being vigorously opposed with counter-bombardments, which killed many of their number, and by sallies, two of which were carried out successfully by the confederates on 23 and 31 December. Relations steadily worsened between the Spanish and French components of the besieging force, a trend that was exacerbated {{by the lack of}} progress they were making, the appalling conditions they were enduring in the open and the steady stream of casualties being caused by the counter-bombardment and outbreaks of epidemic disease. The weather, too, was terrible, with storms and heavy rain making life a misery. By the New Year of 1705, the besieging force was disintegrating and had dropped in numbers from around 7,000 men to only 4,000, the remainder having either become casualties or simply deserting.|$|E
5|$|While the Iwasa Unit {{arrived at}} its attack {{position}} on 8March, its {{assault on the}} American perimeter was delayed until the next day. Hill 700, in the 37th Division's sector, was held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the US Army's 145th Infantry Regiment. Several small skirmishes were fought between these units and elements of the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment on 8March, and the 37thDivision's artillery bombarded areas from where the Japanese could potentially launch {{an attack on the}} 2nd Battalion, 145th Infantry. The 23rd Infantry Regiment belatedly began to attack just after midnight on 9March, but was unable to penetrate far into the American defenses. After daybreak on 9March, elements of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 145th Infantry Regiment counterattacked the Japanese, and regained most of the terrain which had been lost. The Iwasa Unit attacked again at 6:45am on 10March, but did not make <b>any</b> <b>progress.</b> At 5:00pm that day parts of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 145th Regiment launched a well coordinated attack, and managed to recapture more of the area lost on 9March. The remaining men of the Iwasa Unit conducted an offensive against Hill 700 on the night of 10/11March, but only managed to capture a single pillbox. Further Japanese attacks on the morning of 11March were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In the West, the Muslims {{continued}} to make steady advances, as the local Byzantine forces proved inadequate: the Empire was forced {{to rely on the}} aid of their nominal Italian subjects, and had to resort to the transfer of the eastern fleets to Italy to achieve <b>any</b> <b>progress.</b> Following the fall of Enna in 855, the Byzantines were confined to the eastern shore of Sicily, and under increasing pressure. A relief expedition in 868 achieved little. Syracuse was attacked again in 869, and in 870, Malta fell to the Aghlabids. Muslim corsairs raided the Adriatic, and although they were driven out of Apulia, in the early 880s they established bases along the western Italian coast, from where they would not be completely dislodged until 915. In 878, Syracuse, the main Byzantine stronghold in Sicily, was attacked again and fell, largely because the Imperial Fleet was occupied with transporting marble for the construction of the Nea Ekklesia, Basil's new church. In 880, Ooryphas' successor, the droungarios Nasar, scored a significant victory in a night battle over the Aghlabids who were raiding the Ionian Islands. He then proceeded to raid Sicily, carrying off much booty, before defeating another Muslim fleet off Punta Stilo. At the same time, another Byzantine squadron scored a significant victory at Naples. These successes allowed a short-lived Byzantine counter-offensive to develop in the West in the 870s and 880s under Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, expanding the Byzantine foothold in Apulia and Calabria and forming the thema of Longobardia, which would later evolve into the Catepanate of Italy. A heavy defeat off Milazzo in 888, however, signalled the virtual disappearance of major Byzantine naval activity in the seas around Italy for the next century.|$|E
