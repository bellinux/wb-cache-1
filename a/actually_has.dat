5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism {{to conclude that}} the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> values of position or momentum.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} “Charlie” {{is in fact}} a {{reporter}} who is doing a story on Logan, and Logan punches him. Keith tells Harmony that her husband was not in fact cheating after all. Veronica obtains proof that another person, not one of the fraternity members, was with Claire the night she was raped. While retrieving Logan’s watch, Veronica learns that Logan <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> a half-brother.|$|E
50|$|While China {{had many}} men in Chinese cavalry, {{very few of}} them <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> horses to ride; and if they did <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> a horse, they did not ride well. In stark contrast, the {{military}} forces arising from Inner Asia had many horses and the men had excellent riding skills.|$|R

5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} is Troy's {{memorial}} {{service and the}} wedding of Mayor Michael Ebbs (Ralph Fiennes) to Charlie Bratley's mother Terri (Rita Wilson). Lou finally realizes that his son <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> been kidnapped and heads out to look for him. Now at Lee's house, Crystal asks Lee to help stop the kidnapping scheme, {{but he does not}} comply. Crystal goes to Dean's house for help, where she finds him hallucinating about Troy's death and finally expressing his grief. Meanwhile, a paranoid Lee, encouraged by Billy, tries to kill Charlie Bratley to avoid being caught, but Charlie fights back and slices the knife through Billy's eye. Billy runs out into the street, screaming in pain, and is hit by Lou's police car.|$|E
5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a hike in the local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E

5|$|Nick Hendricks (Bateman) and Dale Arbus (Day) {{are friends}} who despise their bosses. Nick {{works at a}} {{financial}} firm for the sadistic David Harken (Spacey), who implies {{the possibility of a}} promotion for Nick for months, only to award it to himself. Dale is a dental assistant being sexually harassed by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris (Aniston); she threatens to tell his fiancee Stacy (Lindsay Sloane) that he had sex with her unless he <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> sex with her. Nick and Dale's accountant friend Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) enjoys working for Jack Pellitt (Donald Sutherland) at a chemical company, but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack, the company is taken over by Jack's cocaine-addicted son Bobby (Farrell), whose apathy and incompetence threaten the future of the company.|$|E
5|$|Predators of waders {{breeding}} in wet grasslands include birds such {{as large}} gulls, common raven, carrion and hooded crows, and great and Arctic skuas; foxes occasionally take waders, {{and the impact}} of feral cats and stoats is unknown. Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find. In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were stress-related sudden death and twisted neck syndrome. Adults seem to show little evidence of external parasites, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats, and so they might be expected to invest strongly in their immune systems; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating ruffs intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance. The ruff can breed from its second year, and the average lifespan for birds that have passed the chick stage is about 4.4 years, although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.|$|E

25|$|The keys of the {{keyboard}} are connected by vertical pushrods to the escapements. When a key is pressed, the corresponding escapement is actuated, which releases a matrix from the magazine. With one exception, each key corresponds {{directly to a}} channel in the standard (90channel) magazine. The one exception is the lower-case letter e: that letter is used so often that the 90 channel magazine <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> 91 channels, with two channels (the leftmost two) both used for the letter e. Similarly, the 72channel magazine <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> 73channels, with the leftmost two being used for lower-case e. Alternate lines release matrices alternately from the two e channels in the magazine.|$|E

25|$|A simple {{example of}} a scale-invariant QFT is the {{quantized}} electromagnetic field without charged particles. This theory <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> no coupling parameters (since photons are massless and non-interacting) and is therefore scale-invariant, much like the classical theory.|$|E

25|$|D.sect. Diplophragma {{was defined}} as {{containing}} a single species, D.bipinnatifida (now Banksia bipinnatifida), which Brown thought contained two seed separators. The epithet Diplophragma is from the Greek diplo ("two") and phragma ("barrier"). It {{is not clear how}} Brown came to believe that this species has two seed separators, as it <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> none.|$|E
25|$|Although each {{nociceptor}} {{can have}} a variety of possible threshold levels, some do not respond at all to chemical, thermal or mechanical stimuli unless injury <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> occurred. These are typically referred to as silent or sleeping nociceptors since their response comes only on the onset of inflammation to the surrounding tissue.|$|E
25|$|As in any {{strictly}} convex solid, {{at least}} three faces meet at every vertex, and the total of their angles is less than 360 degrees. Since a regular polygon has angles at least 60 degrees, it follows that at most five faces meet at any vertex. The pentagonal pyramid (J2) is an example that <b>actually</b> <b>has</b> a degree-5 vertex.|$|E
