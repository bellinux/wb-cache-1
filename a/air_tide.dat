40|$|The small S_ 1 {{ocean tide}} is caused {{primarily}} by diurnal atmospheric pressure loading. Its excitation is therefore {{unlike any other}} diurnal tide. The global character of S- 1 is here determined by numerical modeling and by analysis of Topex/Poseidon satellite altimeter data. The two approaches yield reasonably consistent results, and large (greater than l) amplitudes in several regions are further confirmed by comparison with coastal tide gauges. Notwithstanding their excitation differences, S- 1 and other diurnal tides are found to share several common features, such as relatively large amplitudes in the Arabian Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Gulf of Alaska. The most noticeable difference {{is the lack of}} an S- 1 Antarctic Kelvin wave. These similarities and differences can be explained in terms of the coherences between near-diurnal oceanic normal modes and the underlying tidal forcings. While gravitational diurnal tidal forces excite primarily a 28 -hour Antarctic-Pacific mode, the S_ 1 <b>air</b> <b>tide</b> excites several other near-diurnal modes, none of which has large amplitudes near Antarctica...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} solar semidiurnal tide (S 2) in {{the ocean}} is forced by the pressure loading of the atmospheric thermal tide {{as well as by}} the gravitational tidal potential. This paper examines the effects of adding the atmospheric S 2 forcing to a forward tide model. When the model is forced only by the gravitational potential, the S 2 relative elevation error with respect to pelagic tide gauges is anomalously poor. After atmospheric S 2 forcing is added, the relative error reduces to levels seen in other tidal constituents. In the global average, the atmospherically forced S 2 ocean tide is 14. 7 percent as large as the gravitationally forced S 2 tide, and differs by about 109. 4 in phase, consistent with the relative amplitudes and phases of the atmospheric and gravitational S 2 forcings. Because the S 2 <b>air</b> <b>tide</b> is periodic, the oceanic S 2 tide represents a particularly clean test of the ability of numerical models to successfully replicate the oceanic response to atmospheric pressure loading...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} {{resonance}} and energetics {{of the daily}} tides, especially in the southern ocean, the distribution of gravitational power input of daily and half-daily tides, and comparison with other estimates of global dissipation rates. The present global tidal maps, derived from Geosat altimetry, compare favorably with ground truth data {{at about the same}} rms level as the models of Schwiderski (1983), and are slightly better in lunar than in solar tides. Diurnal admittances clearly show Kelvin wave structure in the southern ocean and confirm the resonant mode of Platzman (1984) at 28. 5 + or - 0. 1 hr with an apparent Q of about 4. Driving energy is found to enter dominantly in the North Pacific for the daily tides and is strongly peaked in the tropical oceans for the half-daily tides. Global rates of working on all major tide constituents except S 2 agree well with independent results from analyses of gravity through satellite tracking. Comparison at S 2 is improved by allowing for the <b>air</b> <b>tide</b> in gravitational results but suggests deficiencies in all solar tide models...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} part of {{the processing}} of the GRACE satellite data will be correction for the gravitational effect of tides. This includes solid earth, ocean, and atmospheric tides. The most problematic are ocean tides in shallow seas and in high latitudes (above the 66 ^∘ inclination of Topex). Somewhat smaller, but still important, errors {{are associated with the}} S_ 1 <b>air</b> <b>tide</b> and the ocean's dynamic response to it. In this paper we explore several facets of the tidal error budget. The ocean tide error spectrum is estimated (a) by inverse methods and (b) by simple differencing of several of the best tidal models. The tidal error spectrum is flatter than the tidal signal spectrum, and it exceeds 10 % of the signal at degrees 15 and above. The tide errors also exceed the anticipated sensitivity of GRACE for all degrees below 40, and possibly below 50. The assumption of constant seawater density (of about 1035 kg M^- 3) is a minor error source. Owing to GRACE's high inclination, solar tides are aliased to long periods, which is potentially problematic for geophysical interpretation of the gravity signal. Simulations of the effect of high-latitude solar-tide errors on gravity estimates around Antarctica will be discussed...|$|E

A seasonal difference was identified {{in the degree of}} air exposure, which was higher in October 2005 and February 2006. Air temperature and wave height and periodicity differed significantly among the four studied periods. Some species occurred only in one period as Fissurella clenchi in July 2005 and October 2005, Gracilaria domingensis in July 2005, Grateloupia sp. in October 2005) and Porphyra acanthophora in October 2005 and February 2006. Species richness and diversity values were higher in the intermediary quadrats in all the studied periods. The intermediate benthic strip occupied a narrower zone, changing its spatial location according to the season of the year: in May 2005 it was closer to the lower zone, in July and October 2005 it occupied an intermediate position, and in February 2006 it was nearest to the upper quadrats.

When tides recede, water inside the thallus is retained. Such water reserves reduce desiccation and heating of tissue during periods of emersion (DePamphilis 1978).

40|$|Intertidal {{platform}} reefs are {{a distinctive}} {{feature of the}} Perth coastline. Occurring adjacent to shoreline beaches and also as isolated offshore reefs, these limestone platforms have been formed by wave action over many centuries. Rising and falling tides exert {{a major influence on}} the structure of intertidal reef communities, and this influence typically results in a distinctive distribution of organisms based on their tolerance to being exposed to the <b>air</b> when the <b>tide</b> is low. Those inhabiting the highest part of the rocky shore, and therefore exposed more often and for longer periods, are typically hardy, desiccation-resistant species. Those living further seaward are more frequently submerged, although even these organisms may be exposed to the drying sun during particularly low tides, or can be periodically buried by the deposition of shifting beach sand. During winter storms, large waves may crash onto these reefs, stripping away algae and dislodging animals.

For strong wind region near typhoon center the computed results agree well with the observed data in most tidal gauge stations. For some typhoons, where the winds are weak and unstable, the computed results are poorly comparable to the observed ones.

When submersed in seawater, H fusiforme was capable of acquiring HCO 3 - as a source of inorganic carbon (Ci) to drive photosynthesis, while emersed and exposed to air, it used atmospheric CO 2 for photosynthesis. The pH changes surrounding the H fusiforme fronds had less influence on the photosynthetic rates under emersed condition than under submersed condition. When the pH was as high as 10. 0, emersed H fusiforme could photosynthesize efficiently, but the submersed alga exhibited very poor photosynthesis. Extracellular carbonic anhydrase (CA) {{played an important role in}} the photosynthetic acquisitions of exogenous Ci in water as well as in air. Both the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon in general seawater and CO 2 in air were demonstrated to limit the photosynthesis of H fusiforme, which was sensitive to O- 2. It appeared that the exogenous carbon acquisition system, being dependent of external CA activity, operates in a way not enough to raise intracellular CO 2 level to prevent photorespiration. The inability of H fusiforme to achieve its maximum photosynthetic rate at the current ambient Ci levels under both submersed and emersed conditions suggested that the yield of aquaculture for this economic species would respond profitably to future increases in CO 2 concentration in the sea and air...|$|R

The spectrometer’s light source, a light emitting diode (LED), enables absorption spectra of gas samples to be acquired over 50 nm bandwidths at visible and nearultraviolet wavelengths. Differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) is then applied to unambiguously identify and quantify the various absorbers present in the samples. Especially difficult operating conditions were encountered during the instrument’s first field deployment onboard the research vessel RRS Discovery. As a result, the instrument did not achieve the I 2 detection limits it had demonstrated in laboratory testing and was unable to detect any I 2 signal in the mid‐Atlantic Ocean during the Reactive Halogens in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment. However, iodine was detected around many night‐time low tides during the BIOFLUX II campaign at the Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station in County Galway, Ireland. The maximum I 2 concentration of 608 pptv (parts per trillion by volume) correlated with the campaign’s lowest tide, and is three times greater than any previous report of atmospheric I 2 concentrations. The BIOFLUX observations support current understanding that coastal I 2 derives from seaweed (particularly kelp species) exposed to <b>air</b> around low <b>tide.</b> LED‐BBCEAS measurements of NO 2 made on the University campus during the Leicester Air Quality Measurement Project are compared with data from two chemiluminescence instruments.

The dominant emission source of iodine into the atmosphere in coastal regions comes from intertidal macroalgal beds. Gas-phase iodine chemistry perturbs the HOₓ and NOₓ radical cycles, provides additional sink reactions for tropospheric ozone, and initiates nucleation of new aerosol particles. Results are presented from an extensive laboratory study of I₂ emissions from five species of temperate seaweeds. Time- and species-dependent I₂ emission rates were quantified in studies mimicking the progressive exposure of seaweeds to <b>air</b> around low <b>tide.</b> Seasonal differences in I₂ emission rates were investigated. By deploying the BBCEAS instrument from a boat, I₂ concentrations were also measured directly above Laminaria digitata and Ascophyllum nodosum seaweeds growing in their natural habitat. NOₓ emissions affect urban air quality directly and indirectly (the latter via formation of tropospheric ozone and secondary aerosol). BBCEAS was applied to measure NO₂ and the optical extinction from aerosol particles at locations around the Leicester University campus. BBCEAS results were compared with commercial NOₓ (chemiluminescence) and aerosol instrumentation. The mobile BBCEAS instrument was also deployed to investigate the dispersion of NO₂ from the roadside...|$|R
