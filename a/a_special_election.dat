5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the Republican majority in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20â€“17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E

5|$|St. Paul's special {{election}} day was April 25, 1978. Again, {{more than the}} usual number of voters appeared for <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election,</b> who again, overturned the city's gay rights ordinance by more than two to one.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> {{was called}} for May 16, 1978 in the 46th Ward when Alderman Chris Cohen, first elected in 1971, was re-elected in 1975 but retired in mid-term to head the Chicago {{regional}} office of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

5|$|After the {{resignation}} of South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint to run Heritage Foundation, Colbert was named a possible candidate for appointment to the seat being vacated by DeMint, which would have triggered <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> in 2014 to finish out DeMint's term. Although Governor Nikki Haley announced promptly {{that she had no}} intention to nominate Colbert to the Senate, a poll showed Colbert as a favorite among South Carolina voters.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election.</b> The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election,</b> the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E
5|$|Jackie Speier, Ryan's former aide, {{was elected}} in 1998 to the California State Senate. In 2008 she won <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> to the US Congress from California's 12th congressional district, much of it {{formerly}} Ryan's constituency.

5|$|On April 4, 1991 H. John Heinz III, {{one of the}} US Senators from Pennsylvania, {{was killed}} when his {{chartered}} plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear. Under the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the legislature of each state {{has the power to}} permit the governor to fill the vacant seat until <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> can be held. In Pennsylvania, this power had been delegated, and Governor Robert P. Casey signed a writ on May 13, 1991, declaring November 5 the date for <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> and temporarily appointing Harris Wofford to fill Heinz's now-vacant seat. Under Pennsylvanian law, {{there was no need for}} a primary in such a situation; instead, both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidate, who would run in the special election. John S. Trinsey Jr., a member of the Pennsylvanian electorate and potential candidate, challenged the constitutionality of this law, claiming that it violated his rights under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown {{was elected}} to the Senate in <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> to replace Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican {{minority}} the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters. His victory had become significant because of its effects on the legislative process. The first was psychological: the symbolic importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many Congressional Democrats concerned about the political cost of passing a bill.|$|E
5|$|The Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to the United States Constitution {{established}} the popular election of United States Senators {{by the people}} of the states. The amendment supersedes , Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, under which senators were elected by state legislatures. It also alters the procedure for filling vacancies in the Senate, allowing for state legislatures to permit their governors to make temporary appointments until <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> can be held.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the death}} of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, Massachusetts state law {{triggered}} <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> {{to be held in}} January 2010. On September 4, 2009, a representative for Lynch took out nomination papers to run in the special election. After speaking with his family and citing the short time frame in which to conduct a campaign, Lynch decided against seeking the Democratic nomination for the seat.|$|E
5|$|Following the Supreme Court ruling, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, fearing {{he would}} be implicated in Goebel's assassination. Beckham became acting governor, {{but because of the}} unusual {{circumstances}} surrounding the election, <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> was held November 6, 1900, to determine who would complete Goebel's unexpired term. Beckham (now of age) won the election over Republican John W. Yerkes by fewer than 4,000 votes. Shortly following the special election, Beckham married Jean Raphael Fuqua of Owensboro. The couple had two sons.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, Dow spoke {{before the}} {{legislature}} {{in favor of}} statewide prohibition. The bill passed, but lacked the enforcement mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, {{he ran for the}} state legislature in <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election,</b> but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so, but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding the veto.|$|E
2500|$|The governor's office {{announced}} that <b>a</b> <b>special</b> primary <b>election</b> {{would be held}} on March 3 and <b>special</b> general <b>election</b> would be held on April 7.

Gillibrand was required to run in <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> in 2010 for the permanent position, which she won with 63% of the vote. She was re-elected to a full six-year term in 2012 with 72% of the vote, the highest margin for any statewide candidate in New York.|$|E
5|$|In Trinsey v. Pennsylvania (1991), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit {{was faced}} with a {{situation}} where, following the death of Senator H.John HeinzIII of Pennsylvania, Governor Robert P. Casey had provided for a replacement and for <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> that did not include a primary. A voter and prospective candidate, John S. Trinsey,Jr., argued that the lack of a primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Republican Senator Scott Brown ran for {{re-election}} to a first full term. He {{had been elected}} in <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>election</b> in 2010 {{following the death of}} incumbent Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy. Brown faced no challengers from his own party. For the Democrats, an initial wide field of prospective candidates narrowed after the entry of Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E
50|$|Bock {{was elected}} to the Assembly in <b>a</b> 1999 <b>special</b> <b>election</b> after the mid-term {{resignation}} of U.S. Congressman Ron Dellums.
