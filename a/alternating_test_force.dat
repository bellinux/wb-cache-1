40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, {{interest}} {{has increased in}} leveraging low-cost "alternate'' test methods as a drop-in replacement for testing analog and RF devices. The current practice for testing such devices, known as specification test, can be very expensive by comparison. By substituting less-costly <b>alternate</b> <b>tests</b> for specification test, substantial test cost reduction can be achieved. Despite this promised cost reduction, the testing community {{has been reluctant to}} adopt such <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> methods in industrial settings, as the error incurred by <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> can be quite difficult to capture. Estimating the expected test error metrics early in the fabrication process is, therefore, extremely desirable. In this work, we present a case study in which we investigate the reliability of kernel density estimation as a means of providing such early estimates of <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> error. We also introduce the novel application of Laplacian score feature selection to identify key subsets of <b>alternate</b> <b>tests.</b> With these tools we are able to dramatically reduce the number of <b>alternate</b> <b>tests</b> applied, as well as predict test escape and yield loss error metrics within about 0. 5 % of their true values when evaluated on an industrial dataset with more than 1 million devices...|$|R

40|$|International audiencen this paper, {{we address}} the problem of limited {{training}} sets for learning the regression functions in <b>alternate</b> analog <b>test.</b> Typically, a large volume of real data needs to be collected from different wafers and lots {{over a long period of}} time to be able to train the regression functions with accuracy across the whole design space and apply <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> with high confidence. To avoid this delay and achieve a fast deployment of <b>alternate</b> <b>test,</b> we propose to use the Bayesian model fusion technique that leverages prior knowledge from simulation data and fuses this information with data from few real circuits to draw accurate regression functions across the whole design space. The technique is demonstrated for an <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> designed for RF low noise amplifiers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{promising}} {{solution to}} reduce the testing costs of analog/RF circuits is the <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> strategy, which permits to replace costly specification measurements by simple low-cost indirect measurements. Despite the substantial test cost reduction offered by this strategy, its deployment in industry is today limited mainly {{because of a lack}} of confidence in <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> predictions. A potential solution to improve test confidence is to exploit model redundancy. The idea is to build different regression models for each specification during the training phase, and then to verify prediction consistency between the different models during the production testing phase. In case of divergent predictions, the devices are removed from the <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> tier and directed to a second tier where further testing may be applied. In this paper, we present a framework for efficient implementation of <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> with model redundancy. Results are illustrated on a power amplifier case study for which we have experimental test data over 11, 200 devices...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpecification testing, which {{involves}} the direct {{measurement of the}} circuit performance parameters is the conventional practice for testing analog/RF devices. While this approach is highly accurate, it often incurs extremely high testing costs. A promising approach is to adopt <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> strategy, i. e. a strategy in which test results are derived from indirect low-cost measurements. The underlying idea is to learn during a training phase the mapping between indirect measurements and circuit performance parameters, and to use only indirect measurements to predict device specifications during production testing. Despite the substantial test cost reduction offered by this strategy, its deployment in industry is today limited, mainly because confidence in <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> predictions is difficult to assess. In this paper, we propose a novel implementation with the objective to improve confidence in <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> predictions. The idea is to exploit model redundancy in order to identify, during the production testing phase, devices with suspect predictions and remove these devices from the <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> flow. This approach is illustrated on a real case study for which we have experimental measurements {{on a set of}} 10, 000 devices...|$|R

40|$|At low frequencies, <b>alternate</b> <b>testing</b> of {{analog modules}} {{is based on}} {{sampling}} the test response using an A/D converter and analyzing the digitized response in the external tester. In order to use <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> at frequencies in the multi-GHz range with RF components, both the test waveforms {{need to be very}} simple and the evaluation of the test response should be handled by practical hardware-based test response feature-extractors. One such scheme employs sensors that measure a complex function of the response waveform and output a DC signature which can easily be collected by a low-cost external tester or can be evaluated by system resources available on chip/package. In this work, we demonstrate the first temperature compensated <b>alternate</b> <b>test,</b> which makes use of built-in feature extraction sensors.

40|$|The goal of {{automated}} {{assembly of}} <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> forms {{is to produce}} multiple test forms that are equivalent to some target. To achieve that goal, the alternate forms are usually assembled according to the content and psychometric specifications obtained from a reference test. Equivalent-test assembly techniques based on conventional testparallelism definitions constrain <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> forms {{to have the same}} characteristics for each test taker. The test scores derived from such assembled forms are beneficial to indicate the standing of an examinee or make inferences about an individual’s performance. However, the requirement that each examinee should be provided test forms with identical test properties can be too stringent and unnecessary for certification and licensure testing. In such setting, tests are intended to classify examinees into categories (e. g., pass vs. fail, or master vs. non-master), and information about an individual’s standing relative to a tested population is not the main concern. One way to assemble equivalent test forms for classification testing can be to constrain <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> forms to have identical test properties for, for example, two contrast groups (o...|$|R

The methodology {{is based on}} current signatures obtained by sampling the filtered supply current when the circuit-under-test is stimulated by a single tone sinusoidal. Sampling of supply current instead of voltage eliminates the parasitics and loading due to test circuitry on the signal path, hence provides a non-invasive built-in-self-test methodology. Furthermore, the experiments show that specification prediction accuracy is not significantly degraded by decreasing the stimulus power.

Dynamic specification testing of high-speed A/D converters requires high-speed ATE, the cost {{of which can be}} prohibitively high. In the proposed approach regression-based mapping functions are generated using specification data of the device from bench testing.

As opposed to the conventional method of dynamic specification testing of A/D converters, proposed approach does not require a spectrally pure sinusoidal input signal and estimates device SNR in presence of sampling clock jitter.
