In 1691, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago, but since Courland was no longer present on the island which was meanwhile claimed by England, the agreement was nullified, and negotiations with England {{did not result in}} an agreement. In 1695, Brandenburg-Prussia tried to get <b>a</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> Tortola, but England denied them settlement. Likewise, England declined an offer to purchase Sint Eustatius in 1697.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, a good example being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps <b>a</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.|$|E

His old friend Eric Hayden (Gaston) has been waiting for a year for confirmation from the Republican-led Congress, and is offered the position of dean of Georgetown's law school. But Josh suggests making a temporary recess appointment that will at least put the issue on the agenda and Hayden agrees. When Josh goes to suggest this to Leo he is told that the issue will have to wait for one of the Supreme Court justices has died. Assuming it is the ailing Chief Justice Roy Ashland that has passed, Josh is surprised to learn that it is 52-year old Justice Owen Brady, taken by a heart attack. C.J., meanwhile, tries to make things right with resurfaced college boyfriend Ben, whom she has been forced to ignore due to her workload. Based on Ben's reaction {{at the end of their}} very brief conversation, C.J. regrets her approach and fears that she may have caused things with Ben to end before they could even begin. Upon voicing this concern to Toby he advices her to go to Ben and fix it. Ryan Pierce, the intern working for Josh, (uncharacteristically) fails to show up for work.

He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man.

5|$|Jill {{begins to}} work for {{cosmetics}} company Jabot and its owner, John Abbott (Jerry Douglas), promotes her to head of merchandising, impressed by her work. They become involved, but she cheated on him with his son, Jack Abbott (Terry Lester). John dumped her and she filed a sexual harassment suit worth $10,000 against Jack when {{he will not be}} with her. She reunites with John and they married in 1982. However, Abbott family housekeeper, Mamie Johnson (Veronica Redd), seemed to be a thorn in Jill's new marriage. Mamie, who wants to protect John, kept and eye on Jill, who had another affair with Jack. Katherine gets <b>a</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> pictures of Jack and Jill and showed them to John, who has a stroke. Jill divorced John in 1986 and gets 20% of Jabot in their settlement, and a seat {{on the board of directors}} after threatening to sell her story turning it into a novel or film. Jill strives at her business, but is later found in her shower having been shot, just as her son Phillip returned to town after years away at boarding school. The three main suspects in the shooting are John, Jack, and Katherine. Jack confesses so that his affair with her won't become public. The real culprit is Sven, a masseur at the Genoa City Hotel. He had been rejected by Jill earlier in the night and shot her after getting drunk. Sven kidnaped Jill and locked her in a meat freezer. Jack rescued her and Sven escaped. Jill and Katherine fight over her son Phillip, who is now a teenager and had a past of acting out. Phillip turned to alcoholism but quit with help from Jill and Katherine. Phillip has sex with Nina Webster (Tricia Cast) and she ends up pregnant. He later died after driving under the influence, devastating both women. Jill hired a former con man Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker) to seduce Katherine. Rex's real name was Brian Romalotti, father of Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) and Gina Roma (Patty Weaver). He married Katherine, but Jill then wanted Rex for herself and convinced him to divorce Katherine. In reality, Katherine had been replaced by a look alike Marge Cotrooke who pushed Rex away. He divorced her, and married Jill, but the real Katherine finally returned and reunited with Rex. Rex eventually was shot and killed while Jill began romancing John again.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} <b>a</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E

On several occasions Jarrett attempted to get El Zorro to submit with an ankle lock, the signature hold of his TNA rival Kurt Angle, but when {{he realized he was}} not going to succeed in his attempt, he took advantage of a distraction from his wife Karen and smashed El Zorro with his signature guitar, but to his surprise, only managed to get a two count out of the following pinfall.

In September 13, 2011, the Cázares issued a formal complaint at the Public Ministry of Matamoros (Spanish: Ministerio Público de Matamoros) and the case was opened by state authorities in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas. A family member who happened to be a U.S. citizen also contacted the FBI and asked them for help in the case. The case was brought to the attention of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who promised to support the investigation. A few weeks after that, one of the alleged kidnappers was arrested in Texas following a traffic violation.

Zach's father sets a contraption around Kendall's neck, which will kill her if its detonator goes off. Zach and Alexander struggle as Zach gets <b>a</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the detonator and will not let it go, even as he is shot in the arm by Alexander. Zach is able to sneak a spare knife from the sheath at his ankle and throw it hard enough at Alexander so that Alexander drops his gun. Zach rescues Kendall.

25|$|Hellwig {{joined the}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in June 1987. First {{competing}} on house shows under his Dingo Warrior moniker, he defeated {{a series of}} jobbers, including Steve Lombardi, Barry Horowitz and Mike Sharpe. He made his television debut as The Ultimate Warrior on the October 25 episode of Wrestling Challenge, where he defeated another jobber, Terry Gibbs. The Ultimate Warrior became known for his high-energy ring entrances, which featured him racing into the arena at full speed, bursting into the ring, and violently shaking the ropes up and down. He was also known for his distinctive pattern of face paint. After several months of defeating jobbers, he was pinned {{for the first time}} in the WWF by fellow WWF rookie/future rival Rick Rude on December 28, 1987. In early 1988, Warrior entered into his first real WWF feud with fellow strongman Hercules Hernandez. The two faced off on the February 7, 1988 airing of Wrestling Challenge, where Hercules was disqualified for using his steel chain. Warrior then grabbed <b>a</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the chain and in the midst of a tug of war over it, the chain snapped. This led to a match at WrestleMania IV, where Warrior was victorious in his pay-per-view debut. Warrior lost twice by pinfall shortly thereafter: cleanly to André the Giant in April in Italy, and to Dino Bravo, who put his feet on the ropes for leverage, in Montreal in June.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Zamindar {{exposes the}} illegal {{activities}} of a cattle smuggler (R. K.). The smuggler loses his animal farm and is {{taken into custody}} by the police amid media fare. Kumbudren Samy brings Thenmozhi to the Zamindar's house to introduce them to each other. Thenmozhi is identified to be the Zamindar's enemy's daughter, which Kumbudren Samy was unaware of. When the Zamindar tells him to break up with her, Saamy refuses and attacks him verbally, telling that he doesn't have a family and no one loves him so he would never understand. An angered Zaminder throws out Kumbudren Samy and Walter as well who tried to defend his brother and gets extremely drunk. Later that evening, both brothers make up with the Zamindar and invite him to their home. The Zamindar even signs over his land to Thenmozhi's father {{who was trying to}} get <b>a</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the land and organises for their marriage. Few days later, the smuggler returns, kidnaps the Zamindar and flogs him into unconsciousness, before hanging him to death from a tree. Walter and Kumbudren Samy are devastated and almost collapse with grief. While Kumbudren Samy fails in his attempt to take revenge, getting flogged and injured severely, Walter manages to bash up the smuggler and his men. The smuggler has been tied down under the platform with the Zamindar's body and is burnt to death along with the Zamindar, while both brothers dance madly.|$|E

25|$|Kali is the {{grandfather}} of Svarocisa Manu, {{one of the}} progenitors of mankind. As previously mentioned, Kali had a son named Svarocisa with the Apsara Varuthini. Svarocisa once traveld to Mt. Mandara and was met by Manorama, a cursed-woman being chased by a demon. In the past, she had made fun of a sage practicing Tapasya austerities on Mt. Kailas and was cursed to be captured by a demon. When her friends Vibhavari and Kalavati berated the sage for enacting a curse for such a minor offence, he cursed one to be a leper {{and the other a}} carrier of diseases. Manorama had knowledge of a powerful spiritual weapon, but {{did not know how to}} wield it, so she taught it to Svarocisa. When the demon leaped out of the forest and grabbed <b>a</b> <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the woman, Svarocis called forth the weapon. But the demon stayed his hand and explained he was actually Manorama’s father, Indivara. He had also been cursed to become a demon by the sage Brahmamitra because he tried to covertly obtain the secrets of Ayurveda medicine without the sage’s knowledge. The sage told him that the curse would end when he was about to eat his own daughter. Once he regained his true form, Indivara taught Svarocisa the Ayurveda medication, which he used to cure Manorama’s friends. He later married the three and had three sons with them. He learned the languages of all creatures from Vibhavari and the Padmini vidya from Kalavati.|$|E
