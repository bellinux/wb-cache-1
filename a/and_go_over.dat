5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, {{close enough}} to the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, command post west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 soldiers of the battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were driven off at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking back down the hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get up out of the rice paddies <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had been driven off the hill. Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{some members of}} the Sherman {{campaign}} were disappointed by Garfield's speech. One telegram from a Sherman backer sent to Sherman himself claimed that, [...] " [...] has been of no service to you...he was extremely lukewarm in his support." [...] Rumors began to spread that Ohio Governor Charles Foster and Garfield, who were in adjoining suites at the Grand Pacific Hotel, were [...] "conspiring to bring Garfield out as [...] candidate...." [...] News of the finger-pointing within the Sherman camp had carried into newspapers across the country. The Albany Evening Journal reported that [...] "here is a general belief that the Ohio delegation is ready to desert Sherman <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> to Blaine in a body." ...|$|E

500|$|Belisarius {{knew that}} success for his {{expedition}} relied on gaining {{the support of}} the local population, which had largely retained its Roman identity and to which he presented himself as a liberator. Thus on the next day of the landing, when some of his men stole some fruit from a local orchard, he severely punished them, and assembled the army and exhorted them to maintain discipline and restraint towards the native population, lest they abandon their Roman sympathies <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> to the Vandals. Belisarius' pleas bore results, for, as Procopius reports (The Vandalic War, I.17), [...] "the soldiers behaved with moderation, and they neither began any unjust brawls nor did anything out of the way, and , by displaying great gentleness and kindness, won the Libyans to his side so completely that thereafter he made the journey as if in his own land".|$|E
500|$|During {{their time}} in Rome, Fermi and his group made {{important}} contributions to many practical and theoretical aspects of physics. In 1928, he published his Introduction to Atomic Physics (...) , which provided Italian university students with an up-to-date and accessible text. Fermi also conducted public lectures and wrote popular articles for scientists and teachers in order to spread knowledge of the new physics as widely as possible. Part of his teaching method was to gather his colleagues and graduate students together {{at the end of}} the day <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> a problem, often from his own research. A sign of success was that foreign students now began to come to Italy. The most notable of these was the German physicist Hans Bethe, who came to Rome as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow, and collaborated with Fermi on a 1932 paper [...] "On the Interaction between Two Electrons" [...] (...)

500|$|The serious losses {{sustained}} in maintaining a static defence during June led to fractures in the German high command. On 1 July, Panzer Group West commander Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg {{had been replaced}} by Heinrich Eberbach, following disagreements with Hitler over how the campaign should be conducted. Gerd von Rundstedt, soon followed, that evening, in a telephone conversation with Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, head of OKW, von Rundstedt said [...] "Make peace, you fools." [...] Taken to task over his endorsement of von Schweppenburg's recommendation for a withdrawal, he replied [...] "If you doubt what we're doing, get up here and take over this shambles yourself". The following morning, informed that perhaps his health was [...] "no longer up to the task", von Rundstedt resigned and was succeeded as OB West by Günther von Kluge. The costly battles in and around Caen and Saint-Lô convinced both Eberbach and von Kluge that their predecessors had been correct. The Germans had suffered heavily, leading Hitler to order Army Group B to temporarily abandon big counter-attacks <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> to the defensive until more reinforcements could arrive to bolster the front.|$|E

Thicke was unable to rejoin the cast for the shooting of the second season, opting instead to focus on his music.

2500|$|Alfred Henry Lewis {{introduced}} Masterson to President Theodore Roosevelt {{and the two}} {{formed a}} friendship that resulted in Masterson being a frequent White House guest and also included regular correspondence. President Roosevelt also arranged for Masterson's appointment as deputy U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of New York. On February 2, 1905, President Roosevelt wrote Masterson a [...] letter which concluded with the lines: [...] "You {{must be careful not}} to gamble or do anything while you are a public officer which might afford opportunity to your enemies and my critics to say that your appointment was improper. I wish you to show this letter to Alfred Henry Lewis <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> the matter with him." [...] Bat served in his $2,000 per year job until August 1, 1909.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the first}} two {{contestant}}s both spin twice <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> $1.00, the last contestant automatically advances to the Showcase and is given only one spin to determine their score; this {{is to ensure that}} a contestant advances to the showcase, avoiding a potential [...] "triple over" [...] scenario in which no one would advance. Any contestant whose score equals $1.00 (from either the first spin or the sum of two spins) receives a $1,000 bonus and, since December 1978, is allowed a bonus spin. The contestant wins an additional $10,000 for landing on either 5¢ or 15¢ (which are adjacent to the $1.00 space and painted green), or an additional $25,000 for landing on $1.00. From December 1978 to September 22, 2008, the bonuses were $5,000 and $10,000 for landing on a green section and the $1.00, respectively. If the wheel stops on any other amount or fails to make at least one revolution, the contestant wins no more money. The wheel is positioned on 5¢ prior to the bonus spin so that it cannot land on a winning prize without making a complete revolution.|$|E

2500|$|The {{clash between}} the Muscovy and the Novgorod Republic was a {{continuation}} of the conflict between them going back into the late 14th century. [...] This particular episode was caused by Novgorod's violation of the Treaty of Yazhelbitsy (1456) signed between Grand Prince Vasily II and the Novgorodian delegation headed by Archbishop Evfimy II. [...] In particular, the treaty limited Novgorod's ability to conduct its own foreign affairs and gave the Grand Prince of Moscow more control over the city (he controlled the city's seals and became the court of higher instance for the Novgorodian courts). When the Novgorodians turned to Poland–Lithuania for help in limiting Moscow's growing power, Ivan III and the metropolitan accused them not only of political treachery, but of attempting to abandon Eastern Orthodoxy <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> to the Catholic Church. [...] A draft treaty between Novgorod and the Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, Casimir IV Jagiellon (r. 1440–1492), said to have been found in a cache of documents after the battle of Shelon, {{made it clear that the}} Lithuanian Grand Prince was not to interfere with the election of the archbishop of Novgorod or the Orthodox faith in the city (by building Catholic churches in the city for example.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The sling bikini is {{also known}} as a [...] "suspender bikini", [...] "suspender thong", [...] "slingshot bikini" [...] or just [...] "slingshot". It is a {{one-piece}} suit which provides as little, or even less, coverage (or as much exposure) as a bikini. Usually, a slingshot resembles a bikini bottom, but rather than the straps going around the hips or waist, the side straps extend upwards to cover the breasts <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> the shoulders, leaving the entire sides of the torso uncovered, but the nipples and pubic area covered. Behind the neck, the straps join and reach down the back to become a thong. The variation of sling bikinis that has the straps simply encircle the neck and another set of straps pass around the midriff, instead of the straps passing over the neck and down the back, is called a pretzel bikini. Corresponding to the advent of Lycra, these bikinis first emerged in the early 1990s, and is more popular on the beaches of Europe including Saint-Tropez, Marabella and Ibiza. Suspender-like straps that running between the breasts and around the neck held the suit up were introduced in the mainstream in 1994. News reports said that within a week of putting the suit on their racks, New York's major stores had sold 150. San Francisco women turned deaf ears to clergymen's warnings that [...] "nakedness and paganism go hand in hand" [...] so at season's end, more than 3000 were sold at $24 each.|$|E
