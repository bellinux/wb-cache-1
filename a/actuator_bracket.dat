40|$|This is {{the final}} report for the {{actuator}} bracket/lug fracture mechanics qualification test. The test plan (CTP- 0071) outlined a two-phase test program designed {{to answer questions about}} the fracture criticality of the redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) nozzle <b>actuator</b> <b>bracket.</b> An analysis conducted using the NASA/FLAGRO fracture mechanics computer program indicated that the <b>actuator</b> <b>bracket</b> might be a fracture critical component. In the NASA/FLAGRO analysis, a simple lug model was used to represent the <b>actuator</b> <b>bracket.</b> It was calculated that the bracket would fracture if subjected to an actuator stall load {{in the presence of a}} 0. 10 in. corner crack at the actuator attachment hole. The 0. 10 in. crack size corresponds to the nondestructive inspection detectability limit for the <b>actuator</b> <b>bracket.</b> The inspection method used is the dye penetrant method. The actuator stall load (103, 424 lb) is the maximum load which the <b>actuator</b> <b>bracket</b> is required to withstand during motor operation. This testing was designed to establish the accuracy of the analytical model and to directly determine whether the <b>actuator</b> <b>bracket</b> is capable of meeting fracture mechanics safe-life requirements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the development of}} ultrasonic intermodulation {{as a method of}} robustly detecting cracks in engineering components. The bispectrum signal processing technique is used to analyse the nonlinear response of a sample to continuous excitation at two frequencies. The increased nonlinearity due to defects such as fatigue cracks is detected. The technique is shown to be insensitive to the support conditions and excitation positions. The importance of the shape of the excited modes is demonstrated and suggests that global inspection can be achieved only by exciting multiple modes. This multimode approach is then applied to the detection of cracking of a steel steering <b>actuator</b> <b>bracket...</b>|$|E
40|$|Flight {{motor set}} 360 L 006 was {{launched}} at approximately 11 : 54 a. m. Central Daylight Time (CDT) on 18 October 1989 {{as part of}} NASA space shuttle mission STS- 34. As with all previous redesigned solid rocket motor launches, overall motor performance was excellent. All ballistic contract end item (CEI) specification parameters were verified with the exceptions of ignition interval and rise rates. Ignition interval and rise rates could not be verified due to the elimination of developmental flight instrumentation from fourth flight and subsequent, but the low sample rate data that were available showed nominal propulsion performance. All ballistic and mass property parameters closely matched the predicted values and were well within the required CEI specification levels that could be assessed, {{with the exception of}} the RH-motor vacuum-delivered specific impulse. It exceeds the upper-limit CEI specification due to a bias imposed on the raw data by the OPT/Taber gage measurement differences. Evaluation of the ground environment instrumentation measurements again verified thermal model analysis data and showed agreement with predicted environmental effects. No launch commit criteria thermal violations occurred. Postflight inspection again verified superior performance of the insulation, phenolics, metal parts, and seals. Postflight evaluation indicated both nozzles performed as expected during flight, although splashdown loads tore the left-hand, 45 -deg <b>actuator</b> <b>bracket</b> from the nozzle. All combustion gas was contained by insulation in the field and nozzle-to-case joints. Recommendations were made concerning improved thermal modeling and measurements. The rationale for these recommendations, the disposition of all anomalies, and complete result details are contained...|$|E
40|$|National audienceClassical {{ultrasonic}} tomography generally uses source {{signals of}} constant amplitude. Mostly linear characteristics like ultrasonic amplitude, attenuation or {{time of flight}} in various directions are evaluated and used to structural defects imaging. On the other hand, more complex and nonlinear characteristics of elastic wave propagation, like 3 rd harmonics etc. are starting to be also used for ultrasonic imaging e. g. in medicine, providing more sensitive indicators of small body changes and irregularities. Nonlinear parameters obtained by Nonlinear Elastic Wave Spectroscopy (NEWS) NDT techniques can give us better information about incipient damage zones than linear ones. The main advantage of NEWS consists not only in higher sensitivity {{but also in the}} ability to detect defects smaller than the ultrasonic wavelength. Some limitations of NEWS methodology are given by difficulties with more precise defects location when global excitation of larger or more complicated structures is applied. To overcome these constraints, further developments of NEWS techniques are desirable for nonlinear pseudo-tomography or tomography defects imaging. Two NEWS methods are considered: Nonlinear Wave Modulation Spectroscopy (NWMS) and Nonlinear Time Reversal Mirrors (NLTRM) with ESAM and DORT signal processing. Testing results, obtained on metallic and concrete parts illustrate performance of both procedures. Both NDT procedures are illustrated on the ASB (<b>Actuator</b> Steering <b>Bracket)</b> aircraft landing gear part subjected to fatigue loading. No arising defects were indicated by traditional NDT methods, although the slightly enhanced acoustic emission (AE) activity was observed to be concentrated in the area depicted by crosslets. The ASB sample was tested by the above NLTRM procedure after 25000 cycles. Sine-pulse train of frequency 389 kHz and 30 &_mu;s duration has been used in primary excitation. Damaged zones detected by AE and NLTRM are overlapping, which confirms high sensitivity of proposed nonlinear methodology. Advantage of nonlinear tomography-like imaging methods is in their potentiality to acquire very complex information about the tested structure...|$|R
