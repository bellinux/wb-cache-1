5|$|<b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is {{a constituent}} of organic compounds {{as diverse as}} Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E

5|$|Metro {{contended that}} though TumbleSeed was marketed as a roguelike, <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> procedurally {{generated}} levels, it was closer in genre to traditional arcade games. Though like roguelikes, player mistakes are costly and unforgivingly punished by returning the player {{to the beginning}} of the game. Polygon wrote that while this mechanic is acceptable, the act of losing all equipped upgrades upon losing a single heart was harsh.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent discoveries and {{analyses}} upheld Sternberg's {{view on the}} position of Triceratops, with Lehman defining both subfamilies in 1990 and diagnosing Triceratops as ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) {{on the basis of}} several morphological features. In fact, it fits well into the ceratopsine subfamily, <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> one feature of a shortened frill. Further research by Peter Dodson, including a 1990 cladistic analysis and a 1993 study using RFTRA (resistant-fit theta-rho analysis), a morphometric technique which systematically measures similarities in skull shape, reinforces Triceratops placement in the ceratopsine subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The final Delrina-branded {{version of}} WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the {{subsequent}} version 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was purely a marketing decision, based on {{keeping up with}} the suite of products in Microsoft Office which were then at the same number. It also reflected the development effort required to develop the first full 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which set it <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> competition at the time.|$|E

5|$|The red fox {{originated}} from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period, and colonised North America {{shortly after the}} Wisconsin glaciation. Among the true foxes, the red fox represents a more progressive form {{in the direction of}} carnivory. <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> large size, the red fox is distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments. Despite its name, the species often produces individuals with other colourings, including albinos and melanists. Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised, which are divided into two categories: the large northern foxes, and the small, basal southern foxes of Asia and North Africa.|$|E

5|$|The {{relief is}} {{displayed}} in the British Museum in London, which has dated it between 1800 and 1750BCE. It originates from southern Mesopotamia, but the exact find-site is unknown. <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> distinctive iconography, the piece is noted for its high relief and relatively large size, which suggest that it {{was used as a}} cult relief, making it a very rare survival from the period. However, whether it represents Lilitu, Inanna/Ishtar, or Ereshkigal is under debate. The authenticity of the object has been questioned from its first appearance in the 1930s, but opinion has generally moved in its favour over the subsequent decades.|$|E
5|$|Tomb of Horrors {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a D {{campaign}} setting. In Tomb of Horrors, the adventurers {{encounter a}} number of tricks and traps while attempting to penetrate the tomb of a dead wizard. As the scenario begins, the players are told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> greater size, {{the common}} raven differs from its cousins, the crows, {{by having a}} larger and heavier black beak, shaggy {{feathers}} around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (C. corone) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.|$|E

5|$|<b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> larger {{size and}} more {{primitive}} molars, the Columbian mammoth also {{differed from the}} woolly mammoth by its more downturned mandibular symphysis; the dental alveoli (tooth sockets) of the tusks were directed more laterally away from the midline. Its tail was intermediate in length between that of modern elephants and the woolly mammoth. Since no Columbian mammoth soft tissue has been found, much less is known about its appearance {{than that of the}} woolly mammoth. It lived in warmer habitats than the woolly mammoth, and probably lacked many of the adaptations seen in that species. Hair thought to be that of the Columbian mammoth has been discovered in Bechan Cave in Utah, where mammoth dung has also been found. Some of this hair is coarse, and identical to that known to belong to woolly mammoths; however, since this location is so far south it is unlikely to be woolly mammoth hair. The distribution and density of fur on the living animal is unknown, but it was probably less dense than that of the woolly mammoth due to the warmer habitat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> long face, {{the large}} chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1962, Tatsunoko Production {{celebrated their}} 40th year of {{animated}} film production by releasing Karas in 2005, their first production being Space Ace in 1965. Keiichi Sato {{joined the company}} as the project director after he pitched its concept of a life-sized dark hero to the management. He researched production and direction techniques from kabuki, a form of traditional Japanese theater; and Japanese staged sword fights as materials for the project. Choreographed sword fights rendered with 3D animation were rare at that time, and Sato felt this would help distinguish the show. The use of theatrical elements and movie shooting techniques in its presentation sets Karas <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>its</b> contemporaries. Producer Kenji Nakamura felt the team's lack of experience in this area pushed them to ignore their previous animation work experience and break free of restrictions influenced by traditional animation production.|$|E
