25|$|Responses {{that focus}} on {{children}} suggest that experiences throughout life influence an individual’s propensity to engage in family violence (either as a victim or as <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator).</b> Researchers supporting this theory suggest {{it is useful to}} think of three sources of domestic violence: childhood socialization, previous experiences in couple relationships during adolescence, and levels of strain in a person's current life. People who observe their parents abusing each other, or who were themselves abused may incorporate abuse into their behaviour within relationships that they establish as adults.|$|E

25|$|The age {{of consent}} in Wisconsin is 18 {{and there is}} no close-in-age {{exception}}. There is, however, a marital exception which allows a person to have sex with a minor 16 or older if they are married to the minor. If the minor is below 16 both sexual intercourse and any sexual contact are a felony; sexual intercourse with a minor 16-17 by <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator</b> who is not married to the minor is a Class A misdemeanor. However, Wisconsin has a child enticement law that prohibits people of any age from taking people under 18 to a private area such as a room and exposing a sex organ to them or having the minor expose their sex organ to them. This is a Class B or C felony.|$|E
25|$|The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry {{found that}} there were 35 deaths between 14 February and 15 April 2011 linked to the uprising.

The Commission could not attribute the remaining 10 deaths to <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator.</b> Additionally, the Commission {{found that there}} were another 11 deaths potentially linked to the uprising between 16 April and 6 October 2011. Between 7 October 2011 and 5 April 2012, the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) reported 32 deaths linked to the uprising, for a total of 78 deaths. The total number, counting all related incidents, even those not mentioned in the BICI report and BCHR is 90 deaths as of 21 April 2012.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>perpetrator</b> {{found guilty}} {{by the court}} is often {{required}} to receive treatment. There are many options for treatment, some more successful than others. The psychological factors that motivated the convicted perpetrator are complex but treatment can still be effective. A counselor will typically evaluate disorders that are currently present in the offender. Investigating the developmental background of the offender can help explain {{the origins of the}} abusive behavior occurred in the first place. Emotional and psychological treatment has the purpose of identifying predictors of recidivism, or the potential that the offender will commit rape again. In some instances neurological abnormalities have been identified in the perpetrators, and in some cases they have themselves experienced past trauma. Adolescents and other children can be the perpetrators of rape, although this is uncommon. In this instance, appropriate counseling and evaluation are usually conducted.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate perceptions of child sexual abuse (CSA), particularly the perceptions held by CSA perpetrators and the public. Given the influence perceptions can have on a CSA victim’s wellbeing and disclosure behaviour, and <b>a</b> CSA <b>perpetrator’s</b> sexual recidivism risk, gaining insight into these perceptions was considered important. Method To facilitate this investigation, a multifaceted approach was adopted. This commenced with chapter one, a systematic literature review, which aimed to identify which factors influence English and Welsh perceptions of CSA victims. The second chapter comprised an empirical research project which aimed to investigate the influence of a victim’s abuse history, victim-perpetrator relationship and <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator’s</b> gender on British perceptions of CSA. These three factors were selected due to their hypothesised influence on perceptions and lack of investigation. Following this, chapter three was completed which involved a critique of the Gudjonsson Blame Attribution Inventory-Revised (GBAI-R). This was to assess the inventory’s suitability for chapter four and to inform practitioners of its utility. Finally, chapter four entailed a case study which aimed to investigate whether <b>a</b> CSA <b>perpetrator’s</b> offence-specific minimisation could be reduced. This was facilitated by completing a six-session intervention on an individual basis. Results This thesis revealed various findings. Specifically, chapter one revealed respondent gender influences public perceptions of CSA victims as males perceived CSA victims more negatively than females. Regarding chapter two, a victim’s abuse history, victim-perpetrator relationship and <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator’s</b> gender were not found to influence British perceptions of CSA. However, similar to chapter one, females were significantly more pro-victim compared to males. In chapter three, the critique identified some evidence of the GBAI-R being psychometrically sound and utilising an efficient administration methodology. Despite this, some concerns were raised regarding the representativeness of its normative data and the inventory’s susceptibility to extreme scores. Finally, chapter four revealed some evidence of the intervention reducing the perpetrator’s offence-specific minimisation although {{it was not possible to}} firmly conclude this. Conclusion The findings highlight the need for further research into perceptions of CSA. This should include investigations into why males are less pro-victim compared to females and the impact this might have on CSA. Research should also continue to investigate the influence of a victim’s abuse history, victim-perpetrator relationship and <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator’s</b> gender on perceptions of CSA. As part of {{this research}} a more representative sample should be recruited to enable the generalisation of findings. A more comprehensive critique of the GBAI-R should also be facilitated as well as further investigations into minimisation...|$|R
25|$|Health {{organizations}} and agencies have also expanded rape beyond traditional definitions. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines rape {{as a form}} of sexual assault, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes rape in their definition of sexual assault; they term rape a form of sexual violence. The CDC lists other acts of coercive, non-consensual sexual activity {{that may or may not}} include rape, including drug-facilitated sexual assault, acts in which a victim is made to penetrate <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator</b> or someone else, intoxication where the victim is unable to consent (due to incapacitation or being unconscious), non-physically forced penetration which occurs after a person is pressured verbally (by intimidation or misuse of authority to force to consent), or completed or attempted forced penetration of a victim via unwanted physical force (including using a weapon or threatening to use a weapon).|$|E
25|$|Retaliation has {{occurred}} when {{a sexual harassment}} victim suffers a negative action {{as a result of}} the harassment. For example, a complainant be given poor evaluations or low grades, have their projects sabotaged, be denied work or academic opportunities, have their work hours cut back, and other actions against them which undermine their productivity, or their ability to advance at work or school, being fired after reporting sexual harassment or leading to unemployment as they may be suspended, asked to resign, or be fired from their jobs altogether. Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also stalking and cyberstalking of the victim. Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator,</b> can use their power to see that a victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2017, Reinhart {{was arrested}} for battery after {{allegedly}} punching a bouncer. Reinhart's lawyer, Dina LaPolt, says of the incident that Reinhart was assaulted by bouncers at Lamplighter Inn in Palatine, Illinois without provocation and forcefully removed from the establishment while a friend in her party was violently beaten, sustaining multiple injuries. LaPolt expressed plans to take legal action against the bouncers involved in the incident. An active investigation into the event is underway, with police confirming on July 12, 2017, that a person was injured during the altercation, without revealing {{the identities of the}} injured person or their attacker. Reinhart appeared in court on August 2, 2017, and plead not guilty to a charge of misdemeanor battery. Her next court date is scheduled for October 6, 2017, at which time the case may go to trial. During the hearing, Reinhart's lawyer, Carmine Trombetta, described Reinhart as a victim, not <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator</b> in this case, and stated he is working on obtaining security footage to corroborate witness statements he already obtained in regards to the incident.|$|E

500|$|Forensic {{scientists}} can use DNA in blood, semen, skin, saliva or hair {{found at a}} crime scene to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator.</b> This process is formally termed DNA profiling, but may also be called [...] "genetic fingerprinting". In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as short tandem repeats and minisatellites, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA. However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people. DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys, and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders case.|$|E

This experiment investigated the impact of perpetrator and victim intoxication on perceptions of <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator’s</b> own awareness of wrongdoing for acquaintance rape. Undergraduate students (N = 314) read one of four rape-scenarios in which intoxication was manipulated and rated the perpetrator’s awareness of the consequences and wrongfulness of his sexual aggression. Findings supported the hypothesis that participants would assign less awareness of wrongdoing to an intoxicated, compared to sober, perpetrator. Further, males ascribed more awareness of wrongdoing to the <b>perpetrator</b> of <b>an</b> intoxicated, compared to sober, victim. Findings indicate that intoxicated sexual perpetrators are seen as not fully aware of the nature and consequences of their crime...|$|R
500|$|The erasure of DeVine {{from the}} {{narrative}} places the white female bodies {{as the only}} true victims of crime; and the film's inability to show DeVine as violated rather than violator perpetuates {{the myth of the}} black man as always already <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator</b> of crime." [...] Regarding DeVine, Halberstam wrote, [...] "Peirce perhaps thought that her film, already running close to two hours, could not handle another subplot, but the story of Philip DeVine is important and it is a crucial part of the drama of gender, race, sexuality, and class that was enacted in the heartland. Race is not incidental to this narrative of mostly white, Midwestern small towns and by omitting DeVine's story from Boys Don't Cry, Peirce contributes to the detachment of transgender narratives from narratives about race, consigning the memory of DeVine to oblivion." ...|$|E

While Cooper made the familiar-from-fiction demand of [...] non-sequentially numbered small bills, [...] mass publicity over the Lindbergh kidnapping had long made it public knowledge that even with thirties technology, getting non-sequential bills in a ransom was no defense against the numbers being logged and used to track down <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator.</b> In the Lindbergh case, fencing what he could as hot money and being very careful with what he did personally pass, the perpetrator had been caught through the [...] ransom money nonetheless, with identification and handwriting evidence only brought in at the trial.|$|E
500|$|Before the war, Hitler {{issued the}} notorious Commissar Order, {{which called for}} all Soviet {{political}} commissars taken prisoner at the front to be shot immediately without trial. German soldiers participated in these mass killings along {{with members of the}} SS-Einsatzgruppen, sometimes reluctantly, claiming [...] "military necessity". On the eve of the invasion, German soldiers were informed that their battle [...] "demands ruthless and vigorous measures against Bolshevik inciters, guerrillas, saboteurs, Jews and the complete elimination of all active and passive resistance". Collective punishment was authorized against partisan attacks; if <b>a</b> <b>perpetrator</b> could not be quickly identified, then burning villages and mass executions were considered acceptable reprisals. Although the majority of German soldiers accepted these crimes as justified due to Nazi propaganda, which depicted the Red Army as Untermenschen, a few prominent German officers openly protested about them. An estimated two million Soviet prisoners of war died of starvation during Barbarossa alone. The famished prisoners of war were hardly able to walk by themselves. By the end of the war, 58 percent of all Soviet prisoners of war had died in German captivity.|$|E

This is because a 'cost' is placed on the listener, with accented voices violating the 'speech schema' the listener is familiar with in their own geographic region. Therefore, listeners may be required to expend more effort in order to recognize and distinguish the non-native speaker's phonetic segments and words.|$|R
