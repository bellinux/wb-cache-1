40|$|Informed Consent is {{the idea}} that a doctor fully {{explains}} to his patient the way of treatment. The most important factor about this idea is that a doctor gives a preference to the patient 2 ̆ 7 s will and consent also is needed for nursing care because nurses are taking a part in the care and treatment of patients as a helper for doctors. In order to study the idea <b>of</b> Informed <b>Consent,</b> we recently have discussed how to teach nursing-ethics and its task in nursing education. For this study, the survey also has been conducted by addressing a questionnaire to the student nurses under bedside training at the pediatric ward in the hospital. The questionnaire has provided 62 different situations for the study. The contents of the questionnaire were as follows: 1) Informed <b>Consent,</b> 2) Code <b>of</b> Nursing, 3) Age of Child, 4) Time of NursingCare. From the viewpoint of these four factors, an investigation has been made about the relationship between the presence or <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> Informed <b>Consent</b> and the easiness of nursing achivement.

5000|$|Sexual acts {{which are}} illegal, and often {{considered}} unethical, {{because of the}} <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> include rape and molestation. Enthusiastic consent, as expressed in the slogan [...] "Yes means yes," [...] is typically the focus of liberal sexual ethics, rather than marriage. Under that view passivity, not saying [...] "No," [...] is not consent. An individual can give consent for one act of sexual activity, however, it does not condone preceding into other acts of sexual activity without reestablishing consent.|$|E
5000|$|Almost {{all modern}} systems of ethics insist that sexual {{activity}} is morally permissible only if all participants consent. Sexual ethics also considers {{whether a person}} is capable of giving consent {{and the sort of}} acts they can consent to. In western countries, the legal concept of [...] "informed consent" [...] often sets the public standards on this issue. Children, the mentally handicapped, the mentally ill, animals, prisoners, and people under the influence of drugs like alcohol might be considered in certain situations as lacking an ability to give an informed consent. In the United States, Maouloud Baby v. State is a state court case ruling that a person can withdraw sexual consent and that continuing sexual activity in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> constitutes rape. Also, if infected with a sexually transmitted disease, it is important that one notifies the partner before sexual contact.|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of Resolution 1973 authorizing intervention in Libya represented {{the first time}} that the UN Security Council had authorized military intervention in a functioning and non-consenting sovereign state for the purpose of protecting civilians. A crucial factor prompting skeptical states to allow the passage of the resolution in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> sovereign <b>consent</b> was the fact that relevant regional organizations had consented to, indeed appealed for, such action.

5000|$|The <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> {{defines the}} crime of sexual assault. Section 273.1 (1) defines consent, section 273.1 (2) {{outlines}} certain circumstances where [...] "no consent" [...] is obtained, while section 273.1 (3) states that subsection (2) does not limit the circumstances where [...] "no consent" [...] is obtained (i.e. subsection (2) describes some circumstances which deem the act to be non-consensual, but other circumstances, not described in this section, can also deem the act as having been committed without consent). [...] "No consent" [...] to sexual assault is also subject to Section 265 (3), which also outlines several situations where the act is deemed non-consensual. In 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. J.A. interpreted the provisions below to find that a person must have an active mind during the sexual activity in order to consent, and that they cannot give consent in advance.|$|E

Recorded punishments are limited compared to purges such as Utrecht sodomy trials, whether due to lack of offending, prosecution or surviving documentation. Baron Hume wrote that [...] "the crime is only mentioned twice in the course of our records", citing a double prosecution in 1570 and a single prosecution in 1630, with bestiality more often noted, all cases being punished by death. [...] A legal text dated 1832 added then recent case in which a man, on confession to two acts of sodomy out of nine initially charged, was transported for life.

5000|$|In {{all cases}} of {{kidnapping}} of children, {{where it is}} alleged that a child has been kidnapped, it {{is the absence of}} the consent of that child which is material. This is the case regardless of the age of the child. A very small child will not have the understanding or intelligence to consent. This means that <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> will be a necessary inference from the age of the child. It is a question of fact for the jury whether an older child has sufficient understanding and intelligence to consent. Lord Brandon said: [...] "I should not expect a jury to find at all frequently that a child under fourteen had sufficient understanding and intelligence to give its consent." [...] If the child (being capable of doing so) did consent to being taken or carried away, the fact that the person having custody or care and control of that child did not consent to that child being taken or carried away is immaterial. If, on the other hand, the child did not consent, the consent of the person having custody or care and control of the child may support a defence of lawful excuse.

40|$|Fewer forced marriages among {{immigrant}} women {{and daughters of}} immigrants Are forced marriages common in France? Are their numbers falling or increasing?

Until now, no recent quantitative data were available to answer these questions, but this knowledge gap has now been filled thanks to the Trajectories and Origins {{survey conducted by the}} French National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED) and the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE). Christelle Hamel presents its initial findings on forced marriage among {{immigrant women}} and the daughters of immigrants. What is meant by “forced marriage”? How can the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> be defined? Marriage may either be voluntary or the consequence of pressure exerted through social norms or through psychological, material or even physical coercion {{on the part of the}} family [1]. The <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> is difficult to delimit: are all arranged marriages necessarily unwanted and non-consensual? In practice, there is a continuum between desired marriages and those contracted under duress. Three levels of consent can nonetheless be defined on the basis of the Trajectories and Origins survey (see Box). The first corresponds to “freely consented unions”. The respondent clearly states that the marriage was desired, even if initiated by the spouse. At this first level, 97 % of marriages are described as a decision taken jointly by both partners.

We learn that the Israeli doctors in this study never make no-treatment decisions regarding patients in need of mechanical ventilation. They are complicit with botched standards of care for these patients, however, accepting without much doubt an ethos of scarce resources and poor managerial habits. The main two practical lessons to be taken from this study are that, for patients in need of mechanical ventilation, compromised care {{is better than a}} policy of intubation only when the intensive care unit is available, and that vigorous efforts are needed in order to extirpate ageism...|$|R
40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the international community}} 2 ̆ 7 s response to the crisis in Darfur between 2004 and 2007 reveals two contradictory developments regarding the responsibilities of sovereign statehood. On one hand, the vast majority of states within the Security Council readily endorse the notion that sovereignty entails a responsibility to protect populations. On the other hand, a few states, including two of the permanent-five, continue to insist that the international community cannot legitimately intervene in the affairs of a functioning state, even when the sovereign has manifestly failed to carry out its responsibilities, unless sovereign consent is granted. While important developments have been made in holding sovereigns to account over the last two decades, this continued assertion of the necessity <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> strikes {{at the heart of the}} notion that sovereignty entails responsibility. If consent is required before the international community can act, the notion that the sovereign state is responsible and accountable not only to its own people but also to the international community loses much of its meaning.

They represent different cultures with different views on the use of force, the role of rights, and the constraining power of international law.

This convergence is reached via different routes in each community: for the national security community, counter terrorism provides the sovereignty-limiting logic, while for the human rights and humanitarian law communities, it is the prevention of atrocities that leads to sovereignty-limiting doctrines.
