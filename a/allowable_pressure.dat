A special technique is provided to estimate the thermal conductivity near the thermodynamic critical point. GASP {{is a group of}} FORTRAN subroutines.

5000|$|Although {{based on}} simple principles, Newcomen's engine was rather complex and {{showed signs of}} {{incremental}} development, problems being empirically addressed as they arose. It consisted of a boiler A, usually a haystack boiler, situated directly below the cylinder. This produced large quantities of very low pressure steam, no more than 1 - 2 psi (0.07 - 0.14 bar) - the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>pressure</b> for a boiler that in earlier versions was made of copper with a domed top of lead and later entirely assembled from small riveted iron plates. The action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking [...] "Great balanced Beam", the fulcrum E of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building, the engine being located in-house. The pump rods were slung by a chain from the arch-head F of the great beam. From the in-house arch-head D was suspended a piston P working in a cylinder B, the top end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston and the bottom end closed, apart from the short admission pipe connecting the cylinder to the boiler; early cylinders were made of cast brass, but cast iron was soon found more effective and much cheaper to produce. The piston {{was surrounded by a}} seal {{in the form of a}} leather ring, but as the cylinder bore was finished by hand and not absolutely true, a layer of water had to be constantly maintained on top of the piston. Installed high up in the engine house was a water tank C (or header tank) fed by a small in-house pump slung from a smaller arch-head. The header tank supplied cold water under pressure via a stand-pipe for condensing the steam in the cylinder with a small branch supplying the cylinder-sealing water; at each top stroke of the piston excess warm sealing water overflowed down two pipes, one to the in-house well and the other to feed the boiler by gravity.|$|E
30|$|In several {{instances}} the lower bound is set as the minimum <b>allowable</b> mud <b>pressure</b> to counterbalance compressive stresses {{that lead to}} compressive/shear failure of the wellbore; this {{is referred to as}} well breakout. For permeable formations, the minimum <b>allowable</b> mud <b>pressure</b> should also prevent an inflow of the reservoir fluid. For this to be achieved, the minimum <b>allowable</b> mud <b>pressure</b> must be greater than the formation pore pressure. At the opposite end, the maximum <b>allowable</b> mud <b>pressure</b> is defined as the highest magnitude of mud weight that can be applied without causing tensile failure, loss in circulation or hydraulic fracturing of the formation (Hilgedick 2012; Moos et al. 2003). The above conditions are likely to apply where the pore pressure gradient is low or normal such that a considerably low mud pressure is sufficient to restrict the influx of reservoir fluids. A low or normal pore pressure gradient also invariably suggests that the pore fluid velocity at the vicinity of the wellbore face is low. If the pore pressure gradient is steep, the associated pore fluid velocity near the wellbore will be high. Sufficiently high pore pressures can generate effective tensile stresses causing tensile failure where the rock strength is exceeded. This has been observed by French et al. (2012) and Secor (1965), where natural hydraulic fractures and dilation are reported to occur when the pore pressure surpasses the least in situ compressive stress by a magnitude equivalent to the rock tensile strength. Dilation and fracture were also shown to take place in response to a high strain rate. Likewise, high pore fluid velocities create tensile stresses that may cause tensile failure if the rock tensile strength is exceeded. Where there is a decline in permeability or at very high flow rates, the increased drag forces cause the effective radial stresses to become negative, leading to tensile failure (Eshiet and Sheng 2013; Morita et al. 1998; Nouri et al. 2002).|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} design {{method for}} plate heat exchangers(PHEs), either epsilon-number of transfer units (epsilon-NTU) or logarithmic mean temperature difference method, involves many trials {{in order to}} meet the pressure drop constraints. This can be avoided through the developed design method, which takes the full utilization of the <b>allowable</b> <b>pressure</b> drops as a design objective. The proposed method is valid for the design situations with and without pressure drop specifications. In the case of the design with pressure drop specification, only one stream can fully utilize the <b>allowable</b> <b>pressure</b> drop. In the case of no pressure drop specification, <b>allowable</b> <b>pressure</b> drops can be determined through economical optimization. Compared to the previous design method, the proposed method does not require many trial iterations. Instead, all heat exchanger parameters, including plate size, number of passes, path, fluid velocity, etc., are determined in a straightforward way. Moreover, the suggested method can guarantee that the optimized values of <b>allowable</b> <b>pressure</b> drops can be fully utilized simultaneously by the two streams.

30|$|The {{choice of}} rock failure models defines the {{magnitude}} of minimum and maximum <b>allowable</b> mud <b>pressures.</b> For example, applying the Mogi–Coulomb rock failure model, the minimum <b>allowable</b> mud <b>pressure</b> is much less compared to when either the Mohr–Coulomb failure model or the Hoek–Brown failure model is adopted (Elyasi and Goshtasbi 2015). Also, predicted mud windows are narrower and conservative with the Hoek–Brown model (Elyasi and Goshtasbi 2015). The failure criterion selected therefore has a prominent influence on the defined safe mud window. Due to its simplicity, the linear-elastic analysis {{is often used to}} predict the initiation of failure. In terms of stress, the onset of tensile or compressive failure happens when the respective tensile and compressive rock strength is exceeded. Whereas the criterion for tensile failure is defined by when the minimum effective stress is greater than the rock tensile strength, the criterion for compressive failure is determined by whichever compressive failure criterion is deemed appropriate (McLean and Addis 1990) (e.g. Mohr–Coulomb, Drucker–Prager and Hoek–Brown).|$|R
40|$|Based on {{a variety}} of case {{histories}} of site investigations, including extensive bore hole data, laboratory testing and geophysical prospecting at more than 550 construction sites, an empirical formulation is proposed for the rapid determination of <b>allowable</b> bearing <b>pressure</b> of shallow foundations in soils and rocks. The proposed expression corroborates consistently with the results of the classical theory and is proven to be rapid, and reliable. Plate load tests have been also carried out at three different sites, in order to further confirm the validity of the proposed method. It consists of only two soil parameters, namely, the in situ measured shear wave velocity and the unit weight. The unit weight may be also determined with sufficient accuracy, by means of other empirical expressions proposed, using P or S - wave velocities.

40|$|The {{collapse}} {{behavior of}} cylindrical shells pressurized from outside is examined. Attention {{is focused on}} tubes of moderate thickness, as required by very deep water pipelines or some innovative nuclear power plant proposals. Their collapse {{is expected to be}} dominated by yielding but, because of the decreasing nature of the post-collapse evolution, interaction with instability is likely to be significant enough to demand consideration. At present, no quantitative assessment of such effect is available, because little study has been devoted to tubes in this thickness range. Plasticity–instability interaction is activated by imperfections and to assess their influence on a systematic numerical study is undertaken. Computations produce a meaningful measure of the collapse pressure and it is proposed that the <b>allowable</b> <b>pressure</b> be determined on its basis, by introducing a suitable safety factor. This is chosen so that results reproduce those provided by presently accepted procedures in the well explored and reliable range of medium-thin tubes.

40|$|The Winkler spring {{model is}} the most {{convenient}} representation of soil support {{in the domain of}} linear elasticity for framed structure-soil interaction analyses. The closeness of the analytical results obtained using this model with those corresponding to the elastic half-space continuum has been investigated in the past for foundation beams. The findings, however, are not applicable to framed structures founded on beam or strip footings. Moreover, the past investigations employ the concept of characteristic length which does not adequately account for the stiffness contribution of the superstructure.
