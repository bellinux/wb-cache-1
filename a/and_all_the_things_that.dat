500|$|... "The Gloaming (Softly Open our Mouths in the Cold)" [...] is an {{electronic}} song with [...] "mechanical rhythms" [...] that Jonny Greenwood built from tape loops. Greenwood {{described it as}} [...] "very old school electronica: no computers, just analogue synths, tape machines, and sellotape." [...] Yorke felt the song was [...] "the most explicit protest song on the record... I feel really strongly that it's about the rise of fascism, {{and the rise of}} intolerance and bigotry and fear, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> keep a population down." [...] "There There (The Boney King of Nowhere)" [...] is a guitar-led rock song with layered percussion building to a loud climax. It was influenced by krautrock band Can, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Pixies.|$|E
500|$|Following Die Another Day, Madonna {{collaborated with}} fashion {{photographer}} Steven Klein in 2003 for an exhibition installation named X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It included photography from {{a photo shoot}} in W magazine, and seven video segments. The installation ran from March to May in New York's Deitch Projects gallery. It traveled the world in an edited form. The same year, Madonna released her ninth studio album, American Life, {{which was based on}} her observations of American society; it received mixed reviews. She commented, [...] " [...] was like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished and all the things I once valued <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were important to me." [...] Larry Flick from The Advocate felt that [...] "American Life is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent" [...] while condemning it as [...] "a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously." [...] The title song peaked at number 37 on the Hot 100. Its original music video was canceled as Madonna thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq. With four million copies sold worldwide, American Life was the lowest-selling album of her career at that point.|$|E

500|$|... "Lacrymosa" [...] {{incorporates}} the Lacrimosa sequence from Mozart's Requiem (1791). It additionally includes a 22-piece orchestra led by Dave Campbell and background vocals by The Millennium Choir. Inspired {{by the film}} Amadeus, the song contains electronic backing beats, symphonic string section, heavy guitar and a haunting choir. Its vocals make a contrasting representation of light and dark. Jim Farber of Daily News compared the song with the works of English progressive rock band Renaissance. [...] "Like You" [...] is written in memory of Lee's deceased sister, as was [...] "Hello" [...] on Fallen. Concerning this, the singer said, [...] "I can't help but be affected by that, and if it's my place to express myself <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have been most deep and the most painful and have just touched me, I feel like it does honor her". One of the most personal songs on the album, [...] "Like You", contains lyrics which yearn for death so Lee can be with her sister. which are accompanied by heavy riffing guitars. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield found similarities between the track and American rock band My Chemical Romance's song [...] "Helena" [...] (2005); other critics compared the song with Evanescence's earlier material on Fallen. [...] "Lose Control" [...] was inspired by Balsamo's loud guitar and contains influences from Portishead. The protagonist shows her anger through the lines, [...] "You don't remember my name, I don't really care". According to Lee, the song is about wanting to be less apprehensive and looser.|$|E
500|$|Archie's {{murder was}} {{compared}} to that of Den Watts in EastEnders in 2005 by Polly Hudson of the Daily Mirror, while Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian called it a rip-off of Citizen Kane. Andrew Grimes from Manchester Evening News said the Christmas Day episode was [...] "in every sense compelling, and to my utter astonishment, a complete and utter joy", and John Gibson of Edinburgh Evening News gave the murder discovery episode on 26 December 2009 a negative review, saying [...] "Hard to tell what was most horrific... the murder, which was bloody, the acting, which was dire, or the script, which was torture." [...] Tim Teeman of The Times called the revelation of Stacey as Archie's killer a [...] "genuine surprise", while Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie's killer was [...] "a slight let-down" [...] and [...] "a little bit predictable". The storyline was nominated in the Killer Secret category at the 2010 All About Soap Bubble Awards. It also received a nomination in the Best Storyline category at the 2010 British Soap Awards and the Best Soap Storyline category at the 2010 TVChoice Awards. Real life police detectives criticised the portrayal of detectives in the show, saying that viewers who see them talking to residents about the case and accepting bribes may believe they operate that way in reality. The BBC insisted that a police consultant was used, adding that [...] "this is heightened fiction <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we show might not always represent real life." [...] The storyline was referenced by Prime Minister Gordon Brown when referring to allegations of bullying, saying [...] "The only thing I haven't been accused of is murdering that guy Archie Mitchell in EastEnders." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{began writing}} songs shortly after {{completing}} Lonerism, {{but was unable}} to specify when the album began to take shape: [...] "There’s never really a start and never really an end either." [...] The idea to compile his songs into an album came when he had between 10–20 songs ready. In May 2014, Parker spoke of his growing inclination toward recording the album in a triple J radio interview, explaining that: [...] "I'm getting more and more sucked into the world of making an album. It's weird how it happens naturally, it's almost feels like a seasonal thing. I've started to think about tracklistings <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> come with an album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Albini {{named his}} new musical project Big Black, calling the moniker [...] "just {{sort of a}} {{reduction}} {{of the concept of}} a large, scary, ominous figure.

[...] He used the Lungs tape to try to enlist other musicians to the project, briefly recruiting Minor Threat guitarist Lyle Preslar who was attending Northwestern, but the two proved incompatible as musicians. Albini passed Lungs on to John Babbin of the small local label Ruthless Records, who released 1,500 copies of the EP in December 1982 with random objects such as dollar bills, used condoms, photographs of Bruce Lee, and bloody pieces of paper thrown into the insert.|$|E

Like the , {{it takes the}} form of a single narrator in a dialogue, {{offering}} presumable objections from the other side. Its treatment of free will relies on Anselm's earlier works, but goes into greater detail as to the ways in which there is no actual incompatibility or paradox created by the divine attributes. In its 5th chapter, Anselm reprises his consideration of eternity from the Monologion. [...] "Although nothing is there except what is present, it is not the temporal present, like ours, but rather the eternal, within which all times altogether are contained. If in a certain way the present time contains every place <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are in any place, likewise, every time is encompassed in the eternal present, and everything that is in any time." [...] It is an overarching present, all beheld at once by God, thus permitting both his [...] "foreknowledge" [...] and genuine free choice on the part of mankind.|$|E

60|$|Do {{you think}} that love-letters are not desired between lovers? Why these, God's ordinances, they are his love-letters, and his love-tokens too. No marvel then if the righteous do so desire them: 'More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honey-comb' (Psa 19:10, 119:72-127). Yea, this {{judgment}} wisdom itself passes upon these things. 'Receive,' saith he, 'my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. For wisdom is better than rubies: <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> may be desired, {{are not to be}} compared to it' (Prov 8:10,11). For this cause therefore are the ordinances of God so much desired by the righteous. In them they meet with God; and by them they are builded, and nourished up to eternal life. 'As new born babes,' says Peter, 'desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby' (1 Peter 2:2). As milk is nourishing to children, so is the word heard, read, and meditated on, to the righteous. Therefore it is their desire.|$|E
