England kept muscling on, and despite never playing {{on top of their}} game they got four more wickets before the scheduled close of play. Giles got two of those, dismissing Katich and Gilchrist, and then an inswinging ball from Flintoff took care of Gillespie, who was trapped lbw.|$|E

Morrison's rapping in the episode was an already acquired skill, with Gilsig commenting: [...] "He can do it. It didn't look like a joke, it <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> totally authentic, and he was fantastic. I think he has just an amazing musical range.

[...] Riley deemed Kurt's coming out in the episode [...] "very emotional" [...] and [...] "one of [...] favorite scenes". Colfer described the scene as [...] "very respectful and very touching ... very, very real and serious." ...|$|E

In 2008 English actress Sophie Winkleman, who had attended Cambridge University in the 1990s, remarked wryly that she had [...] "wor floaty dresses at university ... thinking that I looked poetic and wistful. I <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> homeless".

2500|$|There are {{actually}} several different legal doctrines {{at work in}} this case. [...] First, the case was decided under United States Supreme Court takings jurisprudence. [...] The plurality looked to the factors enunciated in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City {{to determine if the}} enacted legislation functioned to deprive Eastern Enterprises of property without just compensation. [...] Since Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, the factors enunciated by Justice Brennan therein have been used to determine when a regulation rises {{to the level of a}} taking thereby requiring just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. [...] Second, since Lochner v. New York the Court has been reluctant to find on due process grounds that economic regulation was beyond the power of Congress. [...] Third, the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 was passed to remedy the insolvent pension plans of the coal mining labors which had been in place since the 1950s. [...] Fourth, and perhaps not independent, the Court examined the ex post facto nature of the effect of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 on Eastern. [...] The majority examined such under its Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City analysis while the concurrence and the dissents <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> at it as a distinct basis to hold the Congressional Act unconstitutional.|$|E
