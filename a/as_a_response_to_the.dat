5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, is the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, is expected to increase in line with inflation. This situation is aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance {{would lead to a}} harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and a best-seller {{by the standards of the}} day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E

5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
