50|$|The {{scope of}} the CAMO is to {{organize}} and manage all documents and publications for Maintenance Organizations Part 145 and Part M approved, like development and management of aircraft maintenance programmes fulfilled. A CAMO must also provide record keeping of maintenance performed. In other words, a CAMO provides a service for aircraft maintenance organizations. EASA {{has the power to}} give CAMO second privileges also but not in all cases. These second privileges allow the CAMO to conduct <b>airworthiness</b> <b>review</b> on aircraft, issue (or recommend for issue) <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Review</b> Certificates and issue 'permit to fly' for maintenance check flights.|$|R

In January 2010, VC10 passenger operations were temporarily suspended while an <b>airworthiness</b> <b>review</b> was carried out.|$|R
50|$|Personnel {{required}} to be employed in a CAMO are the Accountable Manager (which can be the same person for CAMO and operator), the Quality Manager (to ensure all EASA requirements are in compliance) and appropriately qualified staff for airworthiness management.

40|$|Engineering {{availability}} and operational readiness of an aircraft are requisites {{for its ability}} to operate. After the aircraft has been supplied, both features determine airworthiness of the aircraft, in compliance with the ARC (<b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Review</b> Certificate). Improvement in methods of maintaining the aircraft availability proceeds in compliance with the MSG (Maintenance Steering Group) rules. The paper has been intended to outline the process of maintaining the engineering availability of the aircraft, with account taken of: aircraft maintainability, importance of the engineering diagnostics, and evaluation rates for different maintenance patterns. Maintaining technical ability / airworthiness of an aircraft, ground service of aircrafts, service-friendliness of an aircraft, unfitness and damages to an aircraft, ground diagnostic and provision equipment for A- 380, computer aided verification of an inspection of a front undercarriage (B) of an aircraft (A) and service of the B- 787 aircraft (C), percentage for composite material portion in the structure of some aircrafts and helicopters, positions of composite material airframe elements in B- 757 / 767, B- 777, B- 787 are presented in the paper...|$|R
25|$|The {{origins of}} the Type 31 frigate {{are found in the}} 2010 Strategic Defence and Security <b>Review.</b> The <b>review</b> <b>authorised</b> a {{replacement}} programme, known as the Global Combat Ship (GCS), to replace the Royal Navy's thirteen Type 23 frigates. Earlier that year, BAE Systems was awarded a four-year, £127 million contract by the Ministry of Defence to design the new class. It was planned that two variants of the class would be built: five general purpose frigates and eight anti-submarine warfare frigates. There was to be little difference between the two variants, except for the Sonar 2087. Initial expectations were that all thirteen of the Global Combat Ships would be built starting in 2016, and gradually replace the Type 23 frigates one for one out to the mid-2030s. This planning assumption would not last, and during the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the then Prime minister David Cameron announced that only eight of the anti-submarine warfare version, the Type 26 frigate, would be ordered.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAutorotation landing is {{a special}} {{manoeuvre}} for helicopter when the engine failed. In this situation, it requires the pilot's accurate management, correct judgment and decision on time to enter into steady autorotation. After entry into steady autorotation, then according to the flight altitude and speed, select the landing position, flare from autorotation, and perform a power-off landing successfully. Herein, it will be discussed how the helicopter performs the autorotation when losing the power, including the affecting factors. And refer to the <b>airworthiness</b> regulation, <b>review</b> the relevant sections, discuss the concerning aspect in the certification flight.

40|$|The ALTUS Cumulus Electrification Study (ACES) is an {{uninhabited}} aerial vehicle (UAV) -based {{project that}} will investigate thunderstorms {{in the vicinity}} of the Florida Everglades in August 2002. ACES is being conducted to both investigate storm electrical activity and its relationship to storm morphology, and validate Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite measurements. In addition, as part of NASA's UAV-based science demonstration program, this project will provide a scientifically useful demonstration of the utility and promise of UAV platforms for Earth science and applications observations. Part of the demonstration involves getting approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration and the NASA <b>airworthiness</b> flight safety <b>review</b> board. ACES will employ the ALTUS II aircraft, built by General Atomics - Aeronautical Systems, Inc. Key science objectives simultaneously addressed by ACES are to: (1) investigate lightning-storm relationships, (2) study storm electrical budgets, and (3) provide Lightning Imaging Sensor validation. The ACES payload, already developed and flown on ALTUS, includes electrical, magnetic, and optical sensors to remotely characterize the lightning activity and the electrical environment within and around thunderstorms. ACES will contribute important electrical and optical measurements not available from other sources. Also, the high altitude vantage point of the UAV observing platform (up to 55, 000 feet) offers a useful 'cloud-top' perspective. By taking advantage of its slow flight speed (70 to 100 knots), long endurance, and high altitude flight, the ALTUS will be flown near, and when possible, above (but never into) thunderstorms for long periods of time, allowing investigations to be conducted over entire storm life cycles. In addition, concurrent ground-based observations will enable the UAV measurements to be more completely interpreted and evaluated in the context of the thunderstorm structure, evolution, and environment...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Current Planetary Probe Science and TechnologySixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopExoMars is the first mission of the ESA Exploration Programme - Aurora. The mission will demonstrate the feasibility of several key technologies that are necessary to support the European ambitions for future human exploration: * Entry and Descent of a large re-entry capsule (1200 kg) and Landing (EDL) of a payload of about 600 Kg on the Mars surface * Surface mobility via a Rover (250 kg) having several kilometres of mobility range * Access to sub-surface via a Drill, mounted in the Rover, to acquire samples down to 2 meters. * Automatic sample preparation and distribution for analyses of scientific experiments. Two sets of scientific payloads will be brought to Mars with the following objectives: * Establish whether life ever existed or still exists on Mars (tight control of the bio-burden exported to Mars) * Characterize the Mars geochemistry and water distribution * Improve the knowledge of the Mars environment and geophysics * Identify possible surface hazards to future human exploration missions. The mission configuration, named Enhanced Baseline Mission, foresees the launch of a Spacecraft Composite (SC) by means of an Ariane 5 launcher lifting from Kourou. An optimal launch window has been established from November 23 rd to December 13 th 2013. The mission and the SC will be designed to be compatible with a back-up launcher, Proton -M from Baikonur. An alternative launch date is foreseen, in January 2016. The SC Composite is formed by a Carrier Module (CM) and a Descent Module Composite (DMC), consisting of the Descent Module (DM) housing the Rover Module (RM). The total mass at launch is about 4550 kg. The mission is an enhanced version of the original baseline as it still foresees: * Expandable Carrier that will break and burn up in the Mars atmosphere after releasing the DM. * Use of a NASA Relay Orbiter for the communications from/to Mars However the Rover mission is significantly enhanced: * Rover mass is now raised to 250 kg to accommodate all the scientific instruments of the Pasteur Payload (PPL) * The stationary scientific payload, Humboldt Payload (HPL - formerly GEP) is definitely baselined as part of the Lander. The PFM campaign will be completed within February 2013 with the Flight Acceptance <b>Review</b> which <b>authorises</b> the SC shipment to Korou for the starting of the launch campaign. The Flight Readiness Review is placed mid November 2013 : the optimal 21 -days launch window will last from 23 rd November to 13 th December 2013...|$|R
