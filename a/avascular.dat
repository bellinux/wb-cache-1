5|$|According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel {{and other}} sources, during the {{physical}} after the trade, Favre {{was diagnosed with}} <b>avascular</b> necrosis of the hip, the same degenerative condition that ended running back Bo Jackson's football career, and doctors recommended his physical be failed, which would nullify the trade. Wolf overruled them.|$|E
5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral <b>avascular</b> necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, Emery {{was placed}} on injured reserve to have surgery on a torn muscle in his abdomen. Originally {{expected}} to miss about six weeks, the prognosis changed when {{it was discovered that}} he had <b>avascular</b> necrosis. In March 2010, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren announced that Emery would be out for remainder of the season due to the diagnosis and that a bone graft would be done to alleviate his hip issues.|$|E
5|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, {{also called}} <b>Avascular</b> Necrosis of the Femoral Head, {{is where the}} ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates {{following}} interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6–12 months of age and has been documented {{in a variety of}} other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{is caused}} by blood {{deprivation}} in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone {{to die in a}} process called <b>avascular</b> necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.|$|E
5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} <b>avascular</b> necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause {{osteochondritis}} dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma {{is thought to be}} the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).|$|E
25|$|Rothschild and Martin {{looked for}} {{evidence}} that mosasaurs {{suffered from the}} bends {{as a result of}} their diving and ascent activities. <b>Avascular</b> necrosis resulting from the bends was completely absent in fossils of the genus Clidastes, suggesting that it preferred to stay near the surface. In contrast, Rothschild and Martin observed <b>avascular</b> necrosis in nearly every specimen of Platecarpus and Tylosaurus that they surveyed. The presence and ubiquity of the <b>avascular</b> necrosis is consistent with the idea that these were deep diving animals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Avascular</b> {{necrosis}} (aseptic bone necrosis) {{of the hip}} {{and other}} major joints may occur {{as a result of}} ischaemia.|$|E
25|$|The {{central area}} of the disc is <b>avascular</b> and lacks innervation, and, in contrast, the {{peripheral}} region has both blood vessels and nerves. Few cells are present, but fibroblasts and white blood cells are among these. The central area is also thinner but of denser consistency than the peripheral region, which is thicker but has a more cushioned consistency. The synovial fluid in the synovial cavities provides the nutrition for the <b>avascular</b> central {{area of the}} disc. With age, the entire disc thins and may undergo addition of cartilage in the central part, changes {{that may lead to}} impaired movement of the joint.|$|E
25|$|Legg-Calvé-Perthes syndrome, {{also known}} as Perthes disease or <b>avascular</b> {{necrosis}} of the femoral head, {{is characterized by a}} deformity of the head of the femur and hip pain. It occurs in small breed puppies.|$|E
25|$|Nonunion, {{failure of}} the {{fracture}} to heal, is common in fractures of {{the neck of the}} femur, but much more rare with other types of hip fracture. <b>Avascular</b> necrosis of the femoral head occurs frequently (20%) in intracapsular hip fractures, because the blood supply is interrupted.|$|E
25|$|Corticosteroids are a {{class of}} {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs used to treat moderate to severe flares of Crohn's disease. However, they are used sparingly because they can cause serious side effects, including Cushing's syndrome, mania, insomnia, hypertension, high blood glucose, osteoporosis, and <b>avascular</b> necrosis of long bones. Corticosteroids {{should not be confused}} with the anabolic steroids used to enhance athletic performance.|$|E
25|$|The cornea is <b>avascular</b> {{because it}} must be {{transparent}} to function normally. Its cells absorb oxygen from the tear film. Thus, low-oxygen-permeable contact lenses reduce the cornea's oxygen absorption, sometimes resulting in corneal neovascularization—the growth of blood vessels into the cornea. This causes a slight lengthening of inflammation duration and healing time and some pain during surgery, because of greater bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Total hip {{replacement}} is {{most commonly used}} to treat joint failure caused by osteoarthritis. Other indications include rheumatoid arthritis, <b>avascular</b> necrosis, traumatic arthritis, protrusio acetabuli, certain hip fractures, benign and malignant bone tumors, arthritis associated with Paget's disease, ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The aims of the procedure are pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as physical therapy and pain medications, have failed.|$|E
25|$|One such {{previously}} suspected complication was coxa magna, {{which is}} an overgrowth of the femoral head and broadening of the femoral neck, accompanied by changes in the acetabulum, which may lead to subluxation of the femur. There was also some controversy about whether continuous high intra-articular pressure in transient synovitis could cause <b>avascular</b> necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease), but further studies did not confirm any link between the two conditions.|$|E
25|$|When {{treating}} <b>avascular</b> necrosis of {{the bone}} in people with sickle cell disease, the aim of treatment is to reduce or stop the pain and maintain joint mobility. Current treatment options are to rest the joint, physical therapy, pain relief medicine, joint replacement surgery, or bone grafting. High quality randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the most effective treatment option and determine if a combination of physical therapy and surgery are more effective than physical therapy alone.|$|E
25|$|Perthes' {{disease is}} one of the most common hip {{disorders}} in young children, occurring in roughly 5.5 of 100,000 children per year. The lifetime risk of a child developing the disease is about one per 1,200 individuals. Boys are affected about three to five times more often than girls. New cases of Perthes' disease rarely occur after age 14 years (if diagnosed after 14 years of age, then it is usually old disease from early in childhood or <b>avascular</b> necrosis from an alternative cause).|$|E
25|$|Bone {{fracture}}s, {{such as a}} toddler's fracture (spiral {{fracture of}} the shin bone), can also cause pain and limp, but are uncommon around the hip joint. Soft tissue injuries can be evident when bruises are present. Muscle or ligament injuries can be contracted during heavy physical activity —however, {{it is important not}} to miss a slipped upper femoral epiphysis. <b>Avascular</b> necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease) typically occurs in children aged 4–8, and is also more common in boys. There may be an effusion on ultrasound, similar to transient synovitis.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{air sacs}} {{found within the}} {{respiratory}} system {{are those of the}} post-thoracic region, while the others decrease in size respectively, the interclavicular (unpaired), abdominal, pre-thoracic, and lateral clavicular sacs. The adult common ostrich lung lacks connective tissue known as interparabronchial septa, which render strength to the non-compliant avian lung in other bird species. Due to this the lack of connective tissue surrounding the parabronchi and adjacent parabronchial lumen, they exchange blood capillaries or <b>avascular</b> epithelial plates. Like mammals, ostrich lungs contain an abundance of type II cells at gas exchange sites; an adaptation for preventing lung collapse during slight volume changes.|$|E
25|$|Enamel {{does not}} contain collagen, as found in other hard tissues such as dentin and bone, but it does contain two unique classes of {{proteins}}: amelogenins and enamelins. While the role of these proteins is not fully understood, {{it is believed that}} they aid in the development of enamel by serving as a framework for minerals to form on, among other functions. Once it is mature, enamel is almost totally without the softer organic matter. Enamel is <b>avascular</b> and has no nerve supply within it and is not renewed, however, it is not a static tissue as it can undergo mineralization changes.|$|E
25|$|The pecten is {{a poorly}} {{understood}} body consisting of folded tissue which projects from the retina. It is well supplied with {{blood vessels and}} appears to keep the retina supplied with nutrients, and may also shade the retina from dazzling light or aid in detecting moving objects. Pecten oculi is abundantly filled with melanin granules which have been proposed to absorb stray light entering the bird eye to reduce background glare. Slight warming of pecten oculi due to absorption of light by melanin granules has been proposed enhance metabolic rate of pecten that is suggested to help increase secretion of nutrients into vitreous, eventually to be absorbed by <b>avascular</b> retina of birds for improved nutrition. Exra-high enzymic activity of alkaline phosphatase in pecten oculi has been proposed to support high secretory activity of pecten to supplement nutrition of retina.|$|E
25|$|However, {{given the}} very real {{possibility}} of a limp, constant and/or debilitating pain, complicated treatment and impaired mobility later in life, careful developmental monitoring is indicated and early intervention is often the result. The worst possible consequence of non treatment is developing early arthritis, sometimes even during teenage years. All treatment aims to delay the onset of arthritis, but no treatment is fully successful in avoiding it; and, all available treatments bear the risk of inflicting equivalent damage. Most unfortunately, studies have as yet {{been unable to find}} a method of predicting outcomes in either the surgical/orthopedic treatment of the condition in infants and young children, or the surgical treatment of these early treatments' negative outcomes later in life (such as arthritis, <b>avascular</b> necrosis, trochanteric bursitis, and bone spurs of up to 2cm just medial of the gluteus maximus insertion point on the greater trochanter due to excessive friction).|$|E
500|$|Despite much research, {{the causes}} remain unclear but include {{repetitive}} physical trauma, ischemia (restriction of blood flow), hereditary and endocrine factors, <b>avascular</b> necrosis (loss of blood flow), rapid growth, deficiencies and imbalances in {{the ratio of}} calcium to phosphorus, and problems of bone formation. Although the name [...] "osteochondritis" [...] implies inflammation, the lack of inflammatory cells in histological examination suggests a non-inflammatory cause. It is thought that repetitive microtrauma, which leads to microfractures and sometimes an interruption of blood supply to the subchondral bone, may cause subsequent localized loss of blood supply or alteration of growth.|$|E
2500|$|Healing of the {{fracture}} with a non-anatomic deformity (frequently, a volar flexed [...] "humpback") {{can also lead}} to post-traumatic arthritis. [...] Non-unions can result in loss of blood supply to the proximal pole, which can result in <b>avascular</b> necrosis of the proximal segment.|$|E
2500|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease (LCPD) is a {{childhood}} hip disorder initiated by {{a disruption of}} {{blood flow to the}} ball of the femur called the femoral head. [...] Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or <b>avascular</b> necrosis) and stops growing. [...] Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head. [...] The bone loss leads to some degree of collapse and deformity of the femoral head and sometimes secondary changes to the shape of the hip socket. It is also referred to as idiopathic <b>avascular</b> osteonecrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis of the femoral head since the cause of the interruption of the blood supply of the head of the femur in the hip joint is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|LCP {{disease is}} an <b>avascular</b> {{necrosis}} of the femoral head in small-breed dogs, usually those weighing up to 25 lbs. LCP disease was first described in veterinary literature by Tutt in 1935. Tutt described the disease as almost exactly what Waldenstromin (1909) described in humans. Small breeds, particularly Toy Poodles, Yorkshire Terriers, Pugs, Jack Russell Terriers, West Highland White Terriers, and Dachshunds can be affected. [...] No sex predilection {{is seen in}} the dog as contrasted to humans, in whom an 80% male incidence of the disease is evident. Similar to children, however, the condition is usually unilateral, with only about 10% to 15% incidence of bilateral disease. The age of onset varies between 4 and 12 months, with a peak incidence around 7 months. The pathology of <b>avascular</b> necrosis followed by revascularization and bony remodeling of the femoral head in the dog certainly suggests a vascular etiology, though the cause of the condition is not completely understood.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the width}} of the {{mandible}} is less than 1cm, the jaw loses its endosteal blood supply. [...] Instead, the blood supply comes largely from the periosteum. [...] Open reduction (which normally strips the periosteum during the dissection) can lead to <b>avascular</b> necrosis. [...] In these cases, oral surgeons sometimes opt for external fixation, closed reduction, supraperiosteal dissection or other techniques to maintain the periosteal blood flow.|$|E
2500|$|Within a {{month of}} the injury, Jackson had been {{diagnosed}} with <b>avascular</b> necrosis of the hip joint. He also was found to have lost all of the cartilage supporting his hip. He would be forced to retire from football, and was then cut by the Royals in spring training. Jackson would return to competition with the White Sox {{toward the end of the}} 1991 baseball season ...|$|E
2500|$|Suffering from {{lingering}} {{injuries from}} past high-risk acrobatic stage antics and crashes, Van Halen underwent hip replacement surgery in November 1999, after his chronic <b>avascular</b> necrosis, {{with which he}} was diagnosed in 1995, became unbearable. In April 2001, Van Halen confirmed he had been undergoing treatment for tongue cancer since May 2000. [...] The subsequent surgery removed roughly {{a third of his}} tongue. [...] He was declared cancer-free in May 2002.|$|E
2500|$|The pubic {{symphysis}} is a nonsynovial amphiarthrodial joint. The {{name comes}} from the Greek word [...] "symphysis", meaning [...] "growing together". The width of the pubic symphysis at the front is 3–5mm greater than its width at the back. This joint is connected by fibrocartilage and may contain a fluid-filled cavity; the center is <b>avascular,</b> possibly {{due to the nature}} of the compressive forces passing through this joint, which may lead to harmful vascular disease. The ends of both pubic bones are covered by a thin layer of hyaline cartilage attached to the fibrocartilage. The fibrocartilaginous disk is reinforced by a series of ligaments. These ligaments cling to the fibrocartilaginous disk to the point that fibers intermix with it.|$|E
2500|$|This was Bo Jackson's final NFL game, having {{injured his}} left hip {{during the third}} quarter while being tackled from behind by Bengals linebacker Kevin Walker. The injury was later {{revealed}} to have caused a degenerative bone condition in Jackson's hip called <b>avascular</b> necrosis. Before being knocked out of the game, he rushed six times for 77 yards. Some Bengals fans theorize that this injury {{to one of the}} greatest athletes ever placed a curse on the Bengals franchise (sometimes called [...] "the curse of Bo Jackson"), and that this curse is partially responsible for the Bengals' notorious failure to field a competitive football team for most of the next decade and a half.|$|E
2500|$|Early hip {{dysplasia}} {{can often be}} treated using a Pavlik harness (see photograph) or the Frejka pillow/splint {{in the first year}} of life with usually normal results. [...] Complications can occur when using the Pavlik Harness. [...] Cases of Femoral Nerve Palsy and <b>Avascular</b> Necrosis of the femoral head have been reported with the use of the Pavlik harness, but whether these cases were due to improper application of the device or a complication encountered in the course of the disorder remains unresolved. Complications arise mainly because the sheet of the iliopsoas muscle pushes circumflex artery against the neck of the femur and decreases blood flow to the femoral head, so the Frejka pillow is not indicated in all the forms of the developmental dysplasia of the hip.|$|E
2500|$|The body {{reacts to}} this in several ways. First, the joint itself is {{continually}} repairing itself and laying down new cartilage. However, cartilage repair {{is a relatively}} slow process, the tissue being <b>avascular,</b> so the joint may suffer degradation due to the abnormal wear and tear, or may not support the body weight as intended. The joint becomes inflamed and a cycle of cartilage damage, inflammation and pain commences. This is a self-fueling process, in that the more the joint becomes damaged, the less able it is to resist further damage. The inflammation causes further damage. The bones of the joint may also develop osteoarthritis, visible on an X-ray as small outcrops of bone, which further degrade the joint. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease marked by the breakdown of cartilage between joints resulting in painful bone-to-bone contact.|$|E
2500|$|Non-thrombogenic – As natural {{heart valves}} {{are lined with}} an {{endothelium}} continuous with the endothelium lining the heart chambers they are not normally thrombogenic. This is important as should thrombi form on the heart valve leaflets and become seeded with bacteria, so called [...] "bacterial vegetations" [...] will form. Such vegetations are difficult for the body to deal with as the normal physiological defense mechanisms are not present within the valve leaflets because they are <b>avascular</b> and largely composed of connective tissue (Fixme: Create article discussing the pathgonesis of leaflet bacterial vegetations.). Should bacterial vegetations form on the valve leafets they may continually seed bacteria into the arterial tree which may lead to bacteremia or septicaemia. Portions of the vegetation may also break off forming septic emboli. Septic emboli can lodge anywhere in the arterial tree (e.g. brain, bowel, lungs) causing local infectious foci. Even dislodged fragments from uninfected thrombi can be hazardous as they can lodge in, and block, downstream arteries (e.g. coronary arteries leading to myocardial infarction, cerebral arteries leading to stroke, see embolism). [...] A desirable characteristic of heart valve prostheses {{is that they are}} non or minimally thrombogenic.|$|E
2500|$|From September 2007 to October 2009, 11 royal mummies of the New Kingdom's 18th Dynasty have {{undergone}} extensive genetic and radiological testing. A team of doctors, {{under the leadership}} of Dr. Zahi Hawass, took DNA samples from bone tissue of the 11 mummies to determine a family pedigree and to determine if any familial, pathological diseases caused Tutankhamun's death. The study was able to provide a five-generation pedigree, and the KV55 mummy and KV35 Younger Lady mummy were identified as Tutankhamun's [...] parents. KV55 is believed to have contained the body of Ahkenhaten and in KV35, a young lady mummy was discovered and believed to be either Kiya or Nefertiti. It was discovered that Tutankhamun's family had a large number of irregularities. Four of the mummies, including Tutankhamun, were shown to have had malaria tropica. Based on all the data, the study concluded the most likely cause of death for the young king was the combination of <b>avascular</b> necrosis and malaria. The fact that a cane and Ancient Egyptian-style medicines were found in the tomb backed up Hawass's claim that Tutankhamun suffered from a walking impairment.|$|E
