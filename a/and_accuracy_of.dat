5|$|The {{development}} of military camouflage {{was driven by}} the increasing range <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> infantry firearms in the 19th century. In particular {{the replacement of the}} inaccurate musket with weapons such as the Baker rifle made personal concealment in battle essential. Two Napoleonic War skirmishing units of the British Army, the 95th Rifle Regiment and the 60th Rifle Regiment, were the first to adopt camouflage {{in the form of a}} rifle green jacket, while the Line regiments continued to wear scarlet tunics. A contemporary study in 1800 by the English artist and soldier Charles Hamilton Smith provided evidence that grey uniforms were less visible than green ones at a range of 150 yards.|$|E

Evidence for the validity <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Military {{camouflage}} was {{spurred by}} the increasing range <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> firearms in the 19th century. In particular {{the replacement of the}} inaccurate musket with the rifle made personal concealment in battle a survival skill. In the 20th century, military camouflage developed rapidly, especially during the First World War. On land, artists such as André Mare designed camouflage schemes and observation posts disguised as trees. At sea, merchant ships and troop carriers were painted in dazzle patterns that were highly visible, but designed to confuse enemy submarines as to the target's speed, range, and heading. During and after the Second World War, a variety of camouflage schemes were used for aircraft and for ground vehicles in different theatres of war. The use of radar since the mid-20th century has largely made camouflage for fixed-wing military aircraft obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} {{analysis}} {{are used in}} the bioprospecting of metagenomic data: function-driven screening for an expressed trait, and sequence-driven screening for DNA sequences of interest. Function-driven analysis seeks to identify clones expressing a desired trait or useful activity, followed by biochemical characterization and sequence analysis. This approach is limited by availability of a suitable screen and the requirement that the desired trait be expressed in the host cell. Moreover, the low rate of discovery (less than one per 1,000 clones screened) and its labor-intensive nature further limit this approach. In contrast, sequence-driven analysis uses conserved DNA sequences to design PCR primers to screen clones for the sequence of interest. In comparison to cloning-based approaches, using a sequence-only approach further reduces the amount of bench work required. The application of massively parallel sequencing also greatly increases the amount of sequence data generated, which require high-throughput bioinformatic analysis pipelines. The sequence-driven approach to screening is limited by the breadth <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> gene functions present in public sequence databases. In practice, experiments make use of a combination of both functional and sequence-based approaches based upon the function of interest, the complexity of the sample to be screened, and other factors.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the aforementioned Topaze, casualties were minimal: none were recorded on Jason and Hazard and none in the French battery on shore. Cleopatra, due to the poor position <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> her opponent, lost only two men killed and one wounded, the most serious damage being to her masts and rigging, which were badly cut up. Losses among the French that didn't attempt to flee crew in the engagement were also relatively light, with 12 dead and 14 wounded, although a number of men were killed in their attempt to swim for shore after Topaze had surrendered. The French frigate was badly damaged, particularly in her hull, and required extensive repairs before she was fit for service in the Royal Navy, commissioned under the new name of HMS Alcmene.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{availability}} of different {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) chips {{and the development of}} imputation algorithms allow for multistage dairy cattle breeding schemes applying various genomic selection strategies. These SNP genotypes yield genomically estimated breeding values (GEBV) with different accuracies at different costs. Thus, the optimum allocation of investments to different selection paths and strategies to maximize the genetic gain per year (ΔGa) and its sensitivity to changes in cost <b>and</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> GEBV is of great interest. This is even more relevant under the constraints of limited financial resources. With deterministic methods, optimum multistage breeding plans maximizing ΔGa were identified in which selection could take place on GEBV derived from high-density (GEBVHD) and low-density (GEBVLD) SNP genotypes. To account for the uncertainty <b>of</b> cost <b>and</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> GEBV, these parameters were varied in a semi-continuous manner. Overall breeding costs were limited to the crucial expenses of a traditional breeding program with 50 progeny-tested young bulls per year. Results clearly show that, in an optimal selection strategy, selection on GEBVLD is predominantly used for the identification of future bull dams but the main part of ΔGa is still generated from selection of sires. The low selection intensity in the path dam to sire induced a higher sensitivity of ΔGa to changes in cost <b>and</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> GEBVLD compared with the same changes of GEBVHD. On the contrary, the genetic gain generated from selection of males was only affected by changes in <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> GEBVHD but almost unaffected by any changes in cost. Thus, changes in cost <b>and</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> GEBVLD put the most pressure on the breeding scheme structure to maintain a high ΔGa. Furthermore, genomic selection of bull dams produced by far the majority of breeding cost but the lowest genetic gain...|$|R
