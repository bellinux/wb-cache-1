5|$|Women have {{traditionally}} been disadvantaged {{in terms of economic}} and social status and power, which in turn reduces their access to the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in western nations, women remain disadvantaged with respect to men. The gender gap in health is even more acute in developing countries where women are relatively more disadvantaged. In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride.|$|E

One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis {{that he was}} once psychotic. He also interviewed Kemper, including under truth serum, and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in cannibalism, alleging that Kemper sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a casserole. Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed {{the prospect of the}} infamy <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> labeled a serial killer.|$|E

2500|$|Another common {{associative}} {{disorder of}} agoraphobia is thanatophobia, {{the fear of}} death. [...] The anxiety level of agoraphobics often increases when dwelling upon the idea of eventually dying, which they may consciously or unconsciously <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> the ultimate separation from their emotional comfort and safety zones and loved ones, {{even for those who}} may otherwise believe in some form of afterlife.|$|R

5|$|A second form of mimicry {{occurs when}} two aposematic organisms {{share the same}} anti-predator {{adaptation}} and mimic each other, {{to the benefit of}} both species, since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them. This form of mimicry is known as Müllerian mimicry, after Fritz Müller, a German naturalist who studied the phenomenon in the Amazon in the late 19th century. Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are Müllerian mimics; their similar colouration teaches predators that a striped pattern is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> stung. Therefore, a predator which has had a negative experience with any such species will likely avoid any that resemble it in the future. Müllerian mimicry is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range, each of which looks very similar to a different species of poison frog which lives in that area.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

25|$|People with OCD can use rationalizations {{to explain}} their {{behavior}}; however, these rationalizations {{do not apply to}} the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is still not sure and deems it is still better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.|$|E
25|$|As more {{transgender}} {{people are}} represented and included {{within the realm}} of mass culture, the stigma that is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> transgender can influence the decisions, ideas, and thoughts based upon it. Media representation, culture industry, and social marginalization all hint at popular culture standards and the applicability and significance to mass culture as well. These terms {{play an important role in}} the formation of notions for those who have little recognition or knowledge of transgender people. Media depictions represent only a minuscule spectrum of the transgender group, which essentially conveys that those that are shown are the only interpretations and ideas society has of them.|$|E

25|$|Some {{practices}} of manipulation and adulteration {{have gone through}} stages of being considered fraudulent and later accepted as common practice. One {{of these is the}} practice of blending other grape varieties in order to add a characteristic that is lacking in the original wine. This most often occurred {{in the case of a}} wine lacking color. A wine with a deep dark color is often <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> of a higher quality, so blending a darker color variety (or a teinturier) into a lighter wine could enhance the marketability of the wine. Today the practice of blending grape varieties together is commonly accepted (such as blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot), except where such blending is against the regulation of a particular appellation (such as the controversy over the Brunellopoli scandal in Brunello di Montalcino).|$|E
25|$|The sand tiger {{is often}} <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> vicious or deadly, {{due to its}} {{relatively}} large size and sharp, protruding teeth that point outward from its jaws; however, these sharks are quite docile, and are {{not a threat to}} humans. Their mouths are not large enough to cause a human fatality. Sand tigers roam the surf, sometimes in close proximity to humans, and there have been only a few instances of unprovoked sand tiger shark attacks on humans, usually associated with spear fishing, line fishing, or shark feeding. As of 2013, the database of Shark Attack Survivors does not list any fatalities due to sand tiger sharks. When the sharks become aggressive, they tend to steal fish or bait from fishing lines rather than attack humans. Owing to its large size and docile temperament, the sand tiger is commonly displayed in aquariums around the world.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification motives operate for {{different}} {{dimensions of the}} self-concept and in many different situations. Men and women are equally inclined to display this tendency, {{and it does not}} matter whether the self-views refer to characteristics that are relatively immutable (e.g., intelligence) or changeable (e.g., diligence), or whether the self-views happen to be highly specific (e.g., athletic) or global (e.g., low self-esteem, worthlessness). Furthermore, when people chose negative partners over positive ones, it is not merely in an effort to avoid interacting with positive evaluators (that is, out of a concern that they might disappoint such positive evaluators). Rather, people chose self-verifying, negative partners even when the alternative is participating in a different experiment. Finally, recent work has shown that people work to verify self-views associated with group memberships. For example, women seek evaluations that confirm their belief that they possess qualities <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> a woman.|$|E
5000|$|Cerebritis is an {{infection}} {{of the brain that}} normally leads to the formation of an abscess within the brain itself. It is the inflammation of the cerebrum, a structure within the brain, which performs a number of important functions, including most of the things which people <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> human, such as memory and speech. It is also defined as a purulent nonencapsulated parenchymal infection of brain which is characterized by nonspecific features on CT (ill-defined low density area with peripheral enhancement) and cannot reliably be distinguished from neoplasms.|$|R
3000|$|Common first {{responses}} {{to the question of}} what it means to be Australian were, “That’s a difficult question!” or “I don’t think anyone has ever asked me that question!” This is possibly indicative of Australia’s infancy as a nation, compared to other older civilisations, and the complexity of the vast array of cultural influences that make up a non-Aboriginal Australian. While the participants were able to identify a variety of labels that they would <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> “Australian,” the ambiguity <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> what Australian “culture” is, was clear in their wrestling with this question. Based on the participants’ observations (for example, “The European colonisation of Australia imprinted English Caucasian values that were in many ways built on Christian laws and morals”) it was evident that there is indeed a mainstream Australian culture that is heavily influenced by Anglo-Saxon values; however, the participants were unclear as to whether immigration patterns will significantly change this mainstream culture in the decades to come. The words that the participants used to <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> “Australian” were consistent with their positive views toward multiculturalism (such as “fair go” and “mateship”), and indeed consistent with the dominant paradigm of Australian identity based on literature, commercials, and everyday rhetoric. However, as the participants themselves observed, there is a gap between ideology and practice.

25|$|While fear of rape is {{typically}} <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> outside the home, {{the great majority}} of sexual violence actually occurs in the home of the victim or the abuser. Nonetheless, abduction by a stranger is quite often the prelude to a rape and the opportunities for such an abduction are influenced by the physical environment. The social environment within a community is, however, usually more important than the physical surrounding. How deeply entrenched in a community beliefs in male superiority and male entitlement to sex are will greatly affect the likelihood of sexual violence taking place, as will the general tolerance in the community of sexual assault and the strength of sanctions, if any, against perpetrators. For instance, in some places, rape can even occur in public, with passersby refusing to intervene. Complaints of rape may also be treated leniently by the police, particularly if the assault is committed during a date or by the victim's husband.|$|E
25|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{properties of}} potassium bromide were first noted by Sir Charles Locock {{at a meeting}} of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1857. Bromide can be regarded as the first effective medication for epilepsy. At the time, it was commonly thought that epilepsy was caused by masturbation. Locock noted that bromide calmed sexual excitement and thought this was responsible for his success in treating seizures. In the latter half of the 19th century, potassium bromide was used for the calming of seizure and nervous disorders on an enormous scale, with the use by single hospitals being as much as several tons a year (the dose for a given person being a few grams per day). By the beginning of the 20th century the generic word had become so widely <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> sedate that bromide came to mean a dull, sedate person or a boring platitude uttered by such a person.|$|E
25|$|His {{most widely}} known book, Cocorí, {{was a short}} novel {{published}} in 1947. The book follows a titular character in his search for why a flower lived only one day. In 1994, the book was made required reading in Costa Rican schools. The character of Cocorí was Afro-Caribbean. The qualities he portrays in the book raised accusations of racism, notably from fellow Costa Rican author Quince Duncan, human rights activist Epsy Campbell Barr, and others working on behalf of Proyecto Caribe, an organization devoted to promoting Afro-Caribbean rights. They claimed that ugliness was <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>being</b> of African descent and that the comparisons of the character Cocorí to monkeys create a damaging image. Guitiérrez's supporters countered that Cocorí ennobled Afro-Caribbeans. Eventually, in 2003, {{under the direction of}} Wilfrido Blanco Mora, the Ministry of Public Education dropped the requirement that Cocorí be read in public schools. For his part, when the issue of racism in Cocorí was first raised in the early 1980s, Gutiérrez said that there were no racist elements to the book. Cocorí was translated into more than 10 languages and sold more than 750,000 copies around the world.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{an example of}} research in a micro- comparative perspective.

The xihuimeh are described by some as guardians of community. Others depict them as malevolent witches. Variants of these beliefs are found among Nahuas inhabiting other regions of Mexico. They include mythical beings such as dwarfs, atmospheric phenomena, animal guardians, etc. All of these different features attributed to xihuimeh overlap the characteristics of naguales. Thus the xihuimeh complex proves to be a distinctive variation in pattern of nagualism - a Mesoamerican belief system <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> parallel <b>beings</b> and human-to-animal transformations...|$|R
