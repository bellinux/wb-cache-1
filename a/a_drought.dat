5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. <b>A</b> <b>drought</b> in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. <b>A</b> <b>drought</b> in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} <b>a</b> <b>drought,</b> a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{diversity}} of a harvested plant {{can be the}} result of genetic differences: a crop may have genes conferring early maturity or disease resistance Such traits collectively determine a crop's overall characteristics and their future potential. Diversity within a crop includes genetically-influenced attributes such as seed size, branching pattern, height, flower color, fruiting time, and flavor. Crops can also vary in less obvious characteristics such as their response to heat, cold, <b>a</b> <b>drought,</b> or their ability to resist specific diseases and pests.|$|E

Moreover, the cyclone disrupted relief efforts during an aftermath of flood that killed three persons and displaced 33,000people throughout the country.

5|$|Caused {{in part by}} <b>a</b> <b>drought,</b> the Russian famine of 1921 was {{the most}} severe that the country had {{experienced}} since that of 1891, resulting in around five million deaths. The famine was exacerbated by government requisitioning, {{as well as the}} export of large quantities of Russian grain. To aid the famine victims, the US government established an American Relief Administration to distribute food; Lenin was suspicious of this aid and had it closely monitored. During the famine, Patriarch Tikhon called on Orthodox churches to sell unnecessary items to help feed the starving, an action endorsed by the government. In February 1922 Sovnarkom went further by calling on all valuables belonging to religious institutions to be forcibly appropriated and sold. Tikhon opposed the sale of items used within the Eucharist and many clergy resisted the appropriations, resulting in violence.|$|E
5|$|Since 1750, the Columbia has {{experienced}} six multi-year droughts. The longest, lasting 12years in the mid‑19th century, reduced the river's flow to 20percent below average. Scientists {{have expressed concern}} that <b>a</b> similar <b>drought</b> would have grave consequences in a region so dependent on the Columbia. In 1992–1993, <b>a</b> lesser <b>drought</b> affected farmers, hydroelectric power producers, shippers, and wildlife managers.|$|R

5|$|Cyclone Filao was {{the most}} notable storm of the season, {{originating}} in late February off northern Madagascar. It ultimately struck Mozambique on March1, where it killed about 100people and left $10million in damage (1988USD). In January, both tropical storms Calidera and Doaza crossed Madagascar, the latter of which helped end <b>a</b> <b>drought.</b> Long-lasting Tropical Storm Hely also struck the country in March. The strongest cyclone of the season was Gasitao, which formed {{at the same time}} as Hely and attained peak winds of 150km/h (95mph). The season ended when Tropical Storm Iarisena dissipated northeast of Madagascar in the middle of May.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's passage, the Mauritius {{government}} opened 130shelters, {{and also}} provided 5,000rupees to each homeless family. The crop damage from Hollanda, {{in addition to}} <b>a</b> <b>drought,</b> decreased the following year's output by 22%. In response, the government provided seeds to farmers so they could replant their crops. Most of the island had their power restored by ten days after the storm. The country's prime minister issued {{an appeal to the}} European Union for 67million rupees ($3.6million 1994USD) in assistance, although later dropped it to less than half that total. The requested aid was for the restoration of phone and power utilities. The storm's severe impact on Mauritius caused a sharp drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the overall GDP decreased by 10%.|$|E

Djokovic and Federer helped Serbia (2010) and Switzerland (2014), respectively, win the competition for the first time, while Nadal has won four Davis Cup titles, and Murray helped end <b>a</b> <b>drought</b> of 79 years for Great Britain in Davis Cup competition (2015).|$|E

After much political dispute over several proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams were locked in September 1963. However, <b>a</b> <b>drought</b> meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964.

5|$|Hurricane Flossy {{originated}} from a tropical disturbance {{in the eastern}} Pacific Ocean and moved across Central America into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression on September 21, 1956, which became a tropical storm on September 22 and a hurricane on September 23. The hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 90mph (150km/h) before it struck the central Gulf coast of the United States as a Category 1 hurricane on September 24, and evolved into an extratropical cyclone on September 25. It was the first hurricane to affect oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico. The tropical cyclone led to flooding in New Orleans, and broke <b>a</b> <b>drought</b> across the eastern United States.

5|$|In 1776, Father Junípero Serra founded Mission San Juan Capistrano {{on a site}} {{close to}} the creek (possibly near the Cañada Gobernadora confluence), and the creek was named after the mission.

The mission was moved to a second site in present-day San Juan Capistrano, where it still stands. The Spanish referred to the Acjachemem as the Juañeno. The Spanish made the first recorded anthropogenic changes to hydrology in the San Juan watershed, which included excavating irrigation channels, diverting water from streams, and channelizing and changing course of streams. Grazing animals introduced by Europeans, mainly cattle (and later sheep, after <b>a</b> <b>drought</b> decimated the local cattle ranching industry), consumed native grasses and left hillsides exposed and prone to erosion.|$|E
