25|$|Initially, {{after the}} Second World War, BSA {{motorcycles}} were not generally seen as racing machines, {{compared to the}} likes of Norton. In the immediate post-war period few were entered in races such as the TT races, though this changed dramatically in the Junior Clubman event (smaller engine motorcycles racing over some 3 or 4 laps <b>around</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Isle of Man courses). In 1947 there were but a couple of BSA mounted riders, but by 1952 BSA were in the majority and in 1956 the makeup was 53 BSA, 1 Norton and 1 Velocette.|$|E

25|$|Minigames can {{be played}} during {{adventure}} segments, with each minigame being themed <b>around</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the main characters; these include a top-down arcade-style shooter, a chess-style tactical game, score-based games where Ogami must hit targets, and a simulation where Ogami and another character pick locks within a time limit. A dedicated casino allows Ogami to play poker, blackjack, and on a slot machine. When in his apartment, Ogami can access a device called the Kimenotron, allowing audio communication with characters from earlier Sakura Wars games in Japan. A portable version of this called the Mobile Kimenotron is also available for players who connected the Dreamcast console's VMU, which relays text messages at random intervals.|$|E
25|$|Button {{qualified}} in seventh, {{but took}} a five-place grid penalty {{for changing the}} gearbox in his McLaren. As a result his teammate Magnussen moved into seventh. Despite improving his car's balance, Räikkönen slid several times after a front-end problem could not be rectified, creating understeer, and was restricted to starting eighth. Sutil took ninth and Maldonado, who was the fastest driver not to advance into the final part of qualifying, rounded out the top ten, but slid in turn 19, losing about two-tenths of a second, preventing him from bettering his time. Pérez used two set of super-soft tyres in the first session to ensure he made {{the second part of}} qualifying and took 11th. Hülkenberg was forecast to qualify in the top ten until a tear-off visor wrapped itself <b>around</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his front tyres entering turn 12. He had no grip, ran wide, and lost time, restricting him to qualifying 13th. Kvyat complained of tyre temperature issues after being delayed by slower traffic on his out-lap and could only muster 14th. However, he was handed a ten-place grid penalty for changing an engine component. His teammate Vergne moved into his former starting position and was the fastest driver not to enter the second session by five hundredths of a seconds. Vergne attributed this to changing to an old less powerful engine and excessive oversteer. Esteban Gutiérrez lined up in 15th ahead of Grosjean. Vettel opted to do one lap on soft compound tyres to comply with the 107% rule and took 17th. He started from the pit lane after changing his engine, his sixth of the season.|$|E
25|$|On November 12, 2010, Rodríguez was {{involved}} in an incident where a pickup truck was partially damaged. He and a companion were burned, being initially attended {{at a hospital in}} Vega Baja, before both were transferred to the specialized burn care unit of Centro Médico in San Juan, where he was placed in preventive intubation to ease the stress on his lungs. Rodríguez suffered second degree burns in approximately 66% of his body, most of the damage focusing in his back and legs. Due to the incident, Rodríguez was removed from a scheduled dual, but was kept among the recipients of a grant issued by the COPUR. By late December he was already training two to three days per week, while admitted in the burn unit and still wearing bandages <b>around</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his arms and both legs. His trainer, Orlando Rodríguez, noted that {{this was the first time}} that he worked with a pugilist while still recovering in a hospital. Consequently, a special regime was prepared to work on his footwork, speed and strength, while including other standard practices such as shadow boxing and pads. In his first interview since the incident, Rodríguez noted that he intended to focus on his career and education from that point onwards, severing ties with any negative influence. The following week, the possibility of infection was dismissed by the medical personnel, who allowed more contact with external items, including haircutting tools. Upon being released, the original plan was to participate in the qualification of the 2011 Pan American Games, but he received a negative report from Enrique Amy, chief doctor of the COPUR's Anti-Doping Commission. The amateur boxing federation followed the recommendation. Consequently, Rodríguez spent several months of additional recovery, focused on treatment to avoid re-injuring or infecting the scar tissue in his left arm.|$|E

[...] The roof dates from the 15th century, although the visible beams are not original; the roof's exposed wooden trusses rest on sandstone corbels. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted 20 memorials from the 17th and 18th centuries. It also recorded {{the presence of a}} sundial on a pedestal, dated 1768, and some stone shields that were not attached to the building, bearing dates of 1561 and 1563. Most of the fittings now in St Nidan's are not original, and come from other churches in north-west Wales; the granite altar is modern.|$|E
500|$|The Jupiter trojans, {{commonly}} called Trojan asteroids or just Trojans, {{are a large}} group of asteroids that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the Sun. [...] They are named for heroes in the ancient Greek tales of the Trojan War. [...] Relative to Jupiter, each Trojan librates <b>around</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter's two stable Lagrange points: , lying 60° ahead of the planet in its orbit, and , 60° behind. Jupiter trojans are distributed in two elongated, curved regions around these Lagrangian points with an average semi-major axis of about 5.2AU. [...] If you draw a line from Jupiter to each group of asteroids (one group that follows Jupiter in its orbit, and others that move ahead of it in its orbit), and then draw lines from Jupiter and both groups to the Sun, you will have two equal-sided triangles.|$|E
500|$|The second {{match of}} the show {{centered}} <b>around</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the classic tropes in Lucha Libre in which one or more young wrestlers tried to earn the respect of veteran wrestlers, often with the veteran wrestlers portraying the rudo role and putting the rookies [...] "in their place". In this case, the [...] "veteran" [...] was Fuerza Guerrera, who felt that the 19-year-old Rey Misterio Jr. had not earned his sport, pushing for his own son, Juventud Guerrera, as the future superstar of Lucha Libre. The Guerreras were also involved in a long-running storyline against the then-reigning Mexican National Tag Team Champions Heavy Metal and Latin Lover over the championship. The Guerreras had aligned themselves with Psicosis, a peer of Juventud Guerrera, who fought Rey Misterio Jr. on several occasions before {{the two of them}} joined AAA. For unexplained reasons, Fuerza Guerrera and Psicosis were not teamed up with Juventud Guerrera for the show but instead were teamed with Gringo Loco member Madonna's Boyfriend for the match against Heavy Metal, Latin Lover, and Rey Misterio Jr.|$|E
