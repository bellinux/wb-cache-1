500|$|The {{specific}} epithet phalloides means phallus-like, and {{refers to}} the similarity of the volva to the genus Phallus.

40|$|Background/PurposeThe {{addition}} of ultra-low-dose naloxone to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine reduces opioid-related side effects. Nalbuphine, a mixed opioid agonist–antagonist, {{may be able}} to attenuate opioid-related side effects. The goal {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of combined low-dose nalbuphine and morphine in PCA for postoperative pain control after gynecological surgery. MethodsThis randomized, double-blind, controlled study enrolled 174 female patients who were undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy, myomectomy, or ovarian tumor excision. In the control group, the PCA formula was 1 mg/mL pure morphine. In the study group, the PCA formula was 1 mg/mL morphine and 10 μg/mL nalbuphine (1 : 100). Numerical rating score, PCA requirement, nausea, vomiting, use of antiemetics, pruritus, use of <b>antipruritics,</b> and opioid-related adverse events were investigated at 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours postoperatively. ResultsOne hundred and sixty-nine patients completed the study: 86 in the control group and 83 in the study group. The incidence of nausea was lower in the study group (41 %) than in the control group (65 %). The incidence of vomiting, use of antiemetics, pruritus, and use of <b>antipruritics</b> did not differ between the two groups. The numerical rating pain score and PCA requirements were not significantly different between the two groups. ConclusionCombination of low-dose nalbuphine and morphine in PCA decreases the incidence of opioid-related nausea, without affecting the analgesia and PCA requirement. This novel combination can improve the quality of PCA used for postoperative pain control after gynecological surgery...|$|R
40|$|The {{prognostic}} value [...] at diagnosis [...] of fever, {{sweating and}} weight loss, which enter the Ann Arbor B category, and of pruritus, whose influence on survival is still debated, were systematically reevaluated in 635 patients with Hodgkin's disease, observed between 1972 and 1982. By means of multivariate analysis an intrinsic, more negative prognostic value was demonstrated {{for each of}} the following symptoms: fever over 38 degrees C, weight loss more than 10 % of body weight in the 6 months before admission, and severe pruritus, which is defined as being generalized, causing multiple excoriations and resisting local and systemic <b>antipruritics.</b> Patients with the mild counterparts of these symptoms, as well as sweats, were found to have a survival rate quite comparable with that of fully asymptomatic patients. A rearrangement of the Ann Arbor B constitutional symptoms which would replace sweats with severe pruritus might be more correct and more suitable for better selecting the patients who require more aggressive therapy...|$|R
40|$|Pityriasis rosea is {{a common}} {{disorder}} of unknown etiology that may simulate {{a number of other}} dermatologic entities. Secondary syphilis should always be ruled out, particularly in ad-olescents. Pruritus occurs more frequently than is generally appreciated. The herald patch may not always be present. Secondary lesions occasionally occur distal to the elbows and knees and on the face. Over the more proximal parts of the body the secondary lesions will characteris-tically align themselves with the long axis following the skin lines of cleavage. The natural course is that of spontaneous resolution within 6 to 8 weeks. Sequelae are rare and usually medically insignificant. Management with oral <b>antipruritics</b> and/or topical steroids may be necessary to relieve the itching.

40|$|Stephanie Vanterpool, Randall Coombs, Karamarie FechoDepartment of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USABackground: This study {{retrospectively}} {{compared the}} continuous epidural infusion of morphine {{with a single}} epidural injection of extended-release morphine for postoperative pain control after arthroplasty. Methods: Medical records were reviewed for subjects who had total knee or hip arthroplasty (THA) under spinal anesthesia and received either a continuous epidural infusion of morphine (Group EPID; n = 101) or an extended-release epidural morphine (Group EREM; n = 109) for postoperative pain. Data were collected for three postoperative days (POD) on: pain scores; supplemental opioids; medications for respiratory depression, nausea, and pruritus, and distance ambulated during physical therapy. Results: Pain scores were similar until subjects were transitioned to another analgesic approach on POD 2; after that time, pain scores increased in Group EPID, although they decreased in Group EREM. Supplemental opioids were used more on POD 1 in Group EREM than in Group EPID, although time to first opioid and total daily morphine equivalents were similar. Naloxone and antiemetics, not <b>antipruritics,</b> were used more in Group EREM. Distance ambulated after THA was greater in Group EREM than in Group EPID. Conclusions: These results suggest that EREM is associated with better postoperative ambulation and analgesia during the transition to oral or intravenous analgesics, although {{a higher incidence of}} side-effects was evident.

40|$|Backround. Deep {{skin burn}} injuries, {{especially}} {{those on the}} face, hands, feet, genitalia and perineum represent significant therapeutic challenges. Autologous dermo-epidermal skin grafts (DESG) have become standard of care for treating deep burns. Additionally, human autologous thrombin activated autologous platelet concentrate (APC) has gained acceptance {{in the setting of}} wounds. While each of these interventions has been independently shown to accelerate healing, the combination of the two has never been evaluated. We hypothesized that the addition of platelets (source of growth factors and inhibitors necessary for tissue repair) to the DESG (source of progenitor cells and of tissue proteases necessary for spatial and temporal control of growth regulators released from platelets) would create the optimal environment for the reciprocal interaction of cells within the healing tissues. Methods: We used clinical examination (digital photography), standardised scales for evaluating pain and scarring, in combination with blood perfusion (laser Doppler imaging), as well as molecular and laboratory analyses. Results: We show {{for the first time that}} the combination of APC and DESG leads to earlier relief of pain, and decreased use of analgesics, <b>antipruritics</b> and orthotic devices. Most importantly, this treatment is associated with earlier discharges from hospital and significant cost savings. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that DESG engraftment is facilitated by the local addition of platelets and by systemic thrombocytosis. This local interaction leads to the physiological revascularization at 1 - 3 months. We observed significant elevation of circulating platelets in early stages of engraftment (1 - 7 days), which normalized over the subsequent 7 and 90 days. Web of Science 158225824...|$|R
