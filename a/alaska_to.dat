50|$|The Sami {{were first}} brought <b>to</b> <b>Alaska</b> in order <b>to</b> teach {{reindeer}} husbandry to the Inuit. The U.S. government encouraged this immigration beginning in 1894 to 1898, so that Alaska Natives would rely on reindeer rather than seal, walrus, and whale hunting. Reindeer are not native <b>to</b> <b>Alaska</b> and had <b>to</b> be imported from Norwegian Finnmark in Lapland / Sapmi / Samiland.|$|R
5|$|The last native {{sea otter}} in Oregon was {{probably}} {{shot and killed}} in 1906. In 1970 and 1971, a total of 95 sea otters were transplanted from Amchitka Island, <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> the Southern Oregon coast. However, this translocation effort failed and otters soon again disappeared from the state.|$|E
5|$|Chlamys hastata, {{the spear}} scallop, spiny scallop or {{swimming}} scallop, is {{a species of}} bivalve mollusc in the family Pectinidae found {{on the west coast}} of North America from the Gulf of <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> San Diego, California. A limited number of these scallops are harvested by divers or by narrow trawls off the west coast of Canada.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, the News-Miner was {{purchased}} by Alaska industrialist Austin E. Lathrop, who operated it under a series of editors until 1950. In that year, the paper {{was purchased}} by Charles Willis Snedden, who proceeded on a course of modernization. Under Snedden's leadership, the News-Miner {{became one of the}} first papers in <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> print in color and survived a fire and the biggest flood in Fairbanks history.|$|E

His request was approved and in the summer of 1952 he was sent to the combat zone.|$|E
5|$|Recommissioned on 15 June 1903 Concord {{operated}} {{along the}} North American coast from <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Panama and to Hawaii and Alaska until decommissioned at Bremerton, Washington, on 25 August 1904. Concord was commissioned again on 16 September 1905 and sailed from Bremerton on 24 December 1905 for {{operations in the}} Philippines. Remaining there until March 1906, Concord sailed to China. Until 1908 she remained in the Far East serving at times on the Yangtze Patrol and as station ship at Shanghai and Canton.|$|E
5|$|A {{widespread}} {{species with}} an almost cosmopolitan distribution, {{it has been reported}} from Africa (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania), Asia (China, Himalayas, Japan, southern India), Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and South America (Brazil). It has been collected from subarctic areas of Greenland, and subalpine regions in Iceland. In North America, where it is considered the most common puffball species, it ranges from <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Mexico, although it is less common in Central America. The species is popular on postage stamps, and has been depicted on stamps from Guinea, Paraguay, Romania, Sierra Leone, and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|After two failed attempts, {{about 60}} common {{starlings}} were released in 1890 into New York's Central Park by Eugene Schieffelin. He {{was president of}} the American Acclimatization Society, which tried to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare into North America. About the same date, the Portland Song Bird Club released 35 pairs of common starlings in Portland, Oregon. These birds became established but disappeared around 1902. Common starlings reappeared in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1940s and these birds were probably descendants of the 1890 Central Park introduction. The original 60 birds have since swelled in number to 150 million, occupying an area extending from southern Canada and <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Central America.|$|E
5|$|Both Neotrypaea californiensis and the {{mud shrimp}} Upogebia pugettensis live in mudflats and sandy {{substrates}} in the intertidal zone of estuaries in western North America. N.californiensis is found from Mutiny Bay, <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Punta Abreojos, Muleg√©, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Its habitat {{is also used}} for the aquaculture of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Since the bioturbation carried out by N.californiensis and U. pugettensis reduces the productivity of the oyster beds, they are considered pests. Their effects may, however, have knock-on effects across the entire ecosystem, and may buffer it from the hazards of nutrient enrichment and increase primary and secondary productivity by {{increasing the amount of}} dissolved inorganic nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Canada {{occupies}} much of {{the continent}} of North America, sharing land borders with the contiguous United States to the south, and the US state of <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> the northwest. Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean. Greenland is to the northeast. By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, {{the difference being due}} to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.|$|E
50|$|Langton's Forester or the Six-spotted Forester (Alypia langtoni) is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It {{is found}} from Newfoundland <b>to</b> <b>Alaska,</b> south <b>to</b> Maine and Wisconsin in the east, {{south in the}} west to Colorado and California.|$|R

5|$|From <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} trout in sea-run, resident stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run {{cutthroat trout}} fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the other}} Endurance {{veterans}} returned to the Antarctic, although Worsley made one voyage to the Arctic in 1925. Of the other crew and staff of Quest, the Australian naturalist Hubert Wilkins became a pioneer aviator in both the Arctic and Antarctic, in 1928 flying from Point Barrow, <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Spitsbergen. He also made several unsuccessful attempts during the 1930s, {{in collaboration with the}} American adventurer Lincoln Ellsworth, to fly to the South Pole. James Marr, the Boy Scout, also became an Antarctic regular after qualifying as a marine biologist, joining several Australian expeditions in the late 1920s and 1930s. Roderick Carr, the frustrated pilot, became an Air Marshal in the Royal Air Force and Deputy Chief of Staff (Air) to SHAEF in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The California {{sea lion}} (Zalophus californianus) is a coastal eared seal native to western North America. It {{is one of}} six species of sea lion. Its natural habitat ranges from {{southeast}} <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> central Mexico, including the Gulf of California. Sea lions are sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have a thicker neck and protruding crest. They mainly haul-out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves. Sea lions feed {{on a number of}} species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by orcas and white sharks.|$|E

5|$|The mallard {{is widely}} {{distributed}} across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres; in North America its range extends from southern and central <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands, across Eurasia, from Iceland and southern Greenland {{and parts of}} Morocco (North Africa) in the west, Scandinavia and Britain to the north, and to Siberia, Japan, and South Korea, in the east, south-eastern and south-western Australia and New Zealand in the Southern hemisphere. It is strongly migratory in the northern parts of its breeding range, and winters farther south. For example, in North America, it winters south to the southern United States and northern Mexico, but also regularly strays into Central America and the Caribbean between September and May.|$|E
5|$|Alaska possessed no {{mental health}} {{treatment}} facilities prior {{to the passage of}} the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{engineer}} to the Military Division of the Pacific, {{he was the}} top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officer on the entire American Pacific Coast. Upon his arrival on the West Coast, he visited locations from <b>Alaska</b> <b>to</b> the Mexican border in order to analyze the work that would be needed. Between 1868 and 1870, he surveyed numerous California harbors and made engineering suggestions as required. One of these suggestions resulted {{in the construction of}} a 7,000-foot breakwater that made Long Beach harbor accessible to large amounts of shipping for the first time. In 1870, he suggested that landowners near Colusa, California, construct levees to contain the Sacramento River within a single channel. The plan would reclaim swampland and control the river's annual floods, making large-scale farming possible. The plan was eagerly seized upon by local residents.|$|E
