40|$|In {{a day of}} such {{widespread}} and extensive alimony decrees, it is abnormal {{that there are not}} more authorities upon the questions raised by an attempt {{on the part of the}} wife 2 ̆ 7 s creditors to garnish future alimony installments. The law is indeed meagre on this subject and such cases as are available seem to be in hopeless conflict. Upon analysis, however, it may be that some guiding principles underlie the apparently paradoxical decisions. Two possible situations, in general, may be presented. First, after a decree for future installments, creditors of the wife may seek to attach the same <b>by</b> <b>garnishment</b> and thus subject the payments to the satisfaction of their claims, whether the installments be payable directly from the husband to the wife, or payable to a trustee, to be paid over to the wife at regular intervals; second, the court issuing the alimony decree, either originally or by supplementary decree, may attempt to prevent assignment or <b>garnishment</b> <b>by</b> a pro-vision against alienation until the money is actually paid over to the wife. These two situations, with the legal problems involved,will be discussed separately...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Insects {{foraging}} on plant surfaces must {{attach to}} the layer of lipophilic materials known as epicuticular waxes (EW) that cover these surfaces. In this paper, we briefly review the evidence that variation in EW morphology can influence the ecology of herbivorous insects directly, <b>by</b> affecting their <b>attachment</b> to plant surfaces, and indirectly <b>by</b> affecting <b>attachment</b> <b>by</b> actively foraging predatory insects to plant surfaces. We then present new data examining how EW micromorphology and chemical composition of Brassica oleracea influence <b>attachment</b> <b>by</b> the predatory beetle, Hippodamia convergens (Coccinellidae). Bio-assays with genotypes of B. oleracea differing in wax characteristics, and with EW extracts from these plants applied to glass, show that wax crystals disrupt attachment. In addition, bioassays show that <b>attachment</b> <b>by</b> H. convergens differs among EW extracts prepared to have smooth surfaces without crystals. The differences in attachment under these conditions are evidently due to the chemical composition of the waxes. Bioassays with two pure wax constituents show that wax composition can significantly affect <b>attachment</b> <b>by</b> H. con-vergens. The study opens the way for using a similar approach to understand <b>attachment</b> <b>by</b> insects to waxy plant surfaces...|$|R

Sperm and both types of gonococci were pre-incubated separately with various chemical agents, selected because the agent is found in genital fluids, or has a known effect on bacterial cell walls or sperm membrane. After treatment, sperm were washed or were not washed, and were then tested for <b>attachment</b> <b>by</b> mixture with untreated gonococci. Treated gonococci were handled in the same manner.

40|$|The Campaign for Objects in Purgatory is a {{creative}} research project that investigates user-product <b>attachment</b> <b>by</b> exploring the emotional conflicts embodied in uncherished gifts.

This paper reviews the Objects in Purgatory ‘live exhibition’ as a qualatitive research method, and as a means of engaging an audience in collective reflection on gift giving and accumulation. It also examines the data collected through the exhibition against research from anthropology, psychology and design. The findings suggest that we can dislike an object and yet still keep and value it. This challenges notions of emotional <b>attachment</b> <b>by</b> suggesting that an emotional bond need not be based on desire.
