5|$|Although the <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> Islamic Homosexualities argued {{this did}} not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.|$|E

5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition.

He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E

5|$|<b>Authors</b> <b>of</b> books {{left the}} country in droves and some wrote {{material}} critical of the regime while in exile.
