40|$|Researchers {{have long}} been {{interested}} in the relationship among the separate fields of psychology and religion. This dissertation seeks to explore {{the differences in the}} way protestant Christians with various religious orientations view mental illness and how these views relate to their attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help. A total of 540 individuals from church congregations representing ten different denominations completed measures of religiosity, <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> mental illness, <b>and</b> attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help. Scores on these measures were analyzed to observe group differences between religious orientations and correlations among the orientations and dependent variables of <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> mental illness <b>and</b> attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help. Analyses revealed significant group differences between extrinsic religiosity and all other religious orientations as it pertained to stereotypical <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> mental illness. Also, results showed a small but significant negative correlation between intrinsic religiosity <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> mental illness, a significant positive correlation between extrinsic religiosity <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> mental illness, <b>and</b> weak but significant negative correlation between intrinsic religiosity and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help. Finally, hierarchical regression analysis showed a weak but significant predictor model with religious orientation <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> mental illness as valid predictors of attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help.

Additionally, some cultures fatalistically attribute their good or poor health to their god(s), and attach less importance to self-care than others.|$|E
25|$|Aboriginally and {{in early}} {{historic}} times the shaman, called as medicine man or medicine woman (Tanacross deshen Upper Tanana dishin) {{was the central}} figure of Athabaskan religious life. The shaman within this culture was the middle man/woman between spirits and the native peoples. Magicoreligious practices included omens, charms, amulets, songs, taboos, <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the supernatural. Beliefs and practices were associated with certain animals, and many centered on hunting. Animal spirits appear to have predominated in Tanana spiritual life, although an evil spirit was manifested in a half-man, half-animal being. Spirits were influential {{in the activities of}} the living and in guiding the dead to their final resting place. Athabaskan shamans guarded people against the effects of bad spirits. The shaman also diagnosed various illnesses and restored the health of those harmed by bad spirits. The shaman could also provide the valuable service of scapulimancy, which predicted the location of game when hunting was scarce. According to cultural anthropologist Richard K. Nelson (who lived for extended periods in Alaskan Athabaskan villages), Athabaskan traditions teach that everything in nature is fundamentally spiritual and must be treated with respect. This includes not only avoiding waste, but also following an elaborate code of morality toward plants, animals, and the earth itself. For example, if an Upper Tanana man kills a wolf, he should never touch it until he formally apologizes and explains that his family needs it.|$|E

500|$|Critic William Sylvester {{states that}} the metaphors in Angelou's poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for {{meanings}} understood by other Blacks. In her poem [...] "Sepia Fashion Show" [...] in Diiie, for example, the last lines ("I'd remind them please, look at those knees / you got a Miss Ann's scrubbing") is a reference to slavery, when Black women had to show their knees to prove how hard they had cleaned. Sylvester states that Angelou uses this technique often in her poetry, and that it elicits {{a change in the}} reader's emotions; in this poem, from humor to anger. Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in [...] "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", also in Diiie, in which the understatement contained in the repeated phrase [...] "nothing happens" [...] is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society. Hagen calls Angelou's coding [...] "signifying" [...] and states, [...] "A knowledge of black linguistic regionalisms and folklore enhances the appreciation of Angelou's poems". Hagen believes that despite the signifying that occurs in many of Angelou's poems, the themes and topics are universal enough that all readers would understand and appreciate them. DeGout states that Angelou conveys meaning through literary imagery, denser vocabulary, and poetic techniques such as catachresis, ambiguity, and anthropomorphism. Angelou's use of language frees her readers from their traditional perceptions <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> human experience. She uses everyday language, the Black vernacular, Black music and forms, and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language, the occasional use of profanity, and traditionally unacceptable subjects. DeGout says that although this use of language is not the main technique she uses in her poetry, it appears in her more popular poems.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout history, {{human organs}} have {{acquired}} different characteristics, acting as both alienable and inalienable possessions {{depending on the}} temporal and spatial context. Alienable possessions are objects that can be bought and sold, while inalienable possessions are things that must be kept due to their relationships with an individual's identity and origins. During the 17th century, human organs were represented as inalienable possessions, that is, objects {{that could not be}} given away in exchange and their use by the medical profession was associated with violent actions. However, once the medical value of bodies was recognized, there was an increase in its commodification which was not legally acknowledged until the Anatomy Act, which prohibited the selling of bodies, was signed in 1832. In reality, consensus over the sale of bodies and body parts had not been reached, and as Locke as argued, [...] "competition over corpses and body parts existed because ideas about their value <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> their alienability varied among contenders". Currently, different representations of organs and other body parts coexist blurring the lines between alienability and inalienability.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Cirigliano and Judi Chervenak {{have stated}} in reviews of {{literature}} on BHRT that large-scale, peer-reviewed studies {{should be used to}} establish the safety, efficacy <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the use of bioidentical hormones. [...] Two 2008 studies conducted in France found that estradiol plus micronized progesterone did not increase the incidence of breast cancer, while a comparison of estradiol plus different types of progestins found a reduced risk of invasive breast cancer with micronized progesterone. Christine Derzko stated that the evidence supported the use of bioidentical estrogen plus progesterone, but since the trial was an observational cohort study rather than a randomized controlled trial that compared different types of hormones head-to-head, more data was required before concluding bioidentical hormones were safer and preferred. [...] Derzko concluded that there was weak (but promising) preliminary evidence that bioidentical hormones may present equal (or possibly lower) risks than conventional HRT; however, there was no data supporting the use of compounding. Derzko recommended following evidence-based medicine and cited concerns over BHRT by numerous medical organizationsrequirements for oversight over compounding, black box warnings for all bioidentical products, and the establishment of a mandatory adverse-events registry.|$|E
