40|$|For over a decade, we {{have heard}} <b>alarming</b> <b>statements</b> about the spread of cyber weapons from senior policymakers and experts. Yet, the {{dynamics}} of cyber proliferation are still understudied and under- theorized. This study offers a theoretical and empirical account of what causes the spread and restraint of cyber weapons and argues {{that the world is}} not at the brink of mass cyber proliferation. Whilst almost forty states are exploring and pursuing the development of cyber weapons, I indicate that only few have so far acquired a meaningful capability. This is due both to supply and demand factors. On the supply-side, most states have a latent capacity to develop relatively simple offensive cyber capabilities, but are unable to develop sophisticated cyber weapons. Moreover, the incentives for knowledge transfer and thus exporting offensive cyber capabilities between states are weak. On the demand-side, I show that national security considerations do not provide the best explanation of variance. Instead, domestic politics and prestige considerations are paramount. Moreover, and unlike nuclear proliferation, I argue {{that it is not the}} possession of cyber weapons but the intention of possession signalled through visible initiatives which matters. Ultimately, I note that cyber weapons can have strategic value â but only under certain conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Research {{and public}} {{attention}} into boys's education {{has increased in}} recent times among an emerging concern about the performance and retention of boys in schools. This concern, in many ways, constitutes a 'moral panic' (Foster, Kimmel and Skelton, 2001, p. 1) sometimes producing generalised and <b>alarming</b> <b>statements</b> such as 'all boys are underachieving in school' and are therefore becoming the new disadvantaged (Foster, et, al., 2001, p. 7). Alongside these populist concerns about boys in schools generally, is an emerging body of contemporary academic studies into early school leaving, (Trent and Slade, 2001; Smyth, Hattam, Cannon, Edwards, Wilson and Wurst, 2000; Smyth and Hattam, 2004) boys' experiences of schooling, (Martino and Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2003), {{as well as some}} broader statistical evidence indicating a general decline in school retention rates in Australia since the early 1990 s (Lamb, 1998). Performance in schools generally, and declining retention rates specifically, has been described as an unacknowledged national crisis (Smyth and Hattam, 2002, p. 375). This study investigates boys' education generally and early school leaving specifically, by focusing on boys who leave school before completing year 10. The study explores the stories, meanings and constructed experiences of a small sample (5) of young boys aged 14 - 16 years, who have left secondary school just prior to being interviewed. This is a qualitative critical ethnographic (L. Harvey, 1990) study located within a constructivist epistemology (Crotty, 1998). It aims to investigate early school leaving through narrative (Cortazzi, 1993; Way, 1997) and ethnographic inspired analysis (Robson, 2002) of transcribed interview data. Such analyses are referenced against a macro socio-political, economic, and cultural context characterised by changing global socio-economic and political circumstances, especially in regard to how these impact on schools and future possibilities for young people (Spierings, 2002). It seeks further understanding by drawing from a framework of concepts that invoke discussion of school culture, identity practices and how these are inferred (Smyth and Hattam, 2004),produced,understood and enacted within schools and social contexts. This study reveals that schools (as cultural and institutional practices) co-construct the often painful, lengthy and contradictory processes and experiences of early school leaving. Early school leaving therefore needs to be seen as an institutional and not merely personal or individual phenomenon. Appreciating the way schools assist in the process of early school leaving is important to understand, as it is within this domain that alternative educational practices can be located, constructed and enacted. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the current public policy debates on boys in schools, and as such be seen as an important contribution to public discourses and policy processes that help shape responses to boys in schools in general, and early school leaving in particular...|$|R

In interviews with Piers Morgan and John Stossel, Cain stated that he was [...] "pro-life from conception", that it was not the government's role to make decisions about abortion, and in the interview with Stossel that [...] "abortion should not be legal". His seemingly contradictory <b>statements</b> <b>alarmed</b> pro-life activists and other social conservatives, who accused Cain of echoing pro-choice reasoning and questioned his dedication to outlawing abortion. Cain sought to address these concerns by emphasizing his commitment to outlawing abortion and to de-funding Planned Parenthood. He argued that some of his comments had been taken out of context and described himself as [...] "100% pro-life. End of story." [...] The Washington Post described Cain's positions on abortion as inconsistent, but noted that his initial position [...] "actually sounds vaguely pro-choice".|$|R

Tsaldaris had no involvement and condemned the criminal attack, but members of his party and close supporters were deemed responsible for the assault. At the same time, three prominent members of the People's Party expressed their support for the monarchy and the exiled George II. Tsaldaris denounced such statements, which caused the outrage of the Liberals. However, these <b>statements</b> <b>alarmed</b> the Venizelist camp, which launched an abortive coup in March 1935.

40|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} conditions and can affect children of any age. Epilepsy is accompanied by many symptoms and similarly to other conditions requires specific treatment and care [...] Children patients have difficulties to accept this fact and it is necessary to support them. This thesis called "Specifics of nursing care for epileptic children" consists of two parts. The theoretical part describes epilepsy, its types, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and regiment. A large part focuses on nursing care for epileptic children. The empirical part of this bachelor thesis has three aims. The first aim was to find out common nursing practices when caring for children epileptic patients. The second aim was to find out the needs of hospitalized epileptic children. The last aim was to create an educative material for nurses working at standard hospital wards. A research question was set for each of these aims: What procedures do nurses use when looking after patients with epilepsy? What are the specifics of nursing when looking after a child hospitalized with epilepsy? What needs do children hospitalized with epilepsy have? The research for the empirical part was carried out using qualitative method of research. Nurses in University Hospital Brno and in the Motol Hospital were interviewed using the method of semi-structured interview to collect data [...] Data such as age, gender, degree of education and length of experience of each nurse were also taken into account [...] If necessary, further questions were asked to clarify the answer. If the nurse agreed, the interview was recorded on Dictaphone. Some interviews were written down word-by-word when the nurse did not agree with recording. The interviews were then typed into Microsoft Word 2007 and data was divided into the following categories: Specifics of hospitalization, Accompanying persons, Specifics of medical examination, Child's needs, Regimen, Specifics of nursing care, Safety, Communication rules. Diagrams were created in draw. io software. The research revealed facts and answers described below. It was revealed that when it comes to hospitalization, the look of the room and the care are very important, and that it is necessary to use a regular daily regimen. Emphasis was laid on children's safety; accommodating the child in a suitable room, preferably near the nurses' room; the furniture should have round edges; beds with side barriers; <b>alarm.</b> The interviewees' <b>statements</b> regarding hospitalization with or without a child's parent differ. Most interviewees replied that this depends on the child's age. It is suitable that a small child is accompanied by a parent during hospitalization, but this is not necessary in case of older children who sometimes do not even require this. The research also revealed that preparing a child for magnetic resonation also differs with age. Older children are only prepared psychologically. Small children are under general anaesthesia and the preparations are more demanding. When identifying the children's needs it was revealed that the most important needs of an epileptic child are independency and socialization. Children feel greatly limited because they cannot take part in evening parties, driving lessons, sports, they cannot do demanding and adrenalin sport activities or sports where they could fall from a height. The research revealed that during an epileptic fit it is important to measure its length, observe what part of the body the fit affects, what is its frequency, if he wets himself, drooling [...] Not all interviewees confirmed that children should be prevented from movement during a fit. An important part of the nursing care is communication, which should have character of communication with a normal healthy child. This thesis can be used to educate and widen the nurses and parents' knowledge about the care for epileptic children. It can be also used as a teaching material for nurse trainees...|$|R
