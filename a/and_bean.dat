5|$|Inocybe maculata has {{thin-walled}} cheilocystidia, {{which are}} clavate (club-shaped), lack encrustation at the apex, and are colourless. The basidia are also clavate, {{and can be}} two-, three- or four-spored, and measure from 15 to 30 micrometres (μm) by 5 to 9μm. The sterigmata (the narrow horns {{on the end of}} the basidia which hold the spores) are 4 to 5μm long. It lacks pleurocystidia. The species leaves a snuff-brown spore print. The spores themselves are smooth <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> shaped; they have a yellow-brown to rusty brown colouration, and measure from 9 to 11μm by 4.5 to 5.5μm. The hyphae can have clamp connections, but can also lack them.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in 1940 or early 1941, Treloar {{requested}} that he be appointed to command the War Records Section, which formed part of the Second Australian Imperial Force's administrative headquarters. The Cabinet agreed to this during February 1941. Treloar's responsibilities in this role were to coordinate and control the collection of material {{to be included in}} the AWM as well as to supervise the official war artists and photographers; these duties were similar to those he <b>and</b> <b>Bean</b> had undertaken during World War I. While Treloar was appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel, he primarily worked for the AWM, which reimbursed the Army for his salary and allowances. This arrangement gave Treloar less influence with the Army than he had enjoyed as head of the AWRS during World War I. General Thomas Blamey, the commander of the AIF, subsequently redesignated the War Records Section the Military History and Information Section (MHIS) on the grounds that its original name had not adequately described the unit's role. In contrast to the DOI's propaganda activities, the MHIS focused on collecting records, images and items that would be useful to historians.|$|E
5|$|Bean was not {{the first}} actor to be chosen to play Sharpe. As Paul McGann was injured while playing {{football}} two days into filming, the producers initially tried to work around his injury, but it proved impossible <b>and</b> <b>Bean</b> replaced him. The series ran continuously from 1993 to 1997, with three episodes produced each year. It was filmed under challenging conditions, first in Ukraine and later in Portugal. After several years of rumours, more episodes were produced: Sharpe's Challenge, which aired in April 2006, and Sharpe's Peril, which aired in autumn 2008 and was later released on DVD. Both of these were released as two cinema-length 90 minute episodes per series. With a role as enigmatic Lord Richard Fenton in the TV miniseries Scarlett, Bean made the transition to Hollywood feature films. His first notable Hollywood appearance was that of an Irish republican terrorist in the 1992 film adaptation of Patriot Games. While filming his death scene, Harrison Ford hit him with a boat hook, giving him a permanent scar. Bean's rough-cut looks made him a patent choice for a villain, and his role in Patriot Games was the first of several villains that he would portray, all of whom die in gruesome ways.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the floods}} in Costa Rica, the country's Red Cross opened shelters to house storm victims. The {{government}} advised residents not to drink {{water out of}} fear it could be polluted from the flooding. A state of emergency was declared on October18 due to the effects in Costa Rica. In Nicaragua, officials deployed about 3,000soldiers to assist in flood operations. The World Food Programme provided about 8tons of food to families in El Salvador affected by the flooding. Then-president of Honduras Manuel Zelaya declared a national state of emergency on October19. In Honduras, pre-positioned supplies from UNICEF quickly diminished due to the widespread distribution of blankets and medical kits, raising fears for the spread of disease. The World Food Programme provided about 58tons of food to 5,500families in Honduras. Residents returned home as floodwaters gradually receded. The Mercy Corps later provided corn <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> seeds to 1,300Honduran farmers to regrow the damaged crops. In May 2009, the World Bank provided $25million (USD) to Honduras to rebuild damaged roads and bridges. Workers in Guatemala airlifted food to storm victims due to residual flooding. The Guatemalan government provided $6.6million to residents in the northern portion of the country, including medical supplies and seeds to regrow crops. A state of emergency was declared for Cayo District in Belize. Search and rescue teams were deployed to the district, and medical crews visited several towns, providing help to 3,000people. The Belize National Emergency Management Organization provided meals to about 9,000people following the floods.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species have}} become so {{numerous}} that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand use by sea lions. Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks. In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam. The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing Pacific Northwest salmon populations. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted {{to ward off the}} sea lions using bombs, rubber bullets <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> bags. Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective. Critics like the Humane Society object to the killing of the sea lions, claiming that hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon. Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be culled, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually {{have a negative effect on}} the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{migration}} of the Zabbaleen, the Wahiya had used the refuse, after drying it, {{as a source of}} energy, specifically as fuel for public baths <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> cookeries. However, this use of dried refuse became obsolete in the 1930s when fuel oil became the preferred fuel for public baths <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> cookeries. This coincided with {{the migration}} of the Zabbaleen, who used the organic components of the wastes to feed their pigs. Thus, the Wahiya began to sell the organic refuse to the Zabbaleen. Because the Zabbaleen needed to obtain waste food before it rots, they preferred to collect the refuse themselves using their own donkey carts.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} the price transmission and market integration of Maize <b>and</b> <b>Beans</b> in the rural and urban markets of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. Average monthly prices (measured in naira per kilogram) of Maize and Cowpea in rural and urban markets {{were used in the}} analysis. The data was obtained from the quarterly publications of the Akwa Ibom State Agricultural Development Programme (AKADEP). The data covered the period; January 2005 to June 2013. The trend analysis showed that, prices of Maize <b>and</b> <b>Beans</b> in the rural and urban markets had exponential growth rates that were less than unity, which suggested a possible co-movement of these prices in the study area. Also, the Pearson correlation coefficient generated for the pair of rural and urban prices of Maize <b>and</b> <b>Beans</b> revealed significant linear symmetric relationships. The result implies the existence of symmetric market information flows between the rural and urban markets for Maize <b>and</b> <b>Beans</b> in the state. The Granger causality test revealed bi-directional relationships between the rural and urban price of Maize <b>and</b> <b>Beans</b> in the study area. The co-integration test revealed the presence of co-integration between the rural and urban prices of Maize <b>and</b> <b>Beans.</b> The coefficients of the price variables in the co-integration equations for Maize <b>and</b> <b>Beans</b> markets converged to unity or law of one price which implied perfect market integration in the long run. The results of the error correction model (ECM) also confirm the existence of the short run market integration between the rural and urban prices of Maize <b>and</b> <b>Beans</b> in the study area. In addition, it was discovered that, the rural price of Maize adjusted faster to the stable state in the long run than the urban price. Likewise, the urban price of Beans adjusted faster than its corresponding rural price. The index of market connection (IMC) supported the high short run market integration for prices of Maize <b>and</b> <b>Beans</b> in rural <b>and</b> urban markets. Based on the findings, it is recommended that, the Akwa Ibom State government should continue to provide marketing infrastructures and reduced externality costs in order to improve further the symmetric nature of information flow among Maize <b>and</b> <b>Beans</b> markets in the state. Also, individuals, trade unions, NGOs’ and government should established market information units and awareness programmes on mass media to facilitate efficient communication flows of <b>Beans</b> <b>and</b> Maize markets in the state...|$|R
