Crane was delighted with his novel's success overseas, writing to a friend: [...] "I have only one pride <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> English edition of The Red Badge of Courage has been [...] with great praise by the English reviewers. I am proud of this simply because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win." [...] Critic, veteran and Member of Parliament George Wyndham called the novel a [...] "masterpiece", applauding Crane's ability to [...] "stage the drama of man, so to speak, within the mind of one man, and then admits you as to a theatre." [...] Harold Frederic wrote in his own review that [...] "If there were in existence any books of a similar character, one could start confidently by saying that it was the best of its kind. But it has no fellows. It is a book outside of all classification. So unlike anything else is it that the temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all". Frederic, who would later befriend Crane when the latter relocated to England in 1897, juxtaposed the novel's treatment of war to those by Leo Tolstoy, √âmile Zola and Victor Hugo, all of whose works he believed to be [...] "positively... cold and ineffectual" [...] when compared to The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E

Let me say {{something}} {{that may not be}} great politics. But I think the secretary is right. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> American people {{are sick and tired of}} hearing about your damn emails!"

2500|$|Layton, {{along with}} Prime Minister Harper and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe, {{initially}} opposed {{the inclusion of}} Green Party leader Elizabeth May in the leaders' televised debates. Layton initially {{said that he was}} following the rules of the broadcast consortium, while NDP spokesman Brad Lavigne confirmed that Layton had refused to attend if May was present, noting that May had endorsed Liberal leader St√©phane Dion for prime minister, and arguing that her inclusion would in effect give the Liberals two representatives at the debate. Rod Love, former chief of staff to Ralph Klein, suggested that the Greens could potentially cut into the NDP's support. Layton's stance drew criticism from the YWCA, Judy Rebick, and members of his own party. Layton dropped his opposition to May's inclusion on September 10, 2008. [...] "This whole issue of debating about the debate has become a distraction to the real debate that needs to happen", Layton said. [...] "I have only one condition for this debate <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prime minister is there." ...|$|E

50|$|Although Dutch {{lawmakers have}} {{historically}} favored being very conservative about creating special legal positions {{for members of}} the royal house or the royal family, there is one area in which the rules {{for members of the}} royal house are very different from those for other Dutch citizens: the area of death and burial.

500|$|On May 14, {{the day of}} the {{scheduled}} vote on Thorne-Begland's appointment, Republican Governor Bob McDonnell stated that the candidate's sexuality should not be an issue: [...] "All I can tell you is what I've always said about judges, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these ought to <b>be</b> merit-based selections solely based on a person's skill, ability, fairness, judicial temperament".

2500|$|In an August 27, 2006, {{appearance}} on Meet the Press, Novak {{was asked if}} indeed Armitage was his source of Mrs. Wilson's identity as a CIA operative.

This view also opens the possibility of joining the research tradition of traits with studies that have focused on the behaviour/roles of the entrepreneur/top-manager (for instance Choran 1969 in Mintzberg 1973, Noel 1989, O‚ÄôGorman 2001, Flor√©n and Tell 2004).|$|R
