5|$|Examples of biologically {{important}} {{fatty acids}} include the eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid {{is also important}} in biological systems, {{particularly with respect to}} sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter <b>anandamide.</b>|$|E
25|$|THC and its {{endogenous}} equivalent <b>anandamide</b> additionally {{interact with}} glycine receptors.|$|E
25|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome can be induced by overfeeding with sugar or fructose, particularly concomitantly with high-fat diet. The resulting oversupply of omega-6 fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid (AA), {{is an important}} factor in the pathogenesis of {{metabolic syndrome}}. Arachidonic acid (with its precursor - linoleic acid) serve as a substrate to the production of inflammatory mediators known as eicosanoids, whereas the arachidonic acid-containing compound diacylglycerol (DAG) is a precursor to the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) while fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) mediates the metabolism of arachidonic acid into <b>anandamide.</b> <b>Anandamide</b> can also be produced from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine via several pathways. <b>Anandamide</b> and 2-AG can also be hydrolized into arachidonic acid, potentially leading to increased eicosanoid synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Cocoa solids are {{a source}} of {{flavonoids}} and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine and caffeine. Chocolate also contains <b>anandamide.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are two well-characterized endocannabinoids {{located in}} the brain and periphery. The first {{identified}} was <b>anandamide</b> (arachidonoyl ethanolamide) and the second was 2-AG (2-arachidonoyl glycerol). Additional endocannabinoids include virodhamine (O-arachidonoyl ethanolamine), noladin ether (2-arachidonoyl glyceryl ether) and NADA (N-arachidonoyl dopamine).|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>anandamide,</b> {{formation}} of 2-AG is calcium-dependent and is {{mediated by the}} activities of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). 2-AG acts as a full agonist at the CB1 receptor. At a concentration of 0.3nM, 2-AG induces a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free calcium in NG108-15 neuroblastoma X glioma cells through a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism. 2-AG is hydrolyzed in vitro by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the uncharacterized serine hydrolase enzymes ABHD6 and ABHD12. The exact contribution {{of each of these}} enzymes to the termination of 2-AG signaling in vivo is unknown, though it is estimated that MAGL is responsible for ~85% of this activity in the brain. There have been identified transport proteins for 2-arachidonoylglycerol and <b>anandamide.</b> These include the heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs).|$|E
25|$|When THC {{enters the}} blood stream and reaches the brain, it binds to {{cannabinoid}} receptors. The endogenous ligand of these receptors is <b>anandamide,</b> {{the effects of}} which THC emulates. This agonism of the cannabinoid receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and norepinephrine; neurotransmitters which are {{closely associated with the}} acute effects of cannabis ingestion, such as euphoria and anxiety.|$|E
25|$|The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a {{biological}} system composed of endocannabinoids, which are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors, and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the mammalian {{central nervous system}} (including the brain) and peripheral nervous system. The endocannabinoid system is involved in regulating a variety of physiological and cognitive processes including fertility, pregnancy, during pre- and postnatal development, appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the pharmacological effects of cannabis. The ECS is also involved in mediating some of the physiological and cognitive effects of voluntary physical exercise in humans and other animals, such as contributing to exercise-induced euphoria as well as modulating locomotor activity and motivational salience for rewards. In humans, the plasma concentration of certain endocannabinoids (i.e., <b>anandamide)</b> {{have been found to}} rise during physical activity; since endocannabinoids can effectively penetrate the blood–brain barrier, {{it has been suggested that}} <b>anandamide,</b> along with other euphoriant neurochemicals, contributes to the development of exercise-induced euphoria in humans, a state colloquially referred to as a runner's high.|$|E
25|$|Two primary endocannabinoid receptors {{have been}} identified: CB1, first cloned in 1990; and CB2, cloned in 1993. CB1 receptors are found {{predominantly}} {{in the brain}} and nervous system, as well as in peripheral organs and tissues, and are the main molecular target of the endocannabinoid ligand (binding molecule), <b>Anandamide,</b> as well as its mimetic phytocannabinoid, THC. One other main endocannabinoid is 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) which is active at both cannabinoid receptors, along with its own mimetic phytocannabinoid, CBD. 2-AG and CBD are involved in the regulation of appetite, immune system functions and pain management.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these specialized cannabinoid {{receptors in the brain}} led researchers to the discovery of endocannabinoids, such as <b>anandamide</b> and 2-arachidonoyl glyceride (2-AG). THC targets receptors in a manner far less selective than endocannabinoid molecules released during retrograde signaling, as the drug has a relatively low cannabinoid receptor efficacy and affinity. In populations of low cannabinoid receptor density, THC may act to antagonize endogenous agonists that possess greater receptor efficacy. THC is a lipophilic molecule and may bind non-specifically to a variety of entities in the brain and body, such as adipose tissue (fat).|$|E
25|$|Shimon Ben-Shabat, of Ben-Gurion University, {{discovered}} the chemical. 2-AG was a known chemical compound but its occurrence in mammals and its {{affinity for the}} cannabinoid receptors were first described in 1994-1995. A research group at Teikyo University reported the affinity of 2-AG for the cannabinoid receptors in 1994-1995, but the isolation of 2-AG in the canine gut was first reported in 1995 by the research group of Raphael Mechoulam at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which additionally characterized its pharmacological properties in vivo. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol, next with <b>Anandamide,</b> was the second endocannabinoid discovered. The cannabinoid established {{the existence of a}} cannabinoid neuromodulatory system in the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Insulin {{is a major}} {{regulator}} of endocannabinoid (EC) {{metabolism and}} insulin treatment {{has been shown to}} reduce intracellular ECs, the 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and <b>anandamide</b> (AEA), which correspond with insulin-sensitive expression changes in enzymes of EC metabolism. In insulin-resistant adipocytes, patterns of insulin-induced enzyme expression is disturbed {{in a manner consistent with}} elevated EC synthesis and reduced EC degradation. Findings suggest that insulin-resistant adipocytes fail to regulate EC metabolism and decrease intracellular EC levels in response to insulin stimulation, whereby obese insulin-resistant individuals exhibit increased concentrations of ECs. This dysregulation contributes to excessive visceral fat accumulation and reduced adiponectin release from abdominal adipose tissue, and further to the onset of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
25|$|For centuries hashish and {{marijuana}} from the Indian hemp Cannabis sativa L. {{have been used}} for medicinal and recreational purposes. In 1840, Schlesinger S. was apparently the first investigator to obtain an active extract from the leaves and flowers of hemp. A few years later, in 1848, Decourtive E. described the preparation of an ethanol extract that on evaporation of the solvent gave a dark resin, which he named “cannabin”. In 1964 the main active constituent of C. sativa L., Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was isolated and synthesized by Mechoulam's laboratory. Two types of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, responsible for the effects of THC were discovered and cloned in the early 1990s. Once cannabinoid receptors had been discovered, it became important to establish whether their agonists occur naturally in the body. This search led to the discovery of the first endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid), <b>anandamide</b> (arachidonoyl ethanolamide). Later on other endocannabinoids were found, for example 2-AG (2-arachidonoyl glycerol). These findings raised further questions about the pharmacological and physiological role of the cannabinoid system. This revived the research on cannabinoid receptor antagonists which were expected to help answer these questions. The use of the cannabinoid agonist, THC, in its many preparations to enhance appetite is a well known fact. This fact led to the logical extension that blocking of the cannabinoid receptors might be useful in decreasing appetite and food intake. It was then discovered that the blockage of the CB1 receptor represented a new pharmacological target. The first specific CB1 receptor antagonist / inverse agonist was rimonabant, discovered in 1994.|$|E

2500|$|As for the anecdotes about exercise, {{they likely}} {{experienced}} a [...] "runner's high" [...] {{due to their}} bodies releasing endorphins, which are endogenous opioid agonists, along with <b>anandamide</b> and other endogenous cannabinoid agonists. These flashbacks have also been reported after one has stretched or stood up/sat or laid down abruptly. [...] In addition, some studies find that the body produces endocannabinoids such as <b>anandamide</b> during exercise, which may also explain such effects since they activate the same receptors as THC.|$|E
2500|$|The {{endogenous}} arachidonate-based lipids, <b>anandamide</b> (N-arachidonoylethanolamide, AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG); {{these are}} known as [...] "endocannabinoids" [...] and are physiological ligands for the cannabinoid receptors. Endocannabinoids are all eicosanoids.|$|E
2500|$|... 2-AG, unlike <b>anandamide</b> (another endocannabinoid), {{is present}} at {{relatively}} high {{levels in the}} central nervous system; {{it is the most}} abundant molecular species of monoacylglycerol found in mouse and rat brain (~5-10 nmol/g tissue). Detection of 2-AG in brain tissue is complicated by the relative ease of its isomerization to 1-AG during standard lipid extraction conditions. It has been found in maternal bovine as well as human milk.|$|E
2500|$|Milk {{chocolate}} is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain {{a minimum of}} 20% total dry cocoa solids; {{in the rest of}} the European Union, the minimum is 25%. [...] "White chocolate" [...] contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, such as dogs and cats. Chocolate contains [...] "brain cannabinoids" [...] such as <b>anandamide,</b> N-oleoylethanolamine and N-linoleoylethanolamine. Dark chocolate has been promoted for unproven health benefits.|$|E
2500|$|While {{working with}} the cerebellum, Kreitzer's group also {{discovered}} that depolarization of Purkinje cells could also cause a temporary reduction in excitatory input into these cells from both climbing fibres and parallel fibres (Kreitzer et al. 2001b). [...] This phenomenon was termed depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), and differs from DSI only {{by the kind of}} neurotransmitter whose release is reduced. [...] In the case of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, the result is a reduction in inhibitory GABA release, while in DSE the effect is a reduction in excitatory glutamate release. [...] DSE was also found to occur in other regions of the brain, however the evidence for the involvement of the endocannabinoid receptor CB1 in this process is not as solid as it is for DSI. [...] Both depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and DSE have been studied in the CB1 knock-out mice. [...] Some groups show that both depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and DSE are lacking in these mice, while others have shown that DSE, but not depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, can still be evoked in the knock-outs (Ohno-Shosaku et al. 2002, Hajos et al. 2001). [...] The endocannabinoids may still mediate DSE too, but by acting at a yet unknown cannabinoid receptor. [...] Interestingly, some work has shown that <b>anandamide</b> can bind to the vannilloid receptor VR1, the receptor responsible for mediating the effects of capsaicin. [...] This receptor is present in the brain, and <b>anandamide</b> actions at this receptor may potentially contribute to DSE (Cristino et al. 2006, Hajos et al. 2002). [...] However DSE is currently a largely unexplored phenomenon and {{more research is needed to}} draw any firm conclusions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} that depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition is mediated by endocannabinoids finally explained why both the CB1 receptor and the endocannabinoids are both so widely {{distributed in the}} brain. Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition is a very common form of short-term plasticity and thus needs to be mediated by a commonly found neurotransmitter. [...] The use of endocannabinoids such as <b>anandamide</b> and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol in this method of signalling is quite logical, since both molecules can be synthesized relatively easily from lipids in the plasma membrane, a fundamental constituent of all cells. Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition is therefore the primary cortical process mediated by the endocannabinoids, and may contribute to many forms of cortical plasticity and synaptic strengthening, such as in long-term potentiation (Carlson et al. 2002).|$|E
2500|$|Amongst analgesics {{there are}} {{a small number of}} agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid {{receptor}} system and therefore have none of the other (narcotic) qualities of opioids although they may produce euphoria by relieving pain—a euphoria that, because of the way it is produced, does not form the basis of habituation, physical dependence, or addiction. [...] Foremost amongst these are nefopam, orphenadrine, and perhaps phenyltoloxamine or some other antihistamines. [...] Tricyclic antidepressants have painkilling effect as well, but they're thought to do so by indirectly activating the endogenous opioid system. Paracetamol is predominantly a centrally acting analgesic (non-narcotic) which mediates its effect by action on descending serotoninergic (5-hydroxy triptaminergic) pathways, to increase 5-HT release (which inhibits release of pain mediators). It also decreases cyclo-oxygenase activity. It has recently been discovered that most or all of the therapeutic efficacy of paracetamol is due to a metabolite, AM404, which enhances the release of serotonin and inhibits the uptake of <b>anandamide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anandamide</b> is an {{endogenous}} cannabinoid neurotransmitter {{that binds}} to cannabinoid receptors. It {{has been shown}} that aerobic exercise causes an increase in plasma <b>anandamide</b> levels, where the magnitude of this increase is highest at moderate exercise intensity (i.e., exercising at ~70-80% maximum heart rate). Increases in plasma <b>anandamide</b> levels are associated with psychoactive effects because <b>anandamide</b> is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and act within the central nervous system. Thus, because <b>anandamide</b> is a euphoriant and aerobic exercise is associated with euphoric effects, it has been proposed that <b>anandamide</b> partly mediates the short-term mood-lifting effects of exercise (e.g., the euphoria of a runner's high) via exercise-induced increases in its synthesis.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} that {{truffles}} contain the endocannabinoid <b>anandamide</b> (AEA) {{and the major}} metabolic enzymes of the endocannabinoid system ECS, and the <b>anandamide</b> content increases in the late stages of truffles’ development. It is suggested, that <b>anandamide</b> and ECS metabolic enzymes have evolved earlier than endocannabinoid-binding receptors, and that <b>anandamide</b> might be an ancient attractant to truffle eaters, that are well-equipped with endocannabinoid-binding receptors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anandamide</b> was {{the first}} such {{compound}} identified as arachidonoyl ethanolamine. The name {{is derived from the}} Sanskrit word for bliss and -amide. It has a pharmacology similar to THC, although its structure is quite different. <b>Anandamide</b> binds to the central (CB1) and, to a lesser extent, peripheral (CB2) cannabinoid receptors, where it acts as a partial agonist. <b>Anandamide</b> is about as potent as THC at the CB1 receptor. <b>Anandamide</b> is found in nearly all tissues {{in a wide range of}} animals. <b>Anandamide</b> has also been found in plants, including small amounts in chocolate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anandamide</b> {{is found}} in {{chocolate}} together with two substances that might mimic the effects of <b>anandamide,</b> N-oleoylethanolamine and N-linoleoylethanolamine.|$|E
50|$|The {{developing}} embryo expresses cannabinoid receptors {{early in}} development that are responsive to <b>anandamide</b> secreted in the uterus. This signaling {{is important in}} regulating the timing of embryonic implantation and uterine receptivity. In mice, {{it has been shown}} that <b>anandamide</b> modulates the probability of implantation to the uterine wall. For example, in humans, the likelihood of miscarriage increases if uterine <b>anandamide</b> levels are too high or low. These results suggest that intake of exogenous cannabinoids (e.g. marijuana) can decrease the likelihood for pregnancy for women with high <b>anandamide</b> levels, and alternatively, it can increase the likelihood for pregnancy in women whose <b>anandamide</b> levels were too low.|$|E
50|$|OEA is the {{monounsaturated}} analogue of the endocannabinoid <b>anandamide,</b> {{but unlike}} <b>anandamide</b> it acts {{independently of the}} cannabinoid pathway, regulating PPAR-α activity to stimulate lipolysis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anandamide</b> is also {{important}} for implantation of the early stage embryo in its blastocyst form into the uterus. Therefore, cannabinoids such as Δ9-THC might influence processes during the earliest stages of human pregnancy. Peak plasma <b>anandamide</b> occurs at ovulation and positively correlates with peak estradiol and gonadotrophin levels, suggesting that these {{may be involved in}} the regulation of AEA (<b>anandamide)</b> levels. Subsequently, <b>anandamide</b> has been proposed as a biomarker of infertility, but so far lacks any predictive values in order to be used clinically.|$|E
50|$|Endogenous <b>anandamide</b> {{is present}} {{at very low}} levels and has a very short {{half-life}} due to {{the action of the}} enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which breaks it down into free arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. Studies of piglets show that dietary levels of arachidonic acid and other essential fatty acids affect the levels of <b>anandamide</b> and other endocannabinoids in the brain. High fat diet feeding in mice increases levels of <b>anandamide</b> in the liver and increases lipogenesis. This suggests that <b>anandamide</b> {{may play a role in}} the development of obesity, at least in rodents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anandamide</b> {{has been}} shown to impair working memory in rats. Studies are under way to explore what role <b>anandamide</b> plays in human behavior, such as eating and sleep patterns, and pain relief.|$|E
50|$|FAAH {{knockout}} mice display highly elevated (>15-fold) {{levels of}} N-acylethanolamines and N-acyltaurines in various tissues. Because of their significantly elevated <b>anandamide</b> levels, FAAH KOs have an analgesic phenotype, showing reduced pain sensation {{in the hot}} plate test, the formalin test, and the tail flick test. Finally, because of their impaired ability to degrade <b>anandamide,</b> FAAH KOs also display supersensitivity to exogenous <b>anandamide,</b> a cannabinoid receptor (CB) agonist.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anandamide</b> {{plays a role}} in the {{regulation}} of feeding behavior, and the neural generation of motivation and pleasure. In addition, <b>anandamide</b> injected directly into the forebrain reward-related brain structure nucleus accumbens enhances the pleasurable responses of rats to a rewarding sucrose taste, and enhances food intake as well. Moreover, the acute beneficial effects of exercise (termed as runner's high) seem to be mediated by <b>anandamide</b> in mice.|$|E
5000|$|URB597 (KDS-4103) is a {{relatively}} selective inhibitor of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). [...] FAAH is the primary degradatory enzyme for the endocannabinoid <b>anandamide</b> and, as such, inhibition of FAAH leads to an accumulation of <b>anandamide</b> in the CNS and periphery where it activates cannabinoid receptors. URB597 {{has been found to}} elevate <b>anandamide</b> levels and have activity against neuropathic pain in a mouse model.|$|E
5000|$|Fatty {{acid amide}} {{hydrolase}} or FAAH ( [...] , oleamide hydrolase, <b>anandamide</b> amidohydrolase) {{is a member}} of the serine hydrolase family of enzymes. It was first shown to break down <b>anandamide</b> in 1993. In humans, it is encoded by the gene FAAH.|$|E
50|$|AM404 was {{originally}} {{reported to be}} an endogenous cannabinoid reuptake inhibitor, preventing the transport of <b>anandamide</b> and other related compounds back from the synaptic cleft, much {{in the same way}} that common selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants prevent the reuptake of serotonin. Earlier work on the mechanism of AM404 suggested that the inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) by AM404 was responsible for all of its attributed reuptake properties, since intracellular FAAH hydrolysis of <b>anandamide</b> changes the intra/extracellular <b>anandamide</b> equilibrium. However, this is not the case, as newer research on FAAH knockout mice has found that brain cells internalize <b>anandamide</b> through a selective transport mechanism which is independent of FAAH activity. This mechanism is inhibited by AM404.|$|E
