5|$|Consultants who {{prepared}} the Environmental Impact <b>Assessment</b> <b>report</b> in 2001 for the Central reclamation noted the pier's {{significant role in}} Hong Kong's transport history. The Government was warned that a public backlash could be expected when the full implications of the reclamation were known.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} reason for this ambition is growing international concern about human-induced climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's proposal that carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by 60% was incorporated into the UK government's 2003 Energy White Paper. The 2006 Stern Review proposed a 55% reduction by 2030. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth <b>Assessment</b> <b>Report</b> has further increased {{the profile of the}} issue.|$|E
50|$|<b>Assessment</b> <b>reports</b> are {{the record}} of geological, geochemical, {{geophysical}} and other exploration work completed on mineral claims (exploration permits). <b>Assessment</b> <b>reports</b> are useful to subsequent property holders because they provide {{information that can be}} used to advance the prospect, rather than duplicating work already done by a previous mineral rights holder. Due to regulations, <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> remain confidential for one year after submission. AGS has 675 <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> on file, dating from 1949 to 2002. All non-confidential reports are available for viewing.|$|R
40|$|Openness and {{transparency}} are important considerations for medicines regulators, where public health is of paramount concern. As {{part of their}} commitment to transparency, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia publish information relating to their evaluation of medicines via public <b>assessment</b> <b>reports.</b> European Public <b>Assessment</b> <b>Reports</b> (EPARs) and Australian Public <b>Assessment</b> <b>Reports</b> (AusPARs) provide information about the considerations that led the regulator to approve or refuse the application. The <b>reports</b> summarise <b>assessments</b> by each regulator of the information provided on the quality, safety, and efficacy of the medicine under evaluation. Here, we describe the experiences of two established medicines regulators in publishing public <b>assessment</b> <b>reports,</b> and reflect on their future role in communicating medicines information...|$|R

30|$|We {{used the}} {{assessment}} results {{of national and}} international structural vulnerability assessment initiatives in Bangladesh RMG industry, which have been discussed in Sect.  2 of this article. Two datasets were collected: individual vertical load vulnerability <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> of all the 3746 factory buildings assessed by DIFE (2016) and individual earthquake load vulnerability <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> of all the 478 factory buildings assessed by BUET. Thus, individual <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> {{of each of these}} buildings were collected. After collection of individual reports, we prepared two compiled datasets separately for vertical load vulnerability and earthquake load vulnerability based on factors selected for this research, which are discussed in the following section.|$|R

40|$|Psychological {{methods of}} {{assessing}} intelligence have been criticised {{because of their}} limited diagnostic-remedial nature and especially their lack of potential for initiating effective and pragmatic intervention programmes. Similarly, the means through which the results of such methods are communicated {{in order to make}} them useful and constructive can be debated. In this research we aimed to establish the value of psycho-educational <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> in terms of the understanding and interpretation of the reports by the irrecipients, specifically remedial teachers, who participated in focus group discussions and offered their opinion on the utility of psycho-educational <b>assessment</b> <b>reports.</b> The outcomes of these focus group discussions pointed to the fact that psycho-educational <b>assessment</b> <b>reports</b> were problematic {{in the sense that they}} failed to provide useful, specific, and pragmatic information for learning support programmes to be developed from. The research revealed insights which may be of interest to psychologists writing <b>assessment</b> <b>reports.</b> Suggestions for multi-disciplinary collaboration are addressed.
