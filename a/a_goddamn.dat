500|$|In January 1942, Balmer briefly {{took charge}} of No.7 Squadron, flying Hudsons on {{maritime}} patrol and convoy escort duties from RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. Two months later he assumed command of the first RAAF unit to operate Australian-built Bristol Beauforts, No.100 Squadron. It was formed at Richmond using the number of a Royal Air Force (RAF) squadron that had been decimated in the Malayan Campaign. In tribute to its original incarnation, Balmer adopted the RAF unit's crest, which featured a skull-and-crossbones emblem and the motto Sarang Tebuan Jangan Dijolok (Malay for [...] "Do not stir up a hornet's nest"). No.100 Squadron transferred to Mareeba in Far North Queensland on 22May, after Balmer decided that a proposed base at Cairns was unsuitable owing to periodic flooding. While his crews at Mareeba gained experience on maritime patrols, he travelled to Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 26May to test the Beaufort in operational conditions; as he came in to land he was fired upon by US anti-aircraft batteries, whose gunners had [...] "never seen <b>a</b> <b>Goddamn</b> aircraft like that before", but escaped damage.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by {{this early}} success, Kubrick {{quit his job}} at Look and visited {{professional}} filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about {{the technical aspects of}} film-making. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker {{because of the number of}} bad films he had seen, remarking, [...] "I don't know <b>a</b> <b>goddamn</b> thing about movies, but I know I can make a better film than that". He began making Flying Padre (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called [...] "Sky Pilot", a pun on the slang term for a priest. [...] During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in Flying Padre are later echoed in [...] (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin (1925) and Ivan the Terrible (1944/1958).|$|E

The song explores the concept of nursery rhymes. Davis relates: [...] "'Shoots and Ladders' uncovers the hidden messages in nursery rhymes, the first songs many of us ever hear. 'Shoots and Ladders', to set the record straight, calls out nursery rhymes for what they really are. I choose each rhyme for a different reason—'Baa Baa Black Sheep' has racist overtones. 'London Bridge' talks of all the people of London dying (from the Black Plague, as does 'Ring Around the Roses').

When asked why, he allegedly replied, [...] "I have no problem being a loyal American, that's all the resolution asks. We just don't agree on the Truman foreign policy.

In May 1947, CIO leaders met to discuss the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers, where locals representing thousands of members had recently disaffiliated due to the communist politics of the international union's leadership. CIO President Philip Murray proposed that the CIO run the international union for a time, but Gold and seven other communists voted against Murray's proposal. An outraged Murray declared, [...] "Any man who goes into a shop ostensibly as the representative of the workers and then devotes his time to furthering the interest of the Communist Party is <b>a</b> <b>goddamn</b> traitor.

With Hepburn's {{influence over the}} CBS network, Reeve worked out the schedules of Love of Life and the play {{so that he would}} be able to do both. Because of his busy schedule, he ate candy bars and drank coffee in place of meals, and suffered from exhaustion and malnutrition. On the first night of the play's run, Reeve entered the stage, said his first line, and then promptly fainted. Hepburn turned to the audience and said, [...] "This boy's <b>a</b> <b>goddamn</b> fool. He doesn't eat enough red meat." [...] The understudy finished the play for him, and Reeve was treated by a doctor who advised him to eat a more healthy diet. He stayed with the play throughout its year-long run and was given very favorable reviews. He and Hepburn became very close. She said, [...] "You're going to be a big star, Christopher, and support me in my old age." [...] He replied, [...] "I can't wait that long." [...] A romance between the two was rumored in some gossip columns. Reeve said, [...] "She was sixty-seven and I was twenty-two, but I thought that was quite an honor...I believe I was fairly close to what a child or grandchild might have been to her." [...] Reeve said that his father, who was a professor of literature and came to many of the performances, was the man who most captivated Hepburn. When the play moved to Los Angeles in 1976, Reeve— to Hepburn's disappointment— dropped out. They stayed in touch for years after the play's run. Reeve later regretted not staying closer instead of just sending messages back and forth.|$|E
