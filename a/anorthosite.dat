The granite here is <b>anorthosite,</b> and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon. There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic sandstone at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Isles and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary basalt and basalt and gabbros respectively. The sandstone at Broad Bay was once thought to be Torridonian or Old Red Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{rocks of}} Scotland are the Lewisian gneisses, which were {{formed in the}} Precambrian period, up to 3,000 Ma (million years ago). They are among the oldest rocks in both Europe and the World. They form the {{basement}} {{to the west of}} the Moine Thrust on the mainland, in the Outer Hebrides and on the islands of Coll and Tiree. These rocks are largely igneous in origin, mixed with metamorphosed marble, quartzite and mica schist and intruded by later basaltic dykes and granite magma. One of these intrusions forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roineabhal in Harris. The granite here is <b>anorthosite,</b> and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{collected}} from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques. They {{range in age from}} about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust. As such, they represent samples from a very early period {{in the development of the}} Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This <b>anorthosite</b> rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean).|$|E
50|$|Some {{research}} has focused on neodymium (Nd) and strontium (Sr) isotopic determinations for <b>anorthosites,</b> particularly for <b>anorthosites</b> of the Nain Plutonic Suite (NPS).

40|$|The {{most popular}} model of early lunar {{differentiation}} {{is that of}} a globe-encircling magma ocean tens, if not hundreds, of kilometers deep which produced a floating anorthositic crust and a complementary plagioclase-depleted interior during solidification. Shirley (1983) attempted to show a process by which some of the oldest rocks, lunar ferroan <b>anorthosites</b> (LFA), might have formed from a partially molten 'magma ocean'. The present investigation is concerned with a process by which ferroan <b>anorthosites</b> might have formed without a magma ocean. Attention is given to the magma ocean hypothesis, a hypothesis proposed by Wetherill (1975) regarding a petrogenesis without a magma ocean, two-stage lunar <b>anorthosites,</b> and terrestrial <b>anorthosites...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} uses {{plagioclase}} compositions and partition coefficients for several elements to estimate melts from which lunar <b>anorthosites</b> formed and the partition liquids from which these melts were derived. The Fe and Mg {{contents of the}} plagioclases are examined for their potential use as predictors of Fe and Mg in associated melts. Usable trace elements are employed with selected partition coefficients to predict the equilibrium melts for lunar <b>anorthosites,</b> and melts for <b>anorthosites</b> are used in various models to calculate {{the composition of the}} initial melt from which the lunar mantle and eventually the <b>anorthosites</b> evolved. The initial melts are compared with bulk moon compositions to evaluate the nature of the melting that could have produced the <b>anorthosites.</b> All the models indicate that extensive melting of all or nearly all of the lunar mantle is required to produce a lunar crust that constitutes 13 - 15 percent of the moon's volume...|$|R
25|$|The {{bedrock of}} Harris is largely Lewisian gneisses, which were {{laid down in}} the Precambrian period, {{interspersed}} with igneous intrusions.

25|$|The primary {{mechanism}} for forming cumulate layers is, of course, {{the accumulation of}} layers of mineral crystals on the floor or roof of the intrusion. Rarely, plagioclase is found in cumulate layers {{at the top of}} intrusions, having floated {{to the top of a}} much denser magma. Here it can form <b>anorthosite</b> layers.|$|E
25|$|The maria are {{composed}} predominantly of basalt, whereas the highland regions are iron-poor and composed primarily of <b>anorthosite,</b> a rock composed primarily of calcium-rich plagioclase feldspar.

In reality, however, Dwan and his associates were not selling what they thought; they were really selling the worthless mineral <b>anorthosite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many Proterozoic <b>anorthosites</b> {{occur in}} spatial {{association}} with other highly distinctive, contemporaneous rock types (the so-called 'anorthosite suite' or 'anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite complex'). These rock types include iron-rich diorite, gabbro, and norite; leucocratic mafic rocks such as leucotroctolite and leuconorite; and iron-rich felsic rocks, including monzonite and rapakivi granite. Importantly, {{large volumes of}} ultramafic rocks are not found in association with Proterozoic <b>anorthosites.</b>|$|R
40|$|There is a {{suite of}} rocks {{typically}} associated with Proterozoic massif <b>anorthosites</b> that bear some interesting similarities to lunar KREEP. In many cases these rocks are plutonic and have traditionally {{been referred to as}} the jotunite-mangerite-+/-charnockite-+/-syenite suite. However, in the Rogaland district of southwestern Norway, where they are referred to as 'monzonorites', these rocks are also present as fine-grained dikes and as the chill margin of a layered intrusion, and thus approximate magmatic liquid compositions are readily obtained by chemical analysis. Monzonorites are typically enriched in incompatible lithophile elements such as K (alkali feldspar is present), the rare earths (REE), and P. They have intermediate to low Mg', low-Ca pyroxene, and more evolved types have low Ti/Sm ratios. Much debate has developed over attempts to explain the link between monzonorites and massif <b>anorthosites.</b> One feature seems clear: monzonorites and associated <b>anorthosites</b> have different initial isotopic ratios, so a simple relation is not possible. However, there is apparently a continuum in major elements between the monzonorites and gabbros believed to represent magmas parental to the <b>anorthosites.</b> This continuum suggests a link via high pressure fractionation coupled with assimilation. Although more complicated, this scenario is similar to that evoked for the early Moon: following the formation of ferroan <b>anorthosites,</b> continued fractional crystallization of the residual liquids {{at the base of the}} crust led to the formation of KREEP. An attempt is made here to establish a link between monzonorites and high-Al gabbros which are nearly always found as ancillary intrusions associated with <b>anorthosites,</b> and which may record processes in lower crustal magma chambers...|$|R

The founders discovered that the stones had traveled across the Atlantic Ocean packed near olive oil, and the oil had penetrated the stones. Unable to take the loss of selling expensive inventory, they roasted the stones over fire to remove the olive oil; {{this was the first}} instance of research and development at 3M.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} age of intercrater plains {{material has}} a bearing on its origin. If very old, intercrater plains material may consist of <b>anorthosite</b> {{derived from a}} magma ocean such as may have existed on the Moon (Wood and others, 1970). If emplaced during later stages of mercurian evolution, it may consist of basin ejecta or lava flows. However, planetwide, the morphologic evidence for an impact origin rather than a volcanic one is not compelling. Whether or not either hypothesis is eventually substantiated, the emplacement of intercrater plains material likely began during {{an early stage of}} intense accretionary bombardment (Guest and O’Donnell, 1977) and lasted until the time of formation of intermediate plains material.|$|E
25|$|The QAPF diagram {{has four}} {{minerals}} or mineral groups chosen as important cornerstones of the classification. These are quartz (Q), Alkali feldspars (A), plagioclase feldspars (P), and feldspathoids (F). F and Q for chemical reasons {{can not exist}} together in one plutonic rock. Other minerals may and almost certainly occur in these rocks as well {{but they have no}} significance in this classification scheme. So, the whole diagram is actually composed of two ternary plots (QAP and FAP). To use the classification, the concentration (the mode) of these minerals must be known and recalculated to make their sum 100%. For example: a plutonic rock that contains no alkali feldspar and no feldspathoids but contains lots of pyroxenes (neglected in this diagram), plagioclase feldspar and few quartz grains is probably gabbro (located at the right edge of the diagram, near P). This diagram does not determine whether a rock is gabbro, diorite, or <b>anorthosite.</b> There are another criteria used to decide that. Note that this diagram is not used for all plutonic rocks. Ultramafic rocks are the most important plutonic rocks that have separate classification diagrams.|$|E

A western ANT rock has a far greater Eu anomaly for a given Sm content than does a near-eastern ANT rock, which is in turn has a somewhat greater Eu anomaly than does a far-eastern ANT rock. Distinct differences are also observed in Sc/Sm and Ti/Sm ratios (western ANT rocks have lower ratios) and in the abundances of alkali-rich <b>anorthosites</b> (five of the six known <b>anorthosites</b> from the west are approximately four times richer in Na and K than are ferroan <b>anorthosites,</b> whereas none of the 40 known <b>anorthosites</b> from the near east is alkali-rich).

40|$|Lunar olivines from <b>anorthosites,</b> granulitic impactites, {{and rocks}} in the Mg-rich {{plutonic}} trend were subjected to electron probe measurements for Al, P, Ca, Ti, Cr and Mn, which show that the FeO/MnO ratio for lunar olivines lies between 80 and 110 with little difference among the rock types. The low values of Ca in lunar olivines indicate slow cooling to subsolidus temperatures, with blocking temperatures of about 750 C for 67667 and 1000 C for 60255, 73 -alpha determined by the Finnerty and Boyd (1978) experiments. An important paradox is noted in the low Ti content of Fe-rich olivines from <b>anorthosites,</b> although both Ti and Fe tend to become enriched in liquid during fractional distillation. Except for Ca and Mn, olivine from <b>anorthosites</b> has lower minor element values than other rock types. Formation from a chemically distinct system is therefore implied...|$|R
