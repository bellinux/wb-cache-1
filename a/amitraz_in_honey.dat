40|$|Dispersive {{liquid-liquid}} microextraction (DLLME) {{followed by}} gas chromatography–flame ionization detection (GC-FID), as a simple, rapid and efficient method, {{was developed for}} the determination of <b>amitraz</b> <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> samples. This method {{involves the use of}} an appropriate mixture of the extraction and disperser solvents for the formation of a cloudy solution in 5. 0 mL aqueous sample containing amitraz. After extraction, phase separation was performed by centrifugation and the concentrated amitraz in the sedimented phase was determined by gas chromatography—flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Some important parameters such as the type and volume of extraction and disperser solvents, and the effect of pH and salt on the extraction recovery of amitraz were investigated. Under the optimum conditions (13 µL of carbon tetrachloride as an extraction solvent, 1 mL of acetonitrile as a disperser solvent, no salt addition and pH 6) preconcentration factor and the extraction recovery were 955 and 95. 5 %, respectively. The linear range was 0. 01 - 1. 0 mg?kg– 1 and the limit of detection was 0. 0015 mg?kg– 1. The relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 4) for 0. 1 mg?kg– 1 of amitraz was 3. 2 %. The recoveries of amitraz from honey samples at the spiking levels of 0. 1 mg?kg- 1 were 78. 8 and 98. 2 %. The results indicated that DLLME is an efficient technique for the extraction of <b>amitraz</b> <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> samples...|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{acaricide}} residues of flumethrin, tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos, and <b>amitraz</b> <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> and beeswax {{was carried}} out using a rapid extraction method utilizing C- 18 SPE cartridges and an analytical method utilizing GC with ECD, NPD, and MSD detectors for the four acaricides. Recovery percentages from the extraction method ranged from 90 - 102 %, while the minimum detection levels ranged from 0. 1 - 0. 05 mg/kg for the acaricides. Nine of the 21 analyzed samples {{were found to be}} contaminated with the acaricides tau-fluvalinate and coumaphos. Neither flumethrin nor amitraz was detected in any of the honey or was samples. Coumaphos was found only in honey samples in which two samples exceeded the tolerance levels set by EPA	 and EC regulations. It has not been detected in beeswax. Five honey samples and eight beeswax samples were found to be contaminated with tau-fluvalinate. One of the was samples was contaminated with a relatively high residue of tau-fluvalinate and contained above 10 mg/kg...|$|E
40|$|Amitraz, a {{formamidine}} acaricide, {{plays an}} important role in the control of the southern cattle tick, Boophilus microplus (Canestrini), and other tick species that infest cattle, dogs, and wild animals. Although resistance to <b>amitraz</b> <b>in</b> B. microplus was previously reported in several countries, the actual measurement of the level of <b>amitraz</b> resistance <b>in</b> ticks has been difficult to determine due to the lack of a proper bioassay technique. We conducted a survey, by using a newly reported technique that was a modification of the standard Food and Agriculture Organization larval packet test, to measure the levels of resistance to <b>amitraz</b> <b>in</b> 15 strains of B. microplus from four major cattle-producing states in Mexico. Low-order resistance (1. 68 - to 4. 58 -fold) was detected in 11 of those strains. Our laboratory selection using amitraz on larvae of the Santa Luiza strain, which originated from Brazil, achieved a resistance ratio of 153. 93 at F 6, indicating the potential for high resistance to this acaricide in B. microplus. Both triphenylphosphate and piperonyl butoxide significantly synergized <b>amitraz</b> toxicity <b>in</b> both resistant and susceptible tick strains. Diethyl maleate synergized <b>amitraz</b> toxicity <b>in</b> one resistant strain but had no effect on the susceptible strain and had minor antagonistic effects on two other resistant strains. Target site insensitivity, instead of metabolic detoxification mechanisms, might be responsible for <b>amitraz</b> resistance observed <b>in</b> the Santa Luiza strain and possibly <b>in</b> other <b>amitraz</b> resistant B. microplus ticks from Mexico. The Santa Luiza strain also demonstrated high resistance to pyrethroids and moderate resistance to organophosphates. Multiple resistance shown in this strain and other B. microplus strains from Mexico poses a significant challenge to the management of B. microplus resistance to acaricides in Mexico...|$|R
40|$|Octopamine is a {{biogenic}} amine neurotransmitter of invertebrates that binds to a G-protein coupled receptor that has seven transmembrane domains. Formamidine pesticides like amitraz are highly specific agonists of the octopamine receptor. Amitraz is used extensively {{to control the}} cattle tick, Boophilus microplus, and many other ticks but now there are strains of ticks that are resistant to amitraz. We have isolated a cDNA from the cattle tick, B. miciroplus, that belongs to the {{biogenic amine}} family of receptors. The predicted amino acid sequence from this cDNA is most similar to octopamine receptors from insects. The nucleotide sequence of this gene from amitraz-resistant and amitraz-susceptible cattle ticks was identical. Thus, a point mutation/s did not confer resistance to <b>amitraz</b> <b>in</b> the strains we studied. Alternative explanations for resistance to <b>amitraz</b> <b>in</b> B. microplus are discussed.

40|$|International audienceAn apiary {{trial was}} {{conducted}} in 1999 in Northern Sardinia (Italy) {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and the persistence of <b>amitraz</b> impregnated <b>in</b> plastic strips against Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman. Twelve colonies of bees derived from Apis mellifera ligustica Spin. in Dadant Blatt hives were used; six colonies were treated with 2 strips per hive and the other six were left untreated control. Two methods for the evaluation of treatment efficacy were compared: the percent effectiveness measured as the percent reduction of V. destructor infestation in treated hives, and the percent control which took into consideration natural mortality in the control hives. Percent effectiveness was greater than the percent control. Amitraz residues were determined <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> and the plastic strips. No amitraz residue higher than 0. 01 mg·kg^- 1 was detected <b>in</b> <b>honey.</b> The <b>amitraz</b> content was stable during the trial in plastic strips placed in the colonies, and in the control strips.

40|$|International audienceTetracyclines {{are used}} to control {{bacterial}} diseases like European and American foulbrood which may cause severe losses <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> bee population and honey production. This study, using 24 hives randomly distributed into four groups of 6 hives, was performed for measuring the occurrence of tetracycline (TC) residue levels <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> following two types of TC application. Two groups of colonies were treated 3 times with 0. 5 g of TC in 1 litre of syrup (group S) or in 10 g of powdered sugar (group P). Six hives of a first control group (group C) fed with untreated syrup were installed at 20 and 45 metres from groups S and P respectively. A second control group (group DC) was disposed 3 km apart. TC residues <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> sampled at different times in all hives and <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> artificially contaminated with TC and stored in the laboratory at 4, 20 and 35 °C were analysed by ELISA and HPLC methods. One day after the last application, the mean TC concentration <b>in</b> brood chamber <b>honey</b> was ten times higher in group S (40. 7 mg. kg- 1) than in group P (4. 34 mg. kg- 1). After 8 days, TC residues were detected in all hives of group C. After 146 days, the mean TC concentration <b>in</b> harvested <b>honey</b> was 1. 54, 0. 35, and 0. 15 mg. kg- 1 for groups S, P and C respectively. The control group C had been contaminated by drifting. In all hives of the group DC, no residues were detected {{at any time of}} the study. The honey harvested at day 504 did not contained any detectable TC residues, except in one super from group C (0. 026 mg. kg- 1). The half-life time of TC <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> from supers was similar in groups C, S and P and equal to 65 days. This duration was twice lower than <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> stored <b>in</b> laboratory in similar conditions : at 35 °C in the dark (t 1 / 2 = 121 days). <b>In</b> <b>honey</b> stored at 20 °C, TC was quite stable as its half-life time was 242 days. The data from these experiments specify levels of TC residues <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> after a treatment in hives, their persistence and diffusion into the apiary. These results show that the TC must be used with precaution <b>in</b> <b>honey</b> production...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} amitraz, a {{formamidine}} pesticide, were investigated in four-week old outbred male Wistar rats on certain classic toxicological and haematological parameters {{as well as}} on specific immune functions. The animals were treated, per os by gavage for 28 days, in a five-day treatment two days break system, with 26. 5, 21. 1, 10. 6 and 5. 29 mg/kg/day amitraz. On the 29 th day, organ weights of the thymus, heart, lung, spleen, liver, kidneys, adrenals, testicles and popliteal lymph node; WBC and RBC counts, Ht, MCV, haemoglobin; and cell content of the femoral bone marrow were determined. In two separate groups, the effects of amitraz on the PFC content of the spleen, and on the maximum level and time course of DTH reaction, were investigated. <b>Amitraz</b> <b>in</b> 26. 5 mg/kg dose increased relative adrenal weight, and decreased relative liver weight, MCV value, PFC content of the spleen, and the maximum level of DTH reaction. The 21. 1 mg/kg dose decreased only MCV value, while 10. 6 mg/kg elevated the liver-to-brain weight ratio. Based of these findings, a NOEL dose of 5. 29 mg/kg was determined for <b>amitraz</b> <b>in</b> this experimental system; while the LOEL doses were 10. 6 mg/kg for the general toxicological, 21. 1 mg/kg for the haematological and 26. 5 mg/kg for the immune function parameters.
