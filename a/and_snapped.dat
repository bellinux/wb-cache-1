The Broncos chose {{to go for the}} two-point conversion and the win instead of kicking for the tie. They then ran a Statue of Liberty play, with Zabransky faking a pass to the right side and handing the ball behind his back to Ian Johnson, who ran left and entered the end zone untouched, giving the Broncos a stunning 4342 win.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} estimate the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Autonomic Nervous System components (SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> respectively) by using an indicator obtained from surface ECGs. The long-term goal of the project is to quantitatively analyze the ratio between SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> {{in order to better}} characterize certain pathologies. An approach based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA), which exploits the di erent activation delays of SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> is proposed <b>and</b> applied to a database with normal subjects and diabetic patients. Preliminary results show a good separation, in the frequency domain, of SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> dynamics, including a di erentiation of SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> in the low-frequency band. Results are promising for a better quanti cation of the autonomic state of the patients...|$|R

5|$|The tornado {{started at}} 6:15p.m. local {{time as a}} {{waterspout}} over Community Lake, just west of town. It then moved {{through the center of}} town along Christian Street, damaging almost every structure as it went. The tornado tore houses from their foundations, throwing some more than 600 feet (180 meters). A receipt from the town was later found 65 miles (105km) east in Peacedale, Rhode Island. Large trees were uprooted <b>and</b> <b>snapped,</b> and those that were still standing were stripped of small limbs and leaves. The Catholic Church was blown to bits, and heavy tombstones in the nearby cemetery were tossed around. The brand-new brick high school building was almost completely destroyed. The tornado's path through town was only two miles long, but the damage path was up to 600 feet (180 meters) wide.|$|E
5|$|The 1827 North Carolina {{hurricane}} caused severe impacts {{along its}} track through the northeastern Caribbean Sea {{and up the}} East Coast of the United States in late August1827. First observed over the Leeward Islands on August17, the storm continued northwest, passing over Puerto Rico and the northern coastline of Hispaniola. It moved through the Turks and Caicos Islands and then the Bahamas by August21 and curved northward. Although there is some discrepancy in its track, the hurricane moved ashore somewhere along the North Carolina coastline on August25, perhaps at Category4 intensity on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The cyclone emerged back into the Atlantic Ocean around Norfolk, Virginia, and grazed the New England coastline before last being observed offshore Nova Scotia on August28. Along its track, numerous vessels were damaged, capsized, or run aground. The combination of heavy rainfall and ferocious winds caused severe crop damage, damaged or destroyed structures, <b>and</b> <b>snapped</b> and uprooted trees. Overall, the storm was responsible {{for more than six}} deaths and at least two injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} first killer tornado of the {{outbreak}} touched down around 3:10a.m. EST <b>and</b> <b>snapped</b> several trees. After traveling for {{three quarters of}} a mile, it produced significant structural damage along North Carolina Highway 222 where a brick home was destroyed. A nearby trailer was rolled 30ft down the driveway of the home. The four residents sustained no injuries despite having not taken shelter before the tornado. A double-wide mobile home was blown off its foundation and flipped for 50ft before falling to the ground. One of the occupants, a 61-year-old woman was killed and her husband sustained major injuries. Three other mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado before it crossed into Wilson County. Once in Wilson County, several more mobile homes sustained significant damage before the tornado lifted. Damages from the tornado in both counties amounted to $700,000. The tornado was rated as an EF2 by the National Weather Service.|$|E

5|$|The {{strong winds}} left {{considerable}} tree and powerline damage. At {{the worst of}} the storm, 23,000 of the island's 30,000power subscribers were without electricity. Damage to power lines totaled to $385,000 (2001USD, $468,700 2008USD). The strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation. Three cruise ships weathered the storm at Saint George Harbour, where the powerful winds ripped out a post <b>and</b> <b>snapped</b> a mooring line, leaving a ship drifting in the harbor. One crew member was minorly injured. Over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings, resulting in them running aground or sinking. In all, 87boats were affected to some degree, with marine damage totaling to about $665,000 (2001USD, $809,600 2008USD). The winds also caused minor damage to 175properties on the island, primarily to houses. Damage to houses amounted to about $425,000 (2001USD, $517,400 2008USD). Overall damage was moderate, totaling to about $1.4million (2001USD, $1.7million 2008USD). No fatalities were reported, though a few storm-related injuries occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually large}} wind field uprooted many {{thousands}} of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, <b>and</b> <b>snapped</b> thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. An emergency evacuation shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage. Two {{people in the region}} died due to falling trees—one in New Kent County and one in the city of Hopewell. Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads, resulting in multiple minor car accidents. Additionally, most gas stations were closed, due to power outages leaving the pumps unusable. Old Dominion University remained closed for two weeks due to storm damage and power issues, the longest it has ever been closed during a school term. Likewise, Norfolk State University, Regent University, Tidewater Community College and Eastern Virginia Medical School all experienced significant closing times due to both storm damage and a lack of electricity.|$|E
5|$|On 19January Rewa {{started to}} affect Queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast. However {{it did not}} make its {{predicted}} landfall near Mackay, instead it recurved to the south-southeast and came to within 100km (60mi) of the coast. Two men off Yeppoon's coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army Black Hawk helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler's propeller <b>and</b> <b>snapped</b> its heavy anchor chain, leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone's path. The worst affected island was Lady Elliot as it bore {{the brunt of the}} wind, while on Heron Island, several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged. As Rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19January, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Brisbane received over 144mm (5.7in) in just six hours, which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four deaths. Three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars, while the other death occurred when a person went surfing Brisbane's flood water and got trapped in a storm drain. Within Brisbane, 100homes and 20cars were damaged by the flood waters, while a Sheffield Shield cricket match between Western Australia and Queensland was delayed, after the Gabba resembled a small lake.|$|E

On other network types, the LLC <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> headers are required in order to multiplex different protocols on the link layer, as the MAC layer doesn't itself have an EtherType field, so there's no alternative framing that would have a larger available payload.|$|R
5|$|This {{extremely}} long-tracked EF4 tornado {{touched down}} near Raleigh, Mississippi, in Smith County at 5:42p.m. CDT (2242 UTC), and {{continued into the}} Uniontown, Alabama area before dissipating. The tornado initially downed trees, blew skirting from mobile homes, and tore shingles from roofs. The tornado intensified as it moved northeast across Smith County and produced up to EF2 and EF3 damage. One mobile home was picked up, bounced a couple times, and thrown into a tree line, where it was torn apart and debris was scattered up to a mile away, including the frame. The tornado mowed down a stand of pine trees and destroyed two frame houses, with major damage to the interior walls, and the exterior walls completely destroyed. Many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed as well. It then moved into Jasper County <b>and</b> <b>snapped</b> and debarked many pine trees. The first area of EF4 damage was observed near Louin as a frame home and several mobile homes were completely destroyed, with parts of the mobile homes being thrown long distances, {{and some of the}} frame home foundation being swept clean. The tornado caused significant damage to a poultry farm and cattle ranch before it weakened briefly. It then destroyed two mobile homes and caused extensive tree and power line damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF1-strength tree and power line damage for several miles, until re-intensifying near to EF3 strength near Rose Hill.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the late-1970s and the 1980s, the Nazareth-based firm Beatty Contractors erected {{the candle}} each year. The firm {{originally}} did {{the project for}} free, but began charging $2,000 in 1981 when the cost of fuel started to rise. During the Peace Candle lighting ceremony on November 28, 1980, Easton Mayor Philip Mitman dedicated the candle to the 52 American hostages being held in Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. During a storm on December 6, 1983, 47 mile-per-hour winds caused the Peace Candle to start tilting in place. When city workers removed the flame next day, they realized the bugler statue atop the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument had moved on its base and would have toppled over {{had it not been}} leaning against the candle structure. One of the candle's anchor cables was also snapped by the wind and torn out of the brickwork. The cable was repaired and the bugler statue, which was previously held by its own weight, was reinforced with grouting. A sixteen-pound chunk of granite was also dislodged {{from the top of the}} statue, although in an area that most spectators cannot see from ground level. The candle suffered similar damage in 1988, when high winds loosened parts of the structure <b>and</b> <b>snapped</b> support wires. As a result, it had to be taken down early on January 5, 1989. In 1985, the Easton Area Christmas Committee was renamed to the Easton Holiday Committee.|$|E

40|$|The hormones {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) {{and brain}} natriuretic peptide (BNP) are stored and {{secreted}} by cardiac myocytes. To date, there is little information reported regarding the cellular mechanisms regulating the release of these hormones. Recent studies have identified soluble N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive-fusion attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) in the trafficking, docking and fusion of ANP and BNP secretory vesicles. In this study, I characterized the expression profiles of the three SNARE proteins (syntaxin 5 A, syntaxin 18, <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 29), implicated in constitutive exocytosis, in atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes. My results suggest that syntaxin 5 A, syntaxin 18 <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 29 are not important in the constitutive secretion of ANP and {{may play a role}} in another protein trafficking pathway. Syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25, two SNARE proteins previously characterized in atrial cardiac myocytes, form a complex in adults that has been implicated in the exocytosis of ANP. I investigated the protein expression and promoter activity of these two SNARE proteins in neonatal and adult atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes. The functional role of syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 was assessed using botulinum neurotoxin C (BoNT/C) and BoNT/A which cleave these SNARE proteins, respectively. Treatment of cardiac myocytes with BoNT/A and BoNT/C suggest that syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 regulate ANP secretion in neonatal cardiac myocytes, albeit low levels. Lastly, I examined the influence of forskolin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) on the syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 promoter. The lack of effect of these agents on gene reporter activity suggests that the CRE element in the syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 promoter do not significantly affect transcriptional activity. Overall, my studies demonstrate the developmental changes in SNARE protein expression in the heart, and their potential role in ANP secretion...|$|R
