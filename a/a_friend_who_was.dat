5|$|While Gascoigne was {{successful}} {{on the football}} field, his childhood was marked by instability and tragedy. Initially his family lived in a single upstairs room in a council house with a shared bathroom, and moved several times during Gascoigne's early life. When he was ten, Gascoigne witnessed the death of Steven Spraggon, the younger brother of <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> killed in a traffic collision. Around this time, his father began to suffer from seizures. Gascoigne began developing obsessions and twitches, and was taken into therapy at age ten, but soon quit the therapy sessions after his father expressed doubts over the treatment methods.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Ed Harris {{directed}} Connelly in the biopic Pollock {{in which}} she played Ruth Kligman, Jackson Pollock's mistress. In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film, Requiem for a Dream, directed by Darren Aronofsky {{and based on the}} novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. Connelly played Marion Silver, the girlfriend of Harry, played by Jared Leto; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn. Her character is a middle-class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop. She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution. Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived. During her time in the apartment, Connelly isolated herself, painted, listened to music that she considered that her character would, designed clothes, and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin. Connelly also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> in recovery. Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation. Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions and their effects on the lives and affections of the characters and their relatives.|$|E

He created an entirely new album, which was released under the label in the United States on May 11, 2004. Night Piece originally planned to be just an American only release, but due to strong sales on internet sites, it was released in other countries.

Some of the other 20 works he created in his first decade of composing, most of them commissioned, include: Aaron's Horizons (a tribute to colleague Aaron Copland); Echoes, for horn trio; Angelus, a 9/11 remembrance; Three Pieces for Wind Trio; Bagatelles, for saxophone quartet; The Heart's Light: An Essay for Orchestra; Three by Six, for chamber ensemble; and The Bells of St. Ferdinand, for orchestra.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Herbert Davenport, <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> {{the head of the}} {{economics}} department at the University of Missouri, Veblen accepted a position there in 1911. Veblen’s stay at Missouri was not one that he enjoyed. This was in part {{due to the fact that}} his position as a lecturer was of lower rank than his previous positions and for lower pay. Veblen also strongly disliked the town of Columbia, where the university was located. Although he may not have enjoyed his stay at Missouri, in 1914 he did publish another of his best-known books, The Instincts of Worksmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts (1914). After the First World War began, Veblen published Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution (1915). He considered warfare a threat to economic productivity and contrasted the authoritarian politics of Germany with the democratic tradition of Britain, noting that industrialization in Germany had not produced a progressive political culture.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiographical notes, Aurobindo {{said he felt}} a vast {{sense of}} calmness {{when he first came}} back to India.

He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practise of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Ganganath, <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a disciple of Brahmananda. [...] In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi. Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from the yogi, who had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required.|$|E

500|$|In 1928 Kwee {{was asked}} by <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> hoping to {{establish}} a film company, to write a [...] "sensational" [...] story {{which could be used}} as the basis for a movie. Ongoing activity at Krakatoa was foremost in the author's mind and, after reading Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1834 novel The Last Days of Pompeii, Kwee asked himself [...] "is it impossible for one to write a drama about Krakatoa?" [...] Owing to the length of time between the 1883 and 1928 eruptions, Kwee decided to begin his story with the separation of two young siblings. Further elements of the story were inspired by the mountain-dwelling Baduy, a group which tended to avoid outsiders and claimed to be descended from the Hindu kings of Pajajaran.|$|E

In mid-1882 he ended his studies at Glasgow with a Master of Arts degree, and was awarded prizes for essays on politics and church history.|$|E

500|$|Truman is {{the most}} recent {{president}} who did not earn a college degree. [...] In addition to having briefly attended business college, from 1923 to 1925 he took night courses toward an LL.B. at the Kansas City Law School (now the University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law), but dropped out after losing reelection as county judge. [...] He was informed by attorneys in the Kansas City area that his education and experience were probably sufficient to receive a license to practice law, but did not pursue it because he won election as presiding judge. [...] While serving as president in 1947, Truman applied for a license to practice law. <b>A</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> an attorney began working out the arrangements, and informed Truman that his application had to be notarized. [...] By the time Truman received this information he had changed his mind, so he never sought notarization.

500|$|While at Northwestern, Colbert {{studied with}} the intent of {{becoming}} a dramatic actor; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas and at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago as a part of Del Close's ImprovOlympic {{at a time when the}} project was focused on competitive, long-form improvisation, rather than improvisational comedy. [...] "I wasn't gonna do Second City", Colbert later recalled, [...] "because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv– there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people". After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job. [...] <b>A</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs. Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free. Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly.|$|E
500|$|In 1641 Bellingham {{was elected}} {{governor}} {{for the first}} time, running against Winthrop. [...] The Body of Liberties was formally adopted during his term. [...] However, he served for just one year, {{and was replaced by}} Winthrop in 1642. [...] Bellingham's defeat may have been caused in part by the scandalous impropriety surrounding his second marriage. [...] <b>A</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a guest in his house had been courting Penelope Pelham, a young woman of twenty. [...] According to Winthrop, Bellingham, now 50 and a widower, won her heart, and, without waiting for the formalities of the banns of marriage, officiated at his own wedding. [...] When the issue came before the colonial magistrates, Bellingham (as the governor and chief magistrate) refused to step down from the bench to face the charges, thus bringing the matter to a somewhat awkward end. [...] Bellingham's term in office was characterized by Winthrop as extremely difficult: [...] "The General Court was full of uncomfortable agitations and contentions by reason of Bellingham's unfriendliness to some other magistrates. [...] He set himself in an opposite frame to them in all proceedings, which did much to retard business".|$|E
