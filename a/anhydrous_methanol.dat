Previous reports have identified this mode as a Si−O−C stretch; however, the first principles calculations, presented in this work, indicate that this mode is a combination of an O−C stretch with a CH_ 3 rock. At longer reaction times, the intensity of the Si−H stretching mode decreased, while peaks attributable to the O−C coupled stretch and the CH_ 3 stretching modes, respectively, increased in intensity. Spectra of H−Si(111) surfaces that had reacted with CD_ 3 OD showed the appearance of Si−D signals polarized normal to the surface as well as the appearance of vibrations indicative of Si−OCD_ 3 surface species. The data are consistent with two surface reactions occurring in parallel, involving (a) chemical attack of hydrogen-terminated Si(111) terraces by CH_ 3 OH, forming Si−OCH_ 3 moieties having their Si−O bond oriented normal to the Si(111) surface and (b) transfer of the acidic hydrogen of the methanol to the silicon surface, either through a direct H-to-D exchange mechanism or through a mechanism involving chemical step-flow etching of Si−H step sites...|$|R

At 65 °C, {{reaction of}} atomically smooth H-Si(111) surfaces with CH 3 OH (l) results in partially methoxylated silicon surfaces that are free of any detectable subsurface oxidation (Si-O-Si bonds); this is in contrast to observable oxidation found after similar reactions on H-Si(100) surfaces. At long reaction times (t> 3 h), the Si(111) surface saturates with Si-OCH 3 sites at a coverage of approximately 30 % of a monolayer, with the residual ∼ 70 % comprised of unreacted Si-H sites. The lack of any detectable silicon oxide makes it possible to conclude the following: (i) Reaction mechanisms involving insertion of oxygen atoms from the CH 3 OH molecule into the subsurface Si-Si back bonds cannot be dominant for (111) -oriented silicon under these conditions. (ii) The vibrational modes of the oxide-free surface are very sharp and can be clearly distinguished from blue-shifted modes observed for methoxyl groups chemisorbed on oxidized surfaces. For surfaces that display subsurface oxidation, no evidence for oxygen atoms directly below atop Si-H sites has been observed. Instead, FTIR analysis demonstrates that subsurface oxidation selectively exists underneath atop Si-OCH 3 sites.

30|$|The enzyme {{activities}} of various immobilized PAs were determined {{according to the}} previous methods (Ferreira et al. 2007; Shewale et al. 1987), with some modifications. Briefly, the immobilized enzyme was added into 5  mL of phosphate buffer (100  mmol/L, pH 7.5) containing PGK (1.08  mmol, 216  mmol/L). After the mixture was incubated at 37  °C and 200  r/min for 10  min, 5  mL ethanol was added to quench the enzymatic reaction. Then 1  mL of sample that was withdrawn from the mixture was mixed with 2  mL of acetic acid-NaOH buffer (being composed of 2  mL of 20 % acetic acid and 1  mL of 0.05  mol/L NaOH), followed by adding 1  mL of 5 % PDAB dissolved in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>methanol.</b> After incubation at 37  °C for 20  min, the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 415  nm. The controls without enzyme were run simultaneously. 1  U {{was defined as the}} amount of enzyme that released 1  μmol 6 -APA per minute at pH 7.5 and 37  °C. The specific {{activities of}} SIPA-III, SIPA-IV, SIPA-V, PGA-II, PGA-IV, and PGA- 750 were 98.8, 44.9, 72.5, 78.9, 22.7, and 624.5  U/g, respectively.|$|E
3000|$|... 3 -bromocyclooctene (1) {{was chosen}} as the {{principal}} starting material because of its scalable and highly efficient preparation. Several synthetic pathways were explored as shown in Scheme  1. The bromo group exhibited a wide range of reactivity towards the hydroxyl group in alcohols and phenol derivatives (compounds 2 – 4). Stirring compound 1 in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>methanol</b> at room temperature afforded 3 -methoxy-COE (2) in 24  h; and elevated temperature and extended reaction time was required to obtain compound 3 from its respective alcohol. However, no reaction of 1 with more hindered alcohols (e.g., secondary alcohols) or their deprotonated forms was observed, even after months. The phenoxide anion derived from phenol 4 ′-hydroxy- 4 -biphenylcarbonitrile, which is a liquid crystal building block, reacts readily with 1 in DMF to give 3 -substituted COE with an aryl ether group (compound 4). Other types of nucleophiles, including cyanide, ammonia, phthalimide and a Grignard reagent, reacted with 1 to generate the corresponding 3 FGCOEs (compounds 5 – 7). 3 -amino-COE (6) was used to synthesize 3 FGCOE having amide (16) or urea (17) groups substituted at the 3 -position (Scheme  1).|$|E
40|$|Xylocarpins A and B, two new mexicanolides with a tiglate {{group at}} C- 3, have been {{identified}} in the mixture using NMR spectroscopy. Both compounds were isolated in the mixture from the seeds of a Chinese mangrove Xylocarpus granatum. The first complete assignments of H- 1 and C- 13 NMR data for these mexicanolides were achieved by means of 2 D NMR techniques including H- 1 -H- 1 COSY, HSQC, HMBC and NOESY spectra. In order to separate xylocarpins A (1) and B (2) by chemical method, the mixture of two compounds was reduced with sodium borohydride in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>methanol.</b> However, the reduction led to the opening of the delta-lactone ring in xylocarpin B and afforded compound 3 as the main product. The complete NMR assignments of compound 3 were also achieved by means of the above 2 D NMR techniques. Moreover, xylocarpin A was easily transformed into xylocarpin B during our normal liquid column chromatography. From this point of view, xylocarpin A was deemed to be the genuine natural product and xylocarpin B might be an artifact. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|No-carrier-added trimethylsilyl[18 F]fluoride (TMS[18 F]F) {{was rapidly}} liberated {{from a variety}} of dry {{supports}} containing unreactive [18 F]fluoride by simply heating with neat bistrimethylsilylsulfate. The supports included calcium phosphate, anion exchange resins, alumina, borosilicate and porous carbon beads, to which [18 F]fluoride was applied by absorption or evaporation of aqueous solution. TMS[18 F]F was evolved essentially free of entrained moisture or excess silylating agent and was efficiently absorbed and rapidly cleaved to free [18 F]fluoride ion by 0. 1 % benzyltrimethylammonium methoxide in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>methanol.</b> Passage of this solution through a strong cation exchange column provided purified hydrogen[18 F]fluoride, which was subsequently trapped on a quaternary 4 -aminopyridinium resin and used for heterogeneous nucleophilic radiofluorination of 1, 3, 4, 6 -tetraacetyl-beta-mannopyranose- 2 -triflate in 70 % yield. The purified [18 F]fluoride was also used for solution phase nucleophilic labeling of ethyl [18 F] 4 -fluorobenzoate following addition of K 2 CO 3 /Kryptofix and DMSO. This approach provides a simplified way to ensure high reactivity in [18 F]fluoride ion from cyclotron targets. It also may be used to salvage active [18 F]fluoride ion from insoluble complexes and radiofluorination reaction residues...|$|E
