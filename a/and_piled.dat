25|$|Poke {{is a local}} cuisine that {{originally}} involved preserving raw fish or other seafood such as octopus with sea salt and rubbing it (lomi) with seasonings or cutting it into small pieces. Seasonings made of seaweed, kukui nut, and sea salt were traditionally used for the Hawaiian poke. Since first contact with Western and Asian cultures, scallions, chili peppers, and soy sauce have become common additions to it. Poke is different from sashimi, since the former is usually rough-cut <b>and</b> <b>piled</b> onto a plate, and {{can be made with}} less expensive pieces of fish.|$|E

All off-road movement was virtually impossible because the wet and boggy terrain had recently been ploughed and planted with first shoots starting to appear.

The heavy defeat increased the war’s burden on Rome <b>and,</b> <b>piled</b> on previous military disasters (such as Lake Trasimene, Cannae and others), aggravated the relations with her exhausted Italian allies. For Hannibal the battle was a tactical success, but did not halt for long the Roman advance. Within {{the next three years}} the Romans reconquered most of the territories and cities lost {{at the beginning of the}} war and pushed the Carthaginian general to the southwestern end of the Apennine peninsula. The battle was the last Carthaginian victory of the war; all battles which followed were either inconclusive or Roman victories.|$|E
25|$|The tornado reached EF3 {{strength}} {{just past}} the Liberty Expressway as it impacted a one-story brick home, removing the roof and collapsing several exterior walls, snapping or uprooting almost all surrounding mature trees, and tossing a vehicle in the area. A few other homes in this area also sustained significant structural damage. It then quickly weakened back to EF2 intensity as it completely destroyed the canopy of a service station, snapped large trees, tore the entire roof off of a restaurant, and severely damaged a large Procter & Gamble plant in Albany. Multiple anchored double-wide trailers were completely destroyed at the Marine Corp Logistics Base, and concrete light poles were snapped. Several semi-trailers were tossed <b>and</b> <b>piled</b> atop each other, and multiple other large metal industrial buildings sustained heavy damage in this area as well. A house also had much of its roof ripped off.|$|E

[...] According to the European Union waste list, oil shale ash and spent shale are classified as hazardous waste.

[...] After reading of the college's effort {{to build a new}} library in a Reformed Church publication, Ralph Voorhees and his wife Elizabeth Rodman Voorhees contacted president Austin Scott for the library plans and an estimate of construction costs. Voorhees and his wife, whose wealth came as an inheritance from her family's shipping and importing business, donated $59,000 (2013: US$1,552,880) to erect a new library. $5,000 (2013: US$131,600) was added to this total from other donors to furnish the new building. [...] The new library, called Voorhees Hall, was built on land donated by James Nielson behind Kirkpatrick Chapel that began to extend the college campus west. Voorhees Hall was dedicated on November 10, 1903—the 140th anniversary of the signing of the college's charter—and served as the school's main library until the Archibald S. Alexander Library opened in 1956. [...] Voorhees, who was fully blind, gave a speech and was awarded an honorary degree at the dedication ceremony.|$|E
