500|$|Land tenure {{has been}} an issue since first {{settlement}} as island residents repeatedly requested freehold title or an <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> of cultivated land. Original settlers were squatters. The granting of a [...] lease to Richard Armstrong in 1878 drew complaints and a few short-term leases ("permissive occupancies") were granted. In 1913, with {{the appointment of a}} Board of Control, permissive occupancies were revoked and the Board itself given permissive occupancy of the island. Then the Lord Howe Island Act 1953 made all land the property of the Crown. Direct descendants of islanders with permissive occupancies in 1913 were granted perpetual leases on blocks of up to [...] for residential purposes. Short-term special leases were granted for larger areas used for agriculture, so in 1955, fifty-five perpetual leases and 43 special leases were granted. The 1981 amendment to the act extended political and land rights to all residents of 10 years or more. There remains an active debate concerning the proportion of residents with tenure and the degree of influence on the Board of resident islanders in relation to long-term planning for visitors, and issues relating to the environment, amenity and global heritage.|$|E

His eyes were deep-set in a square, hard head, and he appeared to be taking Austen in without directly looking at him; likewise, one felt that Mr. Flint's handshake was not an <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> of his soul.|$|E
5000|$|One {{challenge}} in settling disputes for breach of promise was {{determining whether a}} gift made during the engagement was an absolute gift—one given permanently, with no strings attached—or a conditional gift, given in the expectation of the marriage taking place. If an engagement gift was given on a holiday, such as Valentine's Day or Christmas, the gift could {{be considered to be}} non-contingent, and given partially for reasons other than marriage, and thus {{does not have to be}} returned. Christmas presents are generally taken to be <b>absolute</b> <b>gifts,</b> and thus cannot be recovered if the engagement dissolves, but engagement rings are generally taken to be conditional gifts, at least under most circumstances, which means that they must be returned if the recipient no longer chooses to go through with the marriage. [...] Whether an engagement ring must be returned if the giver breaks off the engagement varies.|$|R
6000|$|Hillside Church was {{the only}} one in the {{neighbourhood}} where Holy Week or Ascension Day had been observed in the memory of man. When we proposed going to church on the latter day the gardener asked my mother 'if it was her will to keep Thursday holy,' as if he expected its substitution for Sunday. Monthly Communions and Baptisms after the Second Lesson were viewed as 'not fit for a country church,' and every attempt at even more secular improvements was treated with the most disappointing distrust and aversion. When my father laid out the allotment grounds, the labourers suspected some occult design for his own profit, and the farmers objected that the gardens would be used as an excuse for neglecting their work and stealing their potatoes. Coal-club and clothing-club were regarded in like manner, and while a few took advantage of these offers in a grudging manner, the others viewed everything except <b>absolute</b> <b>gifts</b> as 'me-an' on our part, the principle of aid to self-help being an absolute novelty. [...] When I look back to the notes in our journals of that date I see how much has been overcome.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOocyte donation, {{initially}} {{proposed in}} agonadal women, saw indications expand to ovarian deficiencies and failures of {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF), resulting in a significant increasing demand. The recruitment of oocyte donors is a critical issue for all countries that have allowed this practice. The French legislation, with the laws of bioethics, is clearly the most restrictive of European countries, imposing an <b>absolute</b> free <b>gift</b> from mother. The different solutions in the neighboring countries are analysed {{and in particular the}} interpretations made in respect of gratuity and compensation. Motivating donors (spontaneous, relational, or by reciprocity), but also motivating the medical teams can organize a program of oocyte donation in France. The authors present their results of three years experience, demonstrating that this system is possible in the current legislative framework...|$|R
60|$|While the Bishop {{continued}} {{to go on}} the voyages with him, he had companionship, guidance, and comparatively no responsibility, while his success, that supreme joy, was wonderfully unalloyed, and he felt his own especial gifts coming constantly into play. His love for his scholars was one continual well of delight, and really seemed to be an <b>absolute</b> <b>gift,</b> enabling him to win them over, and compensating for what he had left, even while he did not cease to love his home with deep tenderness.|$|E
6000|$|Having {{looked at}} his public services, which are {{well-known}} scenes of wickedness, barbarity, and corruption, we next come to see what his reward is. Your Lordships hear what reward he thought proper to secure for himself; and I believe {{a man who has}} power like Gunga Govind Sing, and a disposition like Gunga Govind Sing, can hardly want the means of rewarding himself; and if every virtue rewards itself, and virtue is said to be its own reward, the virtue of Gunga Govind Sing was in a good way of seeking its own reward. Mr. Hastings, however, thought it was not right that such a man should reward himself, but that it was necessary for the honor and justice of government to find him a reward. Then the next thing is, what that reward shall be. It is a grant of lands. Your Lordships will observe, that Mr. Hastings declares some of these lands to be unoccupied, others occupied, but not by the just owners. Now these were the very lands of the Rajah of Dinagepore from whence he had taken the bribe of 40,000l. My Lords, this was a monstrous thing. Mr. Hastings had the audacity, as his parting act, when he was coming to England, and ought to have expected (whatever he did expect) the responsibility of this day,--he was, I say, shameless enough not only to give this recommendation, but to perpetuate the mischiefs of his reign, as he has done, to his successors: for he has really done so, by making it impossible, almost, to know anything of the true state of that country; and he has thereby made them much less responsible and criminal than before in any ill acts they may have done since his time. But Mr. Hastings not only recommends and backs the petition of Gunga Govind Sing with his parting authority, which authority he made the people there believe would be greater in England than it was in India, but he is an evidence; he declares, that, [...] "to his own knowledge, these lands are vacant, and confessedly, therefore, by the laws of this as well as of most other countries, in the <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> of government." ...|$|E

50|$|In England and Wales, {{the gift}} of an {{engagement}} ring is presumed to be an <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> to the fiancée. This presumption may be rebutted however by proving that the ring was given on condition (express or implied) {{that it must be}} returned if the marriage did not take place, for whatever reason. This was decided in the case Jacobs v Davis (1917).|$|E
5000|$|Lord Langdale MR {{held that}} the words of Payne's will were not {{sufficiently}} certain, which meant {{that there had been}} an <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> to Thomas, who had taken the property unfettered by any trust in favour of the male line. He formulated a legal test, now known as the [...] "three certainties". This test specified that for a valid trust to be created, there must be three certainties: ...|$|E

Commenting upon directing the dramatic culmination of the week, Neilson said: [...] "As a director it's an <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> of a week, because it's a story where the audience are continually looking for meaning in every line and every reaction. Because of that I was determined to get very specific performances which would steer the story as I {{wanted it to be}} steered throughout the week." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Privy Council {{advised that}} the {{fairness}} required by equity meant {{the fact that}} the trust property was vested in one trustee (Mr Pagarani himself) {{at the time of the}} gift was sufficient to make the conveyance to the trust valid. Lord Browne-Wilkinson said the most important question was this: on the basis that Mr Pagarani intended to make an immediate <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> [...] "to the Foundation", but had not vested the gifted property in all the trustees of the Foundation, are the trusts of the Foundation trust deed enforceable against the deposits and the shares, or was it (as the judge at first instance and the Court of Appeal had held) a case where there has been an imperfect gift which cannot be enforced against Mr Pagarani's estate whatever his intentions might have been? ...|$|E
5000|$|Homes {{may be lost}} in ways {{ranging from}} the upheavals of natural disasters, fraud/theft, arson, or war-related destruction, to the more common {{voluntary}} sale, loss for one or more occupants on relationship breakdown, expropriation by government or legislated cause, repossession/foreclosure to pay secured debts, eviction by landlords, disposal by time-limited means [...] - [...] lease, or <b>absolute</b> <b>gift.</b> Jurisdiction-dependent means of home loss include adverse possession, unpaid property taxation and corruption such as in circumstances of a failed state. Personal insolvency, development or sustaining of mental illness or severe physical incapacity without affordable domestic care commonly lead to a change of home. The underlying character of a home may be debased by structural defects, natural subsidence, neglect or soil contamination. Refugees from homes flee where such extreme forms of quasi-nuisance occur such as harassment and religious persecution, who may seek a sheltered housing refuge or place of asylum respectively.|$|E
50|$|Land tenure {{has been}} an issue since first {{settlement}} as island residents repeatedly requested freehold title or an <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> of cultivated land. Original settlers were squatters. The granting of a 100 acre lease to Richard Armstrong in 1878 drew complaints and a few short-term leases ("permissive occupancies") were granted. In 1913, with {{the appointment of a}} Board of Control, permissive occupancies were revoked and the Board itself given permissive occupancy of the island. Then the Lord Howe Island Act 1953 made all land the property of the Crown. Direct descendants of islanders with permissive occupancies in 1913 were granted perpetual leases on blocks of up to 5 acre for residential purposes. Short-term special leases were granted for larger areas used for agriculture, so in 1955, fifty-five perpetual leases and 43 special leases were granted. The 1981 amendment to the act extended political and land rights to all residents of 10 years or more.

5000|$|With a half-secret trust, {{the fact}} that the {{beneficiary}} of the will holds as trustee only is declared {{on the face of the}} will, but not the other terms of the trust. This must go further than the mere [...] "hope" [...] that the beneficiary (again I believe this should read [...] "trustee" [...] - the beneficiary is the passive party to a trust) of the will will act in accordance with its terms. The requirements for a half-secret trust to be valid are similar to those for fully secret trusts, and were laid out in Blackwell v Blackwell, where a testator gave five trustees pieces of property, instructing them (in the will) to hold on to this property as they had been asked. Prior to the testator's death, the trustees had all been told what to do with the property. Lord Sumner said that: [...] The necessary elements create a half-secret trust, on which the question turns, are intention, communication and acquiescence. The testator intends his <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> to be employed as he and not as the donee desires; he tells the proposed donee of this intention and, either by express promise or by the tacit promise, which is satisfied by acquiescence, the proposed donee encourages him to bequeath the money on the faith that his intention will be carried out.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{alternative}} is that members hold beneficially, but {{are bound by}} contracts inter se as {{to their ability to}} receive their own share. That share is considered to pass to {{the other members of the}} association upon the death or resignation of the member. The holding may then either be considered absolute, or on trust for the membership as a whole, but it is the role of contract in each case to determine the rights of members, including the officers, to apply the money. This approach was favoured in Re Recher’s Will Trusts in relation to a gift to the Anti-Vivisection Society, although, on the facts, that society was considered no longer in existence and the gift failed for this reason. One statement of when such an <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> will be considered to have been made was given in Re Lipinski’s Will Trusts: [...] "Where the donee association is itself the beneficiary of the prescribed purpose... the gift should be construed as an absolute one... the more so where, if the purpose is carried out, the members can by appropriate action vest the resulting property in themselves, for here the trustees and the beneficiaries are the same persons." [...] Another statement of the principle came in , where Lewison J stated: [...] "the property of an unincorporated association is the property of its members, but that they are contractually precluded from severing their share except in accordance with the rules of the association... this kind of collective ownership must, in my judgment, be a sub-species of joint tenancy, albeit taking effect subject to any contractual restrictions applicable as between members." [...] It is now considered the dominant theory in the field.|$|E
5000|$|Mr Thakurdas Choithram Pagarani {{wanted to}} start a {{foundation}} called the Choithram International Foundation. He was dying of cancer. He drew up a trust deed, including himself a trustee. He travelled from his business based in Dubai and had a ceremony at his son's home in London. On 17 February 1992, with people gathered at his bedside, Mr Pagarani announced he was transferring his money to a Jersey trust for his proposed philanthropic foundation. Witnesses differed in the precise words, but the generally accepted substance as to what he was thought to have said was: [...] "I now give all my wealth to the Trust" [...] or [...] "I have given everything to the Trust". Mr Pagarani executed the trust deed in front of three trustees (who also signed), his accountant and the First Secretary of the Indian High Commission. He told the group accountant, Mr Param, that he knew what to do to transfer all balances to the foundation. There were to be three more trustees (who signed shortly afterwards), and Mr Pagarani himself was to be a seventh trustee. Those present testified that Mr Pagarani made an immediate <b>absolute</b> <b>gift</b> to the Foundation of all his shareholdings and credit balances in four British Virgin Island companies. But then he died before actually executing the documents to transfer legal title to the assets to the trustees. Some of his children contended the gift was imperfect and unenforceable. The four BVI companies in fact altered the share registers later the same day. Mr Pagarani had also prepared a will, but had not signed it. The share transfer documents were also unsigned by Mr Pagarani. The relatives who were trustees of the Foundation claimed that the gift to the Foundation was valid, and that the shares in the companies had not been transferred properly in the manner specified by law in the International Business Companies Act. Other people who stood to inherit challenged the foundation's claim.|$|E
