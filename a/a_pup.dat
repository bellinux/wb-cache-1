5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. <b>A</b> <b>pup,</b> with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon <b>a</b> <b>pup</b> if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, <b>a</b> <b>pup</b> may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E
5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{a variety of}} vocal behaviors. The cry of <b>a</b> <b>pup</b> is often {{compared to that of}} a seagull. Females coo when they are apparently content; males may grunt instead. Distressed or frightened adults may whistle, hiss, or in extreme circumstances, scream.|$|E
5|$|This {{species at}} its {{breeding}} sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a tawny owl, {{and a much}} less frequent sound like the whimpering of <b>a</b> <b>pup.</b> It is silent at sea. The breeding calls {{are very similar to}} those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms madeira, feae and deserti all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the responsiveness of 19 - to 20 -day-old C 57 BL/ 6 J (C) and A/J (<b>A)</b> mouse <b>pups</b> to maternal cues. The C pups were found {{to spend more time}} near their C or A foster mother than they did near a virgin female. The <b>A</b> <b>pups</b> showed no such preference. Attempts to increase the motivation of <b>A</b> <b>pups</b> to approach the mother did not produce any preference for maternal cues. However, when the bedding on which odorous substances had been permitted to accumulate {{for an extended period of}} time was used as choice stimuli, pups of both lines showed a preference for the bedding of the mother as opposed to that of a virgin female. These results support findings with other rodents of a change in the female 2 ̆ 7 s odor during lactation which increases her attractiveness to her pups; and they demonstrate a genetic difference between pups of 2 inbred strains in their approach to maternal cues...|$|R

40|$|Rat pups (Rattus norvegicus) {{are born}} blind and deaf yet manage to wriggle {{about in a}} huddle, {{dynamically}} adjusting their positions and thereby displaying thermoregulation and energy conservation {{at the level of}} the group. <b>As</b> <b>pups</b> develop, their activity and mobility outpace the development of their visual and auditory systems making it increasingly di¤cult to aggregate and maintain aggregation while still blind and deaf. The developmental emergence of coupled activity may be one mechanism that facilitates aggregation. Our previous research has shown that the activity of <b>a</b> seven-day-old <b>pup</b> is independent of the activity of the litter mates it contacts. However, we hypothesized that, by day 10, more active and mobile pups will exhibit coupled activity, becoming increasingly quiescent when in contact with other behaviourally quiescent pups. In order to test this hypothesis, we used individual-based modelling. Because the structure of the model was complex, we used a Darwinian algorithm for evolving a model that behaved like ten-day-old <b>pups</b> aggregating in <b>an</b> arena. Sensitivity to quiescent individuals was manifested in some litters by the transitory spreading of quiescence across aggregates of both real and virtual <b>pups</b> (<b>a</b> contagion e¡ect). <b>As</b> <b>pups</b> develop, individual behaviour becomes increasingly contingent on the behaviour of others revealing what may be a basic component in the development of cooperative behaviour...|$|R

25|$|The classic {{diagnostic}} technique is with appropriate X-rays and hip scoring tests. These {{should be done}} at an appropriate age, and perhaps repeated at adulthood - if done too young they will not show anything. Since the condition is {{to a large degree}} inherited, the hip scores of parents should be professionally checked before buying <b>a</b> <b>pup,</b> and the hip scores of dogs should be checked before relying upon them for breeding. Despite the fact that the condition is inherited, it can occasionally arise even to animals with impeccably hip scored parents.|$|E

25|$|Scooby-Doo was {{originally}} broadcast on CBS from 1969 to 1975, when it moved to ABC. ABC aired the show until canceling it in 1986, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children, <b>A</b> <b>Pup</b> Named Scooby-Doo, from 1988 until 1991. New Scooby-Doo series aired {{as part of}} Kids' WB on The WB Network and its successor, The CW Network, from 2002 until 2008. Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated aired on Cartoon Network from 2010 to 2013, and Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! debuted on Cartoon Network in 2015.

25|$|Reruns of Scooby-Doo {{have been}} in {{syndication}} since 1980, and have also been shown on cable television networks such as TBS Superstation (until 1989) and USA Network (as part of the USA Cartoon Express from 1990 to 1994). In 1993, <b>A</b> <b>Pup</b> Named Scooby-Doo, having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on the Cartoon Network. With Turner Broadcasting purchasing Hanna-Barbera in 1991, in 1994 the Scooby-Doo franchise became exclusive to the Turner networks: Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and TNT. Canadian network Teletoon began airing Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! in 1997, with the other Scooby series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, Scooby-Doo became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station Boomerang.|$|E

40|$|A cross-fostering {{design was}} used to examine {{maternal}} behavior, pup vocalizations, and pup temperature changes following an infantile handling procedure in C 57 BL/ 6 J (C) and A/J (A) mice. In Experiment I, maternal behavior of C and A mothers after infantile handling differed {{in a number of ways}} irrespective of the strain of the foster <b>pups.</b> In addition, <b>A</b> <b>pups</b> were retrieved faster but licked less than wereC pups by mothers of both strains. Handling appeared to increase the probability that strain differences would occur in that no differences between the lines, in either the behavior of the mothers or the capacity of the pups to elicit maternal behavior, were found during observations made just prior to daily handling. These observations also revealed that mothers of both strains treated same-strain foster pups differently than they treated foster pups of another strain. In Experiment II, <b>A</b> <b>pups</b> were found to emit more ultrasound following handling than were C pups, suggesting that retrieval but not pup-licking was stimulated by ultrasonic signals. Measurement of pup temperature during and following the handling procedure showed that (1) strain differences in ultrasonic signaling were not related to strain differences in the degree of hypothermia experienced by the pups; (2) recovery of body temperature following handling was slow for pups of both strains, and depended to some degree on the strain of the pup 2 ̆ 7 s foster mother; and (3) development of thermoregulation occurred more rapidly in C than <b>A</b> <b>pups...</b>|$|R

25|$|A bonnethead, a type {{of small}} hammerhead shark, {{was found to have}} {{produced}} <b>a</b> <b>pup,</b> born live on 14 December 2001 at Henry Doorly Zoo in Nebraska, in a tank containing three female hammerheads, but no males. The pup was thought to have been conceived through parthenogenic means. The shark pup was apparently killed by a stingray within days of birth. The investigation of the birth was conducted by the research team from Queen's University Belfast, Southeastern University in Florida, and Henry Doorly Zoo itself, and it was concluded after DNA testing that the reproduction was parthenogenic. The testing showed the female pup's DNA matched only one female who lived in the tank, and that no male DNA was present in the pup. The pup was not a twin or clone of her mother, but rather, contained only half of her mother's DNA ("automictic parthenogenesis"). This type of reproduction had been seen before in bony fish, but never in cartilaginous fish such as sharks, until this documentation.|$|E
25|$|During the {{breeding}} season, males {{that fail to}} secure territories and harems, most often subadults, will cause group raids {{in an attempt to}} change the status quo and gain access to the females. Group raids are more common on sandy beaches than rocky ones. These raids cause chaos in {{the breeding}} harems, often splitting mothers from their young. The resident males try to fight off the raiders and keep all the females in their territorial boundaries. Raiders are often unsuccessful in securing a female, but some are able to capture some females or even stay in the breeding area with one or more females. Sometimes, an invading male abducts pups, possibly as an attempt to control the females. They also take pups as substitutes for mature females. Subadults herd their captured pups and prevent them from escaping, much like adult males do to females. <b>A</b> <b>pup</b> may be mounted by its abductor, but intromission does not occur. While abducting pups does not give males immediate reproductive benefits, these males may gain experience in controlling females. Pups are sometimes severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E

500|$|Coyotes were {{probably}} semidomesticated by various pre-Columbian cultures. Some 19th-century writers wrote of coyotes being kept in native {{villages in the}} Great Plains.

Both full-blooded and hybrid coyotes can be playful and confiding with their owners, but are suspicious and shy of strangers, though coyotes being tractable enough {{to be used for}} practical purposes like retrieving and pointing have been recorded.
