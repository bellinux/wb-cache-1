5|$|Many governments now {{prohibit}} {{removal of}} coral from reefs, and inform coastal residents about reef protection and ecology. While local action such as habitat restoration and herbivore protection can reduce local damage, the longer-term threats of <b>acidification,</b> temperature change and sea-level rise remain a challenge.|$|E
5|$|Stony corals first {{appeared}} in the Middle Triassic, but their relationship to the tabulate and rugose corals of the Paleozoic is currently unresolved. In modern times stony corals numbers are expected to decline due to the effects of global warming and ocean <b>acidification.</b>|$|E
5|$|A colour {{reaction}} for salts of acetic acid is iron(III) chloride solution, {{which results in}} a deeply red colour that disappears after <b>acidification.</b> A more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution. Acetates when heated with arsenic trioxide form cacodyl oxide, which can be detected by its malodorous vapours.|$|E
5|$|Some {{consumers}} prefer {{pizza cheese}} with less browning, {{which can be}} achieved using low-moisture part-skim Mozzarella with a low galactose content. Some varieties derived from skim mozzarella variants were designed not to require aging {{or the use of}} fermentation starter. Others can be produced through the direct <b>acidification</b> of milk, which may be used in place of bacterial fermentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{current rate}} of ocean {{chemistry}} change appears to be without precedent in Earth's geological history, making it unclear how well marine ecosystems {{will be able to}} adapt to the shifting conditions of the near future. Of particular concern is {{the manner in which the}} combination of <b>acidification</b> with the expected additional stressors of higher temperatures and lower oxygen levels will impact the seas.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on teleosts could be {{powerful}} but are complex. For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations of freshwater fish in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish. In the oceans, teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it is simply an extension of natural variation in climate. It is uncertain how ocean <b>acidification,</b> caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean <b>acidification,</b> pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species. One species—the North Atlantic right whale—is Endangered {{with only}} around 400(±50) {{individuals}} left, and four more are also classified as Endangered (North Pacific right whale, the blue whale, the fin whale, and the Sei whale), and another 5 ranked as Data deficient (Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, Omura's whale, Southern minke whale, and pygmy right whale). Species {{that live in}} polar habitats are vulnerable {{to the effects of}} ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice, as well as ocean <b>acidification.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs {{are under}} stress around the world. In particular, coral mining, {{agricultural}} and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), overfishing, blast fishing, disease, and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean <b>acidification,</b> all associated with greenhouse gas emissions. In 1998, 16% of the world's reefs {{died as a}} result of increased water temperature.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced <b>acidification,</b> and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} a threatened species in the Åland Islands of Finland. A study of the species' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s, it grew in beech woods with broad-leaved grasses and herbs in topsoils with soil pH levels between 5.0 and 6.6, but the populations have since decreased owing to soil <b>acidification</b> during the last several decades. Fruit bodies collected near arsenic-contaminated sites {{have been shown to}} bioaccumulate arsenic, largely in the form of arsenobetaine.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of an astatine compound with hydrogen– usually referred to as hydrogen astatide– was noted by the pioneers of astatine chemistry. As mentioned, there are grounds for instead referring to this compound as astatine hydride. It is easily oxidized; <b>acidification</b> by dilute nitric acid gives the At0 or At+ forms, and the subsequent addition of silver(I) may only partially, at best, precipitate astatine as silver(I) astatide (AgAt). Iodine, in contrast, is not oxidized, and precipitates readily as silver(I) iodide.|$|E
5|$|The meat, blubber, baleen, and oil of baleen whales have {{traditionally}} {{been used by the}} indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for these products, cetaceans are now protected by international law. However, the North Atlantic right whale is ranked critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, baleen whales also face threats from marine pollution and ocean <b>acidification.</b> It has been speculated that man-made sonar results in strandings. They have rarely been kept in captivity, and this has only been attempted with juveniles or members of one of the smallest species.|$|E
5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, {{especially in the}} peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as {{the main cause of}} dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil <b>acidification</b> and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} fire and/or nuclear winter effects, the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis {{by creating a}} dust cloud that blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year. Further, the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the stratosphere, which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic. The <b>acidification</b> of the oceans would kill many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7℃ for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). Some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival, however.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association {{was founded}} to promote {{conservation}} in the region. One of the association's initial concerns was the <b>acidification</b> of streams, which they originally attributed to tannic acid {{from the trees}} used by the beavers to construct their dams. With the assistance of Pennsylvania's Department of Forests and Waters, Game Commission, and Fish and Boat Commission, they dynamited 79 dams. Afterward, they discovered the water was acidic upstream of the dams too, and eventually realized that the problem was caused by acid rain, not the beavers. The association has operated several stations to reduce the acidity of Mosquito Creek and its tributaries, with technical assistance from the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State).|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} element {{for the formation}} of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. Calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean <b>acidification</b> is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{slightly}} alkaline {{and had a}} preindustrial pH of about 8.2. More recently, anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30–40% of the added CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming carbonic acid and lowering the pH (now below 8.1) through a process called ocean <b>acidification.</b> on the CaCO3 System in the Oceans| journal = Science| volume = 305| issue = 5682| pages = 362–6| year = 2004| last1 = Feely | first1 = R.

5|$|The {{life-cycle}} {{assessment of}} bismuth {{will focus on}} solders, {{one of the major}} uses of bismuth, and the one with the most complete information. The average primary energy use for solders is around 200 MJ per kg, with the high-bismuth solder (58% Bi) only 20% of that value, and three low-bismuth solders (2% to 5% Bi) running very close to the average. The global warming potential averaged 10 to 14kg carbon dioxide, with the high-bismuth solder about two-thirds of that and the low-bismuth solders about average. The <b>acidification</b> potential for the solders is around 0.9 to 1.1kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, with the high-bismuth solder and one low-bismuth solder only one-tenth of the average and the other low-bismuth solders about average.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{can have}} a {{detrimental}} {{impact on the environment}} which can be difficult to predict due to the large variety of environmental conditions that exist within the ash fall zone. Natural waterways can be impacted {{in the same way as}} urban water supply networks. Ash will increase water turbidity which can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. <b>Acidification</b> will also occur, which will reduce the pH of the water and impact the fauna and flora living in the environment. Fluoride contamination will occur if the ash contains high concentrations of fluoride.|$|E
5|$|West Creek is less {{affected}} by episodic <b>acidification</b> {{than most of}} the rest of the upper Fishing Creek watershed, with the exception of Coles Creek. The pH of West Creek is at its lowest in late winter and spring, when it is typically around 6.3. During the rest of the year, it is above 7.0. The entire pH range of the creek ranges from just over 6.0 to 7.2 or 7.3. The concentration of dissolved aluminum in West Creek is under 70 micrograms per liter, considerably less than the concentration needed to kill fish. The aluminum concentration is, in fact, usually approximately zero and is often under 40 micrograms per liter. However, early in 2011, the concentration was observed twice to be nearly 60 micrograms per liter.|$|E
5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to <b>acidification,</b> but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} study of water and Earth's water cycle is hydrology; hydrodynamics studies the physics of water in motion. The more recent study of the sea in particular is oceanography. This began as {{the study of the}} shape of the ocean's currents but has since expanded into a large and multidisciplinary field: it examines the properties of seawater; studies waves, tides, and currents; charts coastlines and maps the seabeds; and studies marine life. The subfield dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known as physical oceanography. Marine biology (biological oceanography) studies the plants, animals, and other organisms inhabiting marine ecosystems. Both are informed by chemical oceanography, which studies the behavior of elements and molecules within the oceans: particularly, at the moment, the ocean's role in the carbon cycle and carbon dioxide's role in the increasing <b>acidification</b> of seawater. Marine and maritime geography charts the shape and shaping of the sea, while marine geology (geological oceanography) has provided evidence of continental drift and the composition and structure of the Earth, clarified the process of sedimentation, and assisted the study of volcanism and earthquakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{threat of}} <b>acidification</b> {{includes}} {{a decline in}} commercial fisheries and in the Arctic tourism industry and economy. Commercial fisheries are threatened because <b>acidification</b> harms calcifying organisms which form {{the base of the}} Arctic food webs.|$|E
25|$|Ocean <b>acidification</b> is {{projected}} to continue (very high confidence).|$|E
25|$|Iron {{fertilization}} of {{the ocean}} could stimulate photosynthesis in phytoplankton (see Iron hypothesis). The phytoplankton would convert the ocean's dissolved carbon dioxide into carbohydrate and oxygen gas, some of which would sink into the deeper ocean before oxidizing. More than a dozen open-sea experiments confirmed that adding iron to the ocean increases photosynthesis in phytoplankton by up to 30 times. While this approach has been proposed as a potential solution to the ocean <b>acidification</b> problem, mitigation of surface ocean <b>acidification</b> might increase <b>acidification</b> in the less-inhabited deep ocean.|$|E
25|$|In warmer regions, where overripening is a concern, the {{opposite}} process of rehydration and <b>acidification</b> is used. This {{is used in}} jurisdictions such as areas of California, where if the must has excess sugar for normal fermentation, water may be added to lower the concentration. In <b>acidification,</b> tartaric acid {{is added to the}} must to compensate for the high levels of sugar and low levels of acid naturally found in ripe grapes.|$|E
25|$|Acid–base equilibria are {{important}} in a very wide range of applications, such as acid–base homeostasis, ocean <b>acidification,</b> pharmacology and analytical chemistry.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen-containing {{fertilizers}} {{can cause}} soil <b>acidification</b> when added. This {{may lead to}} decreases in nutrient availability which may be offset by liming.|$|E
25|$|Ocean <b>acidification</b> {{may force}} some organisms to {{reallocate}} resources away from productive endpoints such as growth {{in order to}} maintain calcification.|$|E
25|$|To help combat ocean <b>acidification,</b> some {{laws are}} in place to reduce {{greenhouse}} gases such as carbon dioxide. The Clean Water Act puts pressure on state government agencies to monitor and limit runoff of pollutants that can cause ocean <b>acidification.</b> Stormwater surge preventions are also in place, as well as coastal buffers between agricultural land and the coastline. This act also ensures that delicate watershed ecosystems are intact, such as wetlands. The Clean Water Act is funded by the federal government, and is monitored by various watershed groups. Many land use laws aim to reduce CO2 emissions by limiting deforestation. Deforestation causes erosion, which releases {{a large amount of}} carbon stored in the soil, which then flows into the ocean, contributing to ocean <b>acidification.</b> Incentives are used to reduce miles traveled by vehicles, which reduces the carbon emissions into the atmosphere, thereby reducing the amount of dissolved CO2 in the ocean. State and federal governments also control coastal erosion, which releases stored carbon in the soil into the ocean, increasing ocean <b>acidification.</b> High-end satellite technology is increasingly being employed to monitor coral reef conditions.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{conservation}} is the preventing of soil loss from erosion or reduced fertility caused by over usage, <b>acidification,</b> salinization or other chemical soil contamination.|$|E
25|$|Caldeira and Wickett (2003) {{placed the}} rate and {{magnitude}} of modern ocean <b>acidification</b> changes {{in the context of}} probable historical changes during the last 300million years.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{engineering}} (mitigating {{temperature or}} pH effects of emissions) {{has been proposed}} as a possible response to ocean <b>acidification.</b> The IAP (2009) statement cautioned against climate engineering as a policy response:Mitigation approaches such as adding chemicals to counter the effects of <b>acidification</b> {{are likely to be}} expensive, only partly effective and only at a very local scale, and may pose additional unanticipated risks to the marine environment. There has been very little research on the feasibility and impacts of these approaches. Substantial research is needed before these techniques could be applied.|$|E
25|$|The pH of Coles Creek is {{sometimes}} only slightly above 6.0. However, {{it is usually}} between 6.5 and 7.5. The creek does not experience severe episodic <b>acidification.</b>|$|E
25|$|Animal {{livestock}} {{is responsible}} for 64 percent of man-made ammonia emissions, which contribute significantly to acid rain. By extension, animal waste contributes to environmental pollution through nitrification and <b>acidification</b> of soil.|$|E
