500|$|The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Scott's performance, {{as well as}} how {{the writers}} have [...] "smartly underplayed" [...] the {{relationship}} between Leslie and Ben. Meslow also liked that the April-Andy subplot was now resolved, as he called it the [...] "weakest plotline of the season", but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] were a rehash of the previous episode. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott's performance, calling him a master at the straight man role, but said he was funnier the previous week in [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two": [...] "The laughs weren't as loud on [...] "Media Blitz," [...] as {{it was more of a}} squirm-inducing half hour of television." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN called it a fine episode that was [...] "dominated, in a good way, by its softer, sweeter moments", particularly the kiss between Andy and April, which he said [...] "was so damn sweet that I just couldn't resist it". Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview, Fowler said he did not find Scott's performance otherwise especially funny. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott's performance, adding, [...] "Did anyone else's heart melt just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> the proud smile that crept across Leslie’s face when Ben found his voice?" [...] Busis also said she was glad the April and Andy reconciled, as April's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it harder and harder to like her character. Busis criticized the Ann and Chris subplot, of which she said, [...] "Wake me up when something actually happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly Thompson of CBR gave issue #5 two-and-a-half stars writing, [...] "While {{the writing}} and {{character}} work is coming together nicely, [...] "Fearless Defenders" [...] #5 still has serious art problems {{to work out}} before this book {{can be considered a}} contender." [...] Lima gave it three stars writing, [...] "Although the appearance of so many characters in one book reads awkwardly, some of the dialogue was clever and funny and that at least redeemed the contents of this issue <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>at</b> least for me." [...] Grey gave issue it an 8.5 writing, [...] "If you're looking for a book that's unabashedly fun and you're not reading this series... look at your life. Look at your choices." ...|$|E

6000|$|In {{those last}} weeks, {{though we did}} not know it, my sister was dying on her feet. For many years she had been giving her life, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> a time, for another year, another month, latterly for another day, of her mother, and now she was worn out. ‘I’ll never leave you, mother.’—‘Fine I know you’ll never leave me.’ I thought that cry so pathetic at the time, but I was not to know its full {{significance}} until it was only the echo of a cry. Looking at these two then it was to me as if my mother had set out for the new country, and my sister held her back. But I see with a clearer vision now. It is no longer the mother but the daughter who is in front, and she cries, ‘Mother, you are lingering so long at the end, I have ill waiting for you.’ ...|$|E

50|$|After the {{building}} of Astoria Palace, the last place on the square where a structure can be placed is the trolleybus stop next to Tatracentrum, more specifically its extension over the pedestrian underpass mouth towards Poštová Street.

5000|$|... "Where I'm Going" [...] {{served as}} the first taste of the album. Peter Gaston of Spin opined that the song [...] "veers into a more conventional-sounding, guitar-bass-drums {{combination}} and seemed to indicate {{a departure from the}} sleek, electronic-laced sound of In Ghost Colours."
