5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical cyclone, local National Weather Service offices issued flood watches for portions of South Carolina, much of eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and southeastern Maryland. Later, flood <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flood watches were issued for southeast Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, northern New Jersey, east-central New York, and southern New England. Wind and lake wind advisories were posted {{in parts of}} Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Extensive damage {{occurred}} in Haiti {{due to high}} winds <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flooding. Total costs for that country were estimated to be at more than $400million (1980 USD). Roughly 60% of the nation's coffee crop was destroyed. In all, 220people were killed and 835,000 were left homeless. In Port-au-Prince, 41 deaths were caused by tin roofs flying off and around 1200 were made homeless by flooding. Another 140 people were reported dead from flooding.|$|E
5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years ago. The added precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> floods in summer). With a greatly increased flow volume the Colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate the Grand Canyon 2million years before present, almost reaching the modern depth by 1.2million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The rainbands of Alberto {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flooding across western Cuba. The rainfall peaked at 39.84inches (1012mm), the fourth highest rainfall total {{in the country}} since 1963. More than 50,000 were forced to evacuate from the resulting floods, which were described as the worst flooding in the northwestern portion of the country since 1950.|$|E

5|$|The storm brought {{tropical}} storm force winds and precipitation to the southwestern Mexican coastline. Later, Emilia produced similar {{conditions in the}} southern portion of the Baja California peninsula, where its passage caused minor damage and flooding. Moisture from Emilia reached the southwestern United States, producing thunderstorms <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flooding in Arizona, as well as beneficial rainfall in southern California. No deaths were reported in association with Emilia.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{initiating}} advisories on Hattie, the Miami Weather Bureau {{noted the}} potential for heavy rainfall <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flooding in the southwestern Caribbean. The advisories recommended for small ships to remain at harbor across the region. Initially, the hurricane was predicted to move near or through the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and Cuba. As a result, Cuban officials advised residents in low-lying areas to evacuate.|$|E

A year later, the team reunited in the Nashville, Tennessee-based Music City Wrestling, where they won the MCW North American Tag Team Championship on May 30, 1998.

5|$|Heavy rains caused {{landslides}} <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flooding {{that was}} responsible for extensive crop and property damage across Japan. The typhoon contributed to the worst flooding in Hokkaido in ten years. Overall, 33people were killed and 51others were injured, including 36seriously. Fifty-six trains and seventy-five flights were cancelled; ferry services were also disrupted by the storm. Greater than 100landslides occurred while over 40bridges were inundated. A total of 48,832houses sustained flooded and 3,000dwellings were damaged. Moreover, 177houses were destroyed, resulting in almost 2,800homeless families. Twenty-eight ships, as well as 80,033ha (197,770acres) of farmland, suffered damage. Nationwide, the typhoon inflicted 34billion yen ($114million USD) worth of damage.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains caused {{landslides}} <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flooding, {{which were}} responsible for extensive crop and property damage. Throughout the island of Shikoku, 14people were killed. In Mishima, two landslides claimed {{a total of four}} lives. Another landslide in Tsukude killed a 53-year old man, a 78-year old women, and a 14-year old girl. Hokkaido suffered the most severe flooding in 10years. Several major rivers on the island overflowed their banks, leaving towns inundated and isolated. Around 1,200residents in Tsukigata were evacuated after a nearby river overflowed its banks.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from Freeport, Texas to the United States/Mexico border; at the same time, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch southward to Rio San Fernando. Shortly before attaining tropical storm status, the watch in Texas was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. Late on August 15, the warning was extended to San Luis Pass, while the watch in Mexico was discontinued. As Erin made landfall, the warning was canceled, and several flood watches and warnings were issued for counties across southeastern Texas. Upon moving into Oklahoma, flood <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flood warnings were issued for several counties.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm spotters to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|E
5|$|Many cephalopods, {{including}} at least 70 genera of squid, are bioluminescent. Some squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical mixtures or bacterial slurries {{in the same way}} as many squid use ink. A cloud of luminescent material is expelled, distracting or repelling a potential predator, while the animal escapes to safety. The deep sea squid Octopoteuthis deletron may autotomise portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch <b>and</b> <b>flash,</b> thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.|$|E
5|$|On August31 {{before the}} storm's arrival, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine {{declared}} a state of emergency, putting the Virginia National Guard and state agencies on alert and opening the state's new Emergency Operations Center in suburban Richmond. North Carolina Governor Mike Easley activated 200 National Guard troops and had other emergency teams on standby. Washington D.C. and parts of Maryland and Delaware were put on a Coastal Flood Watch <b>and</b> <b>Flash</b> Flood Watch by the National Weather Service in preparation for Ernesto.|$|E

5|$|On June2, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center {{anticipated}} Agatha {{to make landfall}} in Mexico near hurricane strength. In {{light of}} this, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were issued for the Pacific coast of Mexico between Tenexpa to Cabo Corrites around 2100UTC that day. Additionally, heavy rains from the system prompted concerns over mudslides <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> floods. Following Agatha's turn towards the west early on June3, the watches and warnings were discontinued. Roughly 1,500 people evacuated from coastal areas of MichoacÃ¡n due {{to the threat of}} damaging winds and flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Lidia, in {{combination of a}} cold front, prompted a tornado watch <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flood watch for much of Texas. In Texas, six tornadoes were reported, {{with one of them}} causing over $8million (1993 USD) in damage. The Dallas-Fort Worth area was hit hard. Strong winds, tornadoes and torrential downpours left broken trees, damaged buildings, and minor injuries {{in the wake of the}} storm. Johnson, Denton, Collin, Tarrant, and Dallas counties were the hardest hit. In northern Arlington, five people were injured when a roof was torn off of a hotel.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} and develop in any {{geographic}} location but most frequently within the mid-latitude, where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes. Thunderstorms {{are responsible for}} the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena. Thunderstorms, and the phenomena that occur along with them, pose great hazards. Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds, large hailstones, <b>and</b> <b>flash</b> flooding caused by heavy precipitation. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts.|$|E
