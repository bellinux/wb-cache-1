5|$|However, {{he still}} {{preferred}} <b>Arabic</b> authors more than Persian ones. There {{is very little}} evidence which shows his interest in Persian poetry. He spoke <b>Arabic,</b> wrote in <b>Arabic</b> and was {{proud to be a}} student of a famous Arab grammarian. He studied science in <b>Arabic,</b> including astronomy and mathematics. Many books written in <b>Arabic</b> were dedicated to him whether religious or secular content. Apparently showing interest in <b>Arabic</b> rather than Persian, Adud al-Dawla followed the mainstream of intellectual life in a provincial town where culture was dominated by <b>Arabic</b> and Persian.|$|E
5|$|The three-languages {{wayfinding}} {{system for}} the Louvre Abu Dhabi was designed by Philippe Apeloig, and is implemented in both <b>Arabic</b> and Roman script. Frutiger LT typeface has been chosen for the Roman texts for its perfect readability for signage; while Lebanese typographer Kristyan Sarkis created an <b>Arabic</b> bespoked typeface, the LAD <b>Arabic,</b> based on the classic Naskh style and his Colvert <b>Arabic</b> font.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{official}} {{languages are}} <b>Arabic</b> and French, but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken. Due to {{the important role}} played by itinerant Arab traders and settled merchants in local communities, Chadian <b>Arabic</b> has become a lingua franca. Chad submitted an application to join the Arab League as a member state on 25 March 2014, which is still pending.|$|E

5|$|Haifa is {{the center}} of liberal <b>Arabic</b> {{speaking}} culture, as it was under British colonial rule. The <b>Arabic</b> speaking neighborhoods, which are mixed Muslim and Christian, are in the lowlands near the sea while Jewish neighborhoods are at higher elevation.

5|$|In 1880, Hartwig Derenbourg was {{the first}} to {{discover}} the Kitab al-I'tibar, which survived in only one manuscript, in the possession of the Escorial Monastery near Madrid. Derenbourg was also the first to produce an <b>Arabic</b> edition (1886), a biography of Usama (1889), and a French translation (1895). In 1930, Hitti produced an improved <b>Arabic</b> edition, and an English translation. Qasim as-Samarrai produced another <b>Arabic</b> edition in 1987.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} mediaeval {{medicine}} started roughly {{around the year}} 1000 with the {{school of medicine in}} Salerno, which combined elements of Latin, Greek, <b>Arabic</b> and Jewish medicine. Galen and Dioscorides (who had used the Graeco-Roman weight system) were among the most important authorities, but also <b>Arabic</b> physicians, whose works were systematically translated into Latin.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrument}} is equally famous in Turkey, especially the lower-pitched clarinet in G.

5|$|The {{official}} language is Modern Standard <b>Arabic,</b> a literary language {{taught in the}} schools. Most Jordanians natively speak one of the non-standard <b>Arabic</b> dialects known as Jordanian <b>Arabic.</b> Jordanian Sign Language {{is the language of}} the deaf community. English, though without official status, is widely spoken throughout the country and is the de facto language of commerce and banking, as well as a co-official status in the education sector; almost all university-level classes are held in English and almost all public schools teach English along with Standard <b>Arabic.</b> Chechen, Circassian, Armenian, Tagalog, and Russian are popular among their communities. French is offered as an elective in many schools, mainly in the private sector. German is an increasingly popular language; it has been introduced at a larger scale since the establishment of the German-Jordanian University in 2005.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{relatively}} intense language contact, Central Atlas Tamazight has a large stratum of <b>Arabic</b> loans. Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter used more in rural areas. The contact was unequal, as Moroccan <b>Arabic</b> has not borrowed as much from Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and Algerian Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E
5|$|Coffeehouses (called al-maqhah in <b>Arabic)</b> {{serve hot}} {{beverages}} and {{soft drinks and}} are usually restricted to male customers—who take part in leisurely activities like playing cards or backgammon and smoking argileh (<b>Arabic</b> for hookah). Sweet shops or mahal al hilaweyat, {{can be found in}} the souks of cities and major towns, they offer a wide range of sweets common with Palestinians, such as, kanafeh, baklawa and anise-flavored cookies. Family-run shops often serve at least one type of sweet that they themselves created. The city of Nablus in particular are world famous for their exquisite <b>Arabic</b> sweets, and have some of the oldest sweet shops in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|In many languages, {{including}} modern European {{languages and}} <b>Arabic,</b> poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. However, {{the use of}} structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme. Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part {{under the influence of}} the <b>Arabic</b> language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). <b>Arabic</b> language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary <b>Arabic</b> in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the chant royal or the rubaiyat, while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.|$|E

Aramaic civilization and its peoples were gradually absorbed by the Arabs with <b>Arabic</b> dialects in Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq in particular exhibiting the influence of Aramaic.|$|E

25|$|Urdu {{uses the}} same subset of {{diacritics}} used in <b>Arabic</b> based on Persian conventions. Urdu also uses Persian names of the diacritics instead of <b>Arabic</b> names. Commonly used diacritics are Zabar (<b>Arabic</b> Fatḥah), Zer (<b>Arabic</b> Kasrah), Pesh (<b>Arabic</b> Ḍammah) which are used to clarify the pronunciation of vowels. Jazam (<b>Arabic</b> Sukun) is used to indicate a Consonant Cluster and Shad (<b>Arabic</b> Tashdid) {{which is used to}} indicate a Gemination. Other diacritics include Khari Zabar (<b>Arabic</b> Dagger alif), Do Zabar (<b>Arabic</b> Fathatan) which are found in some common <b>Arabic</b> loan words. Other <b>Arabic</b> diacritics are also sometimes used though very rarely in loan words from <b>Arabic.</b> Zer-e-Izafat and Hamza-e-Izafat are described in next section.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} use of <b>Arabic</b> script for Tunisian was {{recorded}} in the 17th century, when Sheykh Karray wrote several poems in Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> for mystic purposes. However, transcription of Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> was not common until 1903, when the Gospel of John was transcribed in Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> using <b>Arabic</b> script. After the World War I, the use of <b>Arabic</b> script to Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> became very common with the works of Taht Essour. Nowadays, {{it has become the}} main script used for Tunisian <b>Arabic,</b> even in published books, but writing conventions for Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> are not standardized and can change from one book to another.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of numerals used along with <b>Arabic</b> text; Western <b>Arabic</b> numerals and Eastern <b>Arabic</b> numerals.

25|$|Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> {{has a very}} {{different}} syllable structure from Standard <b>Arabic</b> like all other North African varieties. While Standard <b>Arabic</b> can have only one consonant {{at the beginning of}} a syllable, after which a vowel must follow, Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> commonly has two consonants in the onset. For example, Standard <b>Arabic</b> book is كتاب , while in Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> it is ktāb.|$|E
25|$|As for {{novels and}} short stories, most authors who fluently know Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> prefer {{to write in}} Standard <b>Arabic</b> or in French. But since the {{initiative}} of the Taht Essour and particularly Ali Douagi to use Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> in transcribing dialogues in novels and writing some newspapers, the dialogues in the Standard <b>Arabic</b> Tunisian novels or romans became written in Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> using the <b>Arabic</b> script.|$|E
