5|$|Anaesthesia: <b>Anaesthesia</b> is {{supplied}} by some piercers, {{particularly in the}} United Kingdom and Europe. The <b>anaesthesia</b> may be topical or injected. Piercers and other non-medical personnel are not legally permitted to administer anaesthetics in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{ventilation}} {{has been}} traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or sevoflurane) however {{it can also}} be performed using intravenous <b>anaesthesia</b> (e.g. propofol, ketamine or dexmedetomidine). SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous <b>anaesthesia</b> and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of <b>anaesthesia.</b> It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|Less {{commonly}} used tests might include trans-illumination (to detect congestion of the maxillary sinus or to highlight {{a crack in}} a tooth), dyes (to help visualize a crack), a test cavity, selective <b>anaesthesia</b> and laser doppler flowmetry.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} are generally {{performed by a}} traditional circumciser (cutter or exciseuse) in the girls' homes, with or without <b>anaesthesia.</b> The cutter is usually an older woman, but in communities where the male barber has {{assumed the role of}} health worker he will perform FGM too.|$|E
5|$|A self-expanding metal stent is {{permanently}} deployed {{within the}} dominant transverse sinus across the stenosis under general <b>anaesthesia.</b> In general patients are discharged the next day. Patients require double antiplatelet therapy {{for a period}} of up to 3 months after the procedure and aspirin therapy for up to 1 year.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Clumbers {{often have}} {{difficulties}} conceiving and giving birth, and may require caesarian sections. Some dogs may suffer from sensitivity to <b>anaesthesia.</b> The most common severe health {{conditions in the}} Clumber Spaniel are entropion/ectropion eye conditions, spinal disc herniation and hip dysplasia. They have a median lifespan of around 10 years.|$|E
5|$|While {{stationed}} at the River Valley Road prisoner of war hospital in Singapore in 1945, with the supplies of chemical anæsthetics severely restricted by the Japanese, Woodruff and a medical/dental colleague from the Royal Netherlands Forces successfully used hypnotism as the sole means of <b>anæsthesia</b> {{for a wide range}} of dental and surgical procedures.|$|E
5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much <b>anaesthesia,</b> which is why the dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of <b>anaesthesia</b> or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{stipulated that}} {{researchers}} {{could not be}} prosecuted for cruelty, but that the animal must be anaesthetized, unless the <b>anaesthesia</b> would interfere with {{the point of the}} experiment. Each animal could be used only once, although several procedures regarded as part of the same experiment were permitted. The animal had to be killed when the study was over, unless doing so would frustrate the object of the experiment. Prosecutions could take place only with the approval of the Home Secretary. At the time of the Brown Dog affair this was Aretas Akers-Douglas, who was unsympathetic to the anti-vivisectionist cause.|$|E
5|$|There was {{significant}} opposition to vivisection in England, {{in both houses}} of parliament, during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837–1901); the Queen herself strongly opposed it. The term vivisection referred to the dissection of living animals, with and without <b>anaesthesia,</b> often in front of audiences of medical students. In 1875 there were around 300 experiments on animals in the UK, a figure that had risen to 19,084 in 1903 when the brown dog was vivisected, and 4.11 million in 2012, 4,643 of them on dogs.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in <b>anaesthesia</b> and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires <b>anaesthesia</b> and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{among those with}} non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic care or spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) it is unclear if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending spinal manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended spinal manipulation based on low quality evidence. Manipulation under <b>anaesthesia,</b> or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, anaesthetists are {{physicians}} who have specialized {{in the medical}} field of <b>anaesthesia.</b> Anaesthetists in the Netherlands must complete medical school training, which takes six years. After successfully completing medical school training, they start a five-year residency training in <b>anaesthesia.</b> In their fifth year they can choose to spend the year doing research, or to specialize in a certain area, including regular <b>anaesthesia,</b> critical care medicine, pain and palliative medicine, paediatric <b>anaesthesia,</b> cardiothoracic <b>anaesthesia,</b> neuro-anaesthesia or obstetric <b>anaesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both {{general and}} {{regional}} <b>anaesthesia</b> (spinal, epidural or combined spinal and epidural <b>anaesthesia)</b> are acceptable for use during Caesarean section. Evidence {{does not show}} a difference between regional <b>anaesthesia</b> and general <b>anaesthesia</b> with respect to major outcomes in the mother or baby. Regional <b>anaesthesia</b> may be preferred as it allows the mother to be awake and interact immediately with her baby. Other advantages of regional anesthesia may include the absence of typical risks of general anesthesia: pulmonary aspiration (which has a relatively high incidence in patients undergoing anesthesia in late pregnancy) of gastric contents and esophageal intubation. However, one trial found no difference in satisfaction when general <b>anaesthesia</b> was compared with either spinal <b>anaesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Trainees {{wishing to}} hold dual {{accreditation}} in <b>anaesthesia</b> and {{intensive care medicine}} may enter <b>anaesthesia</b> training via the Acute Care Common Stem (ACCS) program which lasts three years and consists of experience in <b>anaesthesia,</b> emergency medicine, acute medicine and intensive care. Trainees in <b>anaesthesia</b> are called Specialty Registrars (StR) or Specialist Registrars (SpR). The Certificate of Completion of Training(CCT) in <b>anaesthesia</b> {{is divided into three}} levels: Basic, intermediate and advanced. During this time, physicians learn <b>anaesthesia</b> as applicable to all surgical specialties. The curriculum focuses on a modular format, with trainees primarily working in one special area during one module, for example: cardiac <b>anaesthesia,</b> neuro-anaesthesia, ENT, maxillofacial, pain medicine, intensive care, and trauma. Traditionally (before the advent of the foundation program), trainees entered <b>anaesthesia</b> from other specialties, such as medicine or accidents and emergencies. Specialist training takes at least seven years. On completion of specialist training, physicians are awarded CCT and are eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist register and are also able to work as consultant anaesthetist. A new consultant in anaesthetics must have completed a minimum of 14 years of training (including: five to six years of medical school training, two years of foundation training, and seven years of <b>anaesthesia</b> training).|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} {{techniques}} commonly used in castrating a horse, one requiring only local <b>anaesthesia</b> and the other requiring general <b>anaesthesia.</b> Each technique has advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
25|$|Central, or neuraxial, {{blockade}} {{administers the}} anesthetic {{in the region}} of the central nervous system itself, suppressing incoming sensation from outside the area of the block. Examples include epidural <b>anaesthesia</b> and spinal <b>anaesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Regional <b>anaesthesia</b> {{is used in}} 95% of deliveries, with spinal and {{combined}} spinal and epidural <b>anaesthesia</b> being {{the most commonly used}} regional techniques in scheduled Caesarean section. Regional <b>anaesthesia</b> during Caesarean section is different from the analgesia (pain relief) used in labor and vaginal delivery. The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense nerve block.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl is {{sometimes}} given intrathecally {{as part of}} spinal <b>anaesthesia</b> or epidurally for epidural <b>anaesthesia</b> and analgesia. Because of fentanyl's high lipid solubility, its effects are more localized than morphine, and some clinicians prefer to use morphine to get a wider spread of analgesia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} written examination, {{there are many}} {{questions}} of clinical scenarios (including interpretation of radiological exams, EKGs and other special investigations). There are also two cases of real patients with complex medical conditions - for clinical examination and a following discussion. The course has a program of 12 modules such as obstetric <b>anaesthesia,</b> pediatric <b>anaesthesia,</b> cardiothoracic and vascular <b>anaesthesia,</b> neurosurgical <b>anaesthesia</b> and pain management. Trainees also have to complete an advanced project, such as a research publication or paper. They also undergo an EMAC (Effective Management of Anaesthetic Crises) or EMST (Early Management of Severe Trauma) course. On completion of training, the trainees are awarded the Diploma of Fellowship and are entitled to use the qualification of FANZCA – Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists.|$|E
25|$|Anaesthetists or anesthesiologists are {{medical doctors}} who specialise in pain relief {{and the use}} of drugs to {{facilitate}} surgery and other painful procedures. They may contribute to the care of a woman in labour by performing epidurals or by providing <b>anaesthesia</b> (often spinal <b>anaesthesia)</b> for Cesarean section or forceps delivery.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficacy}} {{profile of}} lidocaine {{as a local}} anaesthetic {{is characterized by a}} rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface <b>anaesthesia.</b> Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of <b>anaesthesia.</b> For surface <b>anaesthesia,</b> several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes local numbing less painful. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures.|$|E
25|$|A male white tiger named Cheytan, {{a son of}} Bhim and Sumita born at the Cincinnati Zoo, died at the San Antonio Zoo in 1992 from <b>anaesthesia</b> {{complications}} during {{root canal}} therapy. It appears that white tigers also react strangely to <b>anaesthesia.</b> The best drug for immobilizing a tiger is CI 744, but a few tigers, white ones in particular, undergo a re-sedation effect 24–36 hours later. This is due to their inability to produce normal tyrosinase, a trait they share with albinos, according to zoo veterinarian David Taylor. He treated a pair of white tigers from the Cincinnati Zoo at Fritz Wurm's safari park in Stukenbrock, Germany, for salmonella poisoning, which reacted strangely to the <b>anaesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{fentanyl}} {{is often}} used for <b>anaesthesia</b> and analgesia. During <b>anaesthesia</b> it {{is often used}} along with a hypnotic agent like propofol. It is also administered in combination with a benzodiazepine, such as midazolam, to produce sedation for procedures such as endoscopy, cardiac catheterization, and oral surgery, or in emergency rooms. It is often used {{in the management of}} chronic pain including cancer pain.|$|E
25|$|Clover was {{probably}} present at Robert Liston's first operation under ether <b>anaesthesia</b> at University College Hospital in December 1846.|$|E
25|$|Nitrous oxide is a weak general anaesthetic, {{and so is}} {{generally}} not used alone in general <b>anaesthesia,</b> but used as a carrier gas (mixed with oxygen) for more powerful general anaesthetic drugs such as sevoflurane or desflurane. It has a minimum alveolar concentration of 105% and a blood/gas partition coefficient of 0.46. The use of nitrous oxide in <b>anaesthesia,</b> however, can {{increase the risk of}} postoperative nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{medications}} given before, during, {{and after}} a surgery, a patient may sometimes not remember interactions with the anaesthetist, nurse anaesthetist, or <b>anaesthesia</b> assistant involved in his <b>anaesthesia</b> care. The anaesthetic plan, as well as alternatives, risks, and benefits of the chosen anaesthetic techniques, should be discussed with the patient prior to the surgery. This can be difficult or impossible in some situations, such as with unconscious patients, confused patients, or extremely urgent cases.|$|E
25|$|In Argentina, anaesthetists are {{physicians}} who have specialized {{in the medical}} field of <b>anaesthesia.</b> Residency program is 5 years long.|$|E

25|$|Provide pain relief, {{either by}} nitrous oxide, opiates, or by {{epidural}} <b>anaesthesia</b> done by anaesthestists, an anaesthesiologist, or a nurse anaesthetist.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with fellow}} pioneer of <b>anaesthesia</b> Joseph Thomas Clover, Snow {{is one of}} the heraldic {{supporters}} of the Royal College of Anaesthetists.|$|E
25|$|Labial {{reduction}} can {{be performed}} under local <b>anaesthesia,</b> conscious sedation, or general <b>anaesthesia,</b> either as a discrete, single surgery, or in conjunction with another, gynecologic or cosmetic, surgery procedure. The resection proper is facilitated with the administration of an anaesthetic solution (lidocaine + epinephrine in saline solution) that is infiltrated to the labia minora to achieve the tumescence (swelling) of the tissues and the constriction of the pertinent labial circulatory system, the hemostasis that limits bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Regional <b>anaesthesia</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in women}} on therapeutic anticoagulation, {{and should not}} be used within 24 hours of the last dose of tinzaparin.|$|E
25|$|One {{combination}} {{product of}} this type is used topically for surface <b>anaesthesia,</b> TAC (5-12% tetracaine,1/2000 (0.05%, 500 ppm, ½ per mille) adrenaline, 4 or 10% cocaine).|$|E
