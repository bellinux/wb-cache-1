That is why the problem that arises more frequently is the harmonization of national legislation with the European legislation.

This study investigates whether {{financial statement}} information in Denmark has become less value-relevant to investors over time. The study provides evidence from an accounting system {{which is based on}} both EU <b>accounting</b> <b>directives</b> and an "economic-substance-over-legal-form" philosophy throughout the investigated period. Overall, our results do not indicate that the value-relevance of accounting information has decreased over the investigated period (1983 - 2001), which is otherwise implied by some critics of "traditional" financial reporting. Rather, the results indicate that the value-relevance of accounting information is unchanged over the period.

40|$|In 2009 the European Commission {{launched}} the public consultation on {{the review of}} the <b>Accounting</b> <b>Directives</b> as part of the project to modernise and simplify EU accounting rules, which led to the new European <b>Accounting</b> <b>Directive</b> in 2013. This process offers a unique research opportunity to explore the under researched – but extremely relevant – EU accounting standard-setting process, in order to understand constituents’ different orientations on key topics in reporting regulation and the role played by the users’ primacy principle in shaping the new Directive. Results show significant differences in respondents’ views on the choice between mandatory requirements and voluntary disclosure and on differential reporting. Constituents from different geographical contexts do not share the same view on either topic, while users, the accounting profession and preparers express different orientations with regard to mandatory reporting and voluntary disclosure. In the light of these results, the new Directive seems to be inspired by the users’ primacy principle for issues connected to mandatory reporting and voluntary disclosure, in contrast with preparers’ expectations.

Directive 2009 / 49 /EC is not affecting all sizes of private limited liability companies within the European Union, since {{the most important reason}} for implementing it is to give SMEs less administrative burden by lower requirements regarding the information presented in notes attached to the reports. The implementation of Directive 2009 / 49 EC is a positive change since it is in line with the idea of an Internal Market with equal rights and obligations to all sized of limited liability companies, private or public. The lower obligations in the annual reports in the Fourth Directive are for SMEs to the better because of the less administrative burden and the loss of information for interested is not more important, but of course, for some it is crucial. Amending the Seventh Directive may have larger effect to some companies, most likely medium-sized SMEs, since the obligation to draw consolidated accounts will for some companies not be necessary...|$|R
