5|$|Cambridge {{elected to}} bat and wickets fell regularly. No player made over 33 and the hosts {{were out in}} the second session of the first day for 167. Miller was {{prominent}} with the ball and in the field, taking 5/46 and two catches for his fellow bowlers. In reply, Australia were already 184/1 at stumps, with Brown heading for a consecutive century. He put on 176 for the second wicket with Hamence, who made 92. Brown reached 200 <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> immediately thereafter, prompting stand-in skipper Hassett to declare midway through the second day at 414/4, having reached 61 not out himself. In their second innings Cambridge failed to cope with the leg-spin of McCool, who took 7/78 as the match ended early on the third morning. Attendance over the three days was nearly 25,000.|$|E

5|$|Further showers breathed extra {{life into}} the pitch, and Lindwall and Johnston {{extracted}} steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Hutton was dropped before he had scored and played and missed multiple times. Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42, before Hutton edged Lindwall <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for 13. Toshack removed Edrich and Washbrook in quick succession to leave England at 65/3. However, Compton and Dollery added 41 to have England close at 106/3.|$|E
5|$|Further showers breathed extra {{life into}} the pitch, and Lindwall and Johnston {{extracted}} steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Miller dropped Hutton from Lindwall's bowling before he had scored and played and missed multiple times. Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42, England's highest opening partnership of the series thus far, before Hutton edged Lindwall to Johnson <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls, before Toshack removed both in quick succession to leave England at 65/3. However, Compton and Dollery added 41 in the last 30 minutes to have England close at 106/3.|$|E
5|$|Hutton and Washbrook {{took the}} score to 42England's highest opening {{partnership}} of the seriesbefore the former edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for 13. Soon after, Edrich edged to Johnson low {{down in the}} cordon and England were 2/52. Edrich decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken, thinking he may have hit a bump ball into the ground, but the umpire thought otherwise and ruled him out. Johnson had little else to do as the pacemen made steady progress on a seaming pitch. He bowled only two overs for three runs as England fell for 186, handing Australia victory by 409 runs and a 20 series lead.|$|E

Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. However, they survived Lindwall's spell of bowling. Late in the day, Lindwall was brought back {{to put pressure on}} Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance.|$|E

5|$|Miller's love of horseracing then {{interfered}} with his quest. Wanting {{to attend an}} afternoon race meeting, he opened the batting in the morning against Cambridge University. Not intending to play a long innings, he attacked the bowling <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for 20, before heading for the track. He stayed at the track until late afternoon, and returned to find the Australians walking out to field. This {{was followed by a}} match against the MCC at Lord's where he took four wickets of English Test players. Miller then took match figures of 5/27 against Oxford University. In the match against Essex, Miller pulled rib muscles, meaning he could not bowl in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He scored 55 and five in a rain-affected draw.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August Dainty sighted a {{large ship}} heading {{directly}} towards them {{and as it}} drew nearer, its enormous size became apparent. The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of the battle for five hours.|$|E

On June 29, newcomer Turk McBride suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for the season; McBride would be released two days later. During the day, Jermon Bushrod suffered a mild calf sprain, and was replaced by Jonathan Scott during practices. On the same day, Cheta Ozougwu did not practice due to a hamstring strain. However, Scott eventually injured his calf, so Eben Britton and Cory Brandon took first team reps. Anderson (knee), D. J. Williams (calf) and Corey Wootton (hip) also were forced to miss practice.|$|E

5|$|The Oval is a {{football}} stadium in Belfast, Northern Ireland, {{which has been}} home to Glentoran F.C. since 1892. The Oval was bombed during the Belfast blitz of World War II, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of use until 1949 when it was rebuilt by the club along with supporters, who had jointly formed the 'Back to the Oval' committee. During their exile, the club played games at the ground of fellow Belfast club, Distillery - Grosvenor Park. It had a new stand built in 2000 but requires consistent maintenance to fulfill health and safety requirements and its capacity is currently restricted to 6,050. The Oval has occasionally hosted {{the final of the}} Irish Cup as well as hosting the final of the County Antrim Shield and the Setanta Cup.|$|E

Due to its location {{in the middle of}} Jamaica Bay, the station was filled with debris, with its trackbed damaged. During its temporary closure, the station received new ADA-tactile strips, platform edge rubbing boards, and cosmetic and mechanical work. Service was restored to the station on May 30, 2013, and to celebrate the re-opening, a vintage R1 subway car formed the first train.|$|E
5|$|After the 1944 season ended, Blake {{enlisted in}} the Army and fought with the 40th Infantry Division in the Pacific Theater of Operations. While in the Philippines, Blake was wounded, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of action for nine months as he recovered. As the 1946 season began, he rejoined the Cardinals, now fully recovered, and spent the season with the Columbus Cardinals. Blake started the season losing his first three starts, but then won 13 {{straight}} and finished {{the season with a}} 16 wins, eight losses, and a 3.51 earned run average. In February 1947, Blake was among a group of 92 Cardinals players invited to a dinner for Cardinals minor leaguers, where accusations in regards to Cardinals players being paid poorly were brought up and discussed. He spent the following season playing for both Columbus teams, playing 29 games in total and finishing the season with a combined 4.46 ERA. Before the 1948 season began, Blake was promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He had a 7–6 record and a 3.88 ERA in 34 games, seven of them starts. In 1949, Blake spent most of the season playing for Rochester. On August 9, 1949 he was traded by the Cardinals to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Mike Schultz, ending his career with the Cardinals. Blake finished the season with the Syracuse Chiefs and finished the season with a combined 5–4 record and a 4.78 ERA.|$|E

Mervagain captaining the sidemade a duck <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> before Ray came in, in Victoria's only innings of the match and was not {{selected}} {{for the remainder of}} the season. After this, Ray and Neil played together for Victoria on two occasions in the second half of the season when the latter did not have a match for Australia. In the first match, against New South Wales, the two batted in partnership for the first time for their state. Ray came in at 5/53 to join Neil and he fell for 9 to leave the score at 6/64 as Victoria collapsed to be all out for 130. In the second innings, Ray joined Neil with the score at 5/266 and the latter fell at 6/292, ending a 26-run partnership. The pair did not bat together in the second match against South Australia as Neil was out before Ray came in on both occasions. The 1947-48 was the most productive for the Harveys as a combination for Victoria until Ray played a full season in 1953-54 together with Neil.|$|E
5|$|After two injury plagued {{seasons with}} the Red Wings, Samuelsson agreed to a one-year {{contract}} with Djurgårdens IF of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) on July 29, 2014. Samuelsson's season in Djurgården began with the premiere season of the Champions Hockey League. In the three group stage games he participated in, Samuelsson scored two goals and three points. He scored his first goal for Djurgården in the sixth round of the SHL regular season, a 4–5 loss against Örebro HK. He then injured his knee on October 16 <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of play until October 28. Samuelsson was again out of the lineup between January 10 and February 19 due to a groin injury, missing 11 games. At {{the end of the}} SHL regular season, Samuelsson had scored 13 goals and 26 points in 37 games. He announced his retirement from professional hockey on March 26, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{broke his}} nose at Craven Cottage on {{the opening day of}} the 1962–63 season, in a 2–1 defeat by Fulham. Leicester went to chase a {{possible}} double, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals whilst lying top of the table in April. City beat Liverpool 1–0 at Hillsborough to reach the final, with Banks keeping a clean sheet despite his goal being under a near-constant siege from the Merseyside club. The News of the World reported that Liverpool had had 34 attempts on goal to Leicester's one, and Banks later stated that it was his finest performance at club level. Unluckily, Banks then broke a finger in a 2–1 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> injured as Leicester lost their final three league games, ending the season in a disappointing fourth place. In the 1963 FA Cup Final Banks {{and the rest of the}} team underperformed, and lost the game 3–1 to Manchester United.|$|E
