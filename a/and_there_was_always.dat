5|$|When {{a member}} of the family died there were varying degrees of prostration and display of piety amongst family members, each one {{behaving}} differently according to the custom of kinship association with the deceased. There was to be no flashy or colorful attire while in the period of mourning, and proper funerary rituals were observed such as cleansing and clothing the deceased to rid him or her of impurities. This was one of the necessary steps in the observance of the deceased as one of the worshipped ancestors, which in turn raised the prestige of the family. Funerals were often expensive. A geomancer had to be consulted on where to bury the dead, caterers were hired to furnish the funeral banquet, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the purchase of the coffin, which was burned along with paper images of horses, carriages, and servants in order for them to accompany the deceased into the next life. Due to the high cost of burial, most families opted for the cheaper practice of cremation. This was frowned upon by Confucian officials due to beliefs in the ancestral cult. They sought to ban the practice with prohibitions in 963 and 972; despite this, cremation amongst the poor and middle classes persisted. By the 12th century, the government came up with the solution of installing public cemeteries where a family's deceased could be buried on state owned property.|$|E
500|$|In 1943 Judge Green {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Corps, the {{predecessor}} to the United States Air Force. At the time, the armed forces were still segregated. Green was initially [...] "optimistic that the military {{was going to be}} a good life," [...] until his unit was shipped from Fort Lee, Virginia to Keesler Field (now Keesler Air Force Base), in Mississippi. When the unit arrived at Keesler they were driven past the barracks to what Green would later describe as [...] "a tent city." [...] It was then that Green [...] "realized for real that I was really in a segregated army, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always,</b> as long as I was in the service, two standards, one quite unacceptable and the other as acceptable as could be considering the fact that the country was at war." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially {{slated for}} a March 2, 2012 release, {{the film was}} pushed by Paramount Pictures to a ten-month delay for January 11, 2013. Co-producer Kevin Messick later said: [...] "We’d {{finished}} it but we were still discussing adding a coda scene, which {{we were able to}} shoot. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the consideration that Jeremy [...] had Avengers and Bourne coming out. So the studio made a wise strategic move in finding a good release date for us." [...] Wirkola said that [...] "the main reason is because they wanted to wait on Jeremy. He was cast before , Bourne and The Avengers. They wanted to wait until after those. I was, of course, disappointed then, but actually it helped because we came in under budget" [...] and so the delay enabled him to re-add and shoot an additional scene that is set in the desert and which was cut from his original screenplay. The first trailer for the film was released on September 5, 2012.|$|E

500|$|Gates {{was born}} in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He {{is the son of}} William H. Gates Sr. (b. 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry {{includes}} English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish. His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served {{on the board of directors}} for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates's maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or [...] "Trey" [...] because his father had the [...] "II" [...] suffix. [...] Early on in his life, Gates's parents had a law career in mind for him. [...] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination. The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that [...] "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a penalty for losing".|$|E
500|$|The first {{building}} constructed at Fort Yellowstone was the guardhouse (Bldg 9) at {{the southwest}} corner of the fort. [...] In 1891, visitors traveled the lower Mammoth road through what is now the main residential area for park personnel. The guardhouse was the first building they encountered in the Mammoth area <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a sentry on duty to check visitors entering the park. [...] The building is now a private residence. The original fort administration building (Bldg 8) was located immediately next to the guardhouse and is now also a private residence. Of the twelve buildings constructed in 1891, the most prominent are two of the four double officers' quarters (Bldgs 6 and 7) which front the old parade ground. [...] Other buildings constructed in 1891 included a 60-man barracks, a commissary storehouse (Bldg 10), a quartermaster storehouse (Bldg 11), a granary (Bldg 12), a bakery (Bldg 24), a stable (Bldg 25) and the first two of four non-commissioned officers' (NCO) quarters (Bldgs 30 and 33). [...] These NCO quarters became known as [...] "soap-suds row' because many of the NCO wives were former army laundresses who supplemented their husbands' income by doing laundry for post personnel.|$|E
500|$|In Leipzig, Bache studied piano with Ignaz Moscheles and {{composition}} with Carl Reinecke. He also {{became friends with}} a fellow student, Arthur Sullivan, who, he wrote, [...] "cannot play well, but ... has written some things which I think show great talent." [...] Another fellow student Bache knew well, though they were not especially close, was Edvard Grieg. While the city was reportedly past the halcyon days it had experienced under Mendelssohn, it proved valuable for exposing Bache to artists such as Pauline Viardot, Giulia Grisi, Joseph Joachim and Henri Vieuxtemps, and {{to the music of}} Beethoven, Bellini, Chopin, Moritz Hauptmann and Mendelssohn. He applied himself to his piano studies, but by his own admission wasted much time in Leipzig and lacked direction. In Brother Musicians, Constance quotes [...] "a musician of high standing" [...] who was one of his circle of friends (possibly Sullivan or the pianist Franklin Taylor), who explained, [...] "You see in Leipzig nobody was compelled to work, there being no particular supervision; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> plenty to do, in the way of amusement, for the less energetic. As far as my recollection goes Bache was at that time rather given to working by fits and starts, frequently making excellent resolutions, the effect of which did not last many days." ...|$|E

500|$|Wodehouse {{expected}} to follow Armine to the University of Oxford, but the family's finances took {{a turn for the}} worse at the crucial moment. Ernest Wodehouse had retired in 1895, and his pension was paid in rupees; fluctuation against the pound reduced its value in Britain. Wodehouse recalled, [...] "The wolf was not actually whining at the door <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a little something in the kitty for the butcher and the grocer, but the finances would not run to anything in the nature of a splash". Instead of a university career, in September 1900 Wodehouse was engaged in a junior position in the London office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He was unsuited to it and found the work baffling and uncongenial. He later wrote a humorous account of his experiences at the bank, but at the time he longed for the end of each working day, when he could return to his rented lodgings in Chelsea and write. At first he concentrated, with some success, on serious articles about school sports for Public School Magazine. In November 1900 his first comic piece, [...] "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings," [...] was accepted by Tit-Bits. A new magazine for boys, The Captain, provided further well-paid opportunities, and during his two years at the bank, Wodehouse had eighty pieces published in a total of nine magazines.|$|E

[...] Sidewheel steamers did better in shallow water, as was often encountered on the upper Willamette and its navigable tributaries. [...] Propellers had to be submerged to furnish power, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the potential in low water of striking obstruction on the river bottom, which happened to the Washington at least once, in September 1851, on the lower Willamette river.

He wrote in his autobiography It Doesn't Take A Hero, that Trưởng [...] "did not look like my idea of a military genius: only five feet seven … very skinny, with hunched shoulders and a head that seemed too big for his body … His face was pinched and intense … <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a cigarette hanging from his lips. Yet he was revered by his officers and troopsand feared by those North Vietnamese commanders who knew of his ability." [...] Schwarzkopf said that Trưởng was [...] "the most brilliant tactical commander I'd ever known" [...] and that [...] "by visualizing the terrain and drawing on his experience fighting the enemy for fifteen years, Truong showed {{an uncanny ability to}} predict {{what they were going to}} do".|$|E

2500|$|González's parents, Manuel Antonio González and Carmen Alire Alonso, {{migrated}} from the Mexican state of Chihuahua to the U.S. {{in the early}} 1900s. González was born in 1928, the eldest of seven children. Kramer writes that [...] "Gorgo was not the poor Mexican-American that people assumed. He didn't come from a wealthy family, but from a stable middle-class background, probably a lot like mine. He had a great mother <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a warm feeling of family loyalty. If anything, {{he might have been}} spoiled as a kid. It's a shame he suffered discrimination because of his Mexican heritage". However, according to other sources, Gonzales's father worked as a house-painter and he, along with his six siblings, were raised in a working-class neighborhood. In his autobiography, González states, [...] "We had few luxuries at our house. Food wasn't abundant but it was simple and filling, and we never went hungry. Our clothes were just clothes – inexpensive but clean." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{returning}} to New York City in January 1937, Schneider {{claimed he was}} never paid in full. Spain claimed that they were paid in full, and were not owed any money. Others who flew for the loyalists included: Bert Acosta, Gordon Berry, and Frederic Ives Lord. When he returned he was questioned by Chief Assistant United States Attorney, John F. Dailey on January 15, 1937 in New York. Eddie's lawyer was Colonel Lewis Landes. On January 20, 1937, Eddie, Bert, and Gordon flew to Washington, D.C. and had to testify again. When talking to reporters Eddie said: I was broke, hungry, jobless... yet {{despite the fact that}} all three of us are old-time aviators who did our part {{for the development of the}} industry, we were left out in the cold in the Administration's program of job making. Can you blame us for accepting the lucrative Spanish offer? He later said [...] "This was a mess... <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> that never-ending jockeying for the power among the factions to contend with, it got to the point where we did not know who we were fighting and why, and you can say that we are damn glad to be back."
