5|$|Chelsea's {{route to}} the final began in the third round, with a trip to Carrow Road to face Norwich City. An uneventful tie, with Carlo Cudicini making a series of saves to deny Norwich {{finished}} goalless and was replayed at Stamford Bridge. Goals from Mario Stanić and Frank Lampard put Chelsea in a commanding lead and Gianfranco Zola scored the team's third with a unique piece of skill. From a corner, the Italian made a near-post run <b>and</b> <b>flicked</b> the ball airborne. Chelsea finished the match 4–0 winners and were drawn to face West Ham United in the next round. Frédéric Kanouté's late goal cancelled out Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's opener for Chelsea and the tie was replayed at Upton Park the following Wednesday night. West Ham went a goal up when Jermain Defoe scored for West Ham, but their lead was short-lived as Hasselbaink directly from a free-kick. Defoe restored the home side's advantage in the 50th minute, though substitute Mikael Forssell came on to equalise for Chelsea and in stoppage time John Terry headed-in goalwards from a corner to complete the visitors comeback.|$|E

But he was just unable to complete the job, and his team lost by one run.

2500|$|The {{shot was}} {{developed}} by Zimbabwean batsman Dougie Marillier. In a triangular tournament in Australia with Zimbabwe, Australia and West Indies, Zimbabwe played their final match with Australia and Marillier got a chance in the team. He could hardly have had a more testing experience, as a fine Zimbabwe batting performance after Australia scored 303 meant that he came in at number seven needing to score 15 to win the match in the final over, {{which was to be}} bowled by Glenn McGrath. [...] Marillier moved across to the first and third balls he received from McGrath <b>and</b> <b>flicked</b> them over his shoulder to fine leg for boundaries, reviving hopes of an incredible Zimbabwe victory. But he was just unable to complete the job, and his team lost by two runs. His two courageous and unorthodox boundary strokes made him famous, with the shot becoming known as the Marillier shot.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008–09 season, Bryson {{established}} himself as an important first team player, making thirty-three league appearances, thirty-one of them starts. His first goal of the season came in a Scottish League Cup second round match against Brechin City on 27 August 2008. Described variously as [...] "stunning", [...] "unstoppable", [...] "sublime" [...] and [...] "a thunderbolt", he scored the second in a 2–0 win when he received a cross from Garry Hay <b>and</b> <b>flicked</b> {{the ball into the}} top corner. His next two goals were late winners in successive matches: on 4 October in a 2–1 win at Hearts he made a well-timed run into the box in the 82nd minute to collect a return pass from Donovan Simmonds and finish well into the bottom corner; and then on 18 October he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win at home to Motherwell, slipping the ball into the net at the far post in the 89th minute after a deflected shot-cum-cross from Jamie Hamill. Manager Jim Jefferies praised Bryson after the win over Hearts, saying his late run into the box and finish was comparable to a move by Colin Cameron. He was also named man of the match after the win over Motherwell.|$|E
2500|$|Zoe Nelson was a seventeen-year-old {{motor vehicle}} repair student at Motherwell College, {{who lived with}} her mother, {{stepfather}} and younger sister at Crindledyke Crescent, Newmains, on {{the eastern edge of}} Wishaw. Both Nelson and her 16-year-old sister Laura Anne were involved in relationships with the same man, 20-year-old Robert [...] "Rab" [...] Bayne, who lived with his grandparents in Harper Crescent, Cambusnethan, although the elder sister was also dating another local man, Ross Hemphill. Marieann Nelson, the girls' mother, described how the sisters had argued about Bayne outside the family home at around 5pm on 22 May. She said: [...] "Laura Anne ran out <b>and</b> <b>flicked</b> Zoe's hair and tried to slap her face {{and the two of them}} ended up having a fight at the end of the driveway. I split it up. I said 'Go away you cow and don't come back'. She said she wouldn't come back." [...] Isobel Park, Nelson's stepsister, said Zoe and Bayne seemed [...] "a bit intoxicated" [...] and that Laura Anne had been upset as [...] "she was supposed to be seeing Rab as well." [...] Zoe walked off with Bayne, who was drinking from a bottle of tequila, and was not seen alive by her family again. At 5pm on 24 May, after police had announced the discovery of a body, Mrs. Nelson reported her daughter as a missing person.|$|E

60|$|While {{things were}} in this state with him he {{received}} a letter from Messrs.

The Solicitor-General had suggested to the attorney that he should see the man, <b>and</b> Mr. <b>Flick</b> had found himself bound to obey; but in truth he hardly knew what to say to Daniel Thwaite. It must be his object of course to buy off the tailor; but such arrangements are difficult, and require great caution. <b>And</b> then Mr. <b>Flick</b> was employed by Earl Lovel, and this man was the friend of the Earl's opponents in the case. Mr. Flick did feel that the Solicitor-General was moving into great irregularities in this cause. The cause itself was no doubt peculiar,--unlike any other cause with which Mr. Flick had become acquainted in his experience; there was no saying at the present moment who had opposed interests, and who combined interests in the case; but still etiquette is etiquette, <b>and</b> Mr. <b>Flick</b> was aware that such a house as that of Messrs. Norton <b>and</b> <b>Flick</b> should not be irregular. Nevertheless he sent for Daniel Thwaite.|$|R
