40|$|A {{cornerstone}} of the <b>antiviral</b> <b>interferon</b> response is phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 α. This limits the availability of eIF 2 ·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet ternary complexes, reduces formation of 43 S preinitiation complexes, and blocks viral (and most cellular) mRNA translation. However, many viruses have developed counterstrategies that circumvent this cellular response. Herein, we characterize a novel class of translation initiation inhibitors that block ternary complex formation and prevent the assembly of 43 S preinitiation complexes. We find that translation driven by the HCV IRES is refractory to inhibition by these compounds at concentrations that effectively block cap-dependent translation in vitro and in vivo.

We show that identified compounds exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity and immunostimulatory properties, in line with recent reports linking de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis with innate defense mechanisms against viruses. Most importantly, we establish that pyrimidine deprivation can amplify the production of both type I and type III interferons by cells stimulated with retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) ligands. Altogether, our results further expand the current panel of pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors and illustrate how the production of <b>antiviral</b> <b>interferons</b> is tightly coupled to this metabolic pathway.

Indeed, IEL activation in vivo rapidly provoked type I/III IFN receptor-dependent upregulation of IFN-responsive genes in the villus epithelium.

Hence, intraepithelial T cell activation offers an overt means to promote the innate antivira...|$|E
40|$|SummaryLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) {{modulate}} various biological processes, {{but their}} role in host antiviral responses is largely unknown.

Conversely, silencing NRAV suppressed IAV replication and virus production, suggesting that reduction of NRAV is part of the host antiviral innate immune response to virus infection. NRAV negatively regulates the initial transcription of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM 3 and MxA, by affecting histone modification of these genes.

40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a mechanism}} of {{post-transcriptional gene silencing}} (PTGS) that has been described in plants, invertebrates and, more recently, in mammalian cells 1, 2.

An endonuclease complex uses siRNAs {{as a guide to}} cleave the target mRNA of homologous sequence resulting in a decrease in the steady-state levels of the target mRNA. Endogenously, RNAi and PTGS have been shown to protect against invading genetic elements such as transposons 4, 5, transgenes 6 – 8 and viruses 9 – 10, which potentially share in common a long dsRNA trigger.

40|$|Interferons {{represent}} the body's most rapid defence against virus infection. Natural recovery from viral infections is correlated with interferon production; the inhibition of interferon enhances {{the severity of}} infection and interferon {{has been shown to}} protect animals from some viral infections. beta-Interferon is produced by fibroblasts in response to viral infection. Leucocyte (a) interferon may be induced by foreign or infected cells or by viruses, and it is continuously released into the bloodstream during infection, declining with time. gamma-Interferon are produced later in viral infection by virus-sensitized T lymphocytes. The <b>antiviral</b> action of <b>interferon</b> is induced by interaction with specific receptors on cell surfaces leading to translation of <b>antiviral</b> proteins. <b>Interferons</b> may also enhance immune responses by increasing expression of lymphocyte surface antigens and by increasing the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells.

40|$|Innate {{recognition}} of viruses is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) triggering expression of <b>antiviral</b> <b>interferons</b> (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. In mice, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2) and TLR 9 {{as well as}} intracellular nucleotide-sensing pathways {{have been shown to}} recognize herpes simplex virus (HSV). Here, we describe how human primary macrophages recognize early HSV infection via intracellular pathways. A number of inflammatory cytokines, IFNs, and IFN-stimulated genes were upregulated after HSV infection. We show that early {{recognition of}} HSV and induction of IFNs and inflammatory cytokines are independent of TLR 2 and TLR 9, since inhibition of TLR 2 using TLR 2 neutralizing antibodies did not affect virus-induced responses and the macrophages were unresponsive to TLR 9 stimulation. Instead, HSV recognition involves intracellular recognition systems, since induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and IFNs was dependent on virus entry and replication. Importantly, expression of IFNs was strongly inhibited by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of MAVS, but this MAVS-dependent IFN induction occurred indepen-dently of the recently discovered polymerase III (Pol III) /RIG-I DNA sensing system. In contrast, induction of TNF- was largely independent of MAVS, suggesting that induction of inflammatory cytokines during HSV infection proceeds via a novel pathway.

We investigated the potential roles of Pellino- 1 in the airways. We show {{for the first time that}} Pellino- 1 regulates responses to a human pathogen, rhinovirus minor group serotype 1 B (RV- 1 B). Knockdown of Pellino- 1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with impaired production of innate immune cytokines such as CXCL 8 from human primary bronchial epithelial cells in response to RV- 1 B, without impairment in production of <b>antiviral</b> <b>interferons</b> (IFN), and without loss of control of viral replication. Pellino- 1 actions were likely to be independent of interleukin- 1 receptor-associated kinase- 1 (IRAK- 1) regulation, since Pellino- 1 knockdown in primary epithelial cells did not alter responses to IL- 1 but did inhibit responses to poly(I center dot C), a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR 3) activator that does not signal via IRAK- 1 to engender a response. These data indicate that Pellino- 1 represents a novel target that regulates responses of human airways to human viral pathogens, independently of IRAK signaling. Neutralization of Pellino- 1 may therefore provide opportunities to inhibit potentially harmful neutrophilic inflammation of the airways induced by respiratory viruses, without loss of control of the underlying viral infection...|$|R
