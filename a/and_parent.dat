5|$|Members of the Vanderlip family, {{particularly}} Virginia Vanderlip Schoales, {{continued to}} administer the school for sixty years. A 1959 development plan made way for a new primary school in 1961, new science facilities in 1962, expansion of the library in 1963, {{and the creation of}} an organization for alumni, of whom there were more than a thousand living in 1977. The school was unable to obtain sufficient funding and closed in 1978. In 1980, the buildings and property were taken over by The Clear View School, which opened in September 1981 after major renovations. The school runs a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21, and is sponsored by the Association for Mentally Ill Children of Westchester; its program involves education, treatment, and crisis intervention <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> involvement.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{made worse by}} the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary. As such, it was completely dependent on the Central Bank of Iceland for emergency loans of liquidity, and could not turn to the Bank of England for help. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in the weeks before the crisis. However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and might even have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent. The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> banks ("parental upstreaming"). Landsbanki operated in Guernsey through a legally independent subsidiary.|$|E

The thesis {{presents the}} cooperation between teachers <b>and</b> <b>parents,</b> from tasks <b>and</b> roles of teachers, school goals, problems, that appear from cooperation, to different forms of cooperation and relations between teachers <b>and</b> <b>parents.</b> I especially focused on mathematics teachers and their cooperation with parents. The main goal of the empirical part was to analyze the cooperation between mathematics teachers <b>and</b> <b>parents,</b> to find out through which forms they cooperate, how often, for what reasons, and what is the relationship between them. The findings show, that the most often used form of cooperation between mathematics teachers <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> are PT meetings and that their relationship is based on a partnership. Mathematics teachers rarely use informal forms of cooperation with parents...|$|R

First South Yorkshire, became {{by far the}} largest bus operator and in recent years implemented a series of fare rises and service cuts which saw bus ridership drop. Recent developments have seen Stagecoach Sheffield taking over Yorkshire Terrier, Andrews <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> company Yorkshire Traction, thus forming one company and in the process expanding their bus services in the city. This has resulted in increased competition, and price drops on certain routes.

Participants included 318 male and 544 female same-sex twin pairs from the Twin and Offspring Study in Sweden. All twins completed self-report measures of marital quality and personality (anxiousness, aggression, sociability).

Our objective was to compare the future aspirations of pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents <b>and</b> identify social or structural barriers that they experience in their daily lives using journal entries from pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents. The journals, which served as primary data sources, were completed by 52 multi-ethnic pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents aged 15 to 19 in Indiana. Both pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents aspired to provide a “better life” for their children that included finishing school and obtaining a career. An emergent theme is that the experience of pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> is transformative <b>and</b> may invoke a positive refocusing of life aspirations for educational and career attainment. However, social stigma and barriers exist that make achieving educational and employment opportunities difficult. The study findings indicate that pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents need strong social support networks and practical tools to help harness their motivation and transcend social and material barriers to achieve their goals and aspirations...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} consumer participation {{in the context of}} developmental changes in parent/child relationships and associated differences in the utilization of child and adolescent mental health services. Method: Existing definitions and characteristics of mental health service delivery for children and young people are examined to answer the question,"Who is the consumer in the context of clinical services for young clients <b>and</b> their <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> does this change with the child or young person's developmental stage?". Results: As children, young people <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> utilize services in this area of mental health, the roles of consumer and carer need redefinition to accommodate both young clients <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> as consumers, <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> also as carers. Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the changing roles of <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> young clients from infancy to early adulthood to guide consumer and carer participation strategies. If child and adolescent mental health services are to apply a developmental perspective and engage both young clients <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> as 'consumers', they need to address challenges related to the differences in expectations and capacities of young clients <b>and</b> <b>parents,</b> to the complexity associated with dual roles, and to promoting meaningful participation...|$|R

At each assessment, the psychological adjustment of the children and their families was compared with the adjustment of a cohort of children and families in the general community (n = 49).
