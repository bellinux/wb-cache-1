40|$|Inroduction. Photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystals</b> are crystal structures, {{which just}} like the crystals, are {{characterized}} by zone spectral properties. The purpose of the article is to research the input impedance characteristics and formation features of the photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystals?</b> zone diagrams. Impedance model and properties of unlimited crystal structure. The expressions for input impedance of unlimited one-dimensional crystal structure for waves of different nature are presented. The relationships of physical properties of the <b>crystal</b> structure <b>and</b> the mathematical features of the expressions are investigated. Impedance characteristics of photon <b>and</b> phonon unlimited <b>crystals.</b> The dependences of active and reactive components of photon <b>and</b> phonon unlimited <b>crystal?s</b> input impedance with layers of different thickness are shown. Input impedance characteristics of photon <b>and</b> phonon limited <b>crystals.</b> The dependences of active and reactive components of limited photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystal?s</b> input impedance are given. The conditions for waves resonant passing through photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystals</b> are obtained. Reflection coefficient characteristics of photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystals.</b> The formation of the limited photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystal?s</b> zone diagrams is analyzed by mutual comparison of limited photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystal?s</b> reflection characteristic <b>and</b> active component of unlimited photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystal?s</b> input impedance characteristics. The approximation degree of limited photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystal?s</b> zone diagram parameters to the unlimited photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystal?s</b> zone diagram parameters is quantitatively analyzed. Conclusions. The conditions for waves resonant passing through photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystals</b> is formulated <b>and</b> features of photon <b>and</b> phonon <b>crystal?s</b> zone diagram formation is investigated. ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ? ???????????? ????????? ? ????????? ??????????

5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms.

Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E

At international level, Iwelumo went on to represent Scotland and Leo Bertos became the first former York player to represent his country at a FIFA World Cup when appearing for New Zealand at the 2010 tournament.

At the end of the 2008–09 season he resigned to take over as manager of Sunderland, a post he held until he was dismissed in November 2011. Seven months later, he was appointed manager of Hull City and led the club to two promotions to the Premier League, as well as the 2014 FA Cup Final, before leaving in July 2016.

5|$|By 1867 the Sheffield Rules was the {{dominant}} code in England. The FA had still not achieved the national dominance it enjoys today. Its membership had shrunk to just 10clubs {{and at a}} meeting of the FA it was reported that only three clubs (No Names Club, Barnes <b>and</b> <b>Crystal</b> Palace) were playing by the FA code. At the same meeting the secretary of Sheffield Club suggested three rule changes at an FA meeting: the adoption of rouges, the one man offside and introduction of a free kick for handling the ball. None of the motions were successful. Later in the same year, they abolished handling and touchdowns. It was stated that this was to bring them closer to non-handling games.|$|E
5|$|Charizard {{made its}} video game debut in 1996 with the Japanese release of Pokémon Red and Blue. It is {{available}} only through Pokémon evolution from the starter Pokémon Charmander. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, <b>and</b> <b>Crystal,</b> and their remakes, Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Charizard is used by Red, who acts as the games' final boss. Charizard {{is one of several}} Pokémon in Pokémon X and Y that is able to use the new Mega Evolution mechanic, becoming either Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y. It was given a Mega Evolution about one and a half years into the development of Pokémon X and Y. Charmander (along with Bulbasaur and Squirtle) was added to the game in a significant role in order to allow players to experience Charizard's Mega Evolution.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} the vittae <b>and</b> <b>crystals</b> of Steganotaenia araliacea was studied {{for the first time}} to allow a rigorous comparison with members of the subfamily Saniculoideae, where these two characters are of diagnostic value. The irregular vittae were found to be branching and anastomosing <b>and</b> druse <b>crystals</b> dispersed in the mesocarp. Both these states are predominant in the Saniculoideae but very rare in Apioideae. In the subfamily Apioideae, regular vittae (vallecular and commissural, or cyclic) are present <b>and</b> druse <b>crystals,</b> if present, occur in the commissural side only. The absence of regular vittae and the presence of irregular vittae <b>and</b> dispersed druse <b>crystals</b> further support the exclusion of Steganotaenia from the subfamily Apioideae but support its hypothesized relation to the Saniculoideae, where large rib ducts combined with irregular vittae (branching or anastomosing) <b>and</b> dispersed druse <b>crystals</b> are typical. This study has led to a better understanding of the taxonomic value of irregular vittae <b>and</b> <b>crystals...</b>|$|R
