5|$|During the 1930s, {{as part of}} the {{changing}} Soviet policy towards its ethnic territories, a decision was made to increase the proportion of ethnic Russians in the autonomous oblast. On April10, 1936, the predominantly Russian city of Maykop, as well as Giaginsky District and Khansky Selsoviet of Maykopsky District, became a part of the autonomous oblast (with the selsoviet having been incorporated into Giaginsky District). At the same time, the <b>administrative</b> <b>center</b> of the autonomous oblast was moved from Krasnodar to Maykop. Tuapse, a port on the Black Sea, was considered for the role of the <b>administrative</b> <b>center,</b> but the idea was rejected as it would give the native population access to the sea.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1980s, more {{resistance}} movements {{supported by}} Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung {{up across the}} country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern <b>administrative</b> <b>center</b> of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.|$|E

The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of Split, the second-largest city of modern Croatia.|$|E
5|$|During the 8th century BCE, {{the village}} {{was part of the}} Kingdom of Judah. During the days of Jewish king Herod the town was the <b>administrative</b> <b>center</b> for the {{district}} of Idumea. After the turmoil of the First Jewish-Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt the town became a thriving Roman colony and a major <b>administrative</b> <b>center</b> under the name of Eleutheropolis. In the early 7th century CE, Bayt Jibrin was conquered by Muslim forces led by 'Amr ibn al-'As. Under the Crusaders in the 12th century, it was known as Beth Gibelin, and had a population of 1,500, compared to 100-150 in the average village of the time. It fell to the Mamluks and then the Ottoman Turks. In the 19th century, the al-'Azza family took control of Bayt Jibrin and unsuccessfully attempted to rebel against the Ottomans, ending in the exile and execution of local leaders.|$|E

5|$|The 20th century saw industrialization, {{through the}} {{construction}} of a shipping port, and a fish processing factory of Royal Greenland in 1924, the first such factory in Greenland. Fishing remains the primary occupation of Sisimiut inhabitants, with the town becoming the leading center of shrimping and shrimp processing. Until 2008 Sisimiut had been the <b>administrative</b> <b>center</b> of Sisimiut Municipality, which was then incorporated into the new Qeqqata Municipality on 1 January 2009, with Sisimiut retaining its status as the <b>administrative</b> <b>center</b> of the new unit, consisting also of the former Maniitsoq Municipality and the previously unincorporated area of Kangerlussuaq. The municipal council, seated in the town hall and headed by Mayor Hermann Berthelsen, consists of 13 members, including the mayor and his deputies, and representatives of the four primary political parties of Greenland: Siumut, Atassut, Democrats and Inuit Ataqatigiit.|$|E
5|$|Three {{industrial}} zones {{were placed}} {{adjacent to the}} port {{in the northern part}} of the city, taking into account the prevailing southern winds which take air pollution away from the city.

5|$|Ahmose I's {{campaigns in}} Nubia are better documented. Soon {{after the first}} Nubian campaign, a Nubian named Aata rebelled against Ahmose, but was crushed.

Ahmose restored Egyptian rule over Nubia, which was controlled from a new <b>administrative</b> <b>center</b> established at Buhen.

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 16th century, King FrederickII of Denmark–Norway demanded that the Tsardom of Russia cede the peninsula. Russia declined, and in order to {{organize}} adequate defenses established the position of a voyevoda. The voyevoda sat in Kola, which became the <b>administrative</b> <b>center</b> of the region. Prior to that, the administrative duties were performed by the tax collectors from Kandalaksha. Newly established Kolsky Uyezd covered most of the territory of the peninsula (with the exception of Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts, which were a part of Dvinsky Uyezd), as well as the northern part of Karelia all the way to Lendery.|$|E
5|$|The modern city of Ashdod {{city was}} built outside the {{historic}} settlement site, on virgin sands. The development followed a main development plan. The planners divided the city into seventeen neighborhoods of {{ten to fifteen}} thousand people. Wide avenues between the neighborhoods make traffic flow relatively freely inside the city. Each neighborhood has access to its own commercial center, urban park, and health and education infrastructure. The original plan also called for a business and <b>administrative</b> <b>center,</b> built in the mid-1990s, when the city population grew rapidly more than doubling in ten years.|$|E
5|$|The new Revelin {{became the}} strongest {{of the city}} fortresses, {{safeguarding}} the eastern land approach to the city. Shaped {{in the form of}} an irregular quadrilateral with one of its sides descending towards the sea, it is protected by a deep ditch on the other. One bridge crosses the protective ditch and connects it to the Ploče Gate, while another bridge connects it to the eastern suburb. The construction work was executed so perfectly so that the devastating earthquake of 1667 did not damage Revelin. Divided into three large vaulted rooms in its interior, Revelin became the <b>administrative</b> <b>center</b> of the Republic.|$|E

25|$|Coamo was the <b>administrative</b> <b>center</b> that {{encompassed}} most of {{the southern}} half of the island during the early colonial period.
