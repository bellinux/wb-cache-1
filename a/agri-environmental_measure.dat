Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} calculate the cost effectiveness of organic farming support in achieving environmental policy targets compared to other <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures.</b> The cost-effectiveness of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> can be understood as a function of policy uptake, environmental effects, and public expenditure. Taking the Swiss agricultural sector as an empirical case study, cost-effectiveness of organic farming support and other single agri environmental measures was calculated. For this purpose, the sector-representative PMP model FARMIS was extended by three modules encompassing a) life cycle assessments for fossil energy use, biodiversity and eutrophication according to the SALCA methodology, b) public expenditure, including policy-related transaction costs, and c) uptake of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures.</b> The calculations revealed a slightly higher policy cost with organic farming support of 14 CHF/ha for a 1 % average improvement in the environmental indicators, compared to a combination of three single <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> (11 CHF/ha), including both extensification of arable land and meadows. In view of an average public expenditure on agriculture of 2. 5 kCHF per ha in Switzerland, these differences can be considered as marginal. Sensitivity analyses confirm that the cost-effectiveness of organic farming support is very similar to combined <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures.</b> Furthermore, the model reveals that the cost-effectiveness of specific <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> is higher when implemented on organic farms rather than on non-organic farms...|$|R

To test the absence of fixed costs of enrolment, a simple tobit with a lower and an upper bound, that corresponds to the non fixed costs situation, is compared to the censored model with selection. Estimated specifications based on the enrolled area do not provided normally distributed residues and are not suitable to carry out the likelihood ratio test. Estimated specifications based on the share of enrolled area in the eligible area provide normally distributed residues. The likelihood ratio test rejects the absence of fixed costs. Technical factors as well as social capital variables are taken into consideration as determinants of technical and transaction costs.

This paper describes the main characteristics {{in the implementation of}} FAS in the Member States; as an example, it analyses the uptake of an agri-environmental scheme in an Italian region and discusses the relevance of extending FAS to assist farmers to implement agri-environmental measures (AEM). Yearly surveys carried out have showed that, even if FAS is differently operational in the Member States, the core approach is based on one-to-one advice on the farm mainly covering cross-compliance issues. Only in some Member States advice on agri-environmental issues within the FAS has been reported. In Lombardy Region the uptake of an <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measure</b> on balanced fertilisation and crop rotation demonstrates how the participation of farmers within a geographically homogeneous area can be scattered. Therefore advisory services for agri-environmental measures can play an important role both in increasing farmers¿ awareness and in advising on agricultural practices that go beyond minimum cross-compliance requirements. At this regard the integration of these advisory services for AEM into the existing FAS should be promoted. JRC. DG. G. 3 -Monitoring agricultural resource...|$|E

40|$|<b>Agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> play an {{important}} role in Italian rural areas, as shown by the financial commitment to the Rural Development programmes. However, in contrast with other European Union (EU) countries, policy-makers still have limited experience on how farmers approach environmental incentive schemes. This paper casts new light on this issue from a northern Italian perspec- tive. The rationale of the farmers’ decision-making process is explored using two multinomial models. The first explains the probability of non-participation or participation in one of three specific <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures.</b> The model outcomes show that labour-intensive farming types and high dependency of household income on farming activity constrain farmers’ participation, whereas previous experience, easy-to-implement environmentally friendly farm practices and adequate compensation of extra costs encourage participation. The second model explores the effect of farmers’ attitudes and beliefs on their predispositions towards participation in any of the schemes. The results highlight that, besides income factors, the farm’s future in the business, and the relationship with neigh- bouring farmers and their opinions on environmentally friendly practices all have significant effects on adoption of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures.</b> The paper concludes by suggesting that farmers’ attitudes and beliefs, as well as the local behavioural influences, have to be taken into account when designing and commu- nicating <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

The work selected as a subject of the study agri-environmental contract and its characteristics and other institutions, of which maturity influence the effects of that policy. The main goal was to identify these characteristics of contract and assess their balance in relation to the purpose and subject of the contract and long term benefit of both sides of the contract. Attitudes on the maturity of the contract characteristics have been collected between farmers and state administrators in survey (as sites of the contract) on national level and also in four regional case studies. It was revealed that most of the contract characteristics were not mature enough to serve to long term benefit for both sides of the contract, which decreases potential effectiveness of the agri-environmental policy. These are for example: information availability, trust between sides of the contract, tendencies to strategic behaviour, power distribution in the contract, sharing risks in the contract, adequacy of compensation level. Control and penalty system was regarded as rather adequate. Not mature institutions and characteristics of the contract increase transaction costs of both sides of the contract and decrease willingness to renew the contracts in future.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of two simulated auction models (AM 1, AM 2) {{with that of}} classical payment mechanisms as a marginal flat rate payment (MFR) and average flat rate payment (FR). The models follows the one-shot budget constrained auction model first introduced by Latacz-Lohmann and Van Der Hamsvoort (1997), and subsequently by Viaggi et al. (2008) and Glebe (2008). The first model (AM 1) deals with one-dimensional bids and it allows farmers to make an offer about a per hectare agri-environmental payment {{that they would like}} to receive in order to implement a generic <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measure</b> on their agricultural land. In the second auction model (AM 2) we further extend the analysis, allowing farmers to offer a combination of payment and a measure of their uptake in the agri-environmental program (i. e. a share of their land to commit under the program). Once simulated for AM 1 and AM 2 the optimal bidding behavior of a population of farmer taken from FADN data of E-R 2010 and 2011, assuming a fixed budget level and the sole objective for the public regulator to maximizes farmers participation to the AEM, we analyzed the total payment, the total cost and the total contracted area comparing the result with MFR and FR payment. The results confirm that the auction has the potential to reduce farmers’ information rent when compared with uniform policy instruments. Though the scale of saving depends crucially on auction design hypotheses and farmers' expectation about the maximum acceptable bid cap. The simulation while reflects a number of plausible assumptions, also remains rather simplified and could be improved in further research. However, it can contribute to feed the debate at EU policy level about the role in considering auction design and bidding behaviour so as to limiting the inefficiency related to the actual agri-environmental payments. ...|$|E

However, additional unsubsidised <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> that farmers perform are often ignored. The willingness to perform these measures may give a better insight into farmers’ motivation for <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> than subsidised measures because it likely depends only on farmers’ intrinsic motivation and not on extrinsic factors such as a financial compensation. In this study we used an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to investigate which factors are associated with farmers’ intention to perform unsubsidised <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures.</b> Our results demonstrate that attitude, perceived social norms and perceived personal ability are significantly associated with farmers’ intention to perform these measures.

The proposed innovation is based on the upcoming agricultural subsidy policy for the period 2014 - 2020 period. To evaluate the contribution of the measure is to use a methodology which takes into account the numbers of birds and damage caused by animals in the area. In conclusion, the evaluated ecosystem services that are provided by the proposed measures. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the possibilities of}} developing <b>agri-environmental</b> policy <b>measures</b> in Israel, focusing on market-oriented instruments. A conceptual framework for developing <b>agri-environmental</b> policy <b>measures</b> is presented, first in very broad lines (mandatory regulations, economic instruments and advisory measures) and subsequently focusing on economic instruments, and specifically, on market-oriented ones. Two criteria of choice between the measures are suggested: their contribution to improving {{the effectiveness of the}} policy; and the feasibility of their implementation. This is the framework used for analyzing <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> in Israel. Israel currently implements a mix of mandatory regulations, economic instruments and advisory measures to promote the agri-environment. The use of additional economic instruments may improve the effectiveness of the policy. When comparing the effectiveness of various economic measures, we found that the feasibility of implementation of market-oriented instruments is greater, due to the Israeli public’s preference for strengthening market orientation in the agricultural sector. Four market-oriented instruments were practiced in a pilot project conducted in an Israeli rural area. We found that in this case study, the institutional feasibility and acceptance by stakeholders were the major parameters influencing the implementation of the market-oriented instruments, whereas the instruments’ contribution to enhancing the ecological o...|$|R
30|$|Additionally, in Mediterranean lowland {{farmland}} areas, {{the diet}} {{ecology of the}} hare is almost unknown. However, hare is an important species for hunting economy (Sokos et al. 2003) and has fundamental roles in natural processes such as seed dispersal (Izhaki and Ne’eman 1997) and being prey for threatened predator species (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2009). Information on hare diet would assist evaluations on the suitability of different ecotopes for hare and to design appropriate habitat improvement actions and <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>measures</b> (Sokos et al. 2012).|$|R
