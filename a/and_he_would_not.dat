5|$|At 9a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, {{together}} with {{deputy prime minister}} Frank Crean and Leader of the House Fred Daly, met with the Liberal and Country party leaders. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders {{that he would be}} advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13December, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with Remembrance Day commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00p.m., though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister. Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the season}} started, however, Orr {{underwent}} another surgery on September 20, 1975. The Bruins' contract talks with Orr and Eagleson became difficult. The Bruins' insurer would not insure {{a contract with}} Orr and doctors advised the Bruins that Orr {{would not be able}} to play much longer. Orr returned to the lineup on November 8, 1975, the day after the Bruins traded Esposito to the New York Rangers. Orr was able to play the next ten games for the team but had to stop on November 28 due to pain in his knee. The next day, he underwent another knee surgery. Originally expected to only be out for seven to eight weeks, his knee did not respond to therapy and he returned home to Parry Sound. His season was over after ten games <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> play again for the Bruins. His impending free agency led to speculation that the Bruins would trade him, but despite his injury, they were negotiating to keep him until the end.|$|E
5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the trust company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> commit those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.|$|E
5|$|The {{extreme length}} of Æthelberht's reign {{also has been}} {{regarded}} with skepticism by historians; {{it has been suggested}} that he died in the fifty-sixth year of his life, rather than the fifty-sixth year of his reign. This would place the year of his birth approximately at 560, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> then have been able to marry until the mid 570s. According to Gregory of Tours, Charibert was king when he married Ingoberg, Bertha's mother, which places that marriage no earlier than 561. It therefore is unlikely that Bertha was married much before about 580. These later dates for Bertha and Æthelberht also solve another possible problem: Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburh, seems likely to have been Bertha's child, but the earlier dates would have Bertha aged sixty or so at Æthelburh's likely birthdate using the early dates.|$|E

25|$|Howard Kleinburg, {{an author}} and Miami Beach {{historian}} described Fisher: If you look at Fisher's entire life, it's a marathon. It's a race.

Several months earlier, Welch had placed an order for more diphtheria antitoxin after discovering that hospital's entire batch had expired. However, the shipment did not arrive before the port closed for the winter <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to order more until spring.|$|E

He was a moderately competitive midfield runner for Brabham in 1972 and 1973. He scored no points in the 1972 championship. In 1973 he scored his only Formula One World Championship points with a fifth and a sixth place. His best qualifying results were 9th in Monaco and 10th at Mosport in 1973.|$|E

25|$|During his 7–8-month stint with James Finch, he {{finished}} third at Sonoma after leading a few laps {{and running in}} the top three all race long. However his nearest miss took place at Talladega that autumn. There Busch controlled the race early and mid-way and spun out from contact with Jamie McMurray. He was parked by NASCAR after driving away from the safety officials who were trying to assist him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> stop his car even though NASCAR was telling him to do so.

25|$|Swett {{repeatedly}} {{attacked the}} line of dive bombers, downing each in turn with short bursts. He brought down four and was attacking a fifth when his ammunition was depleted {{and he had his}} cockpit shot up by return fire. Wounded, he decided to ditch his damaged fighter off the coast of Florida Island, after it became clear that his oil cooler had been hit <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> make it back to base. After a few seconds his engine seized, and despite initially being trapped in his cockpit underwater, Swett extricated himself and was rescued in Tulagi harbor after ditching his plane. This feat made the 22-year-old Marine aviator an ace on his first combat mission.|$|E
25|$|Umar I {{had ordered}} that nobody should {{adulterate}} milk by mixing water into it. Once, while patrolling about {{at night to}} inquire into the condition of people, he heard a woman asker her daughter to mix water into the milk before the day-break. The girl refused by reminding her mother of the order given by the Caliph. When the mother retorted {{by saying that the}} Caliph was not present <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> know of it, the daughter replied that God is Omniscient even if Caliph was not present. Umar I was so pleased with the reply that he asked his son Asim to marry the girl, saying that he hoped that she will give birth to a man who would rule over Arabia. Umar II was the son of Asim's daughter from this marriage (Abdul Hakam, pp 17-18).|$|E

25|$|Bimba's attorney, Harry Hoffman, {{called for}} a {{dismissal}} of the prosecution's charges owing to their unconstitutionality, but Judge C. Carroll King ruled against the motion since {{the question of the}} blasphemy charged based on the archaic Massachusetts law was beyond the purview of his court <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> rule on the sedition complaint until evidence was presented. In presenting Bimba's defense, Hoffman first addressed the blasphemy charge, defending atheism as akin to a religion and declaring that there was a constitutional right to belief in the non-existence of a God. With respect to the allegation of sedition, Hoffman again based his defense upon the notion of constitutionally-protected individual liberty, denying any act of incitement in Bimba's actual words and stating that even if Bimba did say the words ascribed to him, he was merely expressing personal beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Much {{as it had}} in the House, debate {{centered}} around the number of candidates in a contingency election and the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution. Again, small Federalist states vehemently argued that three candidates gave too much power to large states to pick presidents. Senator Pierce Butler of South Carolina argued that the issues with the election of 1800 were unlikely to happen again <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> advocate changing the Constitution simply to stop a Federalist Vice President. John Quincy Adams argued that the change from five to three gave an advantage to the people that violated the federative principle of the Constitution. Rather than have the office of the President balanced between the states and the people, Adams felt designation of President and Vice President would tip that scale in favor of the people.|$|E
25|$|Still in {{the summer}} of 209 BC, while Marcellus was {{fighting}} Hannibal in Apulia, the army under the consul Quintus Fulvius Flaccus effected the submission of northern Lucania. The other consul, Quintus Fabius Maximus, assaulted the city of Manduria, in the Sallentine. It was hardly 35km away from Tarentum. Having disentangled himself from Marcellus, although the army of Fabius was very close to Tarentum, Hannibal hurried to rescue the city of Caulonia (in the farthest corner of southwestern Italy for Bruttium was also under Roman attack). Unopposed by the main Roman forces the Carthaginian commander managed to intercept and destroy near Caulonia an 8,000 strong detachment that had attacked the Bruttians from Regium, and thus retained control over the region. But this fight delayed him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> arrive in time to save Tarentum from Fabius' assault. He was five miles away when Fabius sacked Tarentum.|$|E
