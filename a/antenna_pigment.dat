2500|$|In his “Thermodynamic Dissipation Theory of the Origin and Evolution of Life”, Karo Michaelian {{has taken}} the insight of Boltzmann {{and the work of}} Prigogine to its {{ultimate}} consequences regarding the origin of life. This theory postulates that the hallmark of the origin and evolution of life is the microscopic dissipative structuring of organic pigments and their proliferation over the entire Earth surface. Present day life augments the entropy production of Earth in its solar environment by dissipating ultraviolet and visible photons into heat through organic pigments in water. This heat then catalyzes a host of secondary dissipative processes such as the water cycle, ocean and wind currents, hurricanes, etc. Michaelian argues that if the thermodynamic function of life today is to produce entropy through photon dissipation in organic pigments, then this probably was its function at its very beginnings. It turns out that both RNA and DNA when in water solution are very strong absorbers and extremely rapid dissipaters of ultraviolet light within the 230–290nm wavelength (UV-C) region, which {{is a part of the}} Sun's spectrum that could have penetrated the prebiotic atmosphere. In fact, not only RNA and DNA, but many fundamental molecules of life (those common to all three domains of life) are also pigments that absorb in the UV-C, and many of these also have a chemical affinity to RNA and DNA. Nucleic acids may thus have acted as acceptor molecules to the UV-C photon excited <b>antenna</b> <b>pigment</b> donor molecules by providing an ultrafast channel for dissipation. Michaelian has shown using the formalism of non-linear irreversible thermodynamics that there would have existed during the Archean a thermodynamic imperative to the abiogenic UV-C photochemical synthesis and proliferation of these pigments over the entire Earth surface if they acted as catalysts to augment the dissipation of the solar photons. By the end of the Archean, with life-induced ozone dissipating UV-C light in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, it would have become ever more improbable for a completely new life to emerge that didn’t rely on the complex metabolic pathways already existing since now the free energy in the photons arriving at Earth’s surface would have been insufficient for direct breaking and remaking of covalent bonds. It has been suggested, however, that such changes in the surface flux of ultraviolet radiation due to geophysical events affecting the atmosphere could have been what promoted the development of complexity in life based on existing metabolic pathways, for example during the Cambrian explosion ...|$|E

Delayed fluorescence in the nanosecond time region originated from the 683 -nm component {{in all three}} samples, even though a slight variation in lifetimes was detected from 15 to 25  ns.

Using the simulations in conjunction with our recent fluorescence studies, we examine excitation transport and trapping dynamics in photosystem I and the limitations imposed by the finite time resolution in single photon counting experiments.

40|$|ABSTRACT Arabidopsis cryptochromes cry 1 and cry 2 are blue-light {{signalling}} molecules {{with significant}} structural sim-ilarity to photolyases—a class of blue-light-sensing DNA repair enzymes. Like photolyases, purified plant cryptochromes {{have been shown}} to bind both flavin and pterin chromophores. The flavin functions as a light sensor and undergoes re-duction in response to blue light that initiates the signalling cascade. However, the role of the pterin in plant crypto-chromes has until now been unknown. Here, we show that the action spectrum for light-dependent degradation of cry 2 has a significant peak of activity at 380 nm, consistent with absorption by a pterin cofactor. We further show that cry 1 protein expressed in living insect cells responds with greater sensitivity to 380 nm light than to 450 nm, consistent with a light-harvesting <b>antenna</b> <b>pigment</b> that transfers excitation energy to the oxidized flavin of cry 1.

This study was developed {{under the auspices of}} the COST Action “Seagrasses: from genes to ecosystems”, targeting one of its objectives, the development of innovative devices for the continuous measurement of seagrass photosynthesis. Automated multi-channel chlorophyll fluorometers were deployed for 24 -hour periods to examine and compare the changes in the photosynthetic efficiency and energy quenching mechanisms of the 3 species. Tissue samples were collected at predawn and noon, frozen and analysed by HPLC for detailed pigment analysis. The invasive C. taxifolia showed generally higher photosynthetic efficiency than both Z. capricorni and H. ovalis. Both seagrass species showed down-regulation of photosynthesis at noon, evidenced by the low quantum yield and the significant reduction of the <b>antennae</b> <b>pigments</b> between pre-dawn and noon. In contrast, C. taxifolia showed no reduction in <b>antennae</b> <b>pigments</b> or total photosynthetic pigments along the day. While both seagrasses showed 3 - to 7 -fold increases in the epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle pigments between pre-dawn and noon, in C. taxifolia there was no significant change.

40|$|Photosystem I of the {{cyanobacterium}} Synechococcus elongatus {{contains two}} spectral pools of chlorophylls called C- 708 and C- 719 that absorb at longer wavelengths than the primary electron donor P 700. We investigated the relative quantum yields of photochemical charge separation and fluorescence {{as a function}} of excitation wavelength and temperature in trimeric and monomeric photosystem I complexes of this cyanobacterium. The monomeric complexes are characterized by a reduced content of the C- 719 spectral form. At room temperature, an analysis of the wavelength dependence of P 700 oxidation indicated that all absorbed light, even of wavelengths of up to 750 nm, has the same probability of resulting in a stable P 700 photooxidation. Upon cooling from 295 K to 5 K, the nonselectively excited steady-state emission increased by 11 - and 16 -fold in the trimeric and monomeric complexes, respectively, whereas the quantum yield of P 700 oxidation decreased 2. 2 - and 1. 7 -fold. Fluorescence excitation spectra at 5 K indicate that the fluorescence quantum yield further increases upon scanning of the excitation wavelength from 690 nm to 710 nm, whereas the quantum yield of P 700 oxidation decreases significantly upon excitation at wavelengths longer than 700 nm. Based on these findings, we conclude that at 5 K the excited state is not equilibrated over the antenna before charge separation occurs, and that approximately 50 % of the excitations reach P 700 before they become irreversibly trapped on one of the long-wavelength <b>antenna</b> <b>pigments.</b> Possible spatial organizations of the long-wavelength <b>antenna</b> <b>pigments</b> in the three-dimensional structure of photosystem I are discussed...|$|R

The analogy between the algal complexes and those from spinach was drawn from their absorption and fluorescence spectra and relative pigment content. The identities and amounts of the major carotenoids associated with each isolated complex were determined by HPLC. Although the reaction center complexes accounted for only 14 % of the total chlorophyll, they were highly enriched in β-carotene, whereas the light-harvesting complex contained {{a high proportion of}} xanthophylls (mainly violaxanthin and vaucheriaxanthin-ester).

The bacteriochlorophyll c. d. band was absent from the {{spectrum of}} R. rubrum G 9, a mutant unable to synthesize coloured carotenoids, and could be partly restored by adding extracted carotenoids to freeze-dried membrane vesicles isolated from that mutant. Therefore it seems to arise from either bacteriochlorophyll-carotenoid interactions or bacteriochlorophyll-protein interactions that are induced by the carotenoid. The more complex carotenoid c. d. band had different shapes in native and reconstituted carotenoid-containing membranes.

The amplitudes of the three bleach components versus pump energy are linear up to 250 nJ at both pump wavelengths. Between 250 nJ and 1 {mu}J the amplitudes continue to increase but at a lesser slope. Zero-crossing times increase with increasing pump energy from a minimum of about 10 ps at 683 nm excitation and 20 ps at 665 nm excitation. ZCTs provide a convenient way of comparing from laboratory to laboratory the actual pump intensity seen by a sample. Whereas the amplitudes of the three kinetic components increase with pump energy, there {{does not seem to be}} a consistent change in the relative percentage of the three components over the pump energy range investigated. However, the percentage of intermediate time component appears greater, and the lifetimes of all three components increase somewhat when pumping at 665 nm vs. 683 nm. To examine this point, we obtained transient absorption spectra of PSII RCs at 500 ps and 1 ps after low energy pump pulses at 665 nm and 683 nm. At 500 ps, transient absorption spectra in the 500 -nm to 600 -nm range are independent of pump wavelength.
