5|$|After Armstrong {{served as}} backup {{commander}} for Apollo 8, Slayton offered him {{the post of}} commander of Apollo11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon. In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong's biography in 2005, Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Armstrong as commander, lunar module pilot Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> and command module pilot Michael Collins, he was offering the chance to replace <b>Aldrin</b> with Jim Lovell. After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with <b>Aldrin,</b> as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command. Replacing <b>Aldrin</b> with Lovell would have made Lovell the Lunar Module Pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number3 position of the crew.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong's {{second and}} last spaceflight was as {{commander}} of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969. Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> descended to {{the lunar surface}} and spent {{two and a half}} hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and <b>Aldrin,</b> Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978. Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Grissom {{was ranked}} as the #9 (tied with astronauts Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> and Alan Shepard) most popular space hero.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, the backup crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the Gemini 9 mission, scheduled for early June. Jim Lovell and Buzz <b>Aldrin,</b> who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the mission's backup crew, and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without the Gemini experience, it is unlikely that <b>Aldrin</b> would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Several books {{indicate}} early mission timelines had Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> {{rather than}} Neil Armstrong {{as the first}} man on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The G {{mission was}} {{achieved}} on Apollo 11 in July 1969 by an all-Gemini veteran crew consisting of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz <b>Aldrin.</b> Armstrong and <b>Aldrin</b> performed the first landing at the Sea of Tranquility at 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969. They spent {{a total of}} 21 hours, 36 minutes on the surface, and spent 2 hours, 31 minutes outside the spacecraft, walking on the surface, taking photographs, collecting material samples, and deploying automated scientific instruments, while continuously sending black-and-white television back to Earth. The astronauts returned safely on July 24.|$|E
5|$|Three new {{minerals}} {{were discovered}} in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, <b>Aldrin,</b> and Collins.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{inaccuracies}} in Gravity, Tyson, Plait and Parazynski {{said they}} enjoyed watching the film. <b>Aldrin</b> {{said he hoped}} that the film would stimulate the public to find an interest in space again, after decades of diminishing investments into advancements in the field.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Popular Sciences {{photo gallery}} {{included}} a photo that Armstrong took of <b>Aldrin</b> {{but his own}} image is visible on Aldrin's helmet {{as one of the}} best astronaut selfies.|$|E
5|$|More {{than one}} third of the United States' manned spaceflights have {{included}} MIT-educated astronauts (among them Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Buzz <b>Aldrin),</b> more than any university excluding the United States service academies. Alumnus and former faculty member Qian Xuesen was instrumental in the PRC rocket program.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor <b>Aldrin</b> was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. <b>Aldrin</b> stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{official}} NASA flight {{plan called for}} a crew rest period before extra-vehicular activity, Armstrong requested that the EVA be moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time. Once Armstrong and <b>Aldrin</b> were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, the hatch was opened and Armstrong {{made his way down}} the ladder first.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the crash}} {{did not affect}} space flight {{operations}} and the spacecraft itself was undamaged—it was shipped to NASA {{two days after the}} crash—the accident caused neither delays nor engineering changes in the U.S. space program. However, the loss of the Gemini 9 crew did cause NASA to reshuffle the crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and Apollo missions; Stafford and Cernan were moved up to the primary position for Gemini 9, re-designated Gemini 9A. Jim Lovell and Buzz <b>Aldrin,</b> who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the back-up crew for Gemini 9A, and through the normal rotation were then assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without experience during the Gemini mission, Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> would have been an unlikely choice for the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The Museum of Yugoslav History has {{collection}} from Yugoslav era. Beside paintings, {{the most}} valuable are Moon rocks donated by Apollo 11 crew Neil Armstrong, Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> and Michael Collins while visiting Belgrade in 1969 and from mission Apollo 17 donated by Richard Nixon in 1971. Museum also houses Joseph Stalin's sabre with 260 brilliants and diamonds, donated by Stalin himself.|$|E
5|$|While moving {{within the}} cabin, <b>Aldrin</b> accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift {{off from the}} Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, {{stranding}} them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch. Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.|$|E
5|$|An Apollo 1 mission patch {{was left}} on the Moon's surface after the first manned lunar landing by Apollo 11 crew members Neil Armstrong and Buzz <b>Aldrin.</b> The Apollo 15 mission {{left on the}} surface of the Moon a tiny {{memorial}} statue, Fallen Astronaut, along with a plaque containing the names of the Apollo 1 astronauts, among others including Soviet cosmonauts, who perished in the pursuit of human space flight.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's {{goal was}} {{accomplished}} on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> landed their Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and {{walked on the}} lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and <b>Aldrin</b> then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed {{a total of about}} 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, he was {{appointed}} an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society (HonFRS), the only amateur astronomer ever to achieve the distinction. In June 2002, he {{was appointed}} as the Honorary Vice-President of the Society for the History of Astronomy. Also in 2002, Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> presented him with a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for services to television. He was patron of Torquay Boys' Grammar School in south Devon. Moore had a long association with the University of Leicester and its Department of Physics and Astronomy, and was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science (HonDSc) degree in 1996 and a Distinguished Honorary Fellowship in 2008, the highest award that the university can bestow.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Shepard {{was ranked}} as the ninth most popular space hero (tied with astronauts Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> and Gus Grissom). In 2011, NASA honored Shepard with an Ambassador of Exploration Award, {{consisting}} of a Moon rock encased in Lucite, for his contributions to the U.S. space program. His family members accepted the award on his behalf during a ceremony on April 28 at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland, where it is on permanent display. On May 4, 2011, the U.S. Postal Service issued a first-class stamp in Shepard's honor, the first U.S. stamp to depict a specific astronaut. The first day of issue ceremony was held at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.|$|E
5|$|The Buzz on Maggie follows Maggie Pesky (Jessica DiCicco), an {{expressive}} tween fly and her family; parents Chauncey (Brian Doyle-Murray) and Frieda (Susan Tolsky); brothers <b>Aldrin</b> (David Kaufman) and Pupert (Thom Adcox); {{and sister}} Bella (Tara Strong), {{who is still}} a maggot. The family resides in an old milk carton in a suburban fly metropolis called Stickyfeet, which {{is located in a}} dump. Maggie has an ambitious and adventurous personality and aspires to become a rock star. Her approach to life often suffers unexpected consequences that puts herself in jeopardy, as she often follows her own impulses although they go against the rules or her parents' wishes. However, she ultimately learns her lesson, {{which was one of the}} core themes for the show's conception.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{population in}} Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – <b>aldrin,</b> dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, <b>Aldrin</b> joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 21½ total {{hours on the}} lunar surface, they had left behind {{scientific}} instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of {{the leadership of the}} US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management. (In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, <b>Aldrin</b> says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.|$|E
5|$|NASA takes both Homer and Barney to Cape Canaveral for training. As {{only one}} of them can go into space, they soon find {{themselves}} in competition. Under NASA's alcohol ban, the newly sober Barney quickly develops superior skills and is selected to fly with astronauts Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> and Race Banyon. However, when Barney toasts his victory with non-alcoholic champagne, he inexplicably reverts to his normal alcoholic self and escapes, stealing a jetpack and crashing into a nearby pillow factory. Homer wins by default and is selected for space flight, but after watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy involving space exploration, he becomes very nervous about going. Just as they prepare to take off in the Corvair space shuttle, Homer runs away. He talks with Marge on the phone, and she says that he ought {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity. He agrees, and the launch, which is also a Nielsen ratings smash, proceeds.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{had been}} {{competing}} with the US in landing {{a man on the}} Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V. Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and <b>Aldrin</b> took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying on}} her bridesmaid's dress in the TGS fitting room, Colleen, Sylvia Rossitano (Patti LuPone), and Verna Maroney (Jan Hooks) criticize Liz {{for not being}} married by now as she is in her late thirties, but Liz does not care what they think. Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about what her mother has revealed to her and ponders why her mother did not choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting {{to find out what}} her mother missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses {{that it was a good}} decision that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic. After her encounter with Buzz, Liz tells her mother that she respects the decision she made by not ending up with Buzz.|$|E
5|$|The season {{introduces}} Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) in {{the year}} 2030 as he sits his daughter and son down {{to tell them the}} story of how he met their mother. The story begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living in Manhattan with his two best friends from college: Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily <b>Aldrin</b> (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris). Ted begins his search for his perfect mate and meets an ambitious young reporter, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), whom he quickly falls in love with. Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Ted begins dating a baker, Victoria, but when she moves to Germany for a culinary fellowship, Ted leads Robin to believe that she broke up with him. As a result, Victoria breaks up with Ted and Robin begins to distance herself from him, though they eventually reconcile. As her wedding date approaches, Lily begins to wonder if she's missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking her engagement in the process. At the end of the season, Marshall is seen looking desolate and miserable, while Ted and Robin agree to pursue a relationship.|$|E

25|$|The {{fourth and}} final {{rearrangement}} of the Gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of See and Bassett when their trainer jet crashed, coincidentally into a McDonnell building which held their Gemini 9 capsule in St. Louis. The backup crew of Stafford and Cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the re-designated Gemini 9A. Lovell and <b>Aldrin</b> were moved from being the backup crew of Gemini 10 to be the backup crew of Gemini 9. This cleared {{the way through the}} crew rotation for Lovell and <b>Aldrin</b> to become the prime crew of Gemini 12.|$|E
25|$|In {{the video}} game Kerbal Space Program, there is a {{monument}} dedicated to Neil Armstrong and Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> on the Mun (the game's analogue of the Moon) at the exact coordinates where Apollo 11 landed in 1969 as an easter egg.|$|E
25|$|As of February 2016, {{seven of}} the twelve Apollo astronauts who landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972 still survive, {{including}} Buzz <b>Aldrin.</b> Also, nine of the twelve Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing between 1968 and 1972 still survive, including Michael Collins.|$|E
25|$|The Klapmeier {{brothers}} {{received the}} Living Legends of Aviation award in 2007 {{at a ceremony}} in Beverly Hills, California. Among the attendees that year were aerospace pioneers such as Bob Hoover, Buzz <b>Aldrin,</b> Steve Fossett, Michael Dorn, Patty Wagstaff, Cliff Robertson, Chuck Yeager, and many more.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Sax {{received}} the Horatio Alger Award, an honor given {{to those who}} have achieved the American dream through hard work and adversity. Other notable Horatio Alger Award winners include former U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Gerald R. Ford, and Ronald Reagan, McDonald’s founder Ray Kroc and former astronaut Buzz <b>Aldrin.</b>|$|E
25|$|In December 2016, Buzz <b>Aldrin</b> {{was visiting}} the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica, {{as part of}} a tourist group, when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to McMurdo Station and from there to Christchurch, New Zealand, where he was {{reported}} to be in stable condition. Aldrin's visit at age 86 makes him the oldest person to ever reach the South Pole.|$|E
