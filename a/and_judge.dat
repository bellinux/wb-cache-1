40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} factors affecting the evaluations of Judo referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> accredited with A, B and C licenses (n= 100 each) after observing four different throwing techniques from four directions. Referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> {{were asked to}} evaluate the throwing techniques without being allowed to freely select their field of view or {{hear the sound of}} impact between the thrown competitor and the mat. In addition, we investigated the reasons for differences in evaluations according to the direction of view by focusing on contact between the thrown competitor and the mat. 1. Significant interactions were observed for only one of the four throwing techniques. In addition, a significant main effect was observed for all four throwing techniques. Based on these findings, the following factors appeared to influence the evaluations made by the referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> with regard to throwing techniques: 1) direction of view, 2) refereeing level, and 3) a combination of both the direction of view and refereeing level. In addition, differences in evaluations were considered highly likely to have been caused by individual effects related to the direction of view and the level of refereeing. 2. When the execution of a throwing technique prevents referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> from clearly observing body contact with the mat, the technique is evaluated by considering the series of body movements and estimating contact between the body and the mat based on available visual data. This may also result in differences of evaluation. 3. The average scores awarded for throwing techniques by A- and B-licensed referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> were significantly higher than those awarded by C-licensed referees <b>and</b> <b>judges.</b> Although the difference between A- and B-licensed referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> did not reach significance, A-licensed referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> tended to award higher average scores than B-licensed referees <b>and</b> <b>judges.</b> This suggests that more qualified referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> evaluate throwing techniques more accurately. The {{reason for this is that}} less qualified referees <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> tend to undervalue throwing techniques...|$|R

Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, <b>and</b> <b>judge</b> all at once.|$|E
5|$|It {{has already}} proven {{difficult}} {{to be recognized as}} having standing when a fix is not used for a controversial appointment.

Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E
