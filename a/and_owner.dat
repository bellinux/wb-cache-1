40|$|Abstract: Canine von Willebrand’s disease – {{knowledge}} and awareness among dog breed-ers <b>and</b> <b>owners</b> in Poland. Von Willebrand’s dis-ease (vWD), {{one of the}} most common congenital bleeding diatheses caused by a de ¿ cient or de-fective von Willebrand’s factor (vWF), is found in different breeds of dogs. The objective of the study was to perform a preliminary analysis of the {{knowledge and}} awareness of von Willebrand’s disease among dog breeders <b>and</b> <b>owners</b> in Po-land. The online survey was addressed to dog breeders <b>and</b> <b>owners,</b> comprised 25 questions and was voluntary and anonymous. It was placed on 12 thematic Internet forums dedicated to differ-ent breeds of dogs. The respondents provided 231 answers, 76 of which were complete. The results of the survey indicate that the dog breeders <b>and</b> <b>owners</b> are highly interested in genetic tests and want more general access to scienti ¿ c informa-tion. By their own admission, the dog <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> breeders have partly insuf ¿ cient knowledge about vWD. Considerable gaps in their knowl-edge about other issues (including breeding work) were also evidenced. Being a contribution to the discussion about canine vWD, this article high-lighted the need to improve the education of dog breeders <b>and</b> <b>owners,</b> <b>and</b> to make them aware of their role in canine health care...|$|R
