40|$|Appointment systems try {{to achieve}} {{a balance between the}} time the doctor waits for {{patients}} to arrive and the time patients spend waiting to be seen. Mathematical analysis reveals that the time a patient can expect to wait increases exponentially as the <b>appointment</b> <b>interval</b> is reduced. An <b>appointment</b> <b>interval</b> that is less than the median consultation length can result in long waits for patients with no saving of time for the doctor. More frequent, shorter surgeries can save time for patients with no increase in the doctor's waiting time. Methods of improving the efficiency of use of surgery time are discussed...|$|E
40|$|If {{outpatient}} care {{is to be}} made {{acceptable to}} the patient and still remain efficient, some balance between the patients' waiting time and the doctors' idle time must be achieved. Examination {{of the literature on}} the subject and of three specific waiting-time studies revealed that there are at least seven variables affecting this relationship: <b>appointment</b> <b>interval,</b> service time, patients' arrival pattern, number of no-shows, number of walk-ins, physicians' arrival pattern, and interruptions in patient services...|$|E
30|$|This {{study had}} been able, {{for the first}} time in this country, to collect {{perception}} on the public FMSs in many significant domains of clinical practices from PHCPs of almost all categories, at the three main health care facilities, in a nationwide cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. We found that there was an overall positive perception on FMS professionalism, clinical competency and ethical practice. FMS were perceived to provide effective and safe treatment to their patients; equal care was provided disregard of patient’s social background, and FMSs were perceived to safeguard patient’s confidentiality. While some of these clinical attributes were perceived to be outstanding in the FMSs, the results also showed areas of concerns such as in doing home visit, patient referral, walk-in consultation and <b>appointment</b> <b>interval.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} design of a {{healthcare}} appointment system with a single physician and a group of patients whose service durations are stochastic. The challenge is to find the optimal arrival sequence for a group of mixed patients such that the expected total cost of patient waiting time and physician overtime is minimized. While numerous simulation studies report that sequencing patients by increasing order of variance of service duration (Smallest-Variance-First or SVF rule) performs extremely well in many environments, analytical results on optimal sequencing are known only for two patients. In this paper, we shed light on why it is so difficult to prove the optimality of the SVF rule in general. We first assume that the <b>appointment</b> <b>intervals</b> are fixed according to a given template and analytically investigate the optimality of the SVF rule. In particular, we show that the optimality of the SVF rule depends on two important factors: the number of patients in the system and the shape of service time distributions. The SVF rule {{is more likely to be}} optimal if the service time distributions are more positively skewed, but this advantage gradually disappears as the number of patients increases. These results partly explain why the optimality of the SVF rule can only be proved for a small number of patients, and why in practice, the SVF rule is usually observed to be superior, since most empirical distributions of the service durations are positively skewed, like log-normal distributions. The insights obtained from our analytical model apply to more general settings, including the cases where the service durations follow log-normal distributions and the <b>appointment</b> <b>intervals</b> are optimized...|$|R
40|$|We {{address a}} {{critical}} aspect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up: poor clinic organization leading to long waiting times and reduced patient retention. Using a {{before and after}} study design, time and motion studies and qualitative methods we evaluated the impact of triage and longer clinic <b>appointment</b> <b>intervals</b> (triage) on clinic efficiency in a community-based program in Uganda. We compared time waiting to see and time spent with providers for various patient categories and examined patient and provider satisfaction with the triage. Overall, median time spent at the clinic reduced from 206 to 83 min. Total median time waiting to see providers for stable-ART patients reduced from 102 to 20 min while that for patients undergoing ART preparation reduced 88 - 37 min. Improved patient flow, patient and provider satisfaction and reduced waiting times allowed for service delivery to more patients using the same staff following the implementation of triage...|$|R

30|$|Perception of PHCPs {{who worked}} closely with FMS was an {{essential}} piece of feedback information to primary health care in this country. This study had provided an opportunity for other primary healthcare providers, hospital specialists and administrative staff at the health offices to feedback on the FMSs’ roles and performance. It had also provided family medicine specialty and specialists an invaluable source of data for self-reflection. We reported that PHCPs had overall positive perception on FMS across all the domains investigated. PHCPs from non-hospital health care facilities and who had higher frequency of encounter with FMSs had more positive perceptions. Discrepancy between perceptions and the relevance of certain clinical practices such as home visit {{may need to be}} communicated locally. Having shorter <b>appointment</b> <b>interval</b> and allowing walk-in consultation would be the areas of improvement in FMSs’ family practice. FMSs might need support to increase their research visibility by involving more in research activity at the local clinic/community levels and contribute to scientific writing and publication.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{copyright}} restrictions, {{the access}} to {{the full text of}} this article is only available via subscription. This paper investigates two approaches to patient classification: using patient classification only for sequencing patient appointments at the time of booking and using patient classification for both sequencing and <b>appointment</b> <b>interval</b> adjustment. In the latter approach, appointment intervals are adjusted to match the consultation time characteristics of different patient classes. Our simulation results indicate that new appointment systems that utilize interval adjustment for patient class are successful in improving doctors' idle time, doctors' overtime and patients' waiting times without any trade-offs. Best performing appointment systems are identified for different clinic environments characterized characterized by walk-ins, no-shows, the percentage of new patients, and the ratio of the mean consultation time of new patients to the mean consultation time of return patients. As a result, practical guidelines are developed for managers who are responsible for designing appointment systems...|$|E
30|$|This is {{the first}} study to {{evaluate}} treatment duration, number of appointments, and factors associated to these outcomes with SFA in two centers. One of the most highlighted benefits of SFA is the reduction in treatment duration. Recently, a systematic review evaluated a few retrospective cohort studies and {{a larger number of}} case reports treated with SFA [13]. The results showed that the majority of cases were treated under a year. This agrees with our findings which show an average treatment duration of 10.5  months. This is a clear advantage over the conventional approach where treatment times {{have been reported in the}} realm of 18 – 36  months [1, 5 – 7]. It should be noted that the number of appointments is slightly higher than in the conventional approach where patients are seen on a once-a-month visit schedule. This is because the patients are scheduled on a shorter <b>appointment</b> <b>interval</b> schedule (usually 2 – 3  weeks). Our average number of appointment is however far less than the 22 orthodontic appointments reported by a recent study evaluating 45 consecutive patients treated with SFA [14].|$|E

It was a cross-sectional descriptive study carried out in a family practice clinic over a one-month period in 2004. Those who failed to turn up for scheduled appointments were interviewed by telephone based on a structured questionnaire. Out of 671 patients, the non-attendance rate was 16. 7. Sixty-seven percent of non-attenders were successfully interviewed. Males (p= 0. 01), Indians (p= 0. 015), patients with coronary artery disease (p= 0. 017), multiple diseases (>= 4) (p= 0. 036) and shorter <b>appointment</b> <b>intervals</b> (p= 0. 001) were more likely to default. The main reasons for non-attendance were: forgot the appointment dates (32. 9), not feeling well (12. 3), administrative errors (19. 1) and work or family commitments (8. 2). The majority would prefer a reminder through telephone (71. 4), followed by letters (41. 3). In conclusion, appropriate intervention could be taken based on the reasons identified in this study...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{methods for}} {{tracking}} mobile sinks in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) often incur considerable energy consumption and overhead. To address this issue, we propose a Detour-Aware Mobile Sink Tracking (DAMST) method via analysis of movement angle changes of mobile sinks, {{for collecting data}} in a low-overhead and energy efficient way. In the proposed method, while a mobile sink passes through a region, it appoints a specific node as a region agent to collect information of the whole region, and records nodes near or on its trajectory as footprints. If it needs information from the region agent in a future time it will construct an energy efficient path from the region agent to itself by calculating its own movement angles according to the footprints, as well as getting rid of detours by analyzing these movement angles. Finally, {{the performance of the}} tracking method is evaluated systematically under different trajectory patterns and footprint <b>appointment</b> <b>intervals.</b> The simulation results consolidate that DAMST has advantages in reducing energy consumption and data overhead...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} {{follow-up}} after potentially curative treatment {{of breast cancer}} remains controversial. Recurrence-free women (n = 402) attending a breast clinic over a 3 month period were studied. The women attended 423 appointments, 412 of which were routine. Eleven were requested by the patient or general practitioner (<b>interval</b> <b>appointments).</b> All 11 <b>interval</b> and 19 of the routine appointments resulted in investigations for possible recurrence. Three (27 %) <b>interval</b> <b>appointments</b> and four (1 %) routine appointments resulted in the diagnosis of a recurrence (P < 10 (- 5). The attitudes of 285 patients to follow-up were investigated by questionnaire. Two hundred and twenty-three (78 %) questionnaires were completed. Regular follow-up in the breast clinic was preferred to attendance only when symptomatic by 190 (85 %) women and 169 (76 %) preferred regular breast clinic visits to general practitioner follow-up. Most women (n = 174) (81 %) said they felt reassured and less anxious having attended the breast clinic. Routine follow-up after potentially curative treatment of breast cancer is inefficient in the detection of recurrence. It is, however, highly rated for providing reassurance and reducing anxiety. Reassurance rather than detection of recurrence {{may be the most}} important function of the breast cancer follow-up clinic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Outpatient {{department}} {{has the responsibility}} of providing patient with timely access to the health care. This paper consider an Inflammatory Bowel Disease outpatient department in University Medical Center Groningen(UMCG), where doctor resource shortage led to excessive delays of patients’ admission time. So how to more efficiently utilize the doctor resources is the research problem of the paper. In searching the literature we found that appointment scheduling and resource allocation could jointly influence the management decisions, so we assess the current system through both sides and define 4 bottlenecks in achieving resource efficiency. These bottleneck are 1) Insufficient treatment protocol 2) Insufficient resource assignment rule 3) In sufficient <b>appointment</b> <b>interval</b> design and inefficient process of health delivery to control patients and 4) Insufficient execution of access priority and insufficient patient classification. Towards those bottlenecks, a re-examine of literature is conducted to explore for the possibilities of improvement. At the same time, specialist’s suggestion provide us with additional inspirations of redesign. Finally, {{by focusing on the}} bottleneck of insufficient execution of access priority, a scheduling heuristic search is performed to come out with a feasible improvement plan for the IBD clinic.

40|$|Essay one. Examines factors {{associated}} with patients who miss scheduled physician appointments at outpatient clinics, focusing on scheduling effects and individual patient behavior. These clinics consist of many patients who carry private insurance and have choice in where to seek treatment; clinics suffer high rates of no shows {{when there is a}} delay in being able to see the doctor. Lead time, or call <b>appointment</b> <b>interval,</b> indicates a mismatch in supply and demand and contributes to cancelled or missed appointments. Secondary factors for missed appointments include prior patient history of cancelling or not showing, patient age and financial source; typically insurance provider. ^ Essay two. Analyzes arrivals of patients at an outpatient clinic of the Indiana University Medical Group in efforts to improve patient flow and understand how variability in the arrivals and registration of patients affects waiting times. Queuing concepts were used to uncover sources of variability and to generate ideas for improvement in scheduling of patients and clinic resources that would mitigate the undesirable effect of variability. Proposed improvements steps include the reduction in inter-arrival variability, utilizing pooled queues, implementing one piece flow to prevent batching and the reduction of interruptions, particularly from overflow phone calls. A simulation model corresponding to the value stream map was developed. An implication of our study is that a systematic application of Queuing and Six Sigma concepts combined with simulation modeling can be effective in identifying opportunities for improving patient flow in challenging health care delivery environments. ^ Essay three. Explores the call in process to outpatient clinics. An organization with 4 clinics and an overflow facility is analyzed with simulation models and historic phone logs to assess performance levels at the facilities. Clinics may have the capacity to handle the calls, but variation in phone system performance is largely a result of responsiveness and availability of staff members to answer the phones. The most successful facility provides detailed performance benchmarks and coaches employees to improve. Medical facilities that rely on workers to multitask need to have assessment tools similar to larger call centers. ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{contribution}} of competing demands to changes in hypoglycemic medications and to return <b>appointment</b> <b>intervals</b> for patients with type 2 diabetes and an elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (A 1 c) level. METHODS We observed 211 primary care encounters by adult patients with type 2 diabetes in 20 primary care clinics and documented changes in hypoglycemic medications. Competing demands were assessed from length of encounter, num-ber of concerns patients raised, and number of topics brought up by the clini-cian. Days to the next scheduled appointment were obtained at patient checkout. Recent A 1 c values and dates were determined from the chart. RESULTS Among patients with an A 1 c level greater than 7 %, each additional patient concern {{was associated with a}} 49 % (95 % confi dence interval, 35 %- 60 %) reduction in the likelihood of a change in medication, independent of length of the encounter and most recent level of A 1 c. Among patients with an A 1 c level greater than 7 % and no change in medication, for every additional minute of encounter length, the time to the next scheduled appointment decreased by 2. 8 days (P =. 001). Similarly, for each additional 1 % increase in A 1 c level, the time to the next scheduled appointment decreased by 8. 6 days (P =. 001). CONCLUSIONS The concept of clinical inertia is limited and does not fully charac-terize the complexity of primary care encounters. Competing demands is a princi-ple for constructing models of primary care encounters that are more congruent with reality and should be considered in the design of interventions to improve chronic disease outcomes in primary care settings.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Alternative {{medicine}} (AM) encompasses {{all forms}} of therapies that fall outside the mainstream of medical practice. Its popularity is on the increase. Because previous surveys were limited and not generalizable, we estimated the prevalence, pattern and factors associated with use of AM in the community. Subjects and Methods: A multistage cluster cross-sectional household survey was conducted among Saudi residents of the Riyadh region. Data were collected in 2003 by trained interviewers from primary health care centers using a specially designed questionnaire. Results: Of 1408 individuals participating in the study, 39 &#x 0025; were men. The mean (&#x 00 B 1;SD) age for the study pop [...] ulation was 35. 5 (&#x 00 B 1; 13. 9) years. Sixty-eight {{percent of the respondents}} had used AM during the last 12 months. The Holy Quran as a therapy was the most frequently used AM (50. 3 &#x 0025;), followed by honey (40. 1 &#x 0025;), black seed (39. 2 &#x 0025;) and myrrh (35. 4 &#x 0025;). The health belief model was found {{to be the most important}} determinant of AM use. Factors independently associated with AM use included perceived failure of medical treatment, the perceived success of AM, a preference for natural materials, and long <b>appointment</b> <b>intervals</b> to see physicians. Conclusions and Recommendations: There is a high prevalence of AM use in the Riyadh region and the most important determinant of AM use was the perceived failure of medical treatment. The study results call for intensive health education campaigns in the media addressing wrong beliefs regarding AM and modern medicine. The popularity of AM in this community should alert decision makers to look at the difficult accessibility to the health system...|$|R
40|$|A {{temporally}} based {{theory of}} attending is proposed that {{assumes that the}} structure of world events affords different attending modes. Future-oriented attending supports anticipatory behaviors and occurs with highly coherent temporal events. Time judgments, given this attending mode, axe influenced by the way an event's ending confirms or violates temporal expectancies. Analytic attending supports other activities (e. g., grouping, counting), and if it occurs with events of low temporal coherence, then time judgments depend on the attending levels involved. A weighted contrast model describes over- and underestimations of event durations. The model applies to comparative duration judgments of equal and unequal time intervals; its rationale extends to temporal productions/extrapolations. Two experiments compare predictions of the contrast model with those derived from other traditional approaches. One characteristic of modern society is a preoccupation with fixed time schedules and standardized timekeepers.

40|$|Non-surgical {{periodontal}} therapy, including patient motivation, {{instruction in}} oral hygiene and thorough scaling and root planing {{has been shown}} to be an acceptable and effective treatment for chronic destructive periodontitis. Even in deep periodontal pockets clinical attachment levels may be maintained by scaling and root planing alone provided that effective plaque control is assured by recall <b>appointments</b> at regular <b>intervals.</b> Even if personal oral hygiene procedures do not reach the required standard of perfection, non-surgical periodontal therapy may significantly delay the loss of periodontal attachment. Scaling and root planing are best performed with hand instruments. Ultrasonic devices save some time but leave rough root surfaces which are highly susceptible to the accumulation of further subgingival plaque. The intervals at which scaling and root planing have to be performed in order to alter successfully the pathogenic subgingival flora and to maintain a flora consistent with periodontal health have not been conclusively established. The limitations of non-surgical periodontal therapy lie within the operator's skill at gaining access to all root surfaces in furcations and deep periodontal pockets. Non-surgical periodontal therapy may have to extend over long time periods. For this reason, limited flap surgery in order to gain access to root surfaces, which would otherwise be too time-consuming to treat with scaling and root planing alone, might still be valuable. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims. Trauma {{is one of}} {{the major}} factors {{associated}} with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD). These disorders result from macro-trauma or micro-trauma. Macro-trauma might be iatrogenic; for example, from intubation procedures, third molar extraction procedures, and lengthy dental appointments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of lengthy root canal therapy (more than 2 hours) on TMJ and its supporting structures. Materials and methods. Eighty patients whose root canal therapy session lasted more than 2 hours were examined for the status of TMJ and masticatory muscles. After one week the second part of the examination was carried out for TMJ problems and pain and tenderness levels of masticatory muscles. Data was analyzed using Wilcoxon statistical test. Results. Women showed more pain compared to men. There was a significant increase in pain in the external acoustic meatus examination one week after root canal therapy. Patients who were treated for their posterior teeth suffered more pain than those who were treated for the anteriors and premolars. Other aspects of the examination were not affected significantly by lengthy root canal therapy. Conclusion. Lengthy dental treatments can harm TMJ and masticatory muscles and wide opening of the mouth during such appointments can worsen the situation. Therefore, it is wise to break the <b>appointment</b> into shorter <b>intervals</b> and let the patients rest during treatment to close their mouth to prevent iatrogenic damage to TMJ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Breast cancer {{patients}} are routinely followed after primary treatment. Many intensive diagnostic methods (tumor markers, chest X-ray, mammography, liver echography, bonescans) areperformed periodically. However, {{it remains to}} bedetermined howoften attempts {{should be made to}} detect the first recurrence of breast cancer by these methods. Methods: To evaluate the effect of imaging diagnosis andtumormarkers, we analyzed methods of detection of first recurrence sites during intensive follow-up of breast {{cancer patients}}. Results: Of 550 female patients who had been surgically treated between July 1992 and December 1996, 65 recurrent cases had been diagnosed as of December 1997. Thirty cases (46 %) had been found as a result of symptoms related to the site of recurrence and 14 cases (22 %) were detected by physical examination. In the remaining 21 cases (32 %), detection was by other methods: in eightcases by imaging diagnosis, in three cases based on abnormal tumor markers and in 10 cases by imaging diagnosis andabnormal tumormarkers. Twenty-nine cases (45 %) followed every 1 - 3 months had presented with symptoms at routine or <b>interval</b> <b>appointments.</b> There was a significant difference between first recurrence sites (loco-regional, bone and viscera) and the methods of detection (symptoms, physical examination and other diagnostic methods) (P < 0. 0001). However, no statistical difference in overall survival after operation was observed between the 30 casesfound as a result of symptoms and the 35 cases detected by physical examination or otherdiagnostic methods. Conclusions: Taken together with ASCO's surveillance guidelines (J Clin Oneal 1997; 15 : 2149 - 56), intensive follow-up of breast cancer patients should be limited to high-risk breastcancerpatients, especially thosewhoenterrandomized clinical trials. A careful history and physical examination are in practice indicated every 3 - 6 months for 3 years and then every 6 months for the following 2 years.

40|$|Abstract Background Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} is {{a chronic}} inflammatory condition {{that affects the}} joints causing unpredictable episodes of pain, stiffness and disability. People with rheumatoid arthritis usually require lifelong specialist follow-up but frequently have periods when their disease can be managed through self-care or that provided by their general practitioner. Compared to the traditional clinician-driven care in rheumatoid arthritis, patient-initiated care {{has proven to be}} more beneficial in terms of reducing unnecessary medical reviews, providing greater satisfaction to patients and staffs and maintaining the patient’s physical and psychological status. We aim to evaluate the implementation of a patient-initiated review system in a routine secondary care rheumatology service in a public hospital in England, where patients get the opportunity to self-manage their disease by requesting specialist reviews at times of need instead of clinician-scheduled appointments. Methods/design Three hundred and eighty patients attending routine review at Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust will be randomised to either enrol immediately into a patient-initiated review system (direct access group), or to be seen regularly by a clinician at the hospital (regular clinician-initiated group). Patients (or their general practitioner) in the direct access group can arrange a review by calling a rheumatology nurse-led advice line that enables telephone delivered clinical advice, or where appropriate, an appointment with a rheumatologist within 10 working days. Patients in the regular clinician-initiated group will attend their planned <b>appointments</b> at regular <b>intervals</b> during the intervening period of 12 months. The primary outcome of interest is patient satisfaction; secondary outcomes include service use, waiting times and clinical measures. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews will be conducted with a subset of patients and staff with the aim of identifying facilitators/barriers in implementing patient-initiated clinics. Discussion The implementation of a patient-initiated review system in routine care rheumatology will replace the fixed clinician-driven review system with a more flexible patient-driven system where patients usually self-manage their disease, but can request prompt help when required. We believe that this study will enable a comparison of the changes in local services and will be helpful in exploring the benefits/drawbacks of such implementation, thus providing lessons for implementation in other hospitals and for other chronic diseases. </p...|$|R
