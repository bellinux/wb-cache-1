5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active <b>at</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>and</b> dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|The {{call of the}} Siberian accentor is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly <b>at</b> <b>dawn,</b> <b>and</b> some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|E
5|$|The pursuit resumed {{the next}} day <b>at</b> <b>dawn,</b> <b>and</b> was {{followed}} by yet another action at the Battle of Ratisbon, where the Austrians tried to delay the French pursuit. After fierce fighting, during which Nansouty's and Saint-Sulpice's men successfully charged the enemy cavalry three times, the French captured the citadel at Ratisbon, but saw the Austrians skilfully retreating. Nansouty was left at Ratisbon with Davout, to observe the retreat of Archduke Charles.|$|E

5|$|Primarily a nocturnal grazer, the bohor reedbuck {{may also}} feed at daytime. A {{study showed that}} feeding peaked <b>at</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>and</b> late afternoon. In the night, two feeding peaks were {{observed}} once again: at dusk and midnight. They traverse {{a long way from}} their daytime refuges while grazing. Seasonal differences in {{the amount of time spent}} while grazing in a particular area is possibly related to the availability and quality of grasses there. The bohor reedbuck often grazes in association with other grazers such as hartebeest, topi, puku and kob. In Kenyan farmlands, the reedbuck may feed on growing wheat and cereals.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructing a {{timetable}} for {{the day of the}} battle is tentative due to ambiguous statements in Ammianus (which may have been caused by manuscript copying-errors). It appears that Julian's army set forth <b>at</b> <b>dawn,</b> <b>and</b> apparently arrived within sight of the barbarian entrenchments (vallum) outside Strasbourg at around midday, after a march of 21 Roman miles. (A contradictory statement in Julian's speech implies that the army was still far off its destination and faced a night march to reach it. But this is incompatible with all the other available data and should thus probably be disregarded). The starting-point was probably Saverne, since this is the last stated location of Julian's army, and it lay a consistent distance from Strasbourg on the Roman highway.|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly {{during the day}} and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet {{consists}} of invertebrates (such as beetle grubs, earthworms, and caterpillars), fruits, and berries. It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with grass or other soft materials. It {{is one of the first}} birds to sing <b>at</b> <b>dawn,</b> <b>and</b> its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.|$|E

5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} browses {{primarily}} at dusk or <b>at</b> <b>dawn,</b> <b>and</b> {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala. The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E
5|$|Although Theophilos's {{principal}} commanders, Theophobos and the Domestic of the Schools Manuel, both advised for {{a surprise}} night attack, the Emperor sided with {{the opinion of the}} other officers and resolved to wait and launch his attack on the next day. The Byzantine army attacked <b>at</b> <b>dawn,</b> <b>and</b> initially made good progress: they drove back one wing of the opposite army, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the Arabs. Near noon, Theophilos resolved to reinforce the other wing, and detached 2,000 Byzantines and the Kurdish contingent to do so, abandoning his post and passing behind his own army's lines. At this point, however, Afshin launched his Turkish horse-archers in a ferocious counter-attack which stymied the Byzantine advance and allowed the Arab forces to regroup. The Byzantine troops then noticed the emperor's absence, and, thinking he had been killed, began to waver. This soon turned into a disorderly retreat; some men fled as far as Constantinople, bringing with them the rumour that the Emperor had been killed. Some units, however, were apparently able to retreat in good order and assemble at a place called Chiliokomon.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of August 22–23, the North Koreans {{launched}} a weak attack against the 27th Infantry, which was quickly repulsed. Just before 12:00 on August 23, however, a violent action occurred some distance behind the front line when about 100 North Korean soldiers, undetected, succeeded in reaching the positions of K Company, 27th Infantry and of the 1st Platoon, C Company, 65th Engineer Combat Battalion. They overran parts of these positions before being driven off and suffering 50 killed. Meanwhile, as ordered by Walker, the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, after repelling several North Korean night attacks, counterattacked <b>at</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>and</b> seized the high ground overlooking the road at the artillery positions. At {{the same time the}} 3rd Battalion started an all-day attack that swept a stretch of high ground east of the road. This action largely cleared the North Koreans from the area behind and on the flanks of the 27th Infantry. At 13:35, Michaelis reported from the Bowling Alley to Eighth Army that the KPA 13th Division had blown the road to his front, had mined it, and was withdrawing.|$|E

5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks <b>at</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>and</b> dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
5|$|Four {{species of}} bird have been {{observed}} visiting the flowers of B.telmatiaea: the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and the brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta). The introduced European honeybee (Apis mellifera) is also commonly observed, and visits by ants and Hylaeus plasterer bees have been recorded. Visits by nectarivorous mammals have not been directly observed, but their involvement in pollination is certain, as their scats have often been found on inflorescences, and studies of other Banksia species have consistently demonstrated their involvement. Moreover, a number of characteristics of the B.telmatiaea spike are purported to be adaptations to pollination by nocturnal mammals: the strong, musky odour, the occurrence of inflorescences hidden within the foliage close to the ground, the large amounts of nectar produced, and the pattern of nectar production, which peaks <b>at</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>and</b> dusk. This last adaptation is thought to favour visits by birds and mammals, which feed {{in the morning and}} evening respectively, as opposed to insects, which are most active during the day.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus is a third-person action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Ready <b>at</b> <b>Dawn</b> <b>and</b> Santa Monica Studio, {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). It was first released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld console on March 4, 2008. The game is the fourth installment in the God of War series, the second chronologically, and a prequel to the original God of War. It is loosely based on Greek mythology and set in ancient Greece, with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls Kratos, a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. Kratos is guided by the goddess Athena, who instructs him to find the Sun God Helios, as the Dream God Morpheus has caused many of the gods to slumber in Helios' absence. With {{the power of the}} Sun and the aid of the Titan Atlas, Morpheus and the Queen of the Underworld Persephone intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn Olympus.|$|E

5|$|On March 12, all South Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had survived the North Vietnamese assault gathered {{at the headquarters of}} the 23rd Infantry Division and Hoa Binh airfield. Unfortunately, those soldiers were without their leaders, because both Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang were captured by the North Vietnamese {{in the early hours of}} the day. From Saigon, President Nguyen Van Thieu ordered Phu to hold all South Vietnamese positions at the eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, where they could stage a counter-attack. Phu drew up a plan to retake Ban Me Thuot that would involve the last two remaining regiments (44th and 45th Infantry Regiments) of the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and the {{soldiers who}} had gathered at the 23rd Infantry Division headquarters and Hoa Binh airfield. Thieu approved the plan <b>at</b> <b>dawn,</b> <b>and</b> authorised Phu to make full use of three Republic of Vietnam Air Force units (6th Air Force Division belonging to the ARVN 2nd Brigade, 1st Air Force Division at Da Nang Air Base, and the 4th Air Force Division at Cần Thơ).|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans, worms, and small bony fish. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the {{epaulette shark}}'s diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs, with juveniles taking mostly {{the former and}} adults mostly the latter. It hunts most actively <b>at</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>and</b> dusk, though feeding can occur {{at any time during}} the day. This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey. It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular buccal cavity. While searching for food, the epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits. Unlike most sharks, the epaulette shark may chew its food for up to 510 minutes. Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard-shelled prey.|$|E
