40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} pathologically confirmed <b>Alexander’s</b> <b>disease</b> in which serial cranial ultrasound studies demon-strated unique findings of enlarging subependymal cysts with evolving periventricular hyperechogenicity. Computed to-mographic scan of the head showed low attenuation of the periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale.

5000|$|<b>Alexander</b> <b>disease</b> {{belongs to}} leukodystrophies, {{a group of}} {{diseases}} that affect the growth or development of the myelin sheath. The destruction of white matter in the brain is accompanied by the formation of fibrous, eosinophilic deposits known as Rosenthal fibers.

50|$|<b>Alexander</b> <b>disease,</b> {{also known}} as {{fibrinoid}} leukodystrophy, is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. It is a rare genetic disorder and mostly affects infants and children, causing developmental delay and changes in physical characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{condition}} {{directly related}} to GFAP is <b>Alexander</b> <b>disease,</b> a rare genetic disorder. Its symptoms include mental and physical retardation, dementia, enlargement {{of the brain and}} head, spasticity (stiffness of arms and/or legs), and seizures. The cellular mechanism of the disease is the presence of cytoplasmic accumulations containing GFAP and heat shock proteins, known as Rosenthal fibers. Mutations in the coding region of GFAP have been shown to contribute to the accumulation of Rosenthal fibers. Some of these mutations have been proposed to be detrimental to cytoskeleton formation as well as an increase in caspase 3 activity, which would lead to increased apoptosis of cells with these mutations. GFAP therefore {{plays an important role in}} the pathogenesis of <b>Alexander</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Alexander</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} affecting the midbrain and cerebellum {{of the central}} nervous system.

It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, such that {{the child of a}} parent with the disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition, if the parent is heterozygotic. However, most cases arise de novo as the result of sporadic mutations.|$|E
50|$|Many genetic {{conditions}} {{are associated with}} macrocephaly, including familial macrocephaly related to the holgate gene, autism, PTEN mutations such as Cowden disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis; overgrowth syndromes such as Sotos syndrome (cerebral gigantism), Weaver syndrome, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (bulldog syndrome), and macrocephaly-capillary malformation (M-CMTC) syndrome; neurocardiofacial-cutaneous syndromes such as Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, Gorlin Syndrome, (also known as Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome) and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome; Fragile X syndrome; leukodystrophies (brain white matter degeneration) such as <b>Alexander</b> <b>disease,</b> Canavan disease, and megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts; and glutaric aciduria type 1 and D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} nearly forty {{different}} types of leukodystrophies, many are lacking in formal and comprehensive research. Most of the research {{so far has been}} done on five types: (1) Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD), (2) Krabbe Disease, (3) X-Linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), (4) Canavan Disease, and (5) <b>Alexander</b> <b>Disease.</b> Each type of leukodystrophy has a unique pathophysiology, but all five of these in some way affect a subset of glial cells, therefore disrupting myelin production and maintenance, and usually involve a mutation involving genes that code for enzymes necessary for the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) that are toxic to the myelin-producing cells of the central nervous system.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{expression}} of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is {{a hallmark of}} gliosis, the astrocytic hypertrophy that occurs during {{a wide variety of}} diseases of the central nervous system. To determine whether this increase in GFAP expression per se alters astrocyte function, we generated transgenic mice that carry copies of the human GFAP gene driven by its own promoter. Astrocytes of these mice are hypertrophic, up-regulate small heat-shock proteins, and contain inclusion bodies identical histologically and antigenically to the Rosenthal fibers of <b>Alexander's</b> <b>disease.</b> Mice in the highest expressing lines die by the second postnatal week.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the significance of}} the accumulation of alpha B-crystallin in Rosenthal fibers within astrocytes, the expression and metabolism of alpha B-crystallin in glioma cell lines were examined under the conditions of heat and oxidative stress. alpha B-crystallin mRNA was increased after both stresses, and alpha B-crystallin protein moved from a detergent-soluble to a detergent-insoluble form. In addition, Western blotting of <b>Alexander's</b> <b>disease</b> brain homogenates revealed that the 27 -kd heat shock protein (HSP 27), which is related to alpha B-crystallin, accumulates along with alpha B-crystallin. The presence of HSP 27 in Rosenthal fibers was directly demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Our results suggest that astrocytes in <b>Alexander's</b> <b>disease</b> may be involved in an as yet unknown kind of stress reaction that causes the accumulation of alpha B-crystallin and HSP 27 and results in Rosenthal fiber formation...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Alexander</b> <b>disease</b> {{is unique}} from the leukodystrophies {{mentioned}} above {{in that it}} is the result of spontaneous mutation, that is it is not inherited. This means that the mutation found in the infected individual is not found in either of his or her parents. It is due to the accumulation of Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) {{as the result of a}} mutation in the GFAP gene; which, rather than being found in association with lysosomes or peroxisomes, is an intermediate filament linked to the nuclear envelope. [...] Intermediate filaments are proteins responsible for the makeup of the cellular cytoskeleton, and thus this type of mutation is involved in malfunctioning structural development of the cells. In fact, cytoskeletal and transporter molecule defects have been observed in the astrocytes (type of glial cell) of affected individuals. These astrocytes have an unhealthily large amount of GFAP that affects astrocyte formation and function.|$|E
50|$|Currently, no {{research}} has shown a higher prevalence of most leukodsytrophy types in any one place around the world. There is, however, a higher prevalence of the Canavan disease in the Jewish population for unknown reasons. 1 in 40 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are carriers of Canavan disease. This estimates to roughly 2.5%. Additionally, due to an autosomal recessive inheritance patterns, {{there is no significant}} difference found between affected males and affected females for most types of leukodystrophy including, but not limited to, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, Canavan disease, and <b>Alexander</b> <b>disease.</b> The one exception to this is any type of leukodystrophy carried on a sex chromosome, such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which is carried on the X-chromosome. Because of the inheritance pattern of X-linked diseases, males are more often affected by this type of leukodystrophy, although female carriers are often symptomatic, though not as severely so as males.

40|$|AbstractThe {{phosphorylation}} of α-crystallin B was {{studied in}} homogenates of autopsy samples of brain tissue from patients with <b>Alexander's</b> <b>disease,</b> a condition characterized by over-expression of this protein. After incubation {{in the presence}} of [γ- 32 P]ATP and cAMP the homogenates were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, (isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE). Three major polypeptides having the same molecular weight as bovine lens α-crystallin B and pIs 7. 1, 6. 9 and 6. 7 were detected in the Coomassie blue stained gels. These three polypeptides were recognized by an α-crystallin B-specific antiserum in Western blots. The polypeptides with pIs 7. 1 and 6. 7 co-migrated in isoelectric focusing gels with bovine lens αB and its phosphorylated form αBp, respectively. Radioautography of the two-dimensional gels demonstrated the presence of 32 P in the most acidic polypeptide.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundGFAP is {{the major}} {{intermediate}} filament protein in mature astrocytes. Its increased expression and aggregation was firstly associated to <b>Alexander's</b> <b>disease,</b> and successively in different neurological diseases including scrapie, Alzheimer's and Creutzfeld–Jacob diseases. Recently, ceftriaxone a multi-potent β-lactam antibiotic able to overcome the blood–brain barrier, successfully eliminated the cellular toxic effects of misfolded mutated GFAP, similarly to phenytoin sodium, in a cellular model of <b>Alexander's</b> <b>disease</b> and inhibited α-synuclein aggregation protecting PC 12 cells from the exposure to 6 -hydroxydopamine. MethodsIn this study, synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy {{has been used to}} obtain structural information about the GFAP-ceftriaxone (phenytoin) interactions, while computational methods allowed the identification of the relevant putative binding site of either ceftriaxone or phenytoin on the dimer structure of GFAP, permitting to rationalize the spectroscopic experimental results. ResultsWe found that GFAP exhibited enhanced stability upon the addition of two equivalents of each ligands with ceftriaxone imparting a more spontaneous interactions and a more ordered complex system than phenytoin. ConclusionsSRCD data and MD models indicate a stronger protective effect of ceftriaxone in neurological disorders characterized by an increased production and polymerization of GFAP. General significanceThis result, in addition to our previous works in which we documented that ceftriaxone interacts with α-synuclein inhibiting its pathological aggregation and that a cyclical treatment with this molecule in a patient with adult-onset <b>Alexander's</b> <b>disease</b> halted, and partly reversed, the progression of neurodegeneration, suggests the possibility of a chaperone-like effect of ceftriaxone on protein involved in specific neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} 2 {{new cases}} of <b>Alexander's</b> <b>disease,</b> {{the first to be}} reported in Belgium. The first patient, a 4 -year-old girl, presented with progressive megalencephaly, mental retardation, spastic tetraparesis, ataxia and epilepsy: post-mortem examination showed widespread myelin loss with Rosenthal fibers (RFs) accumulation throughout the neuraxis. She was the third of heterozygotic twins, the 2 others having developed normally and being alive at age 5 years. The second patient developed at age 10 years and over a decade spastic paraparesis, palatal myoclonus, nystagmus, thoracic hyperkyphosis and thoraco-lumbar scoliosis with radiological findings of bilateral anterior leukoencephalopathy.

40|$|<b>Alexander</b> <b>disease</b> {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} of {{the central nervous system}} of unknown etiology. Infants with <b>Alexander</b> <b>disease</b> develop a leukoencephalopathy with macrocephaly, seizures and psychomotor retardation, leading to death usually within the first decade; patients with juvenile or adult forms typically experience ataxia, bulbar signs and spasticity, and a more slowly progressive course.
