The episode finishes with a scene that takes place the next morning, with the entire staff waiting {{in the conference room}} for Michael to arrive for his farewell party, unaware he has already left, with the exception of Jim and Pam. When DeAngelo deduces Michael is not coming, he begins tearing pieces off Michael's farewell cake (a major subplot point of the episode) and throwing them in the trash, in a bizarre public internal struggle over his dieting. The rest of the staff, particularly Jim and Dwight, watch their new boss's outburst with concern.|$|E

Martin cites Mulder's joke <b>about</b> <b>Michael</b> Jackson as a self-aware comment on [...] "another contemporary white negro" [...] which reinforces a stereotype.|$|E

The track has a basic sequence of Dm11–Dm9 as its chord progression. The song's lyrics are <b>about</b> <b>Michael</b> and Biggie's problems with being famous and dealing with stardom, and throughout the song Jackson asserts that he's been [...] "falsely accused". On December 26, 1995, the track was released by Epic Records as a promotional single in the United States only.

500|$|The opening Star Trek film is {{a parody}} of how old {{the crew of the}} [...] cast looked in the later movies. The 1928 Itchy & Scratchy short [...] "Steamboat Itchy" [...] is a spoof of the 1928 Disney short, Steamboat Willie, {{featuring}} Mickey Mouse. Lisa's line <b>about</b> <b>Michael</b> Jackson and Dustin Hoffman appearing pseudonymously in The Itchy & Scratchy Movie is a reference to the fact that both had made guest appearances on The Simpsons using fake names in [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Substitute" [...] respectively.

500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for an actor who could portray Silver as a [...] "quirky kid who moves to her own beat". Sachs explained that Jessica Stroup [...] "came in dressed for the part, artsy and quirky, and she had her hair up {{and she had a}} bandana. She nailed it." [...] The producers were fans of Tristan Wilds for his acting on The Wire, and hoped to hire him as Dixon from the start of casting. When asked <b>about</b> <b>Michael</b> Steger, who portrays Navid, Sachs said [...] "he's just great". Rob Estes, the last actor to join the series, was a previous cast member of the first Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off, Melrose Place. Estes was sought by The CW to play Harry, but was contracted on the drama Women's Murder Club. When that series was canceled, Sachs called Estes and explained the spin-off to him, and {{he thought it was a}} great idea. Sachs promised that although he was playing a parent, he would not [...] "be furniture... as in the seldom seen or heard parents who populate many youth-centric series, like the Walsh parents on the original 90210." ...|$|E
500|$|There was an auditioning {{process for}} both the chair model and the young blond woman that Michael sees in the coffee shop. According to Novak, the chair model was {{supposed}} to be [...] "pretty" [...] and [...] "perhaps even prettier than your average model", but more of just an [...] "average single girl", because the episode is more <b>about</b> <b>Michael</b> wanting to start dating again than the model herself. [...] In the scene with the [...] "Five Families", one of the actors, Paul Faust was the only first-time actor. Faust is the cousin of writer Paul Lieberstein, and had been {{on a tour of the}} set and talked to many of the writers. He made a good impression and so the character of [...] "Cool Guy Paul" [...] was based on him. The day before they were scheduled to shoot, the show still had not cast anyone for the role, so they called Paul in New York City and had him read the lines into a camera and e-mail to them. In less than an hour, Faust had landed the part and was flown out to Los Angeles.|$|E

5000|$|A ballad {{with minimal}} {{instrumentation}} and a jazz feel, {{the song was}} written <b>about</b> <b>Michael's</b> insecurities as a soulmate and partner because of the baggage and reputation with which he came.

Kelly said she would rather kiss Lord Voldemort, the hideous antagonist of the Harry Potter novels and films, than Michael. Andy sings a song <b>about</b> <b>Michael,</b> [...] "What I Hate About You", to the tune of the rock song by The Romantics, [...] "What I Like About You".

500|$|Mom & Me & Mom (2013) is {{the seventh}} of Maya Angelou's series of autobiographies. [...] It was {{completed}} 11 {{years after the}} publication of her previous autobiography, A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), and over thirty years after she wrote her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969). [...] Mom & Me & Mom, in which Angelou relates her relationship with her mother Vivian Baxter, was published shortly before Mother's Day and Angelou's 85th birthday.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Brian Howard of The Journal News {{described it}} as [...] "classic Office" [...] and praised the camaraderie the staff showed {{for each other and}} the [...] "bizarre discomfort" [...] of the double date with Jim, Pam, Phyllis and Bob. Howard described Dwight and Kevin as the episode's stand-outs. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the episode lacked many laugh-out-loud moments, but was effective because the characters are so well developed: [...] "The Office has, over the years, become as much of a kitchen sink drama as it is a comedy. ... The characters are so well-drawn by now, {{and for the most part}} so likable, that a sweet, low-key episode <b>about</b> <b>Michael</b> and the staff bonding over their singlehood worked even without a lot of memorable jokes." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN described the episode as [...] "familiar territory, but it has plenty of fun moments." [...] Fickett praised the scene with Carell and the mystery woman, and Jim and Pam's lunch. But Fickett said the series needed to address why Pam was staying with the company: [...] "Jim and Pam still work there because, well, that's part of the show – but there really isn't a very good reason as to why these two would still be at this dead end job." ...|$|E
