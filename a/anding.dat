5|$|General Sun led {{the charge}} against Cao Qin right outside Donghua Gate, while Ma Ang {{approached}} Cao Qin's forces from the rear in a flank. Cao was forced to withdraw and set up temporary camp at Dongan Gate. By midday, Sun Tang's forces had killed two of Cao Qin's brothers (Sun personally shot the second with an arrow after Cao Qin's brother led cavalry charges against imperial troops). Sun's forces had also severely wounded Cao Qin in both his arms; his forces took up position in the Great Eastern Market and Lantern Market northeast of Dongan Gate, while Sun deployed artillery units against the rebels. Cao lost his third brother, Cao Duo (曹铎), while attempting to flee out of Beijing by the Chaoyang Gate. Cao made another dash for the northeastern gates of the capital (<b>Anding</b> Gate and Dongzhi Gate), {{and then back to}} Chaoyang Gate, all of which remained closed. Finally, Cao fled with his remaining forces to fortify his residential compound in Beijing. Ming troops under Sun Tang and the newly arrived Marquis of Huichang, Sun Jizong (孙继宗), stormed the residence. To avoid arrest and execution, Cao Qin committed suicide by throwing himself down a well. Imperial troops recovered his body and then decapitated it.|$|E
25|$|Around 195, when a famine {{broke out}} in the Guanzhong region, Su Ze fled from Fufeng Commandery to the {{neighbouring}} <b>Anding</b> Commandery (安定郡; around present-day Zhenyuan County, Gansu) and took refuge under a wealthy man, Shi Liang (師亮). When Shi Liang treated him with contempt, Su Ze sighed and swore that he would return one day as the Administrator (太守) of <b>Anding</b> Commandery and take revenge against Shi Liang. Around 200, he first returned to Fufeng Commandery but later decided to travel with his friend, Ji Mao (吉茂), to Mount Taibai, where they settled down temporarily and spent their time reading.|$|E

When Shi Liang, the wealthy man in <b>Anding</b> Commandery who scorned Su Ze years ago, heard that Su Ze had become the commandery's Administrator, he immediately packed up and prepared to flee. However, Su Ze sent a messenger to stop Shi Liang and reassure him that everything was fine. Su Ze even asked the messenger to thank Shi Liang for offering him shelter during the Guanzhong famine.|$|E
