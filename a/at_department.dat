The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé's grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress. According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé {{and her mother}} founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon. House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era.

25|$|Addressing is {{generally}} done by hand, {{and is an}} opportunity to demonstrate one's handwriting (see shodō). The postcards may have spaces for the sender to write a personal message. Blank cards are available, so people can hand-write or draw their own. Rubber stamps with conventional messages and with the annual animal are on sale <b>at</b> <b>department</b> stores and other outlets, and many people buy ink brushes for personal greetings. Special printing devices are popular, especially among people who practice crafts. Software also lets artists create their own designs and output them using their computer's color printer. Because a gregarious individual might have hundreds to write, print shops offer a wide variety of sample postcards with short messages so that the sender has only to write addresses. Even with the rise in popularity of email, the nengajō remains very popular in Japan, although the younger generation hardly send any cards, preferring to exchange digital greetings using their mobile phones. In recent years this digital greeting preference is gradually accepted among the society.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} 3 May 1982 and took ten weeks. shot mostly on {{location}} in Rome. Kim Newman described the Rome of Tenebrae as unlike the one usually shown {{on television and in}} films, with none of the usual historical landmarks. Newman and Alan Jones agreed that this was a deliberate choice made by Argento, as some of his previous films had utilized so much of recognisable Italy. Argento himself said he had wanted to show Italy was not just a museum piece; Newman said it was Argento's way of saying, [...] "Rome is a vibrant city. It is modern." [...] Most of Tenebraes location shooting was carried out in Rome's EUR business and residential district. The first flashback scene was filmed at the Capocotta beach, south of the city near Ostia. The shoplifting scene near the beginning of Tenebrae was filmed on location <b>at</b> <b>department</b> store La Rinascente, off Piazza Fiume. Bullmer's death in a public square was shot at a shopping precinct called [...] "Le Terrazze" [...] in Rome's Casal Palocco residential neighbourhood. The scene in which Neal's landlord's daughter is killed was filmed outside the home of architect – and friend of Argento – Sandro Petti, switching to studio shots for her initial entrance into the house and back to Petti's house for the confrontation with the killer. The scene {{at the beginning of the}} film where Neal boards his flight to Rome was filmed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.|$|E

40|$|Departments of {{intensive}} medicine often hospitalize patients with self-sufficiency disorders in routine daily activities. Nurses working in those departments have to handle such patients on daily basis, {{as a part}} of providing quality nursing care. To make their work easier there are more or less available aids, however, they are not always fully used. The reasons include complexity of the use, unavailability of the aids in hospitals or saving time for other duties. This thesis is divided into two parts. The first part considers the theoretical side of the issue. We have focused on patients <b>at</b> <b>departments</b> {{of intensive}} medicine, who are dependent on assistance provided by nurses. Nurses function primarily as attendants. The theoretical part also describes the most common aids used for handling of non-self-sufficient patients. The second part of the thesis focuses on research. We have conducted surveys in selected hospitals in the Czech Republic <b>at</b> <b>departments</b> of intensive medicine. The survey used anonymous questionnaires for nurses working <b>at</b> intensive medicine <b>departments.</b> The objectives of the thesis were as follows: To find out whether nurses <b>at</b> <b>departments</b> of intensive medicine use all aids for handling of non-self-sufficient patients; to find out which aids are used most frequently by nurses <b>at</b> <b>departments</b> of intensive medicine for handling of non-self-sufficient patients and to find out whether nurses <b>at</b> <b>departments</b> of intensive medicine are able to use correctly the available aids for handling of non-self-sufficient patients. To achieve the objectives, three hypotheses were established H 1 : Nurses <b>at</b> <b>departments</b> of intensive medicine do not use all aids for handling of non-self-sufficient patients. H 2 : The aid most frequently used by nurses <b>at</b> <b>departments</b> of intensive medicine is a positioning mat. H 3 : Nurses <b>at</b> <b>departments</b> of intensive medicine are able to use correctly the available aids for handling of non-self-sufficient patients. The objectives of the work have been met and three hypotheses were confirmed in the survey. This thesis may serve as an information material for nurses interested in nursing in intensive medicine. Further, it may serve for manufacturers of aids for handling of non-self-sufficient patients; it presents opportunities for improvement of the most frequently used aids and for simplification of work with aids used by the nurses less frequently...|$|R
