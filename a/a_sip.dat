5|$|The video cuts {{between two}} narratives. In the first, a hunter (uncredited actor) straps a 16-gauge shotgun around his shoulder, and tracks {{footsteps}} through the snow, eventually finding the Swamplord (the band's mascot, here as depicted {{on the covers}} of The Black Waltz and For the Revolution). In the second narrative, the band members, dressed warmly in heavy clothing, are sitting around a campfire, preparing a kettle of an unknown drink. As each person takes <b>a</b> <b>sip,</b> they begin convulsing. To simulate the drink's effects, the camera used shaking and rapid zooming. As the song finishes, Pekka pours himself a drink and is the only one immune to its effects.|$|E
5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{practice}} of playing with water has become increasingly common on college campuses, due to the cost saving effects. Instead of drinking the beer from a glass each time a player sinks a shot, the player simply takes a shot of liquor or <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> from their own drink each time the opposing team scores. This is usually done when there isn't enough beer to accommodate {{a large number of}} games during the party.|$|E
25|$|Without having {{tasted the}} wines, {{one does not}} know if, for example, a white is heavy or light. Before taking <b>a</b> <b>sip,</b> the taster tries to {{determine}} {{the order in which}} the wines should be assessed by appearance and nose alone. Heavy wines will be deeper in color and generally more intense on the nose. Sweeter wines, being denser, will leave thick, viscous streaks (called legs or tears) down the inside of the glass when swirled.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} library, Harris and Klebold entered the science area, where they threw {{a small fire}} bomb into an empty storage closet. It caused a fire, which was put out by a teacher hidden in an {{adjacent}} room. The duo proceeded toward the south hallway, where they shot into an empty science room. At approximately 11:44a.m., Harris and Klebold were captured on the school security cameras as they re-entered the cafeteria. The recording shows Harris kneeling on the landing and firing a single shot {{toward one of the}} propane bombs he and Klebold had earlier left in the cafeteria, in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate it. He took <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> from one of the drinks left behind as Klebold approached the propane bomb and examined it. Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the propane bomb. As the two left the cafeteria, the Molotov cocktail exploded, partially detonating one of the propane bombs at 11:46a.m. Two minutes later, approximately one gallon of fuel ignited in the same vicinity, causing a fire that was extinguished by the fire sprinklers.|$|E

In SIP patients, some organs are inverted and others are in their expected positions. Our SIP patient also had partial inversion, i.e., polysplenia, left-sided gallbladder, and bowel malrotation, increasing the surgical difficulty.|$|R
500|$|When {{the trio}} arrives at Duff Gardens, Bart and Lisa wear Selma out, {{especially}} when they go on the Little Land of Duff ride and Bart dares Lisa to drink the toxic [...] "water". Lisa is confused, but Bart mocks her until Selma intervenes, shouting at Bart to shut up and ordering Lisa to drink the water. When Lisa takes <b>a</b> <b>sip,</b> she hallucinates, grows violent and paranoid, and wanders away from the ride, tripping out to the parade music. While Selma is looking for Lisa, Bart gets on a roller coaster called The Barrel Roll and ends up having to be rescued after the car stops {{in the center of}} one of the inversions. Lisa is soon found swimming nude in the Fermentarium, returned to Selma and given pills by an unlicensed doctor.|$|E

He then asked her whether Elijah would really take <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> from the glass and his uncle assured him that he would. His uncle told him to watch very closely when the time came. [...] "Filled with a sense of suggestion and expectation" [...] Asch [...] "thought he saw the level of wine in the cup drop just a bit".

500|$|On 15 December, PZPN {{officials}} {{attempted to}} reconstruct the night's events, asking various players and staff to give accounts of what had happened. Several journalists were present. The stories told contradicted each other in several places, notably regarding how much Młynarczyk had had to drink. The team's technical staff {{said that he had}} been obviously intoxicated when they had seen him, while the goalkeeper insisted he had taken only [...] "three glasses of champagne and <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of beer" [...] with his friend. Another point of contention regarded the conversation at the airport, which had caused Kulesza to yield. It was generally agreed that the players had talked the manager around by telling him that Młynarczyk had personal problems, but the non-playing staff now accused them of emotional blackmail. The players said their intention had been to explain the goalkeeper's off-field issues to help the manager make a more informed decision.|$|E

Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy also praised the content of the video, writing [...] "Of course it wouldn't be a Mariah Carey video without some glitz and glam so the stage and backdrop are covered in (what else?) glitter.

The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on [...] "X-Static" [...] provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was [...] "I'll Stick Around". Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in [...] "Floaty", and tried to enhance the performance through double track – [...] "You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger?

Stewie and Brian discuss The Dog Whisperer and Cesar Millan, and Brian {{explains}} that he is inspired by the philosophy about dogs' instinctive ability to live in the present and with purpose. Stewie, however, points out that Brian himself does not appear to live with any specific purpose. Angered at the implication, Brian begins insulting Stewie, who bitterly retaliates by revealing that he could have gone all day without having his diaper changed, and only thinks of Brian as a passing amusement and [...] "the best of a bad situation". Stewie dares Brian to shoot him with the revolver in the deposit, which Brian earlier said to be bullet-free. It is revealed that Brian lied, and he attempts to shoot Stewie. The two then find a security camera hanging on a wall of the vault. Brian tries to use it to call for help, but Stewie points out if there was someone out there, they would have been saved. Brian then realizes that the camera has recorded him cleaning Stewie, which amuses the infant, but Brian is upset about gaining a laughingstock reputation. Stewie then prematurely causes the gun to discharge, causing the bullet to randomly ricochet off the vault walls, smashing Stewie's already-broken phone and the bottle of Scotch, and forcing the two under the table.|$|E

30|$|In this section, a proxy {{agent-based}} {{scheme is}} proposed {{in order to}} minimize the SIP session re-setup delay over wireless link in 3 G inter-subnet handover scenario. All BSs located together with SGSN (serving GPRS support node) actually have proxy agents, which {{play a significant role in}} processing SIP session request message triggered by the MH or the CH. That is, when <b>an</b> <b>SIP</b> session is initiated by the MH or the CH, the proxy agent on the BS, which the MH is attached to, sends <b>an</b> <b>SIP</b> session specification (called S-SPEC) message to a set of possible BSs (called M-SPEC) to which the MH may visit in next step. Hence, the proxy agent on the BS needs to discover the IP addresses of the neighboring BSs in the M-SPEC.

30|$|The {{proposed}} adaptation {{process is}} divided into three phrases: session initiation, session monitoring, and session adaptation. In the session initiation phrase, the party who invokes the service offers the default parameters in SDP by <b>an</b> <b>SIP</b> signaling message, normally SIP INVITE. Besides those well-known parameters as answer, MME extracts input parameters in AQoS and offers them again as request. Some input parameters can be answered immediately such as terminal capabilities and network capabilities, which is enough for modality selection. However, some of them need to be monitored in real time, for example network conditions. In case that any parameter varies out of the threshold set by AQoS, <b>an</b> <b>SIP</b> UPDATE with the specific SDP is feedback to MME. Once ADTE in MME receives the inputs and makes a decision, the adaptation starts with session renegotiation. In case of quality adaptation, MME commands the MANE with the new parameters.|$|R
