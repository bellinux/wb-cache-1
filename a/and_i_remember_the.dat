25|$|I {{actually}} {{never met}} the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night {{to catch a glimpse}} of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But I do remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
2500|$|... "My {{time with}} the Ambassadors and Junior Wings {{was one of the}} best times of my life, in terms of coaching. I think {{probably}} more so because a lot of people really caught on to junior hockey. I know a lot of those faces I see in the pictures <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> people being so loyal..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Updike {{was born}} in Reading, Pennsylvania, {{the only child of}} Linda Grace (née Hoyer) and Wesley Russell Updike, and was raised in the nearby small town of Shillington. The family later moved to the unincorporated village of Plowville. His mother's {{attempts}} to become a published writer impressed the young Updike. [...] "One of my earliest memories", he later recalled, [...] "is of seeing her at her desk... I admired the writer's equipment, the typewriter eraser, the boxes of clean paper. [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> brown envelopes that stories would go off in—and come back in." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> {{cry of the}} {{peacocks}} (1988) for English horn, string trio, {{and computer}} ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> gun-fighters <b>and</b> bad men {{of my own}} Western land, and was not perplexed at {{the way of the}} Thlinket-folk.|$|R
6000|$|The old soldier hesitated, as if {{unable to}} think of {{anything}} we needed, <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>the</b> hunger which had assailed us while we lay hidden in the thicket, replied: ...|$|R
2500|$|François Truffaut's Jules and Jim was an {{influence}} on the story arc between the characters Angela, Gerard and Marcus. Director Hudlin explained, [...] "I remember when I saw Jules and Jim when I was a kid, and that awkward, awkward feeling of two guys, one has a better time with girls than the other, and they both {{fall in love with}} the same woman. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> agony of watching the emotional stakes of that picture. And, this is just a fun movie, not trying to compare myself to Truffaut on any level, but, at least, that's what inspired the moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1986, Bono and {{his wife}} Ali {{travelled}} to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where they saw firsthand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and United States military intervention. The trip angered Bono and {{formed the basis of}} the song's lyrics. He said, [...] "I remember the ground shaking, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> smell, I suppose, of being near a war zone. I don't think we were in danger, but I knew there were lives in danger or being lost close to us, and I felt for them. It upset me as a person who read the Scriptures, to think that Christians in America were supporting this kind of thing, this kind of proxy war because of these Communists." [...] In August, after reconvening with his bandmates in Dublin to resume work on The Joshua Tree, Bono instructed the Edge to [...] "put El Salvador through an amplifier", resulting in the song's feedback-based guitar part. The Edge said that his guitar playing was also informed by Bono's lyrics.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely I do; he was {{the pilot}} of your ship, it was then said; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> shrewd soldier we entertained even {{suspected}} {{that he was one}} greater than he seemed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So you {{see they}} {{remember}} you. A tall middle-aged man, Moto, {{said that he}} was with us in the boat in 1859, <b>and</b> he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> one-eyed man who piloted us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sermon?" [...] {{said his}} son. [...] "I wasn't {{thinking}} of the sermon, but I saw Captain Nugent there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> stupid quarrel between you. It's absurd that it should go on indefinitely." ...|$|R
60|$|A ray {{fell on his}} features; {{the cheeks}} were sallow, and half covered with black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set <b>and</b> singular. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|The {{contrast}} {{struck me}} {{all at once}} as we stood in the lighted verandah, after rising from the dinner-table. I was fascinated by {{it for the rest}} of the evening, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> impression of something funny and ill-omened at the same time in it to this day.|$|E
6000|$|... "He’s {{been a good}} son," [...] {{said the}} mother, fondly; [...] "never no trouble, always been pertickler, and always quite the gentleman. He always smokes his cigar of a Sunday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> very first money ’e ever earned ’e spent on a cane with a dog’s ’ed to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is convenient, Captain Spike," [...] she coolly {{answered}} for Mulford, [...] "to have stopping-places, for {{vessels that}} are wearied, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> time when my uncle {{used to tell}} me of such matters, very much in the same vein; but, it was before I was twelve years old." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> all <b>the</b> sunny hours Of queens in {{hyacinth}} and {{skies of}} gold, And morning singing where the woods are scrolled And diapered above the chaunting flowers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, dear! How {{things are}} changed! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> when <b>the</b> clergymen did {{more of the}} dancing in Barchester {{than all the other}} young men in the city put together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you be so}} good as to {{stop talking}} {{nonsense}} and call a cab," [...] said Captain Orme coldly. But Higgs began to laugh in his rude fashion, <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>the</b> appearance of [...] "Bud of the Rose" [...] when she lifted her veil of ceremony, and the soft earnestness of her voice, fell into reflection. [...] "Black lady" [...] indeed! What, I wondered, would this young gentleman think if ever he should live to set his eyes upon her sweet and comely face? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite sure," [...] replied Jack; [...] "for I was {{particularly}} interested in the account I once read of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> description well. I am sorry, however that I have forgotten the descriptions of many other trees which I am sure we have seen to-day, if we could but recognise them. So you see, Peterkin, I'm not up to everything yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish it! Of course I do. Why, {{my father}} is a sailor; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> Fury, and I saw the Calliope--his ship that he had in the war time. Before I was as big as little George I always thought I should be a sailor. And now if Papa goes out with Admiral Penrose, and Hal too--oh! it will be so horrid home!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, Kanaka Oolea, {{the priest}} talked a {{language}} largely different, and I {{know it was}} the priest language, the old language. Maui he did not name Maui, but Maui-Tiki-Tiki and Maui-Po-Tiki. And Hina, the goddess-mother of Maui, he named Ina. And Maui's god-father he named sometimes Akalana and sometimes Kanaloa. Strange how one about to die and very thirsty should remember such things! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> priest named Hawaii as Vaii, and Lanai as Ngangai." ...|$|E
5000|$|The quote {{at the end}} of [...] "P.C.P.", [...] "227 'Lears' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> first line", was {{spoken by}} Albert Finney in the 1983 film The Dresser.|$|R
60|$|It {{must have}} been several hours before <b>I</b> regained {{consciousness}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> well <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> feeling of surprise which swept over me as I realized that I was not dead.|$|R
6000|$|In fact, I {{found that}} I {{had made a}} mistake. I had eaten a hearty dinner five hours before, and to have done justice to the fare before me I should have fasted {{for a couple of}} days. The pannikin {{contained}} skilly, three-quarters of a pint, a mixture of Indian corn and hot water. The men were dipping their bread into heaps of salt scattered over the dirty tables. I attempted the same, but the bread seemed to stick in my mouth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> words of the Carpenter, [...] "You need a pint of water to eat the bread nicely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak not so, my uncle," [...] said Godwin; [...] "or at least, {{here is a}} worthier,"--and {{he patted}} the hand of Wulf with his lean fingers. [...] "It was Wulf who bore me through. Oh, I {{remember}} as much as that--how he lifted me onto the black horse and bade me to cling fast to mane and pommel. Ay, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> charge, and his cry of 'Contre D'Arcy, contre Mort!' and the flashing of swords about us, and after that--nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|He let me {{keep his}} hand while things unspoken and untouched, unspeakable and untouchable, {{everything}} that had been between us in the wood a few hours before, were between us again. But so we could only leave them, and, with a short, sharp [...] "Good-bye!" [...] he completely released himself. With {{my hand on the}} latch of the closed door I watched a minute his retreat along the passage, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> reflection that, before rejoining Obert, I made on it. I seemed perpetually, at Newmarch, to be taking his measure from behind.|$|E
60|$|Unthinkable Aladdin, {{dawn and}} dark, Scribbles and scribbles, like a German clerk. We see the fact, but tell, O tell us why? My reverend washman and wise butler cry. Meanwhile {{at times the}} {{manifold}} Imperishable perfumes of the past And coloured pictures rise on me thick and fast: <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> white rime, the loud Lamplitten city, shops, and the changing crowd; And I remember home and the old time, The winding river, the white moving rhyme, The autumn robin by the river-side That pipes in the grey eve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Things {{will get}} better presently," [...] he said. [...] "Now Harry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> often <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> {{pleasant}} evenings we spent at your ranch, and we never got suppers like those Miss Townshead made us, at Somasco." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{say nothing}} of the look he conferred on me, as he stood eyeing us, one after another; for I had always {{understood}} that he hated me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> marks of my hand upon his cheek. But when his eyes passed on to Agnes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw the rage with which he felt his power over her slipping away, and the exhibition, in their disappointment, of the odious passions that had led him to aspire to one whose virtues he could never appreciate or care for, I was shocked by the mere thought of her having lived, an hour, within sight of such a man.|$|R
2500|$|... "Martin and Frazer {{were really}} into Venom, I was really into Mercyful Fate <b>and</b> Slayer. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> day we {{recorded}} 'Fragments...', Frazer had that Venom, Exodus and Slayer video from New York {{and we decided}} that's totally {{what we wanted to}} be doing." ...|$|R
60|$|In the North and East {{there is}} a popular idea that the {{frontier}} of the West is a thing long past, and remembered now only in stories. As I think of this I remember Ranger Sitter when he made that remark, while he grimly stroked an unhealed bullet wound. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> giant Vaughn, that typical son of stalwart Texas, sitting there quietly with bandaged head, his thoughtful eye boding ill to the outlaw who had ambushed him. Only a few months have passed since then--when I had my memorable sojourn with you--and yet, in that short time, Russell and Moore have crossed the Divide, like Rangers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, your Majesty," [...] he said. [...] "I {{remember}} these streets before the Lord Provost began to rule us. I can't remember how we felt very well. All the great songs and the fighting change one so; and I don't {{think we can}} really estimate all we owe to the Provost; but I can remember his coming into this very shop twenty-two years ago, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> things he said. The singular thing is that, as far as I remember, I thought {{the things he said}} odd at that time. Now it's the things that I said, as far as I can recall them, that seem to me odd--as odd as a madman's antics." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus, {{when reading}} in my deck chair or when talking with others, {{practically}} {{any mention of}} {{any part of the}} world I knew instantly aroused the connotation of drinking and good fellows. Big nights and days and moments, all purple passages and freedoms, thronged my memory. [...] "Venice" [...] stares at me from the printed page, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> cafe tables on the sidewalks. [...] "The Battle of Santiago," [...] some one says, and I answer, [...] "Yes, I've been over the ground." [...] But I do not see the ground, nor Kettle Hill, nor the Peace Tree. What I see is the Cafe Venus, on the plaza of Santiago, where one hot night I drank and talked with a dying consumptive.|$|E
2500|$|I said to him, 'Commander of the Believers, {{was there}} some matter that troubled you this night?' And he said, 'Yes, I saw how I was {{occupied}} while governing {{the affairs of the}} community, all its black sheep and its white sheep, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> stranger, beggared <b>and</b> straying, and the poor and the needy, and the prisoners in captivity, and all like them in the far places of the earth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> realised that God Most High would ask me about all of them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> (Umar) would testify about them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feared that I should find no excuse when I was with God, and no defence with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|After this I {{heard no}} more of him, and fell to {{thinking}} with such wits as were left to me of how many perils we had passed since we saw the shores of Thames, and that it seemed sad that all should have been for nothing, since {{it would have been}} better to die at the beginning than now at the end, after so much misery. Then the glare of the lightning shone upon the handle of the sword Wave-Flame, which was still strapped about me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> rune written upon it which my mother had rendered to me upon the morning of the fight against the Frenchmen. How did it run? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{took him}} out of the room. I asked him afterwards, why he had done so, and he made a {{plausible}} excuse; but since last night, father, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> circumstances by its light, I am afraid I can imagine too truly what passed between them.' ...|$|R
