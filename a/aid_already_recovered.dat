50|$|Japan {{emerged from}} the Second World War in defeat, under {{temporary}} American administration. Many cities had been attacked by American bomber forces, {{and many of the}} largest cities suffered further loss as residents evacuated to more rural regions of the country.

50|$|The serum of convalescent {{patients}} successfully <b>recovering</b> (or <b>already</b> <b>recovered)</b> from {{an infectious}} disease {{can be used}} as a biopharmaceutical in the treatment of other people with that disease, because the antibodies generated by the successful recovery are potent fighters of the pathogen. Such convalescent serum (antiserum) is a form of immunotherapy.|$|R

30|$|It was {{perceived}} as an easy system to use, which could be useful in rural areas rather than metropolitan areas where railway crossings are already equipped with flashing lights and boom gates. It {{was perceived}} useful particularly if it was integrated into other technological <b>aids</b> <b>already</b> being used, such as GPS (male, 36).|$|R
50|$|However, Paxton {{immediately}} {{continued his}} voyage alone to Amsterdam. There with Dutch bankers Hope & Co., he encashed Bills of Exchange {{to the value}} of 470,241 Sicca Rupees, given him by the Dutch treasurer at Chinsura in 1781. Having <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> 159,150, he returned to London to clear his client accounts and hence preserve his business.|$|R
50|$|In June 2013 he also {{announced}} plans to charge foreign nationals for using the NHS, claiming that the cost was up to £200 million though official figures put it at £33 million.

50|$|Closer {{investigation}} {{of many of}} the promises made at Gleneagles reveals that some of the aid funds were rehashed versions of <b>aid</b> <b>already</b> pledged and the aid was often used to privatise public services to businesses based in the donor country.

50|$|Cologne {{was taken}} by the American First Army in early March, 1945. By the end of the war, the {{population}} of Cologne had been reduced by 95 per cent. This loss was mainly caused by a massive evacuation of the people to more rural areas. The same happened in many other German cities {{in the last two years}} of war. By the end of 1945, however, the population had <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> to approximately 500,000.|$|R
50|$|Thanks to {{the support}} of other party leaders who had <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> their {{official}} positions, in 1978 the rise to power of Deng was inevitable. Even though Hua Guofeng formally monopolized the top positions in the People's Republic, his position, with little support, was becoming increasingly difficult. In December 1978, during the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee Congress of the Communist Party of China, Deng took over the reins of power.|$|R
2500|$|Reductions {{of up to}} 70 {{percent in}} the ozone column {{observed}} in the austral (southern hemispheric) spring over Antarctica and first reported in 1985 (Farman et al.) are continuing. Antarctic total column ozone in September and October have continued to be 40–50 percent lower than pre-ozone-hole values since the 1990s. A gradual trend toward [...] "healing" [...] was reported in 2016. Even better news came next year when NASA announced that ozone layer had <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> to 1988 level.|$|R
5|$|In February 1864, {{her family}} sent {{her and her}} brother to Melbourne {{to live with her}} sister, with the {{intention}} of helping to improve Baeyertz's health. By the time that the siblings arrived by ship in Melbourne, Baeyertz had <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> and she quickly integrated herself into the Australian social life. She soon met Charles Baeyertz, a bank manager at the Richmond branch of National Bank of Australasia and a practising Anglican. The couple started a relationship, keeping it secret from both their families.|$|R
6000|$|But Valentin (under the steady, humble {{gaze of the}} priest) had <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> himself. [...] "Well," [...] he said shortly, [...] "people's private {{opinions}} can wait. You gentlemen {{are still}} bound by your promise to stay; you must enforce it on yourselves--and on each other. Ivan here will tell you anything more you want to know; I must get to business and write to the authorities. We can't keep this quiet any longer. I shall be writing in my study {{if there is any}} more news." ...|$|R
30|$|To obtain {{appropriate}} islanding, load generation imbalance is not {{as crucial}} and critical as ensuring the transient stability within islands as the system is <b>already</b> <b>recovering</b> from cascading outages. Moreover, on an island, load generation imbalance can be compensated through partial load shedding. However, an island with a negative stability margin and good load generation imbalance will collapse. Hence, a proper islanding solution must ensure that coherent generators remain on the same island to improve the stability and reduce the chances of further outages [37].|$|R

50|$|The most {{formidable}} threat for the emir was Umar Ibn Hafsun, who had conquered {{the provinces of}} Rayya (including Bobastro), Elvira (including Granada) and Jaén, and had allied with the populations of Archidona, Baeza, Úbeda and Priego. In 891 Ibn Hafsun was defeated near the castle of Polei and lost several cities. After the victory, Abdullah massacred all the Christians, while the Muslims of the conquered cities were pardoned. However, by the following year Ibn Hafsun had <b>already</b> <b>recovered,</b> and conquered back all the lost territories.|$|R

30|$|In the {{broadcast}} phase, the BS applies the EW RLC scheme {{defined by a}} window selection distribution Γ(BS)(ξ) over x(BS)and broadcasts the stream of encoded packets using {{the broadcast}} rate R(BS). Each user recovers the BS message x(BS)using the GE decoder where, prior to decoding, the user cancels out its own packets from the received encoded packets. We note that the two phases may overlap in time, i.e., the BS may start broadcasting a subset of (<b>already</b> <b>recovered)</b> layers of x(BS)before the upload phase of all users is completed.|$|R
50|$|Following her {{break-up}} with Jin-Ho, Hae-Young {{decides to}} resign from her post after the first semester of school. Ji-Soo later asks if Jin-Ho was aware of this fact and if Jae-Kyung was involved, but Jin-Ho denies the involvement of Jae-Kyung and claims {{that he no longer}} loves Hae-Young. Ji-Soo later goes to see Jae-Kyung where she overhears her phone call, saying that she had <b>already</b> <b>recovered.</b> After hearing the phone call, Ji-Soo confronts Jae-Kyung, who claims that she doesn't know Ji-Soo, who beats her out of anger for tricking Jin-Ho.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an inverse {{boundary value problem}} for a model time-harmonic equation of acoustic tomography of moving fluid with variable current velocity, sound speed, density and absorption. In the present article {{it is assumed that}} at fixed frequency the coefficients of this equation are <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> modulo an appropriate gauge transformation using some reconstruction method from boundary measurements presented in the literature. Our main result consists in formulas and equations that allow {{to get rid of this}} gauge non-uniqueness and recover the fluid parameters using boundary measurements at several frequencies.

50|$|The Bahamians {{soon came}} into {{conflict}} with the Spanish over the salvaging of wrecks. The Bahamian wreckers drove the Spanish away from their wrecked ships, and attacked Spanish salvagers, seizing goods the Spanish had <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> from the wrecks. When the Spanish raided the Bahamas, the Bahamians in turn commissioned privateers against Spain, even though England and Spain were at peace. In 1684 the Spanish burned the settlements on New Providence and Eleuthera, after which they were largely abandoned. New Providence was settled a second time in 1686 by colonists from Jamaica.|$|R
5000|$|Doug and Susanna Harrison founded The SCOOTER Store in 1991 in New Braunfels, Texas. In 2003, The SCOOTER Store filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) for wrongfully denied Medicare claims. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid {{services}} claimed that their own [...] "Certificate of Medical Necessity" [...] did not certify medical necessity. The federal government countersued the company. The SCOOTER Store agreed to settle its dispute with the government in 2007, having <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> {{the majority of the}} claims in question.|$|R

Reshammiya also visited Ajmer Sharif Dargah on 8 March 2016 with Farah Karimaee to offer prayers {{for the success of}} Teraa Surroor. The director Shawan Arranha has told that the budget of the film was recovered through the music even before the release of film. Arranha said: [...] "The producers have <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> the film's cost through sale of music, satellite and other rights".|$|R
50|$|The Lexington Hearing & Speech Center is {{a medical}} center that {{provides}} clinical services in hearing and speech to people in New York City's five boroughs, including infants, children, adults, and seniors. Beyond attempting to {{determine the cause of}} speech and language difficulty, the center focuses on medical and rehabilitative care, with a specialty in hearing aids.

40|$|License, which permits {{unrestricted}} use, distribution, {{and reproduction}} in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. In acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated plasma creatinine is diagnostic {{of an earlier}} loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) but not of the concomitant GFR. Only subsequent creatinine changes will inform if GFR had <b>already</b> <b>recovered</b> or not. We hypothesized that the creatinine excretion rate to production rate ratio would provide this information. A retrospective analysis of 482 critically ill patients from two intensive care units (ICU) is shown. Plasma creatinine was measured on ICU entry and 12 hours later.
