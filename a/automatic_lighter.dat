40|$|AbstractThe {{automatic}} {{daylight control}} system represent an <b>automatic</b> <b>lighting</b> control system that tray to maintain constant the desired level of illuminance on the working plane (i. e. the desk surface) even the daylight contribution is variable {{during the day}} time. The paper presents the implementation of an automatic daylight control system based on an artificial neural network regulator. Using the past inputs and outputs of the process, the regulator is trained in on-line manner to generate the new command which will {{be applied to the}} process. The author proposes a control algorithm - titled by the author as Control by Estimation Iterative Algorithm – that allow to the <b>automatic</b> <b>lighting</b> control system to achieve the desired illuminance. Also, the author proposes a way to reduce the transient period of the <b>automatic</b> <b>lighting</b> control system response...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} ideas for {{designed}} a lighting system based RF Transceiver. design involves two sensors, sensor based infrared and sensor based light intensity and then becomes the input for the processor media. {{the output of}} the system is <b>automatic</b> switch <b>lights.</b> The <b>automatic</b> switch ensures that the circuit remains turned off when natural illumination is available. The <b>automatic</b> <b>light</b> is made functional from dusk to dawn because sensor reads the light intensity. A movement sensor is used to enhance the conservation of energy. It makes the <b>automatic</b> <b>light</b> operate on low brightnesswhen there is no movement. When a person is approaching, the brightness increases till the person has passed. This function is useful to indoors where it can increase power savings when there is not much movement at night...|$|R
