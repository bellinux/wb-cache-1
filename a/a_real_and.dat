5|$|However, {{since this}} initial skepticism, {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> severe threat to biodiversity. This consensus emerged with {{an increase in the number}} of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} {{the look of}} the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E

The enactment of the Act was criticised by various pro-life groups and the Roman Catholic bishops, but supported by a majority of the electorate in polls, with many indicating they wished to see a more liberal law on abortion.|$|E
25|$|In particular, a DCT is a Fourier-related {{transform}} {{similar to}} the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), but using only real numbers. The DCTs are generally related to Fourier Series coefficients of a periodically and symmetrically extended sequence whereas DFTs are related to Fourier Series coefficients of a periodically extended sequence. DCTs are equivalent to DFTs of roughly twice the length, operating on real data with even symmetry (since the Fourier transform of <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> even function is real and even), whereas in some variants the input and/or output data are shifted by half a sample. There are eight standard DCT variants, of which four are common.|$|E

25|$|Before 1400 it {{was rare}} {{for anyone to}} be persecuted for witchcraft, but the {{increasingly}} common persecution of heresy and failure to fully defeat those heretics {{paved the way for}} later criminal prosecution of witchcraft. By the 15th century belief in witches was widely accepted in European society. Previously, those convicted of witchcraft typically suffered penalties no more harsh than public penances such as a day in the stocks, but their persecution became more brutal following the publication of the Malleus Maleficarum, as witchcraft became widely accepted as <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> dangerous phenomenon. The most vigorous persecutions took place between years 1560 and 1630, ending in Europe around 1780.|$|E
25|$|During his {{original}} trial, Reynolds had challenged two jurors, {{both of whom}} stated that they had formed an opinion on the guilt or innocence of Reynolds before the trial. The court held that universal education and press reports {{made it hard to}} find jurors who had not formed some opinion. It found that Reynolds had failed to meet the requirement that he, as challenger of a juror's objectivity, demonstrate that a juror had developed <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> strong opinion. The prosecution had discharged two potential jurors who refused to say {{whether or not they were}} living in polygamy. The Court held that it would not overturn a case based on the legality of challenges to dismissed jurors.|$|E
25|$|Katerina Ivanovna Verkhovtseva (a.k.a. Katya, Katka, Katenka) is Dmitri's {{beautiful}} fiancée, {{despite his}} open forays with Grushenka. Her engagement to Dmitri is chiefly {{a matter of}} pride on both their parts, Dmitri having bailed her father out of a debt. Katerina is extremely proud and seeks {{to act as a}} noble martyr, suffering as a stark reminder of everyone's guilt. Because of this, she cannot bring herself to act on her love for Ivan, and constantly creates moral barriers between him and herself. By the end of the novel, she too, begins <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> sincere spiritual redemption, as seen in the epilogue, when she asks Mitya and Grushenka to forgive her.|$|E

His only ability was acquired from his father's vocation as a singer, and he joined with a few other youngsters who went to saloons on the Bowery and sang to customers. Itinerant young singers like them were common on the Lower East Side. Berlin would sing a few of the popular ballads he heard on the street, hoping people would pitch him a few pennies. From these seamy surroundings he became street wise, with <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> lasting education.

25|$|With our {{knowledge}} of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his Republic, he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole harem, and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of Pericles.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusions}} of the committee were that pensions allowances and payments should not in future be granted in perpetuity, {{on the ground that}} such grants should be limited to the persons actually rendering the service, and that such reward should be defrayed by the generation benefited; that offices with salaries and without duties, or with merely nominal duties, ought to be abolished; that all existing perpetual pensions and payments and all hereditary offices should be abolished: that where no service or merely nominal service is rendered by the holder of an hereditary office or the original grantee of a pension, the pension or payment should in no case continue beyond the life of the present holder and that in all cases the method of commutation ought to ensure <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> substantial saving to the nation (the existing rate, about 27 years purchase, being considered by the committee to be too high). These recommendations of the committee were adopted by the government and outstanding hereditary pensions were gradually commuted, the only ones left outstanding being those to Lord Rodney (£2,000) and to Lord Nelson (£5,000), both chargeable on the Consolidated Fund.|$|E
