500|$|The use of sandbox {{applications}} like Garry's Mod {{have allowed}} for Combine non-player characters {{to be used}} in a variety of webcomics and machinima productions. The combine are also referenced in the Portal (series). In one webcomic, Concerned, the Combine are portrayed as a highly bureaucratic and often inept organization. One issue shows a Civil Protection briefing for attempting to capture the comic's protagonist Gordon Frohman, in which officers are instructed to cluster around explosive barrels, seek cover on unstable structures and rappel down from bridges in front of fast moving vehicles. In another example, the machinima series Combine Nation follows Civil Protection officers in a similar style to police procedural documentaries. The officers perform their duties with various twists, such as the team's medical officer having an obsession with <b>adhesive</b> <b>bandages</b> and the legal consultant, an Overwatch soldier, favoring dramatic entries, such as throwing flashbangs, which often backfire on him. Another web series, called The Combine, parodies the TV show The Office. This series attempts to portray the combine as an intergalactic corporation that suffers from everyday office issues and problems. One episode shows the soldiers attempting to bypass a webfilter so they can watch videos online instead of working. Other media portray the Combine with more serious overtones, such as the live-action video The Combine Interview, which parodies an interview with Tom Cruise discussing Scientology. The video, described by ActionTrip as [...] "eerie, to say the least" [...] and by both Joystiq and Kotaku as [...] "creepy", instead presents an interview with a Civil Protection officer discussing the Combine's rule of Earth, adapting Cruise's words to fit the Combine theme. PC Gamer UK noted that [...] "the suggestion, of course, is that Scientology's purpose or self-image in some way resembles that of the homogenising intergalactic murderous alien collective".|$|E

2500|$|While [...] "reverse DI" [...] {{re-recording}} {{techniques have}} been used for decades, the process was popularized in part by the introduction of the Reamp device in 1993. The registered trademark [...] "Reamp" [...] describes a patented invention (...) filed in 1994 by audio engineer John Cuniberti, perhaps best known for his lifelong engineering work with guitarist Joe Satriani. The Reamp inductively couples balanced line-level sources into unbalanced guitar-level destinations (e.g., DAW output to guitar amp input) and includes a potentiometer which alters both signal level and source impedance. Derivations of the Reamp trademark, such as [...] "reamping" [...] and [...] "re-amplification," [...] have become common terminology in professional audio to describe the process of amplified re-recording – much like the word [...] "Band-aid" [...] is often used to describe <b>adhesive</b> <b>bandages</b> (see Genericized trademark).|$|E

[...] While playing, the band members would slam their hands against their steel guitar strings so hard that they would draw blood, often needing to put <b>adhesive</b> <b>bandages</b> on their fingers. Albini used a specially-made hip-slung guitar strap worn around his waist like a belt, and would [...] "prowl the stage like a spindly gunslinger", according to Azerrad.

We investigated {{the effectiveness of}} a high-compression short-stretch <b>adhesive</b> <b>bandage</b> compared with non-adhesive crêpe in reducing haemorrhage after stripping of varicose veins. Using 99 mTc-labelled red blood cells, the degree of postoperative bleeding was assessed in 10 patients with bilateral varicose veins allocated for stripping and ligation. High-compression <b>adhesive</b> <b>bandaging</b> was applied to the experimental limb and a non-adhesive bandage to the contralateral control limb. Results show that adequate compression bandaging can decrease subcutaneous haematoma formation after stripping of varicose veins...|$|R

40|$|This is a Chinese Patent. Patent number: 201410129474. 6; Application number: CN: 201410129474 :A; Filed date: 01 Apr 2014; Awarded date: 14 Oct 2015; Publication date: 14 Oct 2015. Abstract：The {{invention}} discloses an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bandage</b> type artificial active tissue {{constructed by}} using a culture solution without serum or bovine pituitary extracts and a construction method of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bandage</b> type artificial active tissue. A cell culture solution without the serum or bovine pituitary extracts is adopted, and a biological film carrier is specially treated {{to ensure that a}} niche suitable for cell interaction is formed on a biological film, and promote human fibroblasts and epidermal cells to give play to self potentials, proliferate, disintegrate and excrete growth factors, so that an artificial tissue with active cells can be formed on the biological film in 4 - 7 days. The artificial tissue is high in cell activity and strong in division and migration ability, can home back to wound surfaces, and can promote tissue regeneration by serving as seed cells for curing burns and chronic ulcer. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>bandage</b> type artificial active tissue disclosed by the invention completely avoids immunological rejection of animal derived products including serum, pituitary extracts and collagen and the risk of infection of viruses transmitted to humans from animals, and a thin cell tissue taking the biological film as a scaffold and an infection barrier is formed, so that the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bandage</b> type artificial active tissue with biological safety is truly realized...|$|R
