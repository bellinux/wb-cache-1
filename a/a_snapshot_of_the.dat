5|$|Wright's {{scientific}} paintings adopted {{elements from}} {{the tradition of}} history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, {{as well as his}} close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.|$|E
25|$|Production {{releases}} were branched from <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development codebase (following a code freeze) and {{underwent a}} QA process that includes backporting security updates and bug fixes.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} line timeline {{is available in}} Newsrail, September 1982, p.197. It lists sets N1 through N9 complete, with the carriages forming N10 through N14 at various stages of construction and fit-out, and the frames of the 43rd carriage being welded together as of 28 July 1982.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, the OHCHR, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UN Women, ILO, UNESCO, WHO, the World Bank and UNAIDS {{issued a}} joint report {{providing}} <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work of UN bodies in combating discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and related work {{in support of}} LGBTI communities around the world, together with a contact list of focal points in each UN entity and links and references to documents, reports and other materials that can be consulted for further information.|$|E
25|$|Note that modes 1 and 2 are {{basically}} identical, except that Mode 1 provides current information, whereas Mode 2 provides <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same data {{taken at the}} point when the last diagnostic trouble code was set. The exceptions are PID 01, which is only available in Mode 1, and PID 02, which is only available in Mode 2. If Mode 2 PID 02 returns zero, {{then there is no}} snapshot and all other Mode 2 data is meaningless.|$|E
25|$|This list {{of units}} is <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Air Corps {{on the date}} of {{activation}} of the General Headquarters Air Force. Except for the assignment of four reconnaissance (formerly observation) squadrons to the 1st and 2nd Wings in September 1936 for attachment to their heavy bombardment groups, and the May 1937 exchange of the 12th Observation Group (inactivated) for the 10th Transport Group (activated), {{the organization of the}} Air Corps shown here remained essentially unchanged until activation of the first expansion groups on 1 February 1940.|$|E

25|$|Another {{noteworthy}} film of {{this genre}} is Fake, {{which was the}} debut film by Thanakorn Pongsuwan. The film's modern, visual style offers <b>a</b> sharp-focus <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Bangkok and a plausible account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mating game in its current forms.|$|R
25|$|GNOME {{releases}} {{are made}} to the main FTP server {{in the form of}} source code with configure scripts, which are compiled by operating system vendors and integrated with the rest of their systems before distribution. Most vendors use only stable and tested versions of GNOME, and provide it in the form of easily installed, pre-compiled packages. The source code of every stable and development version of GNOME is stored in the GNOME git source code repository. Interested users can always obtain <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> _master_ development branch or any other branch/tag and build a cutting-edge version for their own use.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the current}} UK {{coalition}} {{government and the}} previous Labour Government expressed concerns about the rising costs of {{a survey of the}} whole population conducted once every ten years. Meanwhile, the accuracy and utility of <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole UK population once every ten years compared to continued surveying was being questioned. A rapidly changing society, evolving user requirements and new opportunities were emerging as drivers for change. These concerns and opportunities encouraged the UK Government to investigate alternative methods of population data collection; to identify the best way to provide small area population, and socio-demographic statistics in the future by taking advantages of the more advanced technology that is becoming available, and also to make use of existing sources of demographic data already being collected by the private sector.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{are only}} rarely {{preserved}} as fossils {{in the best}} of circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. This is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through the fossil record is less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived. Because of the specialized and rare circumstances required for a biological structure to fossilize, only a small percentage of life-forms can be expected to be represented in discoveries, and each discovery represents only <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which will never demonstrate an exact half-way point.|$|E

500|$|When Elizabeth I came {{to power}} she {{restored}} the Church of England's independence from Rome under the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. The church that she re-established represented, in effect, <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Edwardian Church from September 1552. Thus the Elizabethan Prayer Book was basically Cranmer's 1552 edition but without the [...] "Black Rubric". In the Convocation of 1563 the Forty-Two Articles which were never adopted by the Church were altered {{in the area of}} eucharistic doctrine to form the Thirty-Nine Articles. Most of the exiles returned to England and resumed their careers in the Church. To some like Edmund Grindal, an Archbishop of Canterbury during Elizabeth's reign, Cranmer provided a shining example whose work should be upheld and extended.|$|E
500|$|Four Times of the Day was {{the first}} series of prints that Hogarth had issued since {{the success of the}} Harlot and Rake (and would be the only set he would issue until Marriage à-la-mode in 1745), so it was eagerly anticipated. On hearing of its {{imminent}} issue, George Faulkner wrote from Dublin that he would take 50 sets. The series lacks the moral lessons that are found in the earlier series and revisited in Marriage à-la-mode, and its lack of teeth meant it failed to achieve the same success, though it has found an enduring niche as <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society of Hogarth's time. At the auction of 1745, the paintings of Four Times of the Day raised more than those of the Rake; and Night, which is generally regarded as the worst of the series, fetched the highest single total. Cunningham commented sarcastically: [...] "Such was the reward then, to which the patrons of genius thought these works entitled". While Horace Walpole praised the accompanying print, Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn, as being the finest of Hogarth's works, he had little to say of Four Times of the Day other than that it did not find itself wanting in comparison with Hogarth's other works.|$|E

5|$|The gaps are {{not seen}} in <b>a</b> simple <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{locations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asteroids {{at any one time}} because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.|$|R
500|$|In {{retrospective}} reviews, Winter in America {{was well}} received by critics, who cite {{it as one}} of Scott-Heron's best albums. Uncut magazine's Barney Hoskyns praised the album, calling it an [...] "introspective seasonal offering from black poet-singer and collaborating pianist". He also lauded its critical content and called it [...] "a masterwork of ghetto melancholia and stark political gravitas". Ron Wynn of AllMusic wrote of Scott-Heron's performance, in that he was [...] "at his most righteous and provocative on this album", while acknowledging Jackson's contributions as well. BBC Online's Daryl Easlea called the album [...] "an affecting work" [...] and wrote that its title track [...] "should be played as standard on all modern history courses as <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stilted hopes and aspirations in the post Watergate and Vietnam War mid 70s America". The Washington Posts Richard Harrington cited [...] "The Bottle" [...] and [...] "H²Ogate Blues" [...] as [...] "classic Scott-Heron works" [...] in a review of its reissue. Los Angeles Times writer Mike Boehm viewed that its title track [...] "sounded a sad death-knell for '60s hopes of transforming change", while calling it a [...] "wonderful mood piece, capturing what it's like to feel oppressed in your soul by outer-world events that seem out of control". Danny Eccleston of Mojo called it an [...] "alloy of Rhodes-laden souljazz with 's razor-sharp beat-poetry" [...] and quipped, [...] "Anger, radicalism, humour and funk from the proto-rapper, thankfully restored to health and liberty." ...|$|E

[...] The richness of modern user interfaces can make this problematic, especially within a browser-based environment." [...] An alternative to OT is differential synchronization.|$|E

2500|$|A tree {{object is}} the {{equivalent}} of a directory.

2500|$|Also {{known as}} the [...] "Slashdot effect", the Reddit effect occurs when a smaller website has a high influx of traffic after being linked to on Reddit. It is also called the [...] "Reddit Hug of Death" [...] among the website's users. Because Reddit is such a large site, the traffic is immense and can easily crash smaller sites. In order for users to see crashed websites, several Reddit bots have been created that take <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> website before large amounts of traffic flood the {{affected}} website.|$|E
2500|$|An {{address locator}} is a dataset in ArcGIS that stores the address attributes, {{associated}} indexes, and rules {{that define the}} process for translating nonspatial descriptions of places, such as street addresses, into spatial data that can be displayed as features on a map. An address locator contains <b>a</b> <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference data used for geocoding, and parameters for standardizing addresses, searching for match locations, and creating output. Address locator files have a [...]loc file extension. In ArcGIS 8.3 and previous versions, an address locator was called a geocoding service.|$|E
