40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{reported}} relative mispricing of primes <b>and</b> <b>scores</b> {{to the underlying}} stock. Given transaction costs, the authors establish arbitrage-based bounds on prime <b>and</b> <b>score</b> prices. They then develop a new nonparametric statistical technique to test whether prime <b>and</b> <b>score</b> prices violate these bounds. They find that prime <b>and</b> <b>score</b> prices do exceed stock prices, and often by a considerable amount. They demonstrate that this increased value is most likely due to the score's ability to save on the costs of dynamic hedging. They also show how short sale and trust size constraints impede the ability to arbitrage price disparities. Copyright 1989 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R
