5|$|Mia Ikumi {{spent a year}} {{designing}} the Tokyo Mew Mew manga before {{the release of the}} first volume in February 2001. The story she originally presented to her editors, Tokyo Black Cat Girl, featured a heroine named Hime Azumi.

30|$|In <b>the</b> <b>change</b> model, Dormant (2011) {{suggested}} five levels or {{stages of}} the potential adopter, described here: (1) Awareness: The potential adopter is passive <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> has little/no information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> and has little/no opinion <b>about</b> <b>the</b> change; (2) Curiosity: The potential adopter wants more information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> actively engages in asking questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> and asks questions about personal impact; (3) Mental tryout: The potential adopter is in a pre-commitment stage, imagining how <b>the</b> <b>change</b> would be made, asking job-focused questions (with job-focused concerns) <b>about</b> <b>the</b> impact of the change; (4) Hands-on tryout: The potential adopter has made <b>the</b> commitment to <b>change,</b> wants {{to learn how to}} implement <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> has opinions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> and asks questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> relative to organizational context; and (5) Adoption: The potential adopter has now actively made <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> is able to make suggestions for improvement regarding <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> and may seek out expert opinion for answers to detailed questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b> Although not specifically articulated in Dormant’s model, if awareness is stage 1, there could essentially be a stage 0, that is, a pre-awareness stage.|$|R

25|$|The Democratic Liberal Party submitted, on 12 December, to the Constitutional Court, two notices <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> adopted Tuesday by the Chamber of Deputies to the Penal Code, one {{aimed at}} {{defining}} civil servant {{and the other}} one referring to the conflict of interest. Likewise, the High Court of Cassation and Justice notified the Constitutional Court on the same subject. The concerns expressed by about 50 PDL lawmakers were confirmed by the Constitutional Court of Romania. So, on 15 January 2014, the members of the Constitutional Court unanimously decided that the amendments to the Penal Code are unconstitutional. CCR judges decided that the article which removes the officials from the category of public servants breaches several articles of the Constitution concerning the rule of law, the equal rights of citizens and the Romanian State's obligation to fulfill in good faith its obligations in international treaties.|$|E
25|$|The major {{figures that}} benefited from this boom {{included}} James Hogg (1770–1835), whose best known work is The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1824), which {{dealt with the}} themes of Presbyterian religion and Satanic possession, evoking the landscape of Edinburgh and its surrounding environment. John Galt's (1779–1839) most famous work was Annals of the Parish (1821), given {{in the form of}} a diary kept by a rural minister over a fifty-year period and allowing Galt to make observations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> in Scottish society. Walter Scott's son-in-law John Gibson Lockhart (1794–1854), is most noted for his Life of Adam Blair (1822) which focuses on the contest between desire and guilt. The lawyer and critic John Wilson, as Christopher North, published novels including Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life (1822), The Trials of Margaret Lyndsay (1823) and The Foresters (1825), which investigate individual psychology. The only major female novelist to emerge in the aftermath of Scott's success was Susan Ferrier (1782–1854), whose novels Marriage (1818), The Inheritance (1824) and Destiny (1831), continued the domestic tradition.|$|E
25|$|Storage space {{allocated}} to a database {{is divided into}} sequentially numbered pages, each 8KB in size. A page is the basic unit of I/O for SQL Server operations. A page is marked with a 96-byte header which stores metadata about the page including the page number, page type, free space on the page and the ID of the object that owns it. Page type defines the data contained in the page: data stored in the database, index, allocation map which holds information about how pages are {{allocated to}} tables and indexes, change map which holds information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> made to other pages since last backup or logging, or contain large data types such as image or text. While page is the basic unit of an I/O operation, space is actually managed {{in terms of an}} extent which consists of 8 pages. A database object can either span all 8 pages in an extent ("uniform extent") or share an extent with up to 7 more objects ("mixed extent"). A row in a database table cannot span more than one page, so is limited to 8KB in size. However, if the data exceeds 8KB and the row contains varchar or varbinary data, the data in those columns are moved to a new page (or possibly a sequence of pages, called an allocation unit) and replaced with a pointer to the data.|$|E

[...] The alien-focused campaign began on May 4, 2012 with the release of a new trailer, coinciding with Fox's changing the film's title to The Watch to further distance the film from the Martin case.|$|E
500|$|In 1915, Director of the Mint Robert W. Woolley set {{in motion}} efforts to replace the Barber dime, quarter, and half dollar, as he mistakenly {{believed}} that the law required new designs.

[...] The Mint required modifications to the initial design, and MacNeil's revised version included dolphins to represent the oceans. [...] In late 1916, Mint officials made major changes to the design without consulting MacNeil. [...] The sculptor complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> after receiving the new issue in January 1917. [...] The Mint obtained special legislation to allow MacNeil to redesign the coin as he desired.

500|$|In his diary, Rupprecht {{wrote that}} he was {{doubtful}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> of tactics required by Ludendorff, especially his instructions for more counter-battery fire, since in previous battles the German artillery had engaged British infantry. An anticipated French attack on the Chemin des Dames, meant that fewer reinforcements could be expected by the 4th Army, making a fighting withdrawal the only possible response to the British attacks. Rupprecht wrote that the fighting power of German troops in Flanders was declining and that all attempts to counter the British artillery had failed, requiring a greater retreat, far enough back to force the British into a laborious artillery redeployment. After being postponed from 2 October, due to delays in the transport of ammunition, Unternehmen Mondnacht (Operation Moonlight) took place at midnight on [...] A strip of ground from Messines to Dixmude was bombarded with gas, which high winds dispersed with little effect on Allied troops.|$|E
