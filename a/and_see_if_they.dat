25|$|Although {{the film}} is of course fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done {{advertising}} work, he received many offers to do television commercials after Billy's Balloon drew international attention. In appearances Hertzfeldt has often told the humorous story of how he was tempted to produce the worst possible cartoons he {{could come up with}} for the companies, make off with their money, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would actually make it to air. Eventually this became the germ for Rejecteds theme of a collection of cartoons so bad they were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator's breakdown and ultimately the cartoons' metaphysical crisis.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{developed}} in Los Angeles, where Gaga and her team were working on some other music before the singer became busy with her acting endeavor for A Star Is Born. Gaga utilized the free time from her schedule and asked Blair to meet up <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{could come up with}} any new music. [...] "The Cure" [...] was released due to the positive nature and message in the track, although Gaga had already released Joanne, her fifth studio album, six months prior. According to Jocelyn Vena from Bravo, [...] "The Cure" [...] reminded her of the singer's dance-pop songs. Blair explained that the release happened after agreement between all the personnel involved: [...] "Joannes a great record... we weren't sitting there like, 'Oh, we need to make a song for the summertime and put it out this weekend'." ...|$|E

500|$|Although he had alienated much of London's Jewish community, Livingstone denied {{charges of}} anti-Semitism, holding regular {{meetings}} with the city's Jewish groups and introducing public Hanukkah celebrations in Trafalgar Square in December 2005. He came under further accusations of anti-semitism in March 2006 for asserting that the Indian-born Jewish businessmen David and Simon Reuben should [...] "go back to Iran <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> can do better under the ayatollahs" [...] {{if they did not}} like Britain; he claimed he had mistakenly believed them to be Iranian Muslims. He refused to apologise to the Reubens at the time, instead offering [...] "a complete apology to the people of Iran for the suggestion that they may be linked in any way to the Reuben brothers". The GLA rejected the accusation of misconduct against Livingstone over the incident in June 2006, but he did make a general apology for causing offence to Jews in the previous few years in December that year.|$|E
500|$|After {{searching for}} {{prospective}} collaborators, Madonna chose {{to work with}} Babyface, whose previous work with artists like Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton had resulted in successful smooth R songs. She was also fond of Babyface's song, [...] "When Can I See You" [...] from his third studio album For the Cool in You (1994). The singer's management called Babyface {{to set up a}} meeting <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> wanted to work together. Once met, both were surprised by their camaraderie and wanted to write songs. Madonna came over to Babyface's house and after a couple of days they came up with two songs. One of them was based on a piece of music composed by Babyface, but he was not sure about its musical direction. He made Madonna listen to the composition, and she found a way to take the song forward. Babyface clarified that [...] "t was just a beat and the chords. From there we collaborated and built it up... I was living in Beverly Hills and I created a little studio in my house, so she came over there to write." [...] Together they agreed that the first line of the song should be its title, and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was written. The words were never repeated in the track again.|$|E

Put them out of the reach of children. Do not use them unless it's necessary, but if you believe it is, do not hesitate." [...] When asked what advice he could give to quiet the town's fear, he responded [...] "I'd tell them to check the locks and bolts on their doors and get a double-barreled shotgun to take care of any intruder who tried to get in."

2500|$|The {{blocking}} hypothesis {{states that}} retrieval cues elicit the retrieval {{of a word}} related to the target that then blocks the retrieval of the correct word and causes {{the tip of the}} tongue phenomenon to occur. In other words, TOTs occur when plausible but incorrect responses to a query come to mind quickly. The person recognizes that the related words are incorrect but cannot retrieve the correct word because it is inhibited. [...] These related words are termed blockers because they block the ability to retrieve the correct word. This accounts for why TOTs predict memory performance. Once the inhibition of the correct word is removed or the blockers are forgotten, the TOT will be resolved. Evidence for this hypothesis is minimal as it is difficult to measure. Most research that takes on this approach give participants blockers <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> produce TOT states. This method is controversial as it is unclear if the blockers given produce TOT states or act as retrieval cues.|$|E

When a taxi finally arrived and brought him to Slemdal, the general staff had already evacuated to Eidsvoll without making arrangements for Laake's transport. Laake duly walked to the nearby Slemdal station and took the Holmenkoll Line to Majorstuen to find a taxi. Having failed again in finding transport, Laake made his way to Norges Geografiske Oppmåling to try <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had a car to lend him.

Separate units were detailed for patrolling, once the green line was reached and some cavalry were attached. Divisions were to build strongpoints and organise liaison with neighbouring divisions, with these groups given special training over model trenches. Ten days before zero, divisions were to send liaison officers to Corps Headquarters. Machine-gun units were to be under corps control, until the black line was reached then devolve to divisions, ready to sweep the Steenbeek valley and cover the advance to the green line by the 51st and 39th divisions. Tanks were attached to the divisions, under arrangements decided by the divisions and some wireless tanks were made available. Gas units remained under corps control, a model of the ground was built for all ranks to inspect and it was arranged that two maps per platoon would be issued. Plans for air-ground communication went into considerable detail. Aircraft recognition markings were given and the flares to be lit by the infantry when called for by contact aeroplanes was laid down, as were recognition marks for battalion and brigade headquarters; dropping stations were created to receive information from aircraft. Ground communication arrangements were made according to the manual [...] Appendices covered Engineer work on roads, rail, tramways and water supply; intelligence arrangements covered the use balloons, contact aeroplanes, Forward Observation Officers, prisoners, returning wounded, neighbouring formations and wireless eavesdropping. Corps Observers were attached to brigades, to patrol forward once the black line was reached, to observe the area up to the green line, judge the morale of the Germans opposite <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were preparing to counter-attack or retire, passing the information to a divisional Advanced Report Centre.|$|E
