5|$|Additionally, The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Link {{was one of}} {{the first}} games to combine {{role-playing}} video game and platforming elements to a considerable degree. Over the next few years, a number of Japanese-made games appeared with a similar format; major titles such as Cadash (1989) closely resemble The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Link, with side-scrolling platform stages supplemented by RPG-like statistical systems, weapons, armor, magic spells, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Link is {{a direct}} sequel to the {{original}} The Legend of Zelda, again involving the protagonist, Link, on a quest to save Princess Zelda, who has fallen under a sleeping spell. The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Links emphasis on side-scrolling and role-playing elements, however, was {{a significant departure from}} its predecessor. , the game remains the only technical sequel to the original title, as all other entries in the series either are prequels or take place in an alternative reality, according to the official Zelda timeline.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 {{a statue}} of Shackleton by Mark Richards was erected in Athy, {{sponsored}} by Kildare County Council. In 2017, the musical play Ernest Shackleton Loves Me by Val Vigoda and Joe DiPietro made its debut in New York City at the Tony Kiser Theater, an Off-Broadway venue. Blended with a parallel story of a struggling composer, the play retells the <b>adventure</b> <b>of</b> Endurance in detail, incorporating photos and videos of the journey.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1943, Hergé {{had decided}} that he wanted Jacobs to {{collaborate}} with him on The Adventures of Tintin. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Tintin, The Seven Crystal Balls, which began serialisation in Le Soir in December 1943.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Link allows storing up {{to three}} games in the cartridge's memory.

5|$|Many {{elements}} {{first introduced}} {{in this game}} have remained in the series. For instance, non-player characters (NPCs) were present in The Legend of Zelda, but their role was rather limited. Starting with The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Link, Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal roles in Link's quests. Zelda II {{was also one of}} the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas, giving the world a life of its own rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold. The use of metered magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games. The Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Link and plays an important role in later Zelda games, as it is strongly associated with Link. Dark Link is a version of Link's Shadow which appears in , a similar Link clone called Shadow Link appears in , and yet another appears in , as well as in A Link Between Worlds.|$|E
5|$|After Young Frankenstein was written, {{the rights}} {{were to be}} sold to Columbia Pictures, but after having trouble agreeing on the budget, Wilder, Brooks, and {{producer}} Michael Gruskoff went with 20th Century Fox, where both Brooks and Wilder had to sign five-year contracts. Young Frankenstein was a commercial success, with Wilder and Brooks receiving Best Adapted Screenplay nominations at the 1975 Oscars, losing to Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adaptation of The Godfather Part II. While filming Young Frankenstein, Wilder had an idea for a romantic musical comedy about a brother of Sherlock Holmes. Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn {{agreed to participate in the}} project, and Wilder began writing what became his directorial début, 1975's The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother.|$|E
5|$|First Light {{follows the}} <b>adventure</b> <b>of</b> two protagonists, Peter, {{who lives with}} his mother and father in New York but is in Greenland for his father's research, and Thea, who lives in an {{underground}} colony in Greenland called Gracehope. Gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called the Settlers who used to live in England. They possessed unusual abilities, such as extremely good vision and hearing, leading them to be called 'eye adepts' and 'ear adepts', respectively. These powers were seen as sorcery, prompting Grace, the leader of the Settlers, to bring the Settlers under the ice in Greenland where they could live in peace.|$|E

5|$|Hergé had {{developed}} {{the idea of}} setting an <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Tintin on the moon while producing Prisoners of the Sun. He began serialisation of Destination Moon, {{the first of a}} two part arc followed by Explorers on the Moon, in Tintin magazine in March 1950. In September 1950, Hergé broke off the story, feeling the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September. Many readers sent letters to Tintin asking why Explorers on the Moon was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died. Explorers of the Moon would resume after an eighteen month hiatus, returning in April 1952.|$|E
5|$|Many {{works of}} crime and horror have been set in the Peak. The Terror of Blue John Gap by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines, and Sherlock Holmes investigates the {{kidnapping}} of {{a child in the}} region in The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> the Priory School. Many of the horror stories of local author Robert Murray Gilchrist (1878–1916) feature Peak settings. More recently, Stephen Booth has written a series of crime novels set in various real and imagined Peak locations, while In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner, an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from the United States, Mézières visited the offices of Pilote {{magazine}} to see René Goscinny and Jean-Michel Charlier.

This {{would be the first}} serialised strip that Mézières would work on. Due to the lack of artistic freedom he was given (because Fred's script came with all the strip panels already blocked out), Mézières found this a difficult assignment.|$|E

5|$|Released nearly 8 {{months after}} the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure was created by a {{different}} third-party developer, Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Link, Zelda's Adventure took the top-down The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes, but rather than using drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have given more nuanced reviews {{of the first two}} games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is unanimously negative.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Link has a {{more complex}} combat system than its predecessor. Armed with a sword and shield, Link must {{alternate}} between standing and crouching positions in order to attack enemies and defend himself; for example, the Iron Knuckle enemy changes the height of its attack and its shield depending on Link's current stance, forcing Link to change stances until {{he has a chance}} to attack safely. Link has the ability to jump, which can be used for attacking tall or airborne enemies, and can be used for evasion. Eventually, he can learn techniques for downward and upward stabs in midair.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Link {{plays out}} in a two-mode dynamic. The overworld, {{the area where the}} {{majority}} of the action occurs in other The Legend of Zelda games, is still from a top-down perspective, but it now serves as a hub to the other areas. Whenever Link enters a new area such as a town, the game switches to a side-scrolling view. This mode is where most of the action takes place, and, with the exception of traveling across lava and water, it is the only mode in which Link can take damage and be killed.|$|E

5|$|The module's plot {{revolves}} around {{the tomb of the}} demilich Acererak. The player characters must battle their way past a variety of monsters and traps, with the ultimate goal of destroying Acererak. Tomb of Horrors was considered the third greatest Dungeons & Dragons <b>adventure</b> <b>of</b> all time by the staff of Dragon in 2004. The module has influenced later Dungeons & Dragons products, and was followed by three other (unrelated) modules in the S-series: S2 White Plume Mountain, S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, and S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.|$|E
5|$|Zelda II: The <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Link is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game with platforming elements. The second installment in The Legend of Zelda series, {{it was developed}} and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer Disk System on January 14, 1987, {{less than a year}} after the original The Legend of Zelda was released and seven months before North America saw the release of the first Zelda title. The game was released in North America and the PAL region for the Nintendo Entertainment System in late 1988, almost two years after its initial release in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{a series}} of {{newspaper}} supplements in late 1928, Wallez founded a supplement for children, Le Petit Vingtième (The Little Twentieth), which subsequently appeared in Le Vingtième Siècle every Thursday. Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly anti-semitic. For this new venture, Hergé illustrated L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet (The Extraordinary <b>Adventure</b> <b>of</b> Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet), a comic strip authored {{by one of the}} paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig. Hergé was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium—such as the systematic use of speech bubbles—found in such American comics as George McManus' Bringing Up Father, George Herriman's Krazy Kat and Rudolph Dirks's The Katzenjammer Kids, copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter Léon Degrelle, stationed there to report on the Cristero War.|$|E
