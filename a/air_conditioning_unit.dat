5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the headlamp switch, which was now located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E

25|$|A new {{option for}} all senior Oldsmobiles (88, Ninety-Eight {{and the new}} front-drive Toronado) was GM's {{automatic}} Comfortron Air Conditioning system first introduced by Cadillac in 1964. Comfortron permitted the driver to automatically set a year-round temperature at a constant level. The basic Frigidaire <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> offered in previous years continued as before and becoming an increasingly popular option on full-sized Oldsmobiles. Another new option for 1966 was a Tilt-and-Telescopic steering wheel that could be vertically adjusted to six different positions as well as telescoped outward from the instrument panel to improve driver comfort.|$|E

25|$|On June 19, 2014, a {{powerful}} storm with damaging winds tore {{a part of}} the main gym's, named McGarry Gym, roof off. Although the internal side of the roof was intact, an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> tore off, causing heavy rain to flood the gym. In addition, a gas line was damaged, as well as the bleachers. After drying out the floor, it was determined that a new floor would be put in only in the main area (the area where basketball and volleyball are played at.) The bleachers were recovered and the gas line was fixed.|$|E
25|$|Air {{conditioning}} is {{the cooling}} and de-humidification of indoor air for thermal comfort. Using {{a system of}} coils {{as a solution to}} cool and remove moisture from muggy air in a printing plant that was wrinkling magazine pages, Willis Carrier invented and manufactured the world's first mechanical <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> in 1902. Carrier's invention â€“ encompassing the first system to provide man-made control over temperature, humidity, ventilation and air quality, was first installed as a solution to the quality problems experienced at a Brooklyn printing plant, Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company. Air conditioning not only spawned a company and an industry, but also brought about profound economic, social and cultural changes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of The Simpsons, Homer Simpson {{generally}} loathed Ned, because Ned's family, job, health and self-discipline are of higher quality than he could ever hope to attain himself. Homer is often shown [...] "borrowing" [...] (stealing) items from Flanders, such as a weather vane, a camcorder, a diploma, a toothbrush and an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit.</b> Even the Simpsons' couch came from [...] "the curb outside Flanders' house". Homer has since come to have a love-hate relationship with Ned, sometimes being his best friend, partly due to Ned's selfless tolerance of him, and other times treating Ned with complete disregard. Homer seems to genuinely care for Ned, despite still expressing and often acting on feelings of loathing. Nowadays Homer seems to regard Ned as more of a nuisance. An early running joke was that Marge considers Flanders to be a perfect neighbor and usually sides with him instead of her husband, which always enrages Homer. Flanders is normally oblivious to Homer's disdain for him.|$|E

500|$|Initially police {{believed}} that the murder was a drive-by shooting, but investigators discovered a tennis shoe print near the outdoor <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit,</b> and a yellow business card next to Fischer's body. Though the business card was stained by blood from Corinne's hands after she {{tried to stop the}} bleeding, investigators were able to decipher the wording on the card. It was from the Collin County bail office in McKinney, Texas. A [...] phone number was printed on the card and it had a handwritten area code, 214, from the Dallas area. Alex Perez, the former sheriff of Cameron County, who was appointed to lead the investigation, called the bail office and asked them to fax copies of bond applications made by Rio Grande Valley residents. The police theorized that the assailant had dropped the card after Fischer tried to defend himself. The bail office faxed the police several applications, and included one from Rudy Cuellar, a Dallas resident who often visited Mexico.|$|E

[...] The locomotive suffered major damages in 2000 {{as a result of a}} collision with a dump truck at a grade crossing in Livonia, Louisiana.

2500|$|When body {{temperature}} is significantly elevated, mechanical cooling methods {{are used to}} remove heat and to restore the body's ability to regulate its own temperatures. [...] Passive cooling techniques, such as resting in a cool, shady area and removing clothing can be applied immediately. [...] Active cooling methods, such as sponging the head, neck, and trunk with cool water, remove heat from the body and thereby speed the body's return to normal temperatures.

Among the changes were a new streamlined cowling, strengthening of the airframe, changes to various air intakes, and a new prop. These improved cruise speed by a significant , making it more competitive with similar models from other companies. More significant upgrades were {{carried out in the}} interior, which received a high-quality leather upholstery upgrade, reading lamps, better soundproofing and an optional powerful <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit.</b> One reviewer summed it up as [...] "an ultra-spacious interior that looks more like a luxury car than a spam can".|$|E
2500|$|Since Onyx {{was already}} under construction, {{the boat was}} {{finished}} to Royal Navy specifications. All three boats received modifications to the original Oberon design, which included the enlargement of the snort de-icer, a different weapons fit, a larger <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit,</b> active sonar and different communications equipment. The second and third hulls were built to Canadian specifications, which moved the galley forward of the control room {{to make room for}} the sonar equipment. This led to the removal of three crew bunks, a problem that was never rectified in the submarines and led to an accommodation issue for the crew. The three submarines were acquired for service as [...] "clockwork mice", submarines used to train surface vessels in anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
2500|$|The Rothenberg killing was {{the first}} of many murders {{committed}} by DeMeo's crew. While Gaggi was not involved in most of these killings, he did participate in some of them. DeMeo and Gaggi shot and killed Vincent Governara, a young man with no mob ties, over a fight between him and Gaggi that had occurred twelve years before. In 1976, DeMeo, killed George Byrum, an electrical contractor, who had tipped off thieves who attempted to burglarize Gaggi's Florida vacation home without knowing Gaggi and his wife were present. Under Gaggi's direction, DeMeo shot and killed Byrum in a Miami hotel room while Gaggi and another mobster, Tony Plate, attempted to dismember the body. However, they were interrupted by a construction crew outside the room that was repairing a faulty <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit,</b> causing them to flee.
