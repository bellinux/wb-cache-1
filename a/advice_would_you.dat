(2) What <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> give to employers of these people? Data were gathered through 10 individual semi-structured in-depth interviews with HNC clinic patients at a regional cancer center's head and neck clinic in Ontario, Canada. A constant comparative method of theme development was used. Codes identified in and derived from the data were discussed by research team members until consensus was reached. Codes with similar characteristics were grouped together and used to develop overarching themes. Work-related advice for peers focused on personal self-care and interactions within workplaces. Work-related advice to employers focused on demonstrating basic human values as well as the importance of communication. The study results suggest HNC clinic patients should be proactive with employers and help to set reasonable expectations and provide a realistic plan for work to be successfully completed. HNC clinic patients should develop communication skills to effectively disclose their cancer and treatment to employers. In this exploratory study, HNC clinic patients' advice was solution-focused underscoring the importance of self-care and pro-active communication and planning with employers.

To better understand the reasons new residents move to the Panhandle, twelve focus groups were held across the region. The focus groups are part of a University of NebraskaSLincoln research project funded by a 2006 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture National Research Initiative (USDA-NRI), looking at the characteristics and motivations of new residents in the eleven counties. The research project includes a demographic study, a mail survey to new residents, an iterative three-phase survey process to community development practitioners and a focus group of new residents. For further information about this research project, visit [URL] All new residents receiving the mail survey had the option to participate in the focus groups. Of the 321 mail survey respondents, 78 individuals participated in 12 focus groups held in six Panhandle communities during the Summer of 2007. The majority of the focus group participants, ranging in age from 21 to 81, moved with their spouse, significant other or family. First time Nebraskans represent 63 percent of the focus group participants, compared to 38 percent of those that answered the mail survey.

40|$|Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) - 1 Cue: Foot and Mouth {{disease is}} one of the most devastating of {{livestock}} diseases, not primarily because of the health risk it poses to animals, but because of the economic losses that occur when outbreaks happen. Areas that see Foot and Mouth outbreaks are unable to trade any livestock or livestock products until the disease is controlled, causing much financial hardship to farmers. In order to limit the size of outbreaks, early detection of the disease and quick notification of the veterinary authorities are both essential. For this reason it is vital that farmers are aware of the signs of the disease, and are constantly on the lookout. In our next report, Sylvia Jiyane finds out more about how farmers and veterinary services must work in partnership so that outbreaks of Foot and Mouth disease can be tackled quickly and effectively. IN:		?Good livestock management relies ? OUT:		?Matabeleland North province of Zimbabwe. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And that report was from Sylvia Jiyane. Transcript Jiyane	Good livestock management relies heavily on disease control, and in our discussion today we shall be talking about Foot and Mouth disease. In our programme today I shall be talking to Dr Ndabezinhle Mkhwananzi, a government veterinary officer from Matabeleland North province in Bulawayo. He is going to start off by giving us a definition of the disease. Mkhwananzi	Foot and Mouth disease is a highly contagious specified, or notifiable disease, which causes blisters in the mouth and on the feet of cattle. In fact all cloven hoofed animals ? pigs, sheep and goats, as well as the wildlife like kudus and impalas. Jiyane	And what are some of the key signs and symptoms of this disease? Mkhwananzi	Blisters develop in the mouth and between the claws of the hooves. The blisters contain a clear fluid. In time the blisters will burst, and what will be left there is raw skin sores, which will be sore and the animal will not be able to walk; it will become lame. And it won?t even be able to eat. Jiyane	And Dr Mkhwananzi, if a farmer notices some of those symptoms which you have mentioned, what should he or she do? Mkhwananzi	As I mentioned earlier, this is a notifiable disease. By law, if a farmer suspects his cow has got Foot and Mouth, he has to report to the Department of Veterinary Services, whereby in hours the Veterinary Department will quickly go there and confirm the symptoms, whether they are Foot and Mouth or not. Jiyane	And is this disease one that can be treated? Mkhwananzi	There is no treatment for Foot and Mouth disease. So the major thing is to control the outbreak of the disease. Jiyane	And what are some of these measures? Mkhwananzi	If the Department of Veterinary Services confirms that this is a suspicious case of Foot and Mouth, we will quickly put the area under quarantine. In fact this is the most important disease as far as the Department of Veterinary Services is concerned, not in terms of deaths and so forth, but the economic implications. So, people have to be on the look out for the disease and report it early enough. We put the place under quarantine, carry out vaccination campaigns. Then, after some time we go and investigate whether the disease is still there or not. Afterwards we shall then lift the quarantine. Jiyane	For how long will you quarantine animals in relation to this disease? Mkhwananzi	The initial quarantine will be thirty days. Jiyane	And you have just mentioned earlier on that this disease is of economic importance. Can you clarify that? Mkhwananzi	Right, when there is an outbreak of Foot and Mouth, no trade is supposed to take place. No animals are supposed to go for slaughter, or the milk to the dairy market and so forth. So it affects the economic activity relating to livestock. Jiyane	And for farmers listening right now, what <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> give them from your own experience of this disease? Mkhwananzi	The main thing is to adhere to control measures, like movement of animals. They should come to the department for any movement of animals, say for distances of 5 kilometres or above, whereby they are issued with a permit, a movement permit. And inspections are carried out, to ascertain whether the animal has got any signs of Foot and Mouth or not. That will control the spread of the disease, and also the farmers are not inconvenienced when we put much stronger measures like quarantine and so forth. Jiyane	And just to take you back, you mentioned that this disease also affects wildlife. Is there any way in which the Veterinary Department is involved in the control of spread of that disease in wildlife areas? Mkhwananzi	The buffalo is taken to be the reservoir of the disease, that is, the carrier. The buffalo itself doesn?t get sick of Foot and Mouth; it carries the disease. So we prevent any contact between livestock, that is domestic livestock such as cattle, with the buffalo. All buffalo should be reported if they are sighted, so that the department will go and control them by culling. That is what we do. Jiyane	I was talking to Dr Ndabezinhle Mkhwananzi, a government veterinary officer from Matabeleland North province of Zimbabwe. End of track.

40|$|Water melons Cue: Water melons {{have been}} {{cultivated}} {{by people in}} Africa for over 4000 years, and long before {{that would have been}} collected from the wild by people {{in the southern part of}} the continent, where they are a native plant. Spread into Europe from north Africa around a thousand years ago, and into South America by the Spanish colonists, they grow best in places that have long, hot summers, and are more resistant to drought than other types of melon. They tend to be popular with both farmers and shoppers, because of their high juice content, and the high price they can fetch in the market. The common cultivated varieties are very distinctive, with their dark green outer skin and bright red flesh. Ousman Konateh has been growing water melons on the outskirts of Banjul in The Gambia, for more than twenty years. Ismaila Senghore talked to him about what he had learned during this long period of successful farming. IN:		?On an area of land of 30 metres by 30 metres? OUT:		? whenever they have the possibility. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 56 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Ousmane Konateh, a water melon farmer from Banjul in The Gambia. Transcript Konateh	(Vernac) On an area of land of 30 metres by 30 metres you can harvest up to a thousand watermelons and that is only the first harvest because you can harvest up to three times. In the last harvest you can also make up to 300 watermelons. Senghore	Now Mr Konateh let?s now look at the aspect of growing the crop itself. Now you said the soil was good but what about a situation where the soil conditions and water conditions are not very good. Do you think you will still have a good harvest? Konateh	(Vernac) For the soil aspect actually even on poor soil conditions watermelons do very well. But it would be necessary to apply compound fertiliser which you can buy and mix it with the soil and then grow your melons. You can also grow them using animal dung, like cow dung for fertiliser. That will also be very, very productive and you can have very good sweet watermelons from there. It is also important to know that sandy soils are better than clay soils. Senghore	Now let?s talk a bit about the pests, because insects can also be a bit of a problem? Konateh	(Vernac) Well on the side of pests actually one must just contact the agricultural extension workers who give very good advice. Because when it is flowering time it would be necessary to spray the crop and when it starts fruiting it will also be necessary to spray maybe weekly to control pests. But actually the best thing to do is to contact the agricultural extension workers who are always with us and helping us, giving us advice. They are the experts so definitely they are very helpful in that respect. So we do not have difficulty in that area. Senghore	Mr Konateh, what would you tell anybody who has never grown watermelon anywhere in the Third world? What good <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> tell such a person if he wants to embark on growing watermelon and what incentives can attract a person to this particular crop? Konateh	(Vernac) Actually the first thing to think about if you want to farm watermelons is to get the seeds and get the land and of course the other inputs that are necessary. And when it comes to guarding also the field because you would need to guard it against thieves and against animals that may pilfer the farm. Of course it can be a crop that you can use as an intervention, for example for late starting of the rainy season. If you were away travelling or you were sick and you could not grow on time now an opportunity is there for you to still grow watermelons and they can produce. Because the growing season is very short, it is about just two months you can plant your seeds, even at the end of the rains with minimum water you can still harvest. And if you are a normal farmer and the rains are good, everything is OK. You can still grow melons and it would be an added income, an added value on your yearly earnings. But it is important to know that they are in fact also possible to grow at the beginning of rains and that is when you know you have a lot of productivity. The only problem is that a lot would also get spoilt because of the amount of water at that time. But the important thing to note is that the early season crops are the most valuable because at that time it is out of the market and then they fetch very, very high value. So I would advise everybody to go into the production of watermelons whenever they have the possibility. End of track. Ousman Konateh, who has been growing water melons on his farm outside Banjul in The Gambia for over 20 years, explains some basic rules for producing this popular food crop...|$|E
40|$|Beeswax {{candles and}} creams Cue: Livestock such as cattle provide {{a wide range}} of products: meat, milk, hides, manure and labour. Bees may be a much smaller animal, but they also provide an {{impressive}} range of products. The most obvious is honey, but there are several others, including beeswax and Royal Jelly. Bees produce the beeswax in order to construct the honeycomb. Once a bee-keeper has extracted the honey from the comb, this can be melted into a lump of wax, which has many potential uses. As such, beeswax may be a useful source of extra income for bee-keepers. In The Gambia the National Beekeepers? Association {{is at the heart of}} the country?s bee-keeping activities. Beekeepers bring their honey and other bee products to the Association for them to be sold, or used in making value added products. Ismaila Senghore recently visited the Association?s headquarters, located on a busy road in the capital Banjul, to find out more about the value of these bee by-products. IN:		?I am right here at the National ? OUT:		?to you. Thank you very much. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 37 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And that was Ismaila Senghore reporting from Banjul in The Gambia. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Senghore	I am right here at the National Beekeepers? Association of The Gambia, right in their warehouse where they have the activities of processing of honey going on. And of course we have other by-products also from honey production, that is the wax, like candles, body creams and a lot more. But I have with me here Mr Ebrima Sanyang who is the processing officer of the National Beekeepers? Association of The Gambia. Mr Sanyang is going to tell me exactly how they manage to get the wax in the first place, and what they make out of this wax as by-products which are also meant for the market. Sanyang	Thank you Mr Senghore I am here to give you the view points of the by-products that we have in office here. After extracting out of the honey you put it in a container whereby you can melt it and then produce the wax alone with the bad elements out of it. Then from there you reprocess it again for it to be more clean than before, refining it with coke which will make it cleaner than before. Then you can start to make what you are going to make out of it. Senghore	Now what are the kinds of commodities that you get out of the wax in that form? Sanyang	You can make candles, body cream, wood polish, soap, cosmetics possibly. Senghore	Alright now let?s say if you look at the products that you make, like the ones on display here, the body creams, how do you go about making the body cream for example? Can you explain briefly? Sanyang	Yes ok making body cream you have a certain measurement of the products you are going to use. For the wax itself there is a measurement which is one tea cup full of wax and then you can buy your oil, this vegetable oil, two cups measured in it, put it in the wax, melt it with other products like mentholator or this Karit‚ cream, you add there too to make it soft. Senghore	Ok now let?s talk about the candles, how do you go about making the candles? Sanyang	You are going to break the wax into pieces or into particles, whereby you melt it. And then the other chemical you are going to put inside for it to absorb fire easily is paraffin, which is not available in time. But what we do is we buy these candles from the shops, break it into pieces, melt it together with the wax so that the paraffin inside that candle can be mixed up with the wax to absorb fire easily. Senghore	Now do you make enough for the market, in other words is the demand very high? Sanyang	Well the demand is not so high because we Africans we are not adopting this type of system of candles. But let?s say the whites who always come, sometimes they make a lot of demand, whereby I make it for them, then sell it to them for their own use. Senghore	Finally Mr Sanyang would you say this kind of activity, processing of commodities from wax honey by-products, can be something that can be sustainable amongst your members, like for example they can go and do it on their own even if you are not around? Sanyang	Yes, some of them they do make it because when I am away, sometimes I meet up with others who are making it, and then some comes to my centre to buy wax for making body creams and the likes. Senghore	Therefore what <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> give to anybody who is planning to go into the processing of such by-products? What kind of advice do you think will be useful to them so they will make successful enterprises like this? Sanyang	Yes, I thought that before you start on the process you have to find all your necessary equipments whereby your work will be easy without any other problem. Senghore	Thank you very much Mr Ebrima Sanyang. That was Mr Ebrima Sanyang talking to me about the processing of wax into commodities that are useable by the local markets and of course by tourists coming here in The Gambia. Mr Sanyang is the Processing Officer of the National Beekeeper?s Association of the Gambia. Mr Sanyang it has been a great pleasure talking to you. Thank you very much.

40|$|Using the Sun?s rays Cue: Sun drying is {{the oldest}} method of drying {{agricultural}} produce. It?s free, and it?s effective. There are some disadvantages: the weather is not always hot, and roaming animals can sometimes get a juicy meal from your hard work. But, as Ismaila Senghore found out {{when he spoke to}} Peter Monnie, sun drying has its rewards. With some added salt, all kinds of fish can be preserved through sun drying - from skate to the unusual-looking ?guitar? fish. By putting them on a platform of stalks from the ?rhun? tree, which is like a palm tree, the fish are protected from scavenging animals. Once dried they can be sold. Ismaila went to one fishing community on the windy beaches of Banjul in The Gambia, to find out more. IN:	?The people here are mainly? OUT:	?Yes a glut. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 18 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Ismaila Senghore talking to Peter Monnie in the Gambia. Adding salt, together with the heat from the sun, can preserve all kinds of fish - and fruits and vegetables too. The market may not always be good. But sun dried foods have the advantage that they can be stored, and eaten when resources are scarce. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Monnie	The people here are mainly fishermen so our women too, they also have involved themselves in it. Senghore	Now let me know now the kind of fish that you dry here? Monnie	Skate, skate fish or guitar fish as their form looks like a guitar. So we have named it guitar fish. Senghore	The sea snails - you dry them here too? Monnie	Yes we have them also here. We also dry them here. We also get them from the fishermen and we get them, we crack then we dry them. So it is also part of the activities. Senghore	Now Peter, what are the procedures that you undertake in drying your fish? When you want to dry fish, where do you start from? Monnie	Yes, when we want to dry the fish at least we bring the fish from the seashore and you bring them to our site. Then we off scale them, we scale them off. We remove some of the items in the fish. Senghore	The intestines and so forth? Monnie	Yes. Senghore	And the gills? Monnie	Yes the gills and the intestines. As you can see them you see we remove them and then after you wash them. Then you put them on the platforms. Senghore	So in other words the only treatment that you apply is salting? Monnie	Yes it is only salt because salt is the natural treatment. Senghore	Now I have seen that you have various fish here spread on these platforms. Why do you have to put them on platforms, almost one metre high? Monnie	Yes, you have to do so because we have some animals around us, donkeys, cattle and it is not safe to dry them on the ground. Senghore	I can see that your platform seems to be very practical because it made of the stalks of rhun leaves and you have some tree cuttings that you have planted in the garden, you mounted your platform on these tree cuttings. Now you can see that there is space between the rhun sticks that allows some kind of air to blow from under through the fish. Now does that possibly help your drying, is it advantageous for the drying? Monnie	Yes it is very, very advantageous so that air can blow under it so that while the one that is facing the sun is drying, then the wind also is blowing under it so that they get dry at the same time. Senghore	Now {{how do you know that}} your fish is dry? Do you come to look at it from time to time? Monnie	Yes we are always at the site. When we dry them the next day we come and we turn them all around then it becomes fully dry. Senghore	Yes because the temperature may not be very hot from the sun. Sometimes you know it might not be very sunny. It means you have to come day by day to turn it over and over is it? Monnie	Yes that is why you turn them all around. Senghore	Ok, now that you come and inspect it every day to see whether it is dry now. When it is fully dry how would you know it is fully dry? Monnie	Yes because when it is dry the fish become very hard. When you break it you cannot, it cannot then everything becomes hard. Senghore	All right now if you would want to, for example, tell anybody to start this kind of venture anywhere in the Third World what kind of <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> give them? Monnie	Yes the advice that I would give them is that it seems like tedious work but it is also helping our community. Senghore	Now Mr Monnie, when you come to selling your fish now where do you sell your fish and do you think it is lucrative business? Monnie	Yes after drying them we pack them, we wake up early in the morning around five o?clock and we send them to the roadside and then we take where we have the market there, then we sell. So we sell them locally. Senghore	And do you have a good revenue from it, is it lucrative like is it profitable? Monnie	Yes, sometimes it is profitable. If a lot of people in the market in a day, the market will not be all that impressive because a lot of the fish will be there. So sometimes you will sell? Senghore	There will be a glut? Monnie	Yes a glut. End of trackThe oldest method of drying has advantages and disadvantage...|$|E

[...] "That John Wilkes is not {{concerned}} in it I am {{as sure as}} you are; and, thinking the matter over, I see not how the apprentices could have carried off so many articles, some heavy and some bulky, {{when they left the}} shop in the evening, without John Wilkes noticing them. So sure am I, that my <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> be that <b>you</b> should take John Wilkes into your confidence, and tell him how matters stand. My only objection to that is that he is a hasty man, and that I fear {{he would not be able}} to keep his countenance, so that the apprentices would remark that something was wrong. I am far from saying that they have any hand in it; it would be a grievous wrong to them to have suspicions when there is no shadow of evidence against them; but at any rate, if this matter is to be stopped and the thieves detected, it is most important that they should have, if they are guilty, no suspicion that they are in any way being watched, or that these deficiencies have been discovered. If they have had a hand in the matter they most assuredly had accomplices, for such goods could not be disposed of by an apprentice to any dealer without his being sure that they must have been stolen." ...|$|R

There are further obligations they have as members of a profession. There is a difference.
