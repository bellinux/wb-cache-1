5|$|Rose Tyler and the Doctor {{decide to}} visit Rose's mother Jackie. Jackie {{is pleased to}} see them, but makes <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> happy remark that her {{deceased}} father will be joining them shortly. Despite Rose's protestations that her grandfather is dead, Jackie insists that he has returned and has been visiting her for some time. A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat, surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing. TV broadcasts confirm {{that this is a}} worldwide phenomenon and Jackie explains that a few months previously millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world. Humans have come to accept them and believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones.|$|E
25|$|Two other Harriott albums {{appeared}} in 1967 and 1968. The first, Swings High (Melodisc), was <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> retrospective-sounding, but outstanding bebop record featuring old cohorts Seamen, Goode and Smythe; 1968's Personal Portrait (Columbia) was {{a mixed bag}} of jazz with strings and some affecting work with old bandmate Smythe and Stan Tracey.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} night {{the play is}} going very well. In his {{dressing}} room, <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife Sylvia that several years ago he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about his inner Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia wishes him luck and leaves the room, Riggan picks up a real gun and checks that it is loaded for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on-stage. The play receives a standing ovation as Tabitha rushes out to file copy.|$|E

Headmaster Albus Dumbledore persuades {{his old friend}} Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as a professor {{as there is a}} vacancy to fill. There is a more important reason, however, for Slughorn's return. While in a Potions lesson, Harry takes possession of <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> annotated school textbook, inscribed 'This is the property of the Half-Blood Prince'. Draco Malfoy struggles to carry out a deed presented to him by Voldemort. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Harry secretly work together to discover the method on how to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all.|$|E
25|$|The film {{begins with}} the {{sentencing}} of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between {{the reading of the}} sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on a redheaded girl (Karoline Herfurth) selling yellow plums, following her and repeatedly attempting to sniff her, but startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her all over, becoming distraught when her scent fades. Afterwards, Grenouille is haunted by the desire to recreate the girl's aroma.|$|E
500|$|In September 2001, in an DVD {{review of}} the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of Â½/5 and calls it [...] "the first season at its worst" [...] and {{continues}} [...] that it was [...] "notable for introducing Mr. Burns and (<b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> African-American) Smithers, but otherwise boring and preachy".|$|E

500|$|Backbreakers mobile editions fared well, selling over 1.5 {{million copies}} of their application. The iOS and Android {{versions}} also received positive reviews from critics. [...] "Backbreaker is a fun mini game with cool graphics and animations," [...] said Eli Hodapp in his review of the application. [...] "There isn't anything overly technical about the gameplay, but it has <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> compelling aspect to it, especially as you're high stepping to the end zone," [...] he added.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} days of working on BG2 there was <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> serene feeling in the office. We didn't {{experience}} the headlong panic that is sometimes prevalent while finishing a game, but we certainly did experience considerable stress as we built 21 final candidates in 3 days. After a few long nights with the whole team playing the game over and over again, we reached a point where we built a good final candidate. Then it was sent to the duplicators! ...|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were so glowing. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Although she enjoyed the comedic {{elements}} of the episode, she was somewhat critical of the underlying issues, most notably the way Mulder and Scully viewed {{each other in the}} episode. She wrote that, [...] "their relationship seems to be <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> passive-aggressive one". Vitaris also was critical of the fact that Mulder was not guilty over the fact that he may have killed an innocent boy.|$|E
500|$|Carroon {{is taken}} to Briscoe's office for care, {{on the grounds that}} {{conventional}} hospitals and doctors would have no idea how to evaluate or treat the world's first returned astronaut suffering from some sort of adverse event while in space. [...] But even with Briscoe's care, Carroon remains mute, generally immobile, but alert with his eyes which now have a feral and cunning aspect. Briscoe also discovers <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> disfigured place on his shoulder, and notices changes in his face which suggest some sort of mutation of the underlying bone structure. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard Inspector Lomax has undertaken investigation of the other two men's disappearance and, having surreptitiously fingerprinted Carroon as a suspect, alerts Quatermass that the prints resemble those of nothing human.|$|E
500|$|Spook Country is a 2007 {{novel by}} {{speculative}} fiction [...] author William Gibson. A political thriller set in contemporary North America, it followed {{on from the}} author's previous novel, Pattern Recognition (2003), and was succeeded in 2010 by Zero History, which featured {{much of the same}} core cast of characters. The plot comprises the intersecting tales of three protagonists: Hollis Henry, a musician-turned-journalist researching a story on locative art; Tito, a young Cuban-Chinese operative whose family is on occasion in the employ of a renegade ex-CIA agent; and Milgrim, a drug-addled translator held captive by Brown, <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> authoritarian and secretive man. Themes explored include the ubiquity of locative technology, the eversion of cyberspace and the political climate of the United States {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11, 2001 attacks.|$|E

500|$|From November 2006 to May 2007, Hawke starred as Mikhail Bakunin in Tom Stoppard's trilogy play The Coast of Utopia, an eight-hour-long {{production}} at the Lincoln Center Theater in New York. The Los Angeles Times complimented Hawke's take on Bakunin, writing: [...] "Ethan Hawke buzzes in and out as Bakunin, <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> appealing enthusiast {{on his way to}} becoming a famous anarchist." [...] The performance earned Hawke his first Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play. In November 2007 he directed Things We Want, a two-act play by Jonathan Marc Sherman, for the artist-driven Off-Broadway company The New Group. The play has four characters played by Paul Dano, Peter Dinklage, Josh Hamilton, and Zoe Kazan. New York magazine praised Hawke's [...] "understated direction", particularly his ability to [...] "steer a gifted cast away from the histrionics".|$|E
500|$|Having {{initially}} {{announced a}} new album entitled So Help Me God slated for a 2014 release, in March 2015 West announced that the album would instead be tentatively called SWISH. Later that month, West was awarded an honorary doctorate by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for his contributions to music, fashion, and popular culture, officially making him an honorary DFA. The next month, West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance. Toward {{the end of the}} set, West proclaimed himself: [...] "the greatest living rock star on the planet." [...] Media outlets, including social media sites such as Twitter, were divided on his performance. NME stated, [...] "The decision to book West for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement, and the show itself appeared to polarise both Glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch on their TVs." [...] The publication added that [...] "he's letting his music speak for and prove itself." [...] The Guardian said that [...] "his set has a potent ferocity â but there are gaps and stutters, and he cuts <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> lone figure in front of the vast crowd." [...] In September 2015, West performed 808s & Heartbreak in its entirety two nights in a row to rave reviews at Hollywood Bowl. The performance featured a 60-person orchestra, a live band, guests from the album and 70 plus dancers. In December 2015, West released a song titled [...] "Facts".|$|E
500|$|When the Museum of the Chinese Revolution {{opened on}} Tiananmen Square in 1961, the {{painting}} was displayed on a huge wall in the gallery devoted to the Communist triumph, but in 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, radicals shut down the museum, and it remained closed until 1969. [...] During that time, Liu Shaoqi, accused of taking a [...] "capitalist road", was purged from government. [...] His removal from {{the painting was}} ordered in 1967, and Dong was tasked to carry it out. [...] Dong had suffered during the Cultural Revolution: {{accused of being a}} rightist, he was expelled from the Party for two years, sent to a rural work camp, and then was [...] "rehabilitated" [...] by being made to labor as a steelworker. [...] Dong's task was difficult, as Liu {{was one of the most}} prominent figures in the first row, standing to the left of Madame Song. [...] Officials wanted Liu replaced with Lin Biao, much in Mao's favor at the time. [...] Dong was unwilling to give Lin prominence he had not then had, and though he could not refuse outright at the dangerous time of the Cultural Revolution, he eventually got permission to merely remove Liu. [...] The figure was too large to simply delete, so Liu was repainted as Dong Biwu, and made to appear as if in the second row. [...] According to Andrews, the attempt was a failure: [...] "the new Dong Biwu does not recede into the second row as intended. [...] Instead, he appears as a leering, glowing figure, <b>a</b> <b>strangely</b> malevolent character in the midst of an otherwise stately group". [...] Officials deemed the revised work unexhibitable. [...] Andrews speculated that Dong may have been trying to sabotage the change, or may have been affected by the stress of the years of the Cultural Revolution.|$|E

40|$|A real, almost palpable, {{connection}} {{exists between}} the official and the underground economy. More than that, {{both sides of the}} economy (official and underground) are connected with the competitiveness of <b>a</b> country. <b>Strangely</b> <b>a</b> large presence of undereground in the economy is a sign of competitiveness. Although we would be tempted to say that underground is bad for competitiveness the reality is that due to taxes and regulations the resources (especially the human ones) used âillegalyâ would probably be wasted. In the end the wages from the underground economy return to the oficial one suporting it and hence the competitiveness of the country. ...|$|R

2500|$|Loneliness, if only as {{representing}} {{a lack of}} communication, is recurrent through Lain.
