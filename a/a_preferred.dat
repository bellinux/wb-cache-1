5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at <b>a</b> <b>preferred</b> temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E

5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food {{on the basis of}} profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for <b>a</b> <b>preferred</b> food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E

5|$|Celadon: Named after a pale-tinted spring green colour, Chinese {{archaeologist}} Wang Zhongshu (1982) {{asserts that}} shards having {{this type of}} ceramic glaze have been recovered from Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang; he also asserts {{that this type of}} ceramic became well known during the Three Kingdoms (220–265). Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadon—which requires a minimum 1260°C (2300°F) furnace temperature, <b>a</b> <b>preferred</b> range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F), and reduced firing—was not created until the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). The unique grey or green celadon glaze is a result of iron oxide's transformation from ferric to ferrous iron (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the firing process. Longquan celadon wares, which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than stonewares.|$|E

5|$|Freitas finds {{numerous}} {{reasons why}} interstellar probes may be <b>a</b> <b>preferred</b> method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing {{to make contact}} with Earth. A civilization aiming {{to learn more about the}} distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.|$|E

5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be <b>a</b> <b>preferred</b> first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|It {{was thought}} at the time that empty space was filled with a {{background}} medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as <b>a</b> <b>preferred</b> frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore {{it should be possible to}} measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.|$|E
