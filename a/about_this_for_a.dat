40|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> long time, we {{are facing}} {{problems}} like failures of small and big structures. The biggest problem behind this is swelling soils. This is very unstable soil. Its property varies from hard to soft and dry to wet. It exhibits swelling and shrinkage with different water content. As a result, many structures usually face excessive settlement and differential movements, which causes damage to foundation systems and other structural elements. We are aware <b>about</b> <b>this</b> situation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, but unable to make improvements due to absence of technologies till now. Through physico-chemical modifications, lime can control the plasticity, swelling and shrinkage of soil effectively. Also, lime can stabilize soil through cementation which increases strength and stiffness remarkably. In this work the plasticity characteristics, swell shrinkage properties, compaction characteristics and strength properties of plastic soils with a wide plasticity range treated with lime has been evaluated experimentally. Based on the unconfined compressive strength the optimum lime content of soils has been found out. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> purpose, commercial high plastic clay (i. e. bentonite) having liquid limit of 340 % is mixed with different proportions to a residual soil having liquid limit 34 % and four different soils were synthesized {{over a wide range}} of plasticity. The physical properties of raw soils were found out. The four soils were amended with different lime content and the index properties as well as engineering properties have been studied by conducting relevant experiments conforming to Indian standard code of practice. Based on the experimental results it is observed that the liquid limit and plasticity reduces as lime content increases, swell and shrink characteristics decreases with lime content. Also, lime has a significant effect on strength...|$|R

The process of construction {{is similar to that}} for early closed magnetosphere models, such as the Taylor-Hones model. The first model in fact is simply an addition of an interplanetary field in arbitrary direction to a Taylor-Hones image dipole model. In order to preserve the shape of the magnetosphere at high latitudes, and to partially exclude the exterior field, another model is constructed with the magnetopause approximated by a diamagnetic sphere. We find that there are some interplanetary field lines connected to the earth for all orientations of the interplanetary field other than strictly northward, and that the maximum number of connected field lines occurs with a due southward field. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> average spiral hose angle of the interplanetary field, the dayside neutral point occurs on the magnetopause at about 10 o'clock local time.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 66 - 75. The U. S. {{military and}} the CIA have been using unmanned drone aircraft, in various ways, {{for the past two}} decades. The CIA began using armed drones in 2002 to wreak havoc on Al-Qaeda and its operatives, primarily in Pakistan, Yemen, Afghanistan and Somalia. However, the CIA’s targeted drone killing program was kept officially secret until President Obama admitted, indirectly, to its existence, in 2013. The U. S. public was effectively kept in the dark <b>about</b> <b>this</b> program <b>for</b> over <b>a</b> decade. Recently, with growing public awareness of the use of drones, questions have been raised {{as to whether or not}} unmanned technologies in general – and drones in particular – have the potential to lower the threshold for the use of lethal force. However, the literature surrounding this subject is limited. This thesis aims to provide the reader with a detailed background regarding the evolution of the U. S. military drone program. Moreover, it provides an analysis of the results from a public opinion survey I administered in 2014, in an attempt to discover what effect the use of military drones may have on a select sample from the Charlottesville and Albemarle area in the State of Virginia and the willingness to intervene militarily overseas.
