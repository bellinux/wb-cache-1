From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E

5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most being {{found in the}} largely iron-silicon-nickel core. Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part per billion of the crust whereas its concentration in the core {{is thought to be}} nearly 6,000 times higher.

5|$|Heavy {{water is}} a form of water that {{contains}} a larger than normal <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in ordinary water.

His mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in 1933.|$|E
