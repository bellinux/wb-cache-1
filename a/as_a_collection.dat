5|$|The Corpus {{forms the}} basis of Latin {{jurisprudence}} (including ecclesiastical Canon Law) and, for historians, provides a valuable insight into the concerns and activities of the later Roman Empire. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> it gathers together the many sources in which the leges (laws) and the other rules were expressed or published: proper laws, senatorial consults (senatusconsulta), imperial decrees, case law, and jurists' opinions and interpretations (responsa prudentum).|$|E
5|$|The museum's {{permanent}} display encompasses mineralogical and petrographical collections, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of animals, {{the bulk}} of which {{dates back to the}} 19th century. The zoological collection is {{on the second floor of}} the museum. It includes the skeleton of a Mediterranean monk seal, a basking shark native to the Adriatic Sea and an Atlantic puffin, a bird today native to the Arctic area, which is believed to have nested in the Adriatic in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{no records}} survive of the Norman {{market in the}} 11th to 13thcenturies. It is known that shortly after the market's establishment, a tollhouse was built nearby, which served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> point for taxes on trade. Although the precise {{location}} of the tollhouse is not recorded, it was immediately north of the market on part of the site now occupied by the Guildhall. At some point soon after its construction, the tollhouse also became the centre for the civil administration of the city. Although the Tombland market retained its charter to host an annual horse fair, over time the market at Mancroft supplanted that at Tombland as the principal market of the area. At {{the end of the}} 11thcentury, the Tombland market was removed during construction work on Norwich Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|In 1939 The Map of Love {{appeared}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of 16 {{poems and}} {{seven of the}} 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 {{and moved to the}} home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.|$|E
5|$|Skagen Town and Regional Museum (Skagen By- og Egnsmuseum), {{an open-air}} museum, was opened {{by the local}} {{population}} in 1927. In 1938 it {{was moved to the}} sand dunes of Vesterby. The museum brings together examples of fishermen's cottages and the homes of less fortunate inhabitants of Skagen {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. There is an old life-saving station, a smithy, an old Dutch windmill, pictures of ships in distress and related nautical artefacts as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of items illustrating the town's history over various periods.|$|E
5|$|The Studebaker National Museum holds a large {{collection}} of wagons and automobiles from the 150-year {{history of the}} Studebaker Corporation. The museum began <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of wagons and automobiles produced by Studebaker, including the presidential carriages of Lincoln, McKinley, Harrison, and Grant. The company donated the collection {{to the city of}} South Bend in 1966. The collection was housed in various locations from Century Center to its current location in downtown South Bend, adjacent to The History Museum. The two museums share one campus, and together form The Museums at Washington and Chapin. The former South Bend mansion of Clement Studebaker, named Tippecanoe Place, is now a restaurant.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} in the 1970s and 1980s by Viggo Kann, Kimmo Eriksson and Olle Johansson, three children who had played the game Adventure and wanted to create a similar game in Swedish. The Cottage began <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of smaller games the three had previously developed on their own, with the player moving through an amusement arcade to choose what to play; as they found it more fun to move through the arcade than to play the games, they ended up expanding the area to explore and removing most of the smaller games. Several thousand copies of the IBM PC release were sold; despite this, the developers did not receive much money from it outside of pre-paid royalties. The game had a cult-like status among Oden users at the time, and was commercially important to the computer center in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several anthologies {{collecting}} Hugo-winning short fiction. The series The Hugo Winners, edited by Isaac Asimov, was started in 1962 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of short story winners up to the previous year, and concluded with the 1982 Hugos in Volume 5. The New Hugo Winners, edited originally by Asimov, later by Connie Willis and finally by Gregory Benford, has four volumes collecting stories from the 1983 to the 1994 Hugos. The most recent anthology is The Hugo Award Showcase (2010), edited by Mary Robinette Kowal, which contains most of the short stories, novelettes, and novellas that were nominated for the 2009 award.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several anthologies {{collecting}} Nebula-winning short fiction. The series Nebula Winners, published yearly by SFWA and edited {{by a variety of}} SFWA members and renamed as the Nebula Awards Showcase series since 1999, was started in 1966 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of short story winners and nominees for that year. The sales of these anthologies were intended to pay for presenting the awards themselves. The anthology The Best of the Nebulas (1989), edited by Ben Bova, collected winners of Nebula awards from 1966 through 1986 officially selected by SFWA members. The unofficial anthology Nebula Award Winning Novellas (1994), edited by Martin H. Greenberg, contained ten stories which had won the novella award between 1970 and 1989.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of potential collections {{has been the}} object of different philosophical debates. I discuss three of those debates. I argue that the collection of all natural numbers need not be understood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potentially infinite <b>collection.</b> I argue that the collection of all sets need not be understood <b>as</b> <b>an</b> indefinitely extensible <b>collection.</b> Finally, I argue that the collection of everything needs to be understood <b>as</b> <b>an</b> unlimited <b>collection...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} can be defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin also {{collaborated with}} Bartholomew Iscanus on a Liber penitentialis, which is jointly {{ascribed}} {{to both of}} them in a Lambeth Palace manuscript, MS 235. Another work often attributed to Baldwin, the Ad laudem Bartholomaei Exoniensis episcopi de coloribus rhetoricis, survives in three manuscripts and a fragment of a fourth. A number of other works are known to have been authored by Baldwin, but do not survive. These include Carmen devotionis, which was seen by John Bale at Glastonbury Abbey in the 16th century. Other lost works were a commentary on the biblical books of Samuel and Kings, De sectis haereticis which existed at Christ Church Priory in the 13th century, and De orthodoxis fidei dogmatibus, which was seen by John Leland at Christ Church in the 16th century. Some of Baldwin's letters existed in manuscript form, although they appear never to have circulated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection,</b> but they are no longer extant. One of his letters is mentioned in a Rievaulx Abbey catalogue, and Leland mentions others in his works.|$|E
5|$|Following peak intensity, the {{combination}} of increasing wind shear and lowering sea surface temperatures began to slowly weaken Iselle, bringing it below Category4intensity early on August5. Continued wind shear caused the storm to further degrade and its eye to become ragged in appearance. The NHC downgraded Iselle below major hurricane intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 00:00UTC on August6, forecasting responsibility transferred from the NHC to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center(CPHC). Although wind shear began to decrease thereafter, abundant dry air caused Iselle to rapidly weaken, dropping to Category1 intensity on August6. However, the suppressed wind shear allowed for the hurricane to reorganize and maintain a large eye as it tracked towards Hawaii, and Iselle reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 100mph (155km/h) at 00:00UTC on August7, making it a minimal Category2 hurricane. Only slow degradation of Iselle's structure followed, though on August7, the storm's eye had faded and the CPHC estimated that Iselle had weakened to a minimal hurricane. Becoming increasingly disorganized, Iselle weakened to a tropical storm the next day before making landfall at 12:30UTC along the Kau coast of Hawaii island with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The mountainous terrain of the island largely disrupted the main cyclonic circulation of Iselle, which manifested <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of small vortices south of the Hawaiian islands. Due {{to the loss of}} any sustained thunderstorm activity at the storm's center, the CPHC decided to downgrade Iselle to a remnant area of low pressure on August9; at the time, the disturbance was centered roughly 200mi (320km) west-southwest of Honolulu.|$|E

Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who would grow up to be Gepetto.

5|$|On {{the central}} precinct sits The Hawthorns, a student house {{accommodating}} 115 undergraduate students. The house started life <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of villas built somewhere between 1888 and 1924 that were later converted, bit by bit, {{into a hotel}} by John Dingle. The Hawthorns also houses conferencing facilities, the staff refectory and bar, the Accommodation Office and the Student Houses Office. Several of the residences in the central precinct are more recent and have been built and are managed by third-party organisations under exclusivity arrangements with the University. These include New Bridewell House, opened in 2016, which includes en-suite bedrooms and studios {{and is in the}} former police HQ and operated by Fresh Student Housing, Unite House and Chantry Court, opened in 2000 and 2003 respectively by the UNITE Group, as well as Dean's Court (2001, postgraduates only) and Woodland Court (2005), both run by the Dominion Housing Group.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster was {{released}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> for the PlayStation 3 and as separate releases of each {{game for the}} PlayStation Vita. Alongside the standard PlayStation Vita releases in Japan, there was a Twin Pack that bundled both games and a Resolution Box collection which additionally contained the handheld console. A dual release was decided against for the Vita versions due to the limited storage capacity of the cartridges. Play Arts Kai figurines of Tidus and Yuna were produced and the original soundtracks were re-released. Two new Ultimania guide books were published for each game. Nojima wrote the tie-in novel Final Fantasy X-2.5: Eien no Daishō that bridges the gap between Last Mission and Final Fantasy X: Will. A Collector's Edition of the PlayStation 3 version was exclusively released in North America via Square Enix's online store. It contained both games, an artwork book, a Blu-ray disc for the rearranged soundtrack and five artwork lithographs. A special launch event was held at Gallery Nucleus in Alhambra, California during March 2014. It included a signing event with Kitase and Naora, and an artwork auction with all profits going {{to the victims of}} Typhoon Haiyan. The PlayStation 4 port of the remaster, officially announced at a PlayStation conference in China on December 11, 2014, was originally leaked in Square Enix France's online store earlier that same day. The PS4 release supports save transfers from the PS3 and Vita versions, remote play on the Vita, switching between the original and remastered soundtracks and further enhanced graphics now in full HD (1080p) with non-player NPCs and monsters receiving further treatment. It {{was released}} worldwide on PS4 in May 2015. It was later released on Microsoft Windows via Steam in May 2016 with an auto-save feature, 5 game boosters, 3 parameter changes, 4K resolution support, graphic and audio settings and the option to skip FMVs.|$|E
