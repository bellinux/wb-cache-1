For example, because the information is not currently readily available, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed the 49 agencies that were required to submit inventories to defer the collection of three statutorily required data elements for each contract [...] the role the services played in achieving agency objectives, the total dollar <b>amount</b> <b>invoiced</b> for services under the contracts, and the number and work locations of contractor and subcontractor personnel. Progress, however, is being made to collect this information for future inventories. OMB directed agencies to start collecting information on the role services play in achieving agency objectives for new contracts awarded on or after March 1, 2012. A proposed Federal Acquisition Regulation rule was published in April 2011 to start collecting the remaining two data elements directly from contractors. We also found several instances where agencies significantly underreported obligations in their inventories, either because they misinterpreted or did not follow OMB guidance. For example, the General Services Administration underreported obligations by approximately $ 6. 4 billion. Without complete and accurate service contract inventories, OMB and Congress cannot meaningfully compare service contract obligations among agencies, or develop spending trends for agencies, thus limiting the overall utility of the inventories. ...|$|E
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 4, 000 instances annually where state property located along Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) maintained right-of-way {{needs to be}} replaced or repaired due to motor vehicle crashes.

INDOT incurs significant financial losses from state property damage that is not reimbursed directly by the responsible driver or when invoice costs {{do not reflect the}} fully-loaded cost of the repair. This study 2 ̆ 7 s objective is to identify enhanced management procedures to decrease the financial burden of the state by identifying practices supporting the following four goals: increasing the <b>amount</b> <b>invoiced</b> and the percent collected, associating more crash reports to damage, decreasing the entire process time, and invoicing fully-loaded repair costs. To implement the best practices found in other agencies, this study administered two sets of surveys to state highway agencies in the United States. After comparing INDOT 2 ̆ 7 s process with those of peer states, this study recommends that the recovery process should begin with assignment, by law enforcement, of a tag to each damage instance. On the bases of assigned tags, maintenance crews proceed with the processing of crash damage documentation forms. An overhead and administration fee should be recorded in the repair costs to recover labor used to process the repair documents. This study also recommends that the repair invoice should be preceded with a notification letter to the driver and/or insurance company. The study also establishes appropriate performance measures {{that could be used to}} evaluate the effectiveness of the process. Past invoicing challenges show that these components are expected to increase the frequency of reimbursement of repair costs. ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{sale of the}} {{receivable}} transfers {{ownership of}} the receivable to the factor, indicating the factor obtains all of the rights associated with the receivables. Accordingly, the receivable becomes the factor's asset, and the factor obtains the right to receive the payments made by the debtor for the <b>invoice</b> <b>amount,</b> and is free to pledge or exchange the receivable asset without unreasonable constraints or restrictions. Usually, the account debtor is notified of {{the sale of the}} receivable, and the factor bills the debtor and makes all collections; however, non-notification factoring, where the client (seller) collects the accounts sold to the factor, as agent of the factor, also occurs. The arrangement is usually confidential in that the debtor is not notified of the assignment of the receivable and the seller of the receivable collects the debt on behalf of the factor. [...] If the factoring transfers the receivable [...] "without recourse", the factor (purchaser of the receivable) must bear the loss if the account debtor does not pay the <b>invoice</b> <b>amount.</b> If the factoring transfers the receivable [...] "with recourse", the factor has the right to collect the unpaid <b>invoice</b> <b>amount</b> from the transferor (seller). However, any merchandise returns that may diminish the <b>invoice</b> <b>amount</b> that is collectible from the accounts receivable are typically the responsibility of the seller, and the factor will typically hold back paying the seller for a portion of the receivable being sold (the [...] "factor's holdback receivable") in order to cover the merchandise returns associated with the factored receivables until the privilege to return the merchandise expires.|$|R
