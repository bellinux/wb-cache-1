This uniform is nearly identical to the road uniform that the Blackhawks currently wear.

25|$|The exact {{origins of}} the term are unknown, but it is {{believed}} to have reflected an early 20th-century perception that Chinese immigrants did the menial labor they were consigned to with a bare minimum of adequacy, and were content with minimal reward for it. It has been suggested that it originated with <b>a</b> <b>Tad</b> Dorgan cartoon, but that has not been proven. In the 1950s, an extended take on the term in the New York Daily News led to a petition in the Chinese-American community calling on sportswriters to stop using it. This perception of ethnic insensitivity has further contributed to its disuse today.|$|E
25|$|India {{showed more}} {{determination}} {{than they had}} done in 5 days of test cricket before this one – 3 of them in an abject 10 wicket humiliation in Mumbai. First the tail wagged (if not in Australian proportions); the last two wickets added 58 runs {{in the company of}} VVS Laxman who batting at No.6 stroked a fluent and graceful 59. Raju scored an important 30 runs, and even Venkatesh Prasad hung around for a while as India chipped away at some of the deficit. Laxman was the last man out, <b>a</b> <b>tad</b> unfairly perhaps – replays showed the ball popped up off his arm – as India were bowled out for 171, 274 in arrears. As expected, Steve Waugh asked India to follow-on.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the album was deemed {{contingent}} upon balance.

500|$|Criticism to {{the episode}} {{was done by}} Finley who said, [...] "So much of this show is {{dependent}} on Monk's subtle mannerisms, but he exaggerates them to an absurd degree {{as he tries to}} impress the actor who's playing him." [...] Similarly, Werts said [...] "Shalhoub pushes <b>a</b> <b>tad</b> too far with the compulsions." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today was also critical of its [...] "excessive quirks and overall credibility-busting silliness." [...] Although praised Shalhoub–Tucci dynamic, Rich Heldenfels of Akron Beacon Journal criticized it as [...] "the actor-imitating-life thing has been done before on TV and in the movies, and the gag well is pretty dry." ...|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{was well}} received. Electronic Gaming Monthly said the game sounds as [...] "beautiful" [...] as it looks.

[...] Xenogears was the first Square game to feature voice overs and anime cut scenes. Electronic Gaming Monthly said they are [...] "some of the slickest animation cinemas" [...] they have seen. Game Revolution praised the [...] "absolutely spectacular and stunning" [...] hand-drawn anime cut-scenes, but stated that they were sparse and poorly synched with the voice acting.|$|E
500|$|According to Jurek, {{the song}} is [...] "maybe <b>a</b> <b>tad</b> longer" [...] than it should be, {{although}} he specified {{that it was a}} [...] "small complaint". Lana Cooper of PopMatters questioned the strength of the song, and Billboards KT agreed, calling the song the most [...] "unexpected cut" [...] on the album and that [...] "one could picture the pair singing it at a writer's night somewhere". Cooper wrote that in Timberlake's [...] "unexpected surprise cameo" [...] he [...] "fades into a secondary role", as opposed to the other artists on [...] that [...] "make a strong showing" [...] next to McEntire. She wrote that Timberlake [...] "sounds pretty enough" [...] and that he does [...] "contribute a certain mood" [...] to the song, however, commented that [...] "anyone expecting more of a collaborative effort out of him would be sorely disappointed".|$|E

Support for the party was strongest among Cuban intellectuals and artists, and counted among its members and sympathizers such notable Cubans as the novelist Alejo Carpentier, the poet Juan Marinello, {{who served as the}} party's chair, the painter Wilfredo Lam, the national poet Nicolás Guillén, the writers Félix Pita Rodríguez, Mirta Aguirre, and Pablo de la Torriente Brau, and the economists Jacinto Torres and Raúl Cepero Bonilla. <b>As</b> <b>Tad</b> Szulc wrote in his biography of Fidel Castro about the Cuban communists, [...] "In truth, there were few creative personalities in Cuba since 1930 who were not on the left, or the extreme left" [...] (Fidel: A Critical Portrait, 1986, p. 131).|$|R
500|$|Due to {{repeated}} comparisons with Gothenburg melodic death metal bands, Shadows Fall {{decided to change}} its style to find its own sound. Inspired by more thrash, hard rock and power ballad influences, the band recorded its third studio album, titled The Art of Balance. Released on September 17, 2002, the album peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Top Independent albums chart. Shadows Fall released three music videos to promote the album; [...] "Thoughts Without Words", [...] "Destroyer of Senses", and [...] "The Idiot Box". The Art of Balance featured a cover of the Pink Floyd song [...] "Welcome to the Machine." [...] Andy Hinds of Allmusic stated the album is [...] "a modern heavy metal album that is both brutal and highly musical, traditional yet forward-thinking", but criticized the placement of [...] "Welcome to the Machine", stating the song [...] "is stylishly well-executed, but seems <b>a</b> <b>tad</b> out of place nonetheless." [...] Shadows Fall supported The Art of Balance by touring on Ozzfest in 2003.|$|E
500|$|The episode has {{received}} critical acclaim. Dan Martin of The Guardian {{said that it}} contained [...] "the series' most tearjerking suckerpunch so far" [...] and the [...] "psychedelic premise [...] the characters the chance to shine". He praised Karen Gillan's difference in performance as the old Amy and her improvement in performance since the previous series. Martin later called it a [...] "damn near perfect episode", rating it the best episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in}} the list. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode four out of five stars, praising MacRae's ability to overcome budget issues and deliver [...] "quite a powerful and moving drama, with an ending that although inevitable still delivered a well of sadness". He thought the older Amy's [...] "technical wizardry seemed <b>a</b> <b>tad</b> unlikely" [...] (she manages to scrounge up a sonic screwdriver while waiting for the Doctor) but [...] "the power of Gillan's performance skated over any minor quibbles".|$|E
500|$|Josh Harrison of Ology {{deemed the}} episode a [...] "good sign" [...] {{that the second}} season will be [...] "just as good, if not better" [...] than the first season. He said, [...] "The way it all works {{together}} in this episode ... is subtle and surprising but nevertheless convincing evidence that there's method to the madness. Ugly Americans knows when to play this card; at all other junctures, it's got the right instinct when it shows us yet more madness." [...] Harrison praised the battle scene between the wizards and the demons, calling it [...] "one of the best single sequences in the series so far". In contrast, The Standard-Times critic Kevin McDonough was more critical regarding the episode, noting that it [...] "tries <b>a</b> <b>tad</b> too hard". McDonough commented: [...] "The efforts to meld 1980s summer-camp fantasy comedies with the Harry Potter movies are more odd than amusing. Then again, that pretty much sums up Ugly Americans itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers were {{generally}} {{satisfied with the}} conclusion, and some like Bill Keveney of the USA Today felt the episode does not stray far from [...] "the series formula – a mix of sci-fi adventure, relationships and humor". Jason Van Horn of IGN enjoyed the humor, [...] "the amount of heart and pure emotion running rampant this episode", which he thought served as a symbol for the entire show that will stay {{in the public mind}} through re-runs and DVDs. Two scenes that stood out for him as [...] "powerful", [...] "heart-wrenching" [...] and [...] "the icing on the cake", were Mitchell's breakdown and Vala's seduction of Daniel signaling [...] "the beginning of a very long lasting and loving relationship". Vala's emotional response to Daniel was interpreted as an example of her character growth, while another reviewer felt the [...] "Vala/Daniel argument [...] <b>a</b> <b>tad</b> overwrought [...] the motivation is clear". The emotional death of Landry appealed to several reviewers, as did the resolution via Teal'c's heroic sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{was more}} {{critical}} with the episode, stating, [...] "having {{set up an}} interesting cliffhanger last week, it was <b>a</b> <b>tad</b> annoying that Steven Moffat did his trick again of taking a swerve with the pre-credits section of this week's episode, and more supposed shock value with the shootings of Amy and Rory," [...] but also more annoyed [...] "that what exactly was going on here, {{and how it was}} influenced by the events of the previous episode, were never exactly explained, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks." [...] Fuller believed that the plot and ending [...] "only raised more questions than answers," [...] believing that the overarching storyline would [...] "require the audience's concentration over many weeks; any casual viewer tuning in this week, and I suspect not a few fans, will have been left baffled by the goings-on," [...] but still felt the episode [...] "was interesting and showed just how, when the writers use their imagination, Doctor Who can tell stories in a way little else on television can." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{unfavourable}} {{assessment of}} the song, Ian Inglis contrasts it with the [...] "impressive set of lyrics" [...] on [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] and criticises Harrison for his [...] "turgid proselytizing", which he likens to [...] "the imprecations of an evangelical preacher". Inglis concludes: [...] "Harrison's impressive guitar work helps {{to compensate for the}} absence of a clear melody, but the song is ultimately undermined by some of his least-effective lyrics; the description of political leaders as 'big girls' is puerile and sexist." [...] Another Harrison biographer, Elliot Huntley, describes [...] "The Lord Loves the One" [...] as a [...] "polished foot-tapper", on which [...] "the drums push the song along nicely but the excessively wordy libretto somehow struggles to fit". Terry Staunton of Record Collector considers Living in the Material World to be [...] "sloganeering with slide guitars" [...] but lacking in any [...] "out-and-out protest" [...] message, such that [...] "the more generalised, universally religious themes of The Lord Loves The One (That Loves The Lord) tend to sound <b>a</b> <b>tad</b> diluted." ...|$|E
