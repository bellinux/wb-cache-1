5|$|In 1204 the Byzantine {{capital of}} Constantinople was sacked and {{occupied}} by the Fourth Crusaders, an important moment of the Christian East–West Schism. The Byzantine Empire, already weakened by misrule, was left divided and in chaos. Taking advantage of the situation, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum began seizing territory in Western Asia Minor, until the Nicaean Empire was able to repulse the Seljuk Turks from the remaining territories still under Roman rule. Eventually Constantinople was re-taken from the Latin Empire in 1261 by the Nicaean Empire. However {{the position of the}} Byzantine Empire in the European continent remained uncertain due to the presence of the rival kingdoms of the Despotate of Epirus, Serbia and the Second Bulgarian Empire. This, combined with the reduced power of the Sultanate of Rum (Byzantium's chief rival in Asia) led to the removal of troops from Asia Minor to maintain Byzantium's grip on Thrace. However the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum was by no means <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> the Empire as nobles known as ghazis began setting up their fiefdoms, {{at the expense of the}} Byzantine Empire. While many Turkish beys participated in the conquest of Byzantine and Seljuk territory, the territories under the control of one such Bey named Osman I posed the greatest threat to Nicaea and to Constantinople.|$|E

25|$|My dear Miss Hamilton, What can I have to say? Not much indeed! But to {{wish you}} a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the {{pleasure}} to sit and read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> keep good company! Very likely I {{should not have been}} acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Italian cinema began {{a few months}} after the Lumière {{brothers}} began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing Pope Leo XIII giving <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> the camera. The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Società Italiana Cines, the Ambrosio Film and the Itala Film. Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples. In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy. Cinema was later used by Benito Mussolini, who founded Rome's renowned Cinecittà studio for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox Christians {{who have}} {{committed}} sins but repent of them, and who wish to reconcile themselves to God and renew the purity of their original baptisms, confess their sins to God before a spiritual guide who offers advice and direction to assist the individual in overcoming their sin. Parish priests commonly function as spiritual guides, but such guides can be any person, male or female, who has been given <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> hear confessions. Spiritual guides are chosen very carefully as this is a mandate that once chosen must be obeyed. Having confessed, the penitent then {{has his or her}} parish priest read the prayer of repentance over them.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequent}} midwinter thaws in Great Plains Chinook {{country are}} more of a bane than <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> gardeners. Plants can be visibly brought out of dormancy by persistent Chinook winds, or have their hardiness reduced even if {{they appear to be}} remaining dormant. In either case, they become vulnerable to later cold waves. Many plants which do well at Winnipeg (where constant cold maintains dormancy all winter) are difficult to grow in the Alberta Chinook belt; examples include basswood, some apple, raspberry and Saskatoon varieties, and Amur maples. Trees in the Chinook-affected areas of Alberta are known to be small, with much less growth than trees in areas not affected by Chinooks. This is once again caused by the ‘off-and-on’ dormancy throughout winter.|$|E

25|$|Malise is {{believed}} to have died in 1271, while in France. His body was brought back to Scotland, and he was buried at Dunblane Cathedral, the religious centre of Strathearn. In 1817, during reconstruction of Dunblane Cathedral, two sarcophagi were discovered with life-size effigies of a warrior and his lady. Since the fourteenth-century chronicler John of Fordun had recorded Dunblane as the burial site of Malise, these were determined to be the tombs of Malise and his countess, though which one is uncertain. It was marked with the date 1271. In addition, Sir Robert Sibbald once mentioned that in the late 17th century, there was a picture in the church which represented the Countess of Strathearn and her children kneeling for <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> St. Blane, though its whereabouts today are unknown.|$|E
25|$|The Mashantucket Pequot {{had lived}} in Southeastern Connecticut for over 10,000 years. When the colonists {{occupied}} Windsor, Connecticut, they came into contact and later conflict with the Pequot who inhabited the area. The Pequot had recently conquered the area from another tribe. In 1637, the Pequot killed two British slave raiders who had been capturing Native Americans for the slave trade. The colonists demanded that the Indians who killed the slavers be turned over for punishment. The Pequot refused. Other skirmishes and confrontations ensued, including an attack on settlers working in fields near Wethersfield. This was retribution for the confiscation of land belonging to sachem Sowheag. The English, unlike the French, considered land more important than fur trade, and they enslaved or killed {{most of those who}} survived the periodic epidemics, like the smallpox epidemic among the Pequot during 1630–32. The newcomers wanted the land for themselves, and they believed God afflicted the Pequot with smallpox as <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> the settlers.|$|E
500|$|Although media {{reported}} on the bombardment of Osijek, journalists in the city itself {{felt that it was}} receiving an unduly low level of media coverage compared to wartime events elsewhere in Croatia.

500|$|In 1805, the King {{began making}} plans for Charlotte's education, and engaged a large staff of {{instructors}} for his only legitimate grandchild, with the Bishop of Exeter to instruct {{her in the}} faith that King George believed one day Charlotte, as queen, would defend. [...] The King hoped that these teachers would [...] "render her an honour and comfort to her relations, and <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> the dominions over which she may hereafter preside".

500|$|When {{developing}} the game's graphics, the team decided to include landmarks from Springfield. The player {{is able to}} enter some of them, including the Kwik-E-Mart, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Elementary School, and The Android's Dungeon and Baseball Card Shop. During Hit & Runs development, 20th Century Fox, Gracie Films and Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, played important roles in bringing The Simpsons universe into a 3D environment. All character voices were supplied by the actual cast, and the series' writers wrote the entire story for the game, including dialogue. Tim Ramage, the associate producer of the game's publisher, Vivendi Universal Games, considered it <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> have the opportunity of working with The Simpsons cast, along with the writers, whom Ramage called [...] "the best there is [...] ".|$|E
500|$|A Cajun mutant thief who has {{the ability}} to convert the {{potential}} energy of any object he touches into kinetic energy, forcing it to explode. The size of the object determines the magnitude of the resulting explosion. He is also skilled in the use of a staff, and happens to be very agile. Due to the nature of his power, he displays supernatural durability, being able to take Wolverine's elbow to his face and return to fight moments later. When asked about his thoughts on the character, Kitsch had said, [...] "I knew of him, but I didn't know the following he had. I'm sure I'm still going to be exposed to that. I love the character, I love the powers, and I love what they did with him. I didn't know that much, but in my experience, it was <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> go in and create my take on him.

[...] It's just <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> <b>to</b> even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist.
