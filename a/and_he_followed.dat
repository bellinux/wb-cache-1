5|$|At the Hungarian race, Hill {{did take}} his first career win after leading {{from start to}} finish. In doing so {{he became the first}} son of a Formula One Grand Prix winner to take victory himself, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> it with two more wins, first at Spa where he took the lead after pitstop problem for Prost, and then at the Italian Grand Prix where Prost's engine failed towards the end. This third {{consecutive}} win clinched the constructors' championship for Williams and moved him temporarily to second in the drivers' standings.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist was in fine form {{ahead of}} the 1999 Cricket World Cup with a {{productive}} individual performance in the Carlton & United Series in January and February 1999 against Sri Lanka and England. He finished with 525 runs at a batting average of 43.75 with two centuries—both against Sri Lanka—and a fifty, {{and a total of}} 27 dismissals in 12 matches. His 131 helped Australia set a successful run-chase at the SCG, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> this with 154 at the MCG.|$|E
5|$|Hu Zhengyan was a noted seal-carver, {{producing}} personal seals {{for numerous}} dignitaries. His style {{was rooted in}} the classical seal script of the Han dynasty, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> the Huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary He Zhen. Hu's calligraphy, although balanced and with a clear compositional structure, is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed. Huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient, weathered impression, although unlike other Huizhou artists Hu {{did not make a}} regular practice of artificially aging his seals.|$|E

5|$|Meckiff {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Victoria in 1956–57 against Western Australia. Coming in to bat with his state's score at 8 wickets for 77 (8/77), he made 19 {{not out to}} help them reach 131, before taking three wickets for 45 runs (3/45) to restrict Western Australia to a 34-run first innings lead. His first wicket was future Australian captain Bob Simpson for a duck, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> up by removing Test batsmen Barry Shepherd and Ken Meuleman. Meckiff made 11 in the second innings and took 0/40 as Victoria lost by four wickets.|$|E
5|$|Midnight Sun {{was trained}} by Fred Walker. He {{became the first}} Tennessee Walking Horse to win the World Grand Championship title {{when it was first}} awarded in 1945, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> up that win with another World Grand Championship the next year, in 1946, making him the second repeat winner after Haynes Peacock, his half-brother. At the time, the stake carried a purse of $1,000.|$|E
5|$|Strong showings for Victoria earned Meckiff {{selection}} in Neil Harvey's XI for the one-off match against Ray Lindwall's XI {{at the start}} of January 1957. These annual fixtures were used as trials for the leading players vying for national selection. Lindwall's men batted first and made 428; Meckiff was the most successful bowler, taking 6/75 while his fellow-bowlers struggled to make inroads into the opposition batsmen. His first wicket was Test batsman Ken Mackay for 99, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> this by removing Bob Simpson, Norm O'Neill and Graeme Hole in the middle-order. Meckiff followed his productive bowling with 47 runs in a tail-wagging performance, adding 71 for the eighth wicket with Wally Grout as Harvey's men responded with 419. The Victorian took 0/18 in the second innings as Lindwall's team fell for 188 to leave Harvey's XI with a victory target of 198, which was achieved with seven wickets in hand.|$|E

5|$|When Henry V died in 1422, Northumberland was {{appointed}} {{member of the}} council appointed to govern during the minority of Henry VI. He might {{have been involved in}} an embassy to the Council of Siena in 1423, but still his main area of responsibility lay in the border region. In the council, he seems to have belonged to the circle around Bishop Henry Beaufort, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> Beaufortnow cardinalto peace negotiations at Berwick in 1429. As Warden of the East March, he was constantly occupied with peace negotiations and defence of northern England, but his efforts were constantly frustrated, and in 1434 he resigned his commission. The next year, Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, equally exasperated by the lack of royal support, gave up his commission as Warden of the West March. Northumberland {{was appointed}} joint warden with the earl of Huntingdon of both marches for one year, during which time, although suffering defeat by the Earl of Angus at the Battle of Piperdean, he was able to repel a siege on Roxburgh by James I of Scotland. In 1440 he was once more appointed Warden of the West March, and this time held the position until his death.|$|E
5|$|When he was {{approximately}} 15, Stiller obtained {{a small part}} with one line on the television soap opera Guiding Light, although in an interview he characterized his performance as poor. He was later cast in {{a role in the}} 1986 Broadway revival of John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves, alongside John Mahoney; the production would garner four Tony Awards. During its run, Stiller produced a satirical mockumentary whose principal was fellow actor Mahoney. His comedic work was well received by the cast and crew of the play, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> up with a 10-minute short called The Hustler of Money, a parody of the Martin Scorsese film The Color of Money. The film featured him in a send-up of Tom Cruise's character and Mahoney in the Paul Newman role, only this time as a bowling hustler instead of a pool shark. The short got the attention of Saturday Night Live, which aired it in 1987, and two years later offered him a spot as a writer. In the meantime, he also had a bit part in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun.|$|E
25|$|In {{his second}} match, opening the bowling for Somerset, Bill Greswell took seven Hampshire wickets for just 42 {{runs in the}} second innings of the match at Southampton. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> that up two matches later with seven for 67 against Yorkshire at Taunton.|$|E

25|$|On {{the final}} day, O'Neill and Burge took the score to 113 before Burge was out for 49. O'Neill (65) and Benaud quickly followed, before Mackay and Grout steadied the ship. Mackay {{had been dropped}} first ball, which proved to be crucial. Grout was {{dismissed}} by Worrell for 42 after the pair had added 59, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> up by quickly taking the wickets of Misson and Hoare.|$|E
25|$|Ferdinand I {{had three}} sons who survived to adulthood, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>followed</b> the {{potentially}} disastrous Habsburg tradition of dividing up his lands between {{them on his}} death in 1564. This considerably weakened Austria, particularly {{in the face of}} the Ottoman expansion. It was not until the reign of Ferdinand III (Archduke 1590–1637) that they were reunited again in 1620—albeit briefly until 1623. It was not to be until 1665, under Leopold I that the Austrian lands were definitively united.|$|E

25|$|Dr Kligler {{had arrived}} in Palestine in 1921.

Control of malaria was a vital goal, as a failure meant that much of Palestine would have remained uninhabitable, and Zionism would have remained unfulfilled. He was not a workaholic in the conventional sense – he was driven to these activities by a wish to genuinely improve the community, and would undertake any step which he felt would fulfill those ends.|$|E
