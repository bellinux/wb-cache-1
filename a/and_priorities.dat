5|$|The {{eruption}} {{was used}} as an example for psychiatric recuperation after natural disasters by Robert Desjarlais and Leon Eisenberg in their work World Mental Health: Problems <b>and</b> <b>Priorities</b> in Low-Income Countries. The authors were concerned that only initial treatment for the survivors' psychological trauma was conducted. One study showed that the victims of the eruption suffered from anxiety and depression, which can lead to alcohol abuse, marital problems and other social issues.|$|E
5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that {{they were interested in}} seeing in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities in order to reach a consensus. Each company also had their own set of interests <b>and</b> <b>priorities.</b> Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to bring more diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E

5|$|While the long-toed {{salamander}} {{is classified as}} least concern by the IUCN, many forms of land development negatively affect the salamander's habitat and have put new perspectives <b>and</b> <b>priorities</b> into its conservation biology. Conservation priorities focus at the population level of diversity, which is declining at rates ten times that of species extinction. Population level diversity is what provides ecosystem services, such as the keystone role that salamanders play in the soil ecosystems, including the nutrient cycling that supports wetland and forested ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson also {{advanced}} {{economic development}} in the state. During his tenure, Delta Air Lines nearly doubled {{the number of people}} it employed at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport; Wilkinson secured Delta's expansion by agreeing to limit the company's sales tax liability on jet fuel to $4 million annually. Additionally, Scott Paper Company opened a plant near Owensboro and North American Stainless, a Spanish-owned steel company, located a plant near Carrollton. During his term in office, Wilkinson served on the Education Commission of the States, the Southern Growth Policies Board, and the Council of the State Governments and the Southern States Energy Board. He was elected chair of the Southern Governors Association in 1990 and served on the Education Commission of the States' Policy <b>and</b> <b>Priorities</b> Committee.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 2015, Clinton {{formally}} {{announced her}} candidacy {{for the presidency}} in the 2016 election. She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary <b>and</b> <b>Priorities</b> USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure. The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act. Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.|$|E

5|$|The {{leader and}} cabinet model of decision-making, {{adopted by the}} city council under the Local Government Act 2000, is similar to {{national}} government. The council appoints the Leader (usually {{a member of the}} group with the political majority) and he or she appoints up to nine other councillors to serve on the cabinet. The cabinet members, one of whom is appointed Deputy Leader, assume responsibility for different key areas of local governance. The full council meets around ten times a year. There are decisions that only full council can make, these include setting budgets and spending programmes, setting council tax levels and approving major policies <b>and</b> <b>priorities.</b> In addition to the Leader of the Council, the council also appoints the Mayor of Peterborough, the Deputy Mayor, committee chairmen and the chief executive.

Respondents were asked to provide their outlook on commodity prices, methodologies for estimating prices, preference for different valuation techniques, <b>and</b> <b>priority</b> of various capital structuring decision factors. The analysis includes single and multi-variable regressions that demonstrate correlations between different survey categories. The analysis suggests that price outlook is on average higher than the public futures market, but the popularities of different price estimation methodologies have no correlation with outlook average price or probability density. Other cross-category findings of note were the positive correlation between use of hurdle rate analysis <b>and</b> <b>priority</b> of setting a target capital structure, the negative correlation between use of IRR/hurdle analysis <b>and</b> <b>priority</b> of comparable company debt levels, the negative correlation between use of NPV <b>and</b> <b>priority</b> of interest tax shields, and the significance of our bankruptcy cost multivariate regression model...|$|R

40|$|A new push-and-pull hybrid data {{broadcast}} {{scheme is}} proposed for providing wireless information services to {{three types of}} clients, general, pull <b>and</b> <b>priority</b> clients. Only pull <b>and</b> <b>priority</b> clients have the back channel for sending requests to the broadcast server. There is no scalability problem with the hybrid scheme because the amount of pull <b>and</b> <b>priority</b> clients is very small. Based on the requests collected from pull <b>and</b> <b>priority</b> clients, the server estimates the interest pattern changes of the whole client population. Then the broadcast schedule on the push channel for the next broadcast cycle is adjusted. Besides the push channel, {{a small amount of}} broadcast bandwidth is allocated to a pull channel. The data to be broadcast on the pull channel is decided by the server in real-time <b>and</b> <b>priority</b> is given to requests from priority clients. Simulations show that with a time-varying client interest pattern, the average data access time for all three types of clients can be minimized. Because of the priority in using the pull channel, priority clients can achieve the lowest access time and pull clients can achieve a lower access time than general clients. To further improve the performance, the hybrid scheme with local client cache is also investigated. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
