5|$|Burnell was a {{dominant}} figure {{during the first}} part of Edward's reign, and he controlled most aspects of royal administration. He was involved not only in domestic issues but also in foreign relations, a responsibility he retained for two decades after Edward's return to England in 1274.

In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome, although what he discovered is unknown and the main stupa remains empty.|$|E

5|$|In 1828, after {{recovering}} from wounds {{suffered in the}} Sandbar Fight, Bowie {{decided to move to}} Coahuila y Texas, at that time a state in the Mexican federation. The 1824 Constitution of Mexico banned religions other than Roman Catholicism and gave preference to Mexican citizens in receiving land. Bowie was baptized into the Roman Catholic faith in San Antonio on April 28, 1828, sponsored by the alcalde (chief <b>administrator)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, Juan Martín de Veramendi, and the wife of the administrator, Josefa Navarro.

In 1829, he became engaged to Cecilia Wells, who died in Alexandria, on September 29, two weeks before they were to be married.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} done to {{determine}} whether administrator salaries in 14 Ohio school districts were a reflection <b>of</b> <b>administrator</b> responsibilities or <b>of</b> length of service, and to find what factors accounted for salary differentials. Although previous research suggests factors for assigning value to administrative positions, traditional salary structures are generally continued, resulting in unequal salaries. The Position Description Questionnaire gathered data from 293 administrators in the following areas: accountability and impact of decision making; responsibilities for students, staff, and budget; percentage of decisions cleared with the superior; knowledge and experience; public involvement; and demography. The questionnaire was revised, tested on 54 <b>administrators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instigating district, and given to <b>the</b> <b>administrators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other 13 districts.

Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah. In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%. In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr. In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an <b>administrator</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Raj {{who also}} studied history, {{revisited}} Tod's classification and {{asserted that the}} Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role {{in the relationship between}} princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need to consider that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.|$|E
5|$|To his supporters, Quisling was {{regarded}} as a conscientious <b>administrator</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest order, knowledgeable and with an eye for detail. Balanced and gentle to a fault, they believed he cared deeply about his people and maintained high moral standards throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E
