40|$|AbstractConventional sparse {{representation}} based classification (SRC) {{represents a}} test sample with the coefficient solved by each training sample in all classes. As a special version and improvement to SRC, collaborative representation based classification (CRC) obtains representation with the contribution from all training samples and produces more promising results on facial image classification. In the solutions of representation coefficients, CRC considers original value of contributions from all samples. However, one prevalent practice in {{such kind of}} distance-based methods is to consider only absolute value of the distance rather than {{both positive and negative}} values. In this paper, we propose an novel method to improve collaborative representation based classification, which integrates an <b>absolute</b> distance <b>vector</b> into the residuals solved by collaborative representation. And we named it AbsCRC. The key step in AbsCRC method is to use factors a and b as weight to combine CRC residuals rescrc with <b>absolute</b> distance <b>vector</b> disabs and generate a new deviation r=a·rescrc−b·disabs, which is in turn used to perform classification. Because the two residuals have opposite effect in classification, the method uses a subtraction operation to perform fusion. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method for image classification with different instantiations. The experimental results indicated that it produced a more promising result of classification on both facial and non-facial images than original CRC method...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the advance}} of technology, the fully {{automatic}} recording of absolute magnetic field vector variation at observatories remains an elusive goal. Primary difficulties are the long term stability of sensor orientation and the stable operation of the sensor system. In standard practice, definitive data are produced through the combination of continuous operation of a variometer and the occasional absolute measurements that are used for calibration of the variometer data. A single, automatic instrument that can continuously acquire <b>absolute</b> <b>vector</b> measurements with 1 -second resolution is desired. We introduce a device that will fulfil these requirements. Data are acquired using Serson's method: the ambient magnetic field is modulated by superposed fields. This method has been applied, mostly in connection with Proton magnetometers, for many years. In general it requires that the applied fields have a strength {{on the order of}} the Earth's magnetic field. But the sampling rate is limited for most xisting systems. In contrast, our system only requires applied fields of about 5000 nT, and the switching rate of polarities is 5 Hz. This is possible because we use a fast self oscillating Cs-magnetometer. The self oscillating Cs-magnetometer is calibrated by a Cs-He cell during times without additional fields (tandem-magnetometer) ...|$|E
40|$|The Dirac particle, i. e. {{the dynamic}} system S_D, {{described}} by the free Dirac equation is investigated. Although the Dirac equation is written usually in the relativistically covariant form, the dynamic system S_D is not completely relativistic, because its description contains such absolute objects as γ -matrices γ ^k, forming a matrix vector. By means of the proper change of variables the γ -matrices are eliminated, but instead of them the constant timlike vector f^k appears. The vector f^k describes an absolute splitting of the space-time into space and time, which is characteristic for the nonrelativistic description. To investigate a degree of the violation of the S_D relativistic description, we consider the classical Dirac particle S_Dcl, obtained from S_D {{by means of the}} relativistic dynamic disquantization. The classical dynamic system S_Dcl appears to be composite, because it has ten degrees of freedom. Six translational degrees of freedom are described relativistically (without a reference to f^k), whereas four internal degrees of freedom are described nonrelativistically, because their description refers to f^k. Coupling the <b>absolute</b> <b>vector</b> f^k with the energy-momentum vector of S_Dcl, the classical Dirac particle S_Dcl is modified minimally. The vector f^k ceases to be absolute, and the modified classical Dirac particle S_mDcl becomes to be completely relativistic. The dynamic equations for S_mDcl are solved. Solutions for S_Dcl and S_mDcl are compared. Comment: 25 pages, 0 figures. Correction of misprint...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, a novel {{matching}} classification strategy {{inspired by}} the artificial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology has been proposed for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. Such a method can describe brightness and shape information of a spectrum by encoding the spectral curve into a DNA strand, providing a more comprehensive way for spectral similarity comparison. However, it suffers from two problems: data volume is amplified {{when all of the}} bands participate in the encoding procedure and full-band comparison degrades the importance of bands carrying key information. In this paper, a new multi-probe based artificial DNA encoding and matching (MADEM) method is proposed. In this method, spectral signatures are first transformed into DNA code words with a spectral feature encoding operation. After that, multiple probes for interesting classes are extracted to represent the specific fragments of DNA strands. During the course of spectral matching, the different probes are compared to obtain the similarity of different types of land covers. By computing the <b>absolute</b> <b>vector</b> distance (AVD) between different probes of an unclassified spectrum and the typical DNA code words from the database, the class property of each pixel is set as the minimum distance class. The main benefit of this strategy is that the risk of redundant bands can be deeply reduced and critical spectral discrepancies can be enlarged. Two hyperspectral image datasets were tested. Comparing with the other classification methods, the overall accuracy can be improved from 1. 22 % to 10. 09 % and 1. 19 % to 15. 87 %, respectively. Furthermore, the kappa coefficient can be improved from 2. 05 % to 15. 29 % and 1. 35 % to 19. 59 %, respectively.

The magnetic field instrumentation consists of two independent magnetometer sensor suites, each consisting of a tri-axial Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM) sensor {{and a pair of}} co-located imaging sensors mounted on an ultra-stable optical bench. The imaging system sensors are part of a subsystem that provides accurate attitude information (to approx. 20 arcsec on a spinning spacecraft) near the point of measurement of the magnetic field. The two sensor suites are accommodated at 10 and 12 m from the body of the spacecraft on a 4 m long magnetometer boom affixed to the outer end of one of 's three solar array assemblies. The magnetometer sensors are controlled by independent and functionally identical electronics boards within the magnetometer electronics package mounted inside Juno's massive radiation shielded vault. The imaging sensors are controlled by a fully hardware redundant electronics package also mounted within the radiation vault. Each magnetometer sensor measures the vector magnetic field with 100 ppm <b>absolute</b> <b>vector</b> accuracy over a wide dynamic range (to 16 Gauss = 1. 6 x 10 (exp. 6) nT per axis) with a resolution of approx. 0. 05 nT in the most sensitive dynamic range (+/- 1600 nT per axis). Both magnetometers sample the magnetic field simultaneously at an intrinsic sample rate of 64 vector samples per second.
