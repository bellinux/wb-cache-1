5|$|Ryzhkov <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> {{continued}} {{their work on}} economic reform and in 1987 began drafting the Law on the State Enterprise, which restricted the authority of central planners. This would later come into effect and give workers an unrealistically high level of power. Nikolai Talyzin, Chairman of the State Planning Committee, became the scapegoat {{for the failure of}} this reform and on the orders of Ryzhkov he was replaced by Yuri Maslyukov.|$|E
5|$|Yuri Andropov {{appointed}} Ryzhkov {{head of the}} Economic Department of the Central Committee {{where he}} was responsible for overseeing major planning and financial organs, excluding industry. As head of the department he reported directly to Mikhail Gorbachev and as head of the Central Committee's Economic Department he met with Andropov once a week. Ryzhkov became convinced that had Andropov lived at least another five years, the Soviet Union would have seen a reform package similar to that implemented in the People's Republic of China. During Konstantin Chernenko's short rule, both Ryzhkov <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> elaborated several reform measures, sometimes in the face of opposition from Chernenko.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with late 1987 the Caucasus {{region was}} {{experiencing}} {{a surge in}} political turmoil with large and near constant demonstrations being held {{in the capital of}} Yerevan beginning in February 1988. For the fifteen months prior to the earthquake and at times up to hundreds of thousands of protesters, represented by the Karabakh Committee, were demanding both democracy and the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh (administered by Soviet Azerbaijan but disputed autonomous territory with an 80% Armenian majority and the Azerbaijani minority) in the mountains of the Karabakh region. The unrest and the opposition movement began in September 1988 with negotiations between the Karabakh Committee <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> taking place throughout most of 1989. The relationship between the Soviet authorities and the Armenian society took {{a turn for the worse}} in March and the developments climaxed in November when a state of emergency was declared, along with a nighttime curfew, and a mass movement of up to 50,000 Armenians fleeing ethnic violence arrived from Azerbaijan.|$|E

50|$|The {{impact of}} Chernenko—or the lack thereof—was {{evident in the}} way in which his death was {{reported}} in the Soviet press. Soviet newspapers carried stories about Chernenko's death <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> selection on the same day. The papers had the same format: page 1 reported the party Central Committee session on 11 March that elected <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>and</b> printed the new leader's biography and a large photograph of him; page 2 announced the demise of Chernenko and printed his obituary.|$|R

25|$|Ligachyov's {{career began}} {{in his native}} Siberia {{and took him to}} some of the highest {{functions}} of the Party. He was often regarded as Gorbachev's second man, holding important posts such as Secretary for Ideology. However, Ligachyov lost his posts in 1990, a year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, resigning from his political career at the 28th Party Congress. Ligachyov was critical of Yeltsin <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> to an extent, although he is often held as most remarkable for being Gorbachev's primary critic.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{democratisation}} of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had irreparably {{undermined the}} power of the CPSU <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> himself. The relaxation of censorship and attempts to create more political openness had the unintended effect of re-awakening long-suppressed nationalist and anti-Russian feelings in the Soviet republics. Calls for greater independence from Moscow's rule grew louder, especially in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which had been annexed into the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin in 1940. Nationalist feeling also took hold in Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev {{acknowledged}} that his liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika owed {{a great deal}} to Dubček's [...] "socialism with a human face".

25|$|The Central Committee Plenum in January 1987 saw the {{crystallisation}} of Gorbachev's political reforms, including {{proposals for}} multi-candidate {{elections and the}} appointment of non-Party members to government positions. He also first raised the idea of expanding co-operatives. Economic reforms took up {{much of the rest}} of 1987, as a new law giving enterprises more independence was passed in June <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> released a book, Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World, in November, elucidating his main ideas for reform. In 1987, he rehabilitated many opponents of Joseph Stalin—another part of the De-Stalinization, which began in 1956, when Lenin's Testament was published.|$|E
25|$|While Britain and France were wary of a re-unified Germany, Bush {{pushed for}} German reunification {{alongside}} West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. After negotiations among Bush, Gorbachev, and Kohl, Gorbachev {{agreed to allow}} a reunified Germany that {{would also be a}} member of NATO. At the time of the negotiations, the Soviet Union had over 300,000 soldiers stationed in East Germany, <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> agreed to pull the soldiers out within three to four years. In return, Kohl agreed to limit military personnel and refrain from developing or maintaining weapons of mass destruction. With the signing of the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, Germany officially reunified in October 1990.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} {{remained in}} the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony {{was held at the}} airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, {{the first of its kind}} in some thirty years, marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. That the smooth proceedings of this event had been derailed by the student movement embarrassed the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path. The summit between Deng <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> took place at the Great Hall of the People amidst the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square. When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told the Soviet leader, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. The statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.|$|E

500|$|A {{subsequent}} book, Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended {{describes the}} relationship of the two men and their efforts to reach agreement on arms reductions between the superpowers. Matlock takes the position that the military build-up by Ronald Reagan in the early-1980s has contributed to the inaccurate characterization of Reagan as a war hawk. [...] The quote atop the first page of Reagan <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> is by Ronald Reagan, speaking in 1981 during the beginnings of a one trillion dollar defense spending surge, that states [...] "I've always recognized that ultimately there's got to be a settlement, a solution." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1985, she {{strongly}} {{encouraged her}} husband to hold [...] "summit" [...] conferences with Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, and suggested they form a personal relationship beforehand. Both Ronald Reagan <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> had developed a productive relationship through their summit negotiations. The relationship between Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbacheva was anything but the friendly, diplomatic one between their husbands; Reagan found Gorbachova hard to converse with and their relationship was described as [...] "frosty". The two women usually had tea and discussed differences between the USSR and the United States. Visiting the United States {{for the first time}} in 1987, Gorbachova irked Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American president's wife to quip, [...] "Who does that dame think she is?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Russian President Boris Yeltsin {{released}} the top-secret {{documents from the}} sealed [...] "Package №1." [...] and transferred them to the new Polish president Lech Wałęsa. Among the documents was a proposal by Lavrentiy Beria, dated 5 March 1940, to execute 25,700 Poles from Kozelsk, Ostashkov and Starobelsk camps, and from certain prisons of Western Ukraine and Belarus, signed by Stalin (among others). Another document transferred to the Poles was Aleksandr Shelepin's 3 March 1959 note to Nikita Khrushchev, with information about the execution of 21,857 Poles, {{as well as a}} proposal to destroy their personal files to reduce the possibility that documents related to the massacre would be uncovered later. The revelations were also publicized in the Russian press, where they were interpreted as being one outcome of an ongoing power struggle between Yeltsin <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev.</b>|$|E

500|$|On 4 July, Gorbachev {{declared}} that the region was stabilizing, and announced {{an end to the}} operation. In both military and strategic terms, Operation Ring was a failure. The aim of disarming the Armenian volunteer groups was never achieved. Despite the presence of helicopter gunships and armored vehicles, the militiamen managed to elude and evade capture. Ring, however, managed to reinforce the ethnic divide between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, [...] "virtually precluding," [...] according to Michael Croissant [...] "the possibility of further coexistence between the peoples within" [...] Azerbaijan's borders. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials maintained that Ring was necessary to prevent the region from further deteriorating into chaos and as the militias' presence contravened the July 1990 presidential decree. According to Shabad, however, the operation's objectives were impractical <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> had been misled on the general situation in Karabakh: ...|$|E
500|$|Upon Gorbachev's {{ascension}} to power, Tikhonov {{was elected}} {{chairman of the}} newly established Commission on Improvements of the Management System. The title of chairman was largely honorary, and its de facto head was its deputy chairman, Nikolai Ryzhkov. On 23 May 1985 Tikhonov presented his development plan for 1985 to 1990, and up until 2000, the plan was criticised by co-workers, <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> told his colleagues that Tikhonov was [...] "ill-equipped" [...] for the Premiership. Tikhonov forecast estimated growth of 2022 percent growth in Soviet national income, an increase of 2124 percent in industrial growth and doubling Soviet agriculture output by 2000. As part of Gorbachev's plan of removing, and replacing, the most conservative members of the Politburo, Tikhonov was compelled to retire. Ryzhkov succeeded Tikhonov in office on 27 September 1985. His resignation was made official at a Central Committee plenum in September 1985. It is noteworthy {{that by the time}} of his resignation, Tikhonov was the oldest member of the Soviet leadership. Tikhonov was active in Soviet politics, albeit in a much less prominent role, until 1989 when he lost his seat in the Central Committee.|$|E
2500|$|Another summit {{was held}} in July 1991, where the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) was signed by Bush <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> in Moscow. The treaty took nine {{years in the making}} and was the first major arms {{agreement}} since the signing of the Intermediate Ranged Nuclear Forces Treaty by Reagan <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> in 1987. The contentions in START would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States and the USSR by about 35% over seven years, and the Soviet Union's land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles would be cut by 50%. Bush described START as [...] "a significant step forward in dispelling half a century of mistrust".|$|E

The socialist economy either had to be deregulated almost completely or be brought back under strict state planning, which was done after 1971 by Erich Honecker.|$|R

2500|$|Around the 50th {{anniversary of}} {{the signing of the}} 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in July 1989, the Soviet {{government}} formally acknowledged that the plan had included the placing of the Baltic states into the Soviet sphere of influence, which paved the way for their annexation into the USSR in 1940. The revelation supported the long-denied proposition that the Baltic states had been involuntarily brought into the Soviet Union, and so it boosted the Baltic aspirations to reestablish their independence. Finally, the Eastern bloc fragmented in the autumn of 1989, <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> made the decision not to use military force {{in order to maintain the}} Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. [...] This raised hopes that Gorbachev would extend his non-interventionist doctrine to the internal workings of the USSR.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 August 1991, a coup against Gorbachev was {{launched}} by the government members opposed to perestroika. Gorbachev was held in Crimea while Yeltsin raced to the White House of Russia (residence of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR) in Moscow to defy the coup, making a memorable speech from atop the turret of a tank onto which he had climbed. The White House was surrounded by the military but the troops defected {{in the face of}} mass popular demonstrations. By 21 August most of the coup leaders had fled Moscow <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> was [...] "rescued" [...] from Crimea and then returned to Moscow. Yeltsin was subsequently hailed by his supporters around the world for rallying mass opposition to the coup.|$|E
2500|$|Yeltsin's {{criticism}} of the Politburo <b>and</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> led to a smear campaign against him, in which examples of Yeltsin's awkward behavior were used against him. Speaking at the CPSU conference in 1988, Yegor Ligachev stated: [...] "Boris, you are wrong". An article in Pravda described Yeltsin as drunk at a lecture during his September 1989 visit to the United States, an allegation which appeared to be confirmed by a TV account of his speech. However, popular dissatisfaction with the regime was very strong, and these attempts to smear Yeltsin only added to his popularity. In another incident, Yeltsin fell from a bridge. Commenting on this event, Yeltsin hinted that he was helped to fall from the bridge by the enemies of perestroika, but his opponents suggested that he was simply drunk.|$|E
