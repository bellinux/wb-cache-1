5|$|A box set {{entitled}} The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Complete Radio Series {{was released}} on 3 October 2005. It contains fifteen CDs, subdivided per radio series, and bonus material exclusive to the box set. BBC Audio released a DVD version of the Tertiary Phase, featuring that series in 5.1 surround sound, in October 2006. Contrary to previous announcements, this was merely a DVD-Video disc with Dolby Digital sound <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features,</b> rather than a DVD-Audio disc. While it had been stated that BBC Audio plans on also releasing {{the fourth and fifth}} radio series on DVD, no dates have been set.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Unix File System, {{which is}} {{typically}} the default file system on BSDs, DragonFly BSD supports HAMMER file system. It was developed specifically for DragonFly BSD {{to provide a}} feature-rich yet better designed analogue of the increasingly popular ZFS. HAMMER supports configurable file system history, snapshots, checksumming, data deduplication <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features</b> typical for file systems of its kind.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This {{led to a}} design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features</b> for the SCD system.|$|E

5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, {{a variety of}} colors, coat types, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features</b> that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have {{appeared}} spontaneously. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, each player creates their player {{character}} and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each {{edition of the}} game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features</b> to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist has platform-specific features, {{including}} voice {{integration with}} Xbox 360's Kinect peripheral which allows players to distract enemies before attacking. A player {{can also use}} the Kinect sensor to control the protagonist with their body instead of the Xbox 360 controller. In the Wii U version, the Gamepad controller's touchscreen is an interface, accessing gadgets <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features</b> from the protagonist's arm-mounted computer (OPSAT), and incorporating screen and motion controls to highlight enemies with thermal vision when using Killing in Motion. The Wii U version was not shipped with the game's cooperative mode.|$|E

5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings {{that are designed to}} manipulate the Steam storefront <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features.</b> For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.|$|E
5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features</b> we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|Extant relations, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the white-headed {{starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities in colouration <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features</b> with the extinct Mascarene species. Since the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem morphologically closer to each other than to the hoopoe starling—which appears closer to Southeast Asian starlings—there may have been two separate migrations of starlings from Asia to the Mascarenes, with the hoopoe starling the latest arrival. Except for Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean with native starlings, probably due to their isolation, varied topography, and vegetation.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} spill prevention, the {{pipeline}} was designed with one-way valves (so oil moving ahead could not leak {{out of a}} hole behind a certain point), computer-aided leak detection, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features.</b> The pipeline {{was designed to be}} pressurized, so any leak would be instantly detected by a loss of pressure at one of the pump stations, which could sound an alarm and halt the flow of oil quickly.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} skyscrapers reflected these debates: the Railway Exchange, the Peoples Gas and the Illinois Continental and Commercial Bank Buildings {{were each}} substantial, quarter-block wide palazzo cubes of common height, their facades divided into a classical tripartite design, and sporting classical columns <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features.</b> Despite the apparent uniformity of design, individual buildings varied considerably in the detail {{of their designs}} in effort to express their particular identities, the Peoples Gas Building using texture and the Railway Exchange Building white terracotta, for example.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, the runways, parking ramp <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features</b> of Tamiami Airport were still visible {{on campus and}} clearly {{discernible}} in aerial photos. Construction has removed all of these features, and only the University Tower remains as a memory of the university's past. University Park is a lush, heavily vegetated campus, with many lakes and a 15-acre nature preserve, {{as well as a}} palm arboretum and has over 90 buildings. As of late 2009, current construction at University Park includes the Nursing and Health Sciences Building, the School of International and Public Affairs Building, and a fifth parking garage.|$|E

5|$|Whitepages {{was founded}} in 1997 as a hobby for then-Stanford student Alex Algard. It was {{incorporated}} in 2000 and received $45 million in funding in 2005. Investors were later bought-out by Algard in 2013. From 2008 to 2013, Whitepages released several mobile apps, a re-design in 2009, the ability for consumers to control their contact information, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features.</b> From 2010 to 2016, the company shifted away from advertising revenue and began focusing more on selling business services and subscription products.|$|E
5|$|Alien: Isolation was {{released}} on 7 October 2014, featuring two pre-order downloadable content missions that allow players to play two scenes from the original film. The first mission, entitled Crew Expendable, features the original crew of the Nostromo and involves the player controlling Ripley, Dallas or Parker attempting to flush the alien creature from the air vents and into the ship's airlock. The second mission, Last Survivor, is set during the film's finale and involves the player controlling Ripley {{as she tries to}} activate the Nostromos self-destruct sequence and reach the escape shuttle. Unlike the first mission, the second mission is only available for players who pre-ordered the game at certain retailers. Upon release, five additional downloadable content packs for the game were periodically released between October 2014 and March 2015. These packs expand the game's Survivor Mode with new characters, challenges, maps, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features.</b> A collection featuring the game and all the downloadable content packs {{was released}} for Linux, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in late 2015.|$|E
5|$|As {{a highly}} popular video game series {{with a large}} and active fan base, the Halo trilogy {{has given rise to}} an array of video {{productions}} in an emerging entertainment medium, machinima. Virtually all machinima footage based around the Halo games is taken from the multiplayer modes of the main trilogy games. Most productions are set outside Halo canon, while others are based on fan fiction closely relating to the official story. Halo 3 includes a saved film function that allows camera angles not possible in previous games, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features</b> that simplify production. The game {{has become one of the}} most popular tools for generating machinima, and Microsoft updated its user license agreement to allow noncommercial distribution of such films.|$|E

This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Dave Raggett, then at Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Bristol, England {{devoted his}} spare time to {{developing}} Arena on which he hoped to demonstrate new and future HTML specifications. Development of the browser was slow because Raggett was the lone developer and HP, which like many other computer corporations at the time, was unconvinced that the Internet would succeed and thus did not consider investing in web browser development. Raggett demonstrated the browser at the first World Wide Web Conference in Geneva, Switzerland in 1994 and the 1994 ISOC conference in Prague to show text flow around images, forms, {{and other aspects of}} HTML later termed as the HTML+ specification. Raggett subsequently partnered with CERN, to develop Arena further as a proof of concept browser for this work. Using the Arena browser, Dave Raggett, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, Håkon Wium Lie and others demonstrated text flow around a figure with captions, resizable tables, image backgrounds, HTML math, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features.</b> At the Web World conference in Orlando, in early 1995, Raggett demonstrated the different new features of Arena.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Minneapolis City Council {{appropriated}} {{a portion}} of its $1.35 billion 2008 budget for improvements to Nokomis and Northeast Community Library. $5.2 million of the $7 million project came from the city; Hennepin County put forward $1.8 million for environmental additions to the library <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>features.</b> The new building was designed by KKE Architects with significant input from a citizen advisory committee. Ebert, Inc. was hired as the general contractor. The old building's last day of operation was September 12, 2009, at which time it {{was reported in the}} Longfellow/Nokomis Messenger that the renovated library was expected to reopen sometime in the fall of the next year. During the construction, patrons were encouraged to make use of nearby libraries including East Lake, Roosevelt, Washburn, and Southdale.|$|E
