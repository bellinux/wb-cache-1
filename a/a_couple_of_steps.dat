40|$|The ASICs in the {{automotive}} sensing area are greatly increasing in their complexity. Additional safety mechanisms, DSPs with Firmware and complex output protocols {{need to be}} implemented. Due to this increasing complexity of the sensors, an analog top level simulation cannot be used to verify certain chip behaviour during the development phase. Therefore a digital top level simulation is used to verify the chip functionality. The analog blocks need to be modelled in VHDL to simulate design. In order to receive trustable simulation results, it is needed that the VHDL models match {{as much as possible}} the analog circuits. In this context, the VHDL model must be checked against analog simulation in an automatic way. Deviations between the outputs of the VHDL model and the analog simulation, outside a certain limit in time or amplitude, must be detected and displayed. The aim of this thesis is to develop a verification environment useful for designers to quickly check the behaviour of a VHDL-modelled analog block. Firstly the VHDL core environment is being implemented using a modular approach for adapting the several internal modules to the model under test. This environment imports data from analog simulation and performs the comparison between the signal producing the reports. Then it is embedded in a Self-Checking Metamodel, a bigger simulation structure that generate the input signals and use them as common input for the analog and the relative VHDL block. Several scripts are implemented in order to automatize the whole process of verification and to make the system flexible for block interchanging and project portability. The prototype version released accomplishes the quickness and block interchangeability aimed: the VHDL environment quickly fits the differences between models and shows the divergences between analog and digital behaviour. The tool is also applicable to different projects in order to maintain a useful portability. It has been tested on two different projects, by different users. This tool is really efficient in terms of set up speed and a block simulation can be prepared in <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>step...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} dividing a two-word integer by a single-word integer, together with a few extensions and applications. Due to lack of efficient division instructions in current processors, the division is performed as a multiplication using a precomputed single-word approximation of the reciprocal of the divisor, followed by <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> adjustment <b>steps.</b> There are three common types of unsigned multiplication instructions; we define full word multiplication (umul) which produces the two-word product of two single-word integers, low multiplication (umullo) which produces only the least significant word of the product, and high multiplication (umulhi), which produces only the most significant word. We describe an algo-rithm which produces a quotient and remainder using one umul and one umullo. This is an improvement over earlier methods, since the new method uses cheaper multiplication operations. It turns out we also get some additional savings from simpler adjustment conditions. The algorithm has been implemented in version 4. 3 of the GMP library. When applied {{to the problem of}} dividing a large integer by a single word, the new algorithm gives a speedup of roughly 30 %, benchmarked on AMD and Intel processors in the x 86 64 family.

Longitudinal production data from two untutored Russian beginners (ages 8 and 14) acquiring German under roughly similar conditions are compared to published results on the acquisition of German by adult immigrants.

They then go through <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> intermediate <b>steps</b> in which, first, semantically empty verbs (auxiliaries) serve as isolated carriers of finiteness before lexical verbs become finite. Whereas the 14 -year-old learner of this case study basically shows a developmental pattern similar to that of adults, the 8 -year-old child produces a different order of acquisition: Not only is the development of finite morphology faster, but finite lexical verbs are acquired before auxiliary constructions (Perfekt). Results suggest a stronger tendency for young learners to incrementally assimilate input patterns without relying on analytic steps guided by principles of information organization to the same extent as older learners...|$|R

In a new study in PLOS Biology, Shiwen Wang, Yue Xiong, Dan Ye, Kun-Liang Guan, and colleagues elucidate in detail a regulatory pathway that begins with insulin and ends with removal of an acetyl group on PGK 1, opening up the enzyme’s active site to bind ADP (Fig 1). Acetylation is perhaps less well known as a regulatory modification than phosphorylation, but it is a ubiquitous method of changing a protein’s structure and function. PGK 1 is acetylated in multiple locations, and the authors showed that inhibiting a family of deacetylases led to a decrease in PGK 1 activity, indicating the biochemical relevance of the modification. They iden-tified five highly conserved lysine residues on the protein that could serve as a site of acetyl group attachment, and showed that mutating one, K 220, reduced activity by over 80 %.
