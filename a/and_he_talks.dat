500|$|Tracy {{is served}} with {{paternity}} papers and {{insists that the}} child is not his. After the DNA test, Tracy learns {{that the child is}}n't his but that he is a direct descendant of Thomas Jefferson. The news angers Tracy <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> to Toofer and Frank about it. Toofer learns that he is a direct descendant of Tobias Spurlock, a black Confederate soldier. Tracy and Toofer are upset about the news until Tracy has a dream in which Thomas Jefferson (portrayed by Jack Donaghy) appears to him on The Maury Povich Show. In the dream, Jefferson takes credit for [...] "inventing" [...] America and tells Tracy to forget his past. Tracy decides that he wants Toofer to write a movie about their experiences and Thomas Jefferson's life. Tracy intends to play all of the parts in the movie, except he intends for the film to be a drama.|$|E
500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Rock Show" [...] were improvised by the actors. Paul Schneider made up his own {{dialogue}} during the scene in which he and Poehler sit next to the pit <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about it as if it is already a park. Poehler's laughter at his jokes in this scene is her genuine reaction. Pratt also improvised much of his own dialogue, including his rationale to Ann for why he lied about his leg casts: [...] "I really, really like it when you serve me food." [...] Pratt also changed the reaction his character had to Mark falling into the pit. The script originally called for Andy to be serious and concerned, but Pratt changed it so his character thought the fall was funny. Pratt also improvised the songs he sang during an early scene in the episode, in which Andy makes up songs about random items in Ann's living room out of boredom from wearing the casts for so long. One of the songs he sings is about a lamp, and included the lyrics, [...] "I wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched." [...] Pratt thought of the song because he had recently gotten such a lamp as a gift from a friend.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Louis Menand {{thought that}} {{teachers}} assign the novel {{because of the}} optimistic ending, to teach adolescent readers that [...] "alienation is just a phase." [...] While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age, Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult, given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives. Others highlight the dilemma of Holden's state, in between adolescence and adulthood. Holden is quick to become emotional. [...] "I felt sorry as hell for..." [...] is a phrase he often uses. It is often said that Holden changes at the end, when he watches Phoebe on the carousel, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about the golden ring and how it's good for kids to try and grab it.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{would you}} then be letting him come here as <b>he</b> likes, <b>and</b> {{settling}} nothing, and just maning {{to marry you}} or not, as <b>he</b> likes, <b>and</b> you <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> of over the counthry these four months back, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talking</b> about you, jist as his misthress, through the counthry?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{handed them}} back, with praise for his photography, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> of lenses <b>and</b> time-exposures.|$|R
60|$|This little {{conversation}} {{made quite}} {{an impression on}} Harry, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to Kate about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "A most mercer-like memory!" [...] said Lambourne. [...] "The gentleman {{asks him}} of the lady's beauty, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> of her fine clothes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And when {{he comes}} he sits and touches her hand if he can, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> in his lowest voice, and she sits and smiles--she almost laughs {{outright}} at the things he says." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you know? But bo' could you? He's got {{the most}} {{beautiful}} eyes, and he wea's his hai' in a bang, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> English {{like it was something}} else, and his name's Mr. Beaton." ...|$|E
60|$|I obeyed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> with Hirsch {{for several}} moments in an undertone. Then he turned once more to me.|$|R
60|$|The breakfast was rough, but Nat {{enjoyed it}} greatly. Toussaint remarked {{that he himself}} had breakfasted an hour before, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> while his guest ate.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I am {{sure you}} will when we get home,' said the king smiling, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to him about other things till {{they came to the}} palace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Frank has {{now gone}} to Courcy Castle; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> of going from thence to Cambridge. But he will doubtless be here, {{backwards}} and forwards; {{and perhaps it}} will be better for all parties--safer, that is, doctor--if Miss Thorne were to discontinue her visits to Greshamsbury for a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll have to {{live through}} several," [...] said Cornelia; [...] "You can excuse me when you go. He's very conceited, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> to you {{as if he were}} a {{thousand}} years old. I think Mr. Plaisdell is a great deal nicer. He doesn't treat you as if you were--I don't know what!" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{best of all}} to me, {{are those}} quiet moments when Alured's earnest spirit shows itself, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> out what is in his heart; {{that it is a}} great {{responsibility}} to stand in the place such a man as Fulk would have had--yes--and to have been saved at the cost of Trevor's life.|$|E
60|$|It was Bert {{began the}} <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> on {{regardless}} of what they understood or failed to understand. But his voice must have conveyed his cantankerous intentions.|$|R
60|$|The clear flame {{shooting}} up revealed {{him in the}} black cloak with a hood of a Mediterranean sailor. His eyes watched the dancing dim light to seaward. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> the while.|$|R
60|$|Then 'John' {{began to}} <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> continuously, like a foreigner, not saying {{the things he}} would have said in Italian, but {{following}} the suggestion and scope of his limited English.|$|R
60|$|Behold {{there in}} the wood the fine madman! He is a palace of sweet sounds and sights; he dilates; he is twice a man; he walks with arms akimbo; he soliloquizes; he accosts the grass and the trees; he feels {{the blood of the}} violet, the clover and the lily in his veins; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> with the brook that wets his foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{position}} in the world!" [...] cried Mr. Kendrew. [...] "Here is a man whose father has left him half a million of money--with the one condition annexed to it of taking his father's place {{at the head of}} one of the greatest mercantile houses in England. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about a position, as if he was a junior clerk in his own office! What on earth does your ambition see, beyond what your ambition has already got?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Blendershin smiled. [...] "It's {{not so much}} {{ability as}} {{willingness}} to teach, you know. And they won't find you out. The sort of schoolmaster we deal with can't find anything out. He can't teach {{any of these things}} himself--and consequently he doesn't believe they can be taught. Talk to him of pedagogics <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> of practical experience. But he puts 'em on his prospectus, you know, and he wants 'em on his time-table. Some of these subjects--There's commercial geography, for instance. What is commercial geography?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did,' said Aubrey eagerly; 'at least, I know he said {{he would}} not stay if they wanted to put him up to their dishonest tricks; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> of that very window!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he has {{eighteen}} hundred pounds, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> {{of drawing}} out {{the amount and}} paying up, and then exchanging into some other regiment. The question, however, is, whether he ought to pay." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{sat with}} his back to a tree stump all that night, holding the kitten in his arms. His mind was tired, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> or thought coherently no longer. Towards dawn he dozed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do {{not think}} of Ferdinand as a man; to me he is a companion. He [...] has a wider {{experience}} than a woman, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> of different [...] things. Otherwise I see no difference. On his part, the idea of my [...] sex never occurs to him, and far from being annoyed as an ordinary [...] woman might be, I am proud of it. It shows me that, when I chose a [...] companion, I chose well. To him I am not a woman; I am a man.' ...|$|E
60|$|The gunner took it {{from the}} boatswain, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> {{with one of the}} midshipmen in the same dialect. For my part, says he, I shipped myself for the South Seas when I first came aboard the ship, and in hopes of good booty; and if we go thither, I know nothing can hinder us, wind and weather permitting: but this is such a voyage as no man ever {{attempted}} before; and whatever the captain proposes, can have nothing in it for the men, but horrid fatigue, violent heats, sickness, and starving.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's two people, mamma," [...] Isabel {{answered}} seriously; [...] "and I danced {{three times}} {{with one of}} him, and twice with the other, I believe; at least so he told me. His name's Carnegie, and half of him's called Ernest {{and the other half}} Harold, though which I danced with which time I'm sure I can't tell you. He's a pair of twins, in fact, one a doctor and one a lawyer; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> just the same sort of talk in either case, and is an extremely nice young man altogether. I really like him immensely." ...|$|E
6000|$|Blome was genial, gay, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> the most. Wright alone seemed uncommunicative <b>and</b> unsociable. <b>He</b> smoked {{fiercely}} <b>and</b> drank continually. All at once {{he straightened}} up as if listening. [...] "What's that?" [...] he called suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am frightened!" [...] I sobbed out. [...] "Father {{has been}} in my room {{watching}} you at the gate <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> so strangely. <b>He</b> is very angry <b>and</b> <b>he</b> looks {{as though he were}} going to hurt someone." ...|$|R
50|$|In Sesame Street: 20 <b>and</b> Still Counting, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Bert got a {{new video}} camera, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> Bert into using the camera to record footage of Sesame Street {{so that they could}} watch Sesame Street on television.|$|R
60|$|Now I ask you, is {{this to be}} borne? Here I sit, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> half-impudently and patronisingly about me. And here I sit, and he is glegging {{at me as if}} he saw {{signs of}} an aureole under my grey hat. All in ten minutes. And just because, instead of la Germania I turn out to be l'Inghilterra. I might as well be a place on a map, or a piece of goods with a trade-mark. So little {{perception}} of the actual me! so much going by labels! I now could have kicked him harder. I would have liked to say I was ten times German, to see the fool change his smirk again.|$|E
6000|$|... "If she's been up 'ere once in {{the last}} week to, know whether the Silvia is up she's been four or five times," [...] he growled. [...] "He's forty-seven if he's a day; 'is left leg is shorter than 'is right, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> with a stutter. When she's with 'im you'd think as butter wouldn't melt in 'er mouth; but the way she talked to me just now you'd think I was paid a-purpose to wait on her. I asked 'er at last wot she thought I was here for, and she said she didn't know, and nobody else neither. And afore she went off she told the potman from the 'Albion,' wot was listening, that I was known all over Wapping as the Sleeping Beauty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{their looks}} belie them horribly," [...] Ralph said. [...] "I suppose they don't like me; {{and that would}} be all well enough if I had done {{anything}} to offend them, but it was just as bad the first day I came. I am sure Mr. Penfold does not like it. I can see him fidget on his chair; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> away with me pretty well all the time we are at table, so as to make it less awkward, I suppose. Well, I am stopping with him, and not with them, that's one thing; and it doesn't make much difference to me if they do choose to be disagreeable. I like him immensely. He is wonderfully kind; but it would be awfully stupid work if it weren't for you, Mabel. I don't think I could stand it {{if it were not for}} our rides together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{physician}} hath {{given the}} praefect {{a drug to}} make him sleep, for it seems that fever was upon him with the pain of his wounds <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> incoherently like one bereft of reason." ...|$|R
60|$|The spy was devout to {{the point}} of bigoted, credulous superstition. He spent long hours in prayer, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> freely of his special devotion to the Blessed Virgin, and his ardent faith in miracles.|$|R
60|$|The tailor worked <b>and</b> worked, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to himself. <b>He</b> {{measured}} the silk, {{and turned it}} round and round, and trimmed it into shape with his shears; the table was all littered with cherry-coloured snippets.|$|R
