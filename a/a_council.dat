50|$|Like the US counterpart, the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> (where the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> Japan is modelled), <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> Japan {{generally}} {{does not}} produce public service advertisements itself; rather, it acts as a coordinator and distributor. Its advertising campaigns are divided into three; national campaign, regional campaign and aid campaign. The advertising campaigns are changed yearly in July, the month <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> Japan was founded. <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> Japan accepts requests from sponsor organizations for Japanese advertising campaigns that focus on particular social issues.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chairman}} of <b>a</b> town <b>council</b> {{will have the}} title [...] "town mayor" [...] and that of <b>a</b> parish <b>council</b> which is <b>a</b> city will usually have the title of mayor. As a result, <b>a</b> parish <b>council</b> can also be called <b>a</b> town <b>council,</b> <b>a</b> community <b>council,</b> <b>a</b> village <b>council</b> or occasionally <b>a</b> city <b>council</b> (though most cities are not parishes but principal areas, or in England specifically metropolitan boroughs or non-metropolitan districts).|$|R
50|$|Since Roosevelt, every U.S. {{president}} {{has supported the}} <b>Ad</b> <b>Council's</b> work. In the 1950s, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and General Dwight D.

5|$|Khalid, sensing Heraclius' plan, {{feared that}} the Muslim armies would indeed be {{isolated}} and destroyed. In <b>a</b> <b>council</b> of war he suggested that Abu Ubaidah draw all the Muslim armies to one place so as to fight a decisive battle with the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities are {{administered}} by <b>a</b> <b>council</b> of 23 members elected every four years. They {{also have a}} mayor and several departments (education, culture, finances...). The mayor primarily deals with these departments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> {{spots are}} used to fill unsold air time by {{stations}} and networks. Political talk shows often have advertising time either controlled by the local station or a program's syndicating network that goes unsold; this is often filled by promotions for other programming on a station, short segments, and public service announcements, including from the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council.</b> Activists unfamiliar with the ad model of these programs or that of the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> often complain to the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> itself, along with the organizations which coordinate their messages with the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> such as the AARP, leading the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> and the organizations to disclaim they do not share {{the views of the}} hosts where their announcements air, and have little to no control about where they may be scheduled to air.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> {{has been}} further criticized for distracting {{the public by}} {{focusing}} on individual lifestyle changes, {{rather than on the}} need to fix social problems by changing institutions, such as the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council's</b> many corporate sponsors, or the government and military, whose campaigns the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> has also promoted.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> {{distributes}} {{the advertisements}} {{to a network}} of 33,000 media outlets—including broadcast, print, outdoor (i.e. billboards, bus stops), and Internet—who run the ads in donated time and space. Media outlets donate approximately $1.8 billion to <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> campaigns annually. If paid for, this amount would make the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> {{one of the largest}} advertisers in the country.|$|R

5|$|The {{death of}} Frederick, {{the heir to}} the British throne on 20 March 1751, caused {{constitutional}} chaos; George II wished to appoint his favourite son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, as Regent (since the heir apparent, George III, was only a child), while the public favoured the child's mother Princess Augusta. In an attempt to reach a compromise the government introduced a bill to Parliament declaring that Augusta was to be a regent along with <b>a</b> <b>council</b> of others, and that George would become the heir when he reached maturity. Murray made a speech supporting the government's proposal, but despite this, Parliament was not convinced that <b>a</b> <b>council</b> was necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} is <b>a</b> <b>Council</b> of Ministers, {{consisting of a}} Chief Minister and nine ministers. Each minister may appoint up to two assistant ministers.

5000|$|The <b>Ad</b> <b>Council,</b> <b>an</b> American {{non-profit}} organization that distributes {{public service announcements}} on behalf of various private and federal government agency sponsors, has been labeled as [...] "little more than a domestic propaganda arm of the federal government" [...] given the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council's</b> historically close collaboration with the President of the United States and the federal government.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> {{was first}} {{approached}} by the Department of Justice in 1977 {{to create a}} public campaign to engage the public in reducing crime. The FBI director recommended a campaign playing on fears to convince citizens to take personal safety steps, but the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> rejected their proposal believing it would largely be ignored by an already frightened public. However, the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> was still interested in a crime prevention campaign. Leo Perlis, {{a member of the}} <b>Ad</b> <b>Council's</b> Public Policy Committee, heard the proposal and liked the idea. He met with FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley, the head of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, and {{a board member of the}} National Sherriffs' Association to form a coalition to direct the ad campaign.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>council</b> {{is held in}} the church. The Horseman {{seemingly}} kills Katrina's stepmother, Lady Van Tassel, {{and heads}} off to the church to get Baltus. Crane realizes the Horseman can't enter the church due to it being holy ground. A fight breaks out between the village elders in the church resulting {{in the deaths of}} Reverend Steenwyck and Doctor Lancaster, only ending when the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out and acquiring his head. The next day, Crane believes Katrina {{to be the one who}} controls the Headless Horsemen.|$|E
5|$|A {{report was}} {{approved}} by Brampton City Council during <b>a</b> <b>council</b> meeting on August 16, 1993. The report suggested that in British Columbia, such sculptures are frequently displayed outdoors. As Chinguacousy Park bears an Aboriginal name, it was deemed appropriate for the sculpture to be used {{at the entrance of}} the nearby area. It was to be bolted to a 1.5-metre high (five-foot high) tree stump.|$|E
5|$|According to John of Wallingford, King Edgar {{made this}} {{division}} during <b>a</b> <b>council</b> at York, {{in order to}} prevent the whole area becoming the inheritance of one man. The Historia Regum claims that such a division took place not in Oslac's time but Osulf's, and that the division line was the River Tyne rather than Tees; historian Dorothy Whitelock considered this to be apocryphal.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> {{claimed the}} 1943 [...] "We Can Do It!"

In February 2012 during the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council's</b> 70th anniversary celebration, an interactive application designed by Animax's HelpsGood digital agency was linked to the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council's</b> Facebook page. The Facebook app was called [...] "Rosify Yourself" [...] and it allowed viewers to upload images of their faces to be incorporated into the [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] poster, then saved to be shared with friends. <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own [...] "Rosified" [...] face on The Huffington Post in an article about the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council's</b> past 70 years of public service. The staff of the TV show Today posted two [...] "Rosified" [...] images on their Web site, using the faces of news anchors Matt Lauer and Ann Curry. However, the now-famous poster was actually produced by an internal Westinghouse corporate program as part of a series of posters shown to Westinghouse employees for two weeks then discarded. It was not produced by the <b>Ad</b> <b>Council</b> nor was it used for recruiting women workers.|$|R

5|$|After Longchamp's exile Coutances {{was named}} head of <b>a</b> <b>council</b> of regency, which is {{sometimes}} equated {{to the post}} of Chief Justiciar, although he never referred to himself as such nor is he titled that in any official document. Most modern historians, however, name him as justiciar. He held that power until about 25 December 1193, when Hubert Walter was appointed Justiciar.|$|E
5|$|Although the Charter of 1215 was {{a failure}} as a peace treaty, it was resurrected under the new {{government}} of the young Henry III {{as a way of}} drawing support away from the rebel faction. On his deathbed, King John appointed <b>a</b> <b>council</b> of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, {{one of the most famous}} knights in England. William knighted the boy, and Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October.|$|E
5|$|As the British {{government}} has no legal jurisdiction, it requires the local residents to form a representative committee according {{to the laws of}} the long-defunct dukedom before negotiating with them. Ancient Burgundian law requires that the Duke himself appoint <b>a</b> <b>council.</b> Sébastien de Charolais arrives and presents his claim to the title, which is verified by Professor Hatton-Jones. He forms the governing body which includes the local policeman, Spiller, and the manager of the bank branch, Mr. Wix; the neighbourhood shop keeper, Arthur Pemberton, is appointed as Burgundy's Prime Minister. The council begin discussions with the government, particularly about the Burgundian treasure.|$|E
