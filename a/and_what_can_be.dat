5|$|An {{alternative}} approach {{focuses on the}} links between this form of castle <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> termed a feudal mode of society. The spread of motte-and-bailey castles was usually {{closely tied to the}} creation of local fiefdoms and feudal landowners, and areas without this method of governance rarely built these castles. Yet another theory suggests that the design emerged {{as a result of the}} pressures of space on ringworks, and that the earliest motte-and-baileys were converted ringworks. Finally, there may be a link between the local geography and the building of motte-and-bailey castles, which are usually built on low-lying areas, in many cases subject to regular flooding. Regardless of the reasons behind the initial popularity of the motte-and-bailey design, however, there is widespread agreement that the castles were first widely adopted in Normandy and Angevin territory in the 10th and 11th centuries.|$|E
5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E

The Hill, one of {{the original}} parts of the zoo, was closed as many of the animals there were moved to the new Giants of the Savanna exhibit. One of the more recent additions to ZooNorth is the Wildlife Amphitheater. The Wildlife Amphitheater is home to SOAR! A Festival of Flight. Primate Place features monkeys, with species from Africa and South America. ZooNorth is also home to the Pierre A.

25|$|He once {{claimed to}} be {{considering}} a career in law enforcement and was on reality television show Armed & Famous. The show was pulled from CBS in January 2007, and Osbourne was sued by a woman from Muncie, Indiana, whose house was accidentally raided during filming. Osbourne also filmed a programme for the BBC's Saving Planet Earth series. In it he travelled to Namibia to highlight the tensions between elephants and the local people, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> done so that both groups can live peacefully beside one another. He also {{took part in the}} Mongol Rally with News Corporation director Andrew Knight's daughter, Amaryllis Knight. Their challenge was to drive a car with under 1000cc from London to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, for charity. Osbourne and his family reunited with a reality TV show on Fox that debuted 31 March 2009 but was cancelled after the first episode.|$|E
500|$|As of 2009, the {{congregation}} had approximately five thousand {{two hundred and}} nine parishioners. Mount Saint Peter Church serves {{as a symbol of}} faith <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> accomplished when people work together for a common belief, hope, and dream. The church's new motto, adopted in 2004, reflected this balance: [...] "to restore all things in Christ...with the fire of love." [...] This motto serves as a constant reminder {{of the history of the}} parish. The beauty of the Mellon Mansion was restored by {{the congregation}} and turned into a House of God. This was done through a strong love of Christ, faith, and neighbor. The names of the volunteers who helped build the church are carved in the marble inside the main entrance of the church and serve as a token of the congregation's appreciation. Many of today's parishioners are descendants of those volunteers and are proud to tell the story of their forefathers who gave them this church in which to practice their faith.|$|E
500|$|Turn Based - Much like in Dungeons and Dragons {{this method}} of {{conflict}} resolution is taken in turns. This combat format is the primary system used in Theater-style LARPs. How turns work <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> done during each turn {{is determined by the}} creator's of the game. Generally, who goes first is determined by some form of indicator {{and in the case of}} LARPs it is usually who acts first, this begins the engagement, essentially giving them an opportunity attack. Movement during a turn is determined by that character's movement speed, while actions are can be either consistent and unchanged rules or character specific. Each individual in the conflict has certain actions they can take on their turn. Chess is an example of a turn based game where who goes first is determined by the color of the pieces. That player now gets to make their movement, which in this case movement is synonymous to action. After their action resolves the other player's turn begins. This differs from the 'No-Touch' System, because a Turn Based LARP does not also mean no touching, although it can. An action from one character could end with their hand on the other character's shoulder. An example of a LARP that utilizes this system is the Otakon convention which also has its [...]|$|E

500|$|Late Registration {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 85, based on 31 reviews. Writing for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield deemed the record [...] "an undeniable triumph, packed front to back, so expansive {{it makes the}} debut sound like a rough draft", while calling West [...] "a real MC". Uncut magazine's Simon Reynolds found most of the songs brilliant and highlighted by what he called an unparalleled use of vocal samples by West, while Josh Tyrangiel from Time said the sampling and string arrangements on [...] "Gone" [...] may persuade listeners to believe West's own hype. In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis praised West's topicality and subversive studio production, writing that [...] "Late Registration suggests an artist effortlessly outstripping his peers: more ideas, better lyrics, bigger hooks, greater depth." [...] The Observer viewed the album as a significant milestone in hip hop while calling West [...] "the Brian Wilson of hip-hop" [...] because he [...] "plays up the struggle between conscience and covetousness, the pop mainstream <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> achieved within the notional boundaries of hip hop". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times compared West's dignified execution of pop crossover to that of The Beatles, Johnny Cash, and Bob Marley. Sean Fennessey from Pitchfork felt West avoided the sophomore slump with an [...] "expansive, imperfect masterpiece" [...] that drew on his enthusiastic, ambitious, and scattered personality. Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, praised the album's [...] "exquisite details", both lyrical and musical, and concluded that West is [...] "as good as he thinks he is... He wants everybody to buy this record. So do I"; he would later assign it an [...] "A+" [...] grade.|$|E
500|$|On May 10, Giuliani held what The New York Times {{described}} as an [...] "extraordinary, emotional news conference" [...] in Bryant Park to announce that he was seeking a separation from Hanover, saying, [...] "This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, {{it was difficult to}} participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path." ...|$|E
