Montgomery claimed that [...] "in years to come it will be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> {{for a man to}} be able to say: 'I fought at Arnhem'", a prediction seemingly borne out by the pride of soldiers who took part, and the occasional desire of those who did not to claim that they were there.|$|E

DeGeneres was followed by car to the studio on at least one occasion by a [...] "suspicious man". Some within the entertainment industry assumed that the coming out was simply a ratings stunt, to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I did it selfishly for myself and because I thought it was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> for the show, which desperately needed a point of view." ...|$|E

In 1922, he prepared a 38-page guidebook, entitled The High Peaks of the Adirondacks. Based on his pioneering experiences on the peaks, the guide recommends that [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> these days to leave civilization for a while and return to nature."

500|$|A {{modified}} and fictionalized {{account of}} the Baird nomination formed the core of Wendy Wasserstein's 1996 play An American Daughter, which was later made into a 2000 television film. [...] Wasserstein saw the episode, {{as well as what}} happened to Wood, as an example of double standards and sexism, and used it as a vehicle to explore the nature and status of American feminism as of the 1990s. [...] She said of its role in illustrating feminist issues, [...] "I mean, if Nannygate hadn't existed, what <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to make up as a way of talking about it."

She maintained a focus on women's empowerment, but her days of fighting with government officialdom were over. She defended the presence and reach of the British Empire: [...] "Some talk about the Empire and Imperialism {{as if it were}} something to decry and something to be ashamed of. t is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to be the inheritors of an Empire like ours... great in territory, great in potential wealth.... If we can only realise and use that potential wealth we can destroy thereby poverty, we can remove and destroy ignorance."

500|$|Inside No. 9, for Pemberton, {{offered the}} [...] "perfect vehicle" [...] for revisiting the {{possibility}} of dialogue-free television. Shearsmith said that, {{at the start of}} the writing process, the pair did not have the intention of scripting the entire episode without dialogue, and that it would be [...] "great" [...] to have ten minutes without it. However, Pemberton said it was easier to write once they had entered the correct [...] "mindset". Once half an episode had been written, Pemberton said, the pair thought [...] "we've just got to keep going". The only dialogue in the episode is right at the end; [...] "what <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to get to the end and just have one line of dialogue", Pemberton suggested, comparing the concept to that of the Mel Brooks film Silent Movie.|$|E

However, when the show {{proved to be a}} success, they requested an additional seven, the first ones of which creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to produce quickly. [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first of those new seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. Parker said, [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of your life when you're in third grade. Pinkeye is the thing every third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, Parker said he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing.</b> That was part of what we wanted (to say). I think kids having this kind of mythology is great." ...|$|E

[...] When he left for Epirus in the northwest, Taylor remained in Athens, where she became the Greek war's first woman war correspondent. [...] She wrote under the pseudonym [...] "Imogene Carter" [...] for the New York Journal, a job that Crane had secured for her.

500|$|On the topic, Krause elaborated: [...] "The {{only one}} who didn't do {{anything}} particularly heroic was Sloan. That made him being with Addison at the end even better, because she was using him to sate a desire {{and that was very}} clear." [...] Krause positively reviewed the idea of Ellis Grey's becoming temporarily lucid, deeming it [...] "amazing": [...] "She was not very endearing when she was lucid, that's for certain. She was unbelievably cruel to Meredith, telling her how disappointed she was that Meredith was merely ordinary. Ouch. But she did <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> this episode too, during her short time as a sane person. She gave Cristina the answer she was looking for." [...] The arc involving Callie and George's sudden marriage, named by Krause [...] "a roller coaster", was described as being a way to emphasize the contrast between the two. Krause also noted the contrast between Stevens' kindhearted personality in the past, and the cruelty she proves to have in the episode, which was noted to have been [...] "a highlight in perfect fashion", as well as a reminder for the multi-dimensional personalities of the characters. Also noted was Cristina's way of accepting Burke's proposal, following Ellis' answer, which gave her the hope she had been previously looking for.|$|E
500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that I had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that is something I think is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "if someone told you that concept, you'd think it was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to have happen {{at the beginning of}} the show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided {{at the beginning of the}} series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E

[...] "I'm so pleased they didn't reveal it," [...] said Andrew Lincoln, [...] "because it was scripted, and extremely powerful, and I said to everyone, 'Burn this page: No one should know apart from Rick and Frank.' It's brilliant that they left it —it's perfect, it's so classy." [...] Kirkman was content with the idea of teasing Jenner's revelation in lieu of blatantly revealing anything about the origins of the virus. [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} addition. I'm very much opposed to showing what the actual cause [...] is and explaining how things work, but teasing a little bit is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing.</b> If it adds an extra layer to the drama, then I'm all for it," [...] he stated. [...] "It also led up to the fantastic mystery of the whisper Jenner gives to Rick at the end of that scene. That's going to play into Season 2 quite a bit.

Tony and Matt are great actors, and the fact that they're easy on the eye is a great advantage". [...] "What the brothers bring is romance and fun, because that's something we've been a little short-changed on in EastEnders recently. The Moons are a very interesting family to work with– they're all big characters. It's a great new era for that clan". Kirkwood added that [...] "there is more to the pair than meets the eye" [...] saying that there [...] "are a couple of buried secrets between Eddie and his sons" [...] confirming it will be [...] "a big story for the summer". He finished, [...] "there'll be consequences for all concerned". Kirkwood later added, [...] "What I hope we've created in Tyler and Anthony are blokes you might see in the pub on a Friday night with an appetite for life– and for women." [...] When Anthony was introduced, it was revealed that he was a gambling addict. Of this, Lapinskas said, [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> that our executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and the EastEnders team came up with for Anthony– that he does have this gambling problem and various insecurities connected with it. It adds some more depth to the character and it's brilliant when we can explore that. With every topic and every storyline that crops up, I think Anthony's background will always have an effect and impact on it. That's really nice to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Efforts at {{improvement}} {{before the}} bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre– the exterior of which was widely unloved– {{from the rest of}} the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that [...] "the bomb was the best thing that ever happened to Manchester", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that [...] "I take exception to his [...] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester". [...] Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. [...] "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying [...] "people say the bomb turned out to be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> for Manchester. That's rubbish." [...] There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre {{before the bombing}}, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid.
