5|$|In 1934 Gandhi {{resigned}} from Congress party membership. He did not {{disagree with the}} party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would {{get a chance to}} make themselves heard. Gandhi <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the United States was {{completing}} a retreat from Vietnam.

5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons. Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise, he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series' albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form. He <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires, and this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as he felt it was simple to play on. At the same time, the team <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E
5|$|The team {{originally}} {{wanted to}} release the global version at {{the same as the}} Japanese version. However, since they <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> maintain a direct level of control over the development and operation of the title rather than outsourcing it like Square Enix usually does, the global version was delayed by a year. Direct operation allows them to ensure quality and directly take player feedback and reflect it into the service.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E

5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that the}} visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
