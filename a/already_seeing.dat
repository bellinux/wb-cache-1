5|$|In 1929, Hammond married Dorothy Lister, the {{daughter}} of a Yorkshire textile merchant, in a highly publicised ceremony at a parish church in Bingley. They met at a cricket match in 1927 but spent little time together before the wedding, having little in common. When married, they rarely communicated or got on well. Acquaintances believed Hammond treated her badly, particularly once her father lost nearly everything in the Depression, causing them financial worry. She remained loyal, but their relations gradually broke down, even after she sailed to South Africa, joining Hammond on tour in 1939 in an attempt to save the marriage. By that time, he was <b>already</b> <b>seeing</b> his future second wife, Sybil Ness-Harvey, a former beauty queen whom he had met while on tour.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, the {{railroad}} was <b>already</b> <b>seeing</b> signs of decreased ridership: there were 600 daily riders on the Yonkers branch, down from 2,000 daily riders sixteen years prior. The Interstate Commerce Commission gave New York Central Railroad permission {{to abandon the}} branch on November 12, 1942. Subsequently, riders filed a lawsuit to keep the line open, and the federal lawsuit was heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, who {{ruled in favor of}} {{the railroad}} on June 21, 1943. Nine days later, the railroad abandoned the line. By December 1944, the rails were being removed. The main line also saw fewer riders as the years passed, and on March B, 1958, with daily ridership numbering between 400 and 500 commuters, the New York State Public Service Commission gave its approval for the railroad to stop passenger service on the line. The last day of service was June 1, 1958, and the station was abandoned, the line now only being used for freight.|$|E

And since--he had not once thought of her. Not once! The world had indeed vanished. [...] "Do come and see us--Sylvia." [...] The very notion was an irritation. No rest from aching and impatience to be had that way.|$|R
60|$|But {{so it was}} to be; for so {{it ought}} to have been. You, my American friends, delight, as I have said <b>already,</b> in <b>seeing</b> the old places of the old country.

2500|$|The band {{released}} {{their debut}} album Count Your Blessings in October 2006 in the United Kingdom and in August 2007 in the United States. The band rented a house {{out in the}} countryside to write songs but became easily distracted. They then recorded the album in inner-city Birmingham, a process which was infamous for their excessive and dangerous drinking. During the period drummer Nicholls summarised it as [...] "we were out every night, just being regular 18-year-olds." [...] The album was panned by critics, and added to the strongly polarised responses the band were <b>already</b> <b>seeing</b> from the public.|$|E
2500|$|Hartford {{finished}} with a regular season record of 47–29–3–1 {{for a total of}} 98 points in the standings.

[...] Ryan Callahan led the team with 35 goals and 55 points on the season, earning him a spot on the AHL All-Rookie team for the season. [...] By the time Callahan had won the honor, however, he was <b>already</b> <b>seeing</b> 3rd line playing time in the NHL for the Rangers.

6000|$|... 1. Power of Burgundy.--All the {{troubles}} of France, for the last 80 years, had gone to increase {{the strength of the}} Dukes of Burgundy. The county and duchy, of which Dijon was the capital, lay in the most fertile district of France, and had, as we have seen, been conferred on Philip the Bold. His marriage had given to him Flanders, with a gallant nobility, and with the chief manufacturing cities of Northern Europe. Philip's son, John the Fearless, had married a lady who ultimately brought into the family the great imperial counties of Holland and Zealand; and her son, Duke Philip the Good, by purchase or inheritance, obtained possession of all the adjoining little fiefs forming the country called the Netherlands, some belonging to the Empire, some to France. Philip had turned the scale in the struggle between England and France, and, as his reward, had won the cities on the Somme. He had thus become the richest and most powerful prince in Europe, and seemed on the point of founding a middle state lying between France and Germany, his weak point being that the imperial fiefs in Lorraine and Elsass lay between his dukedom of Burgundy and his counties in the Netherlands. No European court equalled in splendour that of Philip. The great cities of Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp, and the rest, though full of fierce and resolute men, paid him dues enough to make him the richest of princes, and the Flemish knights were among the boldest in Europe. All the arts of life, above all painting and domestic architecture, nourished at Brussels; and nowhere were troops so well equipped, burghers more prosperous, learning more widespread, than in his domains. Here, too, were the most ceremonious courtesy, the most splendid banquets, and the most wonderful display of jewels, plate, and cloth-of-gold. Charles VII., a clever though a cold-hearted, indolent man, let Philip alone, <b>already</b> <b>seeing</b> how the game would go for the future; for when the dauphin had quarrelled with the reigning favourite, and was kindly received on his flight to Burgundy, the old king sneered, saying that the duke was fostering the fox who would steal his chickens.|$|E

60|$|He awoke with a start, {{and for a}} {{few moments}} lay vaguely staring at the sunbeams that {{stretched}} across his bed before he could recall himself.

She had been there once <b>already,</b> but <b>seeing</b> him asleep, she had forborne to wake him. Apparently the spectacle of a gentleman lying on the bed fully dressed, even to his boots, was not an unusual one at that hotel, for she made no comment.
