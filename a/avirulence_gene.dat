50|$|A complex {{relationship}} between hypersensitive response and pathogenicity genes, avirulence genes, and plant resistance genes {{gives rise to}} the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Generally, a single <b>avirulence</b> <b>gene</b> (in the bacterium) corresponds to a single resistance gene (in the plant host), giving rise to the concept of a gene-for-gene response. The <b>avirulence</b> <b>gene</b> leads to the pathogen being avirulent, or unable to induce disease on a specific variety of plant hosts, those being the ones carrying the corresponding resistance genes. Soybean cultivars that have been bread to contain resistance genes Rpg1, Rpg2, Rpg3, and Rpg4 {{have been shown to be}} resistant to Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea race 4. The corresponding avirulence genes in the bacterium are avrB, avrA, avrC, and avrD. A different race of Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea may still be able to elicit disease in these soybean cultivars as it may carry different avirulence genes. Researchers have shown that the exchange of avirulence genes can switch a race from being virulent to avirulent and vice versa. Thus, evolution, mutation, and cases of horizontal gene transfer can make it difficult to breed longterm resistance into soybean cultivars.|$|E
50|$|Studied R genes usually confer {{specificity}} {{for particular}} strains of a pathogen species (those that express the recognized effector). As first noted by Harold Flor in his mid-20th century {{formulation of the}} gene-for-gene relationship, a plant R gene has specificity for a pathogen <b>avirulence</b> <b>gene</b> (Avr gene). Avirulence genes are now known to encode effectors. The pathogen Avr gene must have matched specificity with the R gene for that R gene to confer resistance, suggesting a receptor/ligand interaction for Avr and R genes. Alternatively, an effector can modify its host cellular target (or a molecular decoy of that target), and the R gene product (NLR protein) activates defenses when it detects the modified form of the host target or decoy.|$|E

A screen for mutants with altered resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) expressing the <b>avirulence</b> <b>gene</b> avrRpt 2 resulted in the isolation of four susceptible rps (resistance to P. syringae) mutants. The rps mutants lost resistance specifically to bacterial strains expressing avrRpt 2 as they retained resistance to Pst strains expressing the avirulence genes avrB or avrRpm 1.

RPS 2 and RPM 1 confer resistance to strains of the bacterial phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae carrying the avirulence genes avrRpt 2 and avrB, respectively. In these gene-for-gene relationships, it has been proposed that pathogen avirulence genes generate specific ligands that are recognized by cognate receptors encoded by the corresponding plant resistance genes. To test this hypothesis, {{it is crucial to}} know the site of the potential molecular recognition. Mutational analysis of RPS 2 protein and in vitro translation/translocation studies indicated that RPS 2 protein is localized in the plant cytoplasm. To determine whether <b>avirulence</b> <b>gene</b> products themselves are the ligands for resistance proteins, we expressed the avrRpt 2 and avrB genes directly in plant cells using a novel quantitative transient expression assay, and found that expression of avrRpt 2 and avrB elicited a resistance response in plants carrying the corresponding resistance genes. This observation indicates that no bacterial factors other than the <b>avirulence</b> <b>gene</b> products are required for the specific resistance response as long as the <b>avirulence</b> <b>gene</b> products are correctly localized.

40|$|Faculty Mentor: Dr. Walter Gassmann, Plant Microbiology & PathologyPlants {{are exposed}} {{to a wide variety}} of {{pathogens}} including viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes and protozoa. In response plants have developed a plethora of strategies aimed at blocking infection by potential pathogens. One form of induced response is the hypersensitive response (HR), during which cells immediately surrounding the site of infection rapidly die. This interaction between these pathogens and plants is governed by the genetics of both organisms. The genes responsible for deterring infection are called disease resistance genes. In fact, disease resistance genes are employed to specifically recognize pathogens expressing cognate genes (appropriately called the <b>avirulence</b> <b>gene).</b> Historically, this has been explained by the gene-for-gene relationship. This relationship predicts that if the pathogen carries an <b>avirulence</b> <b>gene,</b> which is ìrecognizedî by a specific resistance gene in the plant, a plant resistance response is induced. If either the <b>avirulence</b> <b>gene</b> or the resistance gene is absent, then the pathogen causes disease on the plant. In many cases, control of disease resistance conforms to the gene-for-gene hypothesis. Avirulence genes that specify resistance reactions in Arabidopsis often specify resistance reactions in other plant species. Therefore the project is not only important to the plant sciences world but also immensely valuable for agriculture. For example tomato and soybean lines often show similar disease reactions to Pseudomonas syringae. Thus knowing how these genes work in Arabidopsis will immensely help the cultivators in protecting their crop plants such as tomato and soybeans. My involvement in this project has been in the identification, and mapping of a new disease-resistance gene, RPS 6.

Using genetic and genomic approaches, we investigated the inheritance and molecular determinant of an L. maculans-Brassica rapa incompatible interaction. Single gene control of the resistance was found, while all markers located on the L. maculans minichromosome, absent in the virulent parental isolate, co-segregated with the avirulent phenotype.

Two <b>avirulence</b> <b>genes</b> and one RAPD marker formed one linkage group, in the order Avr 3 a, OPH 4 - 1, Avr 5, each separated by approximately 5 cM. Our results confirm that outcrossing occurred between the parental isolates, and that sexual recombination under field conditions may {{play an important role}} in generating and maintaining genetic diversity in populations of P. sojae...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{characterisation}} of an Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome P 450 -encoding cDNA clone, B 72, preferentially expressed {{during the}} hypersensitive response (HR) provoked by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pathovar maculicola, is reported. The B 72 cDNA clone {{corresponded to the}} CYP 76 C 2 gene, which belongs to a small multigene family comprising four genes. HR-triggering bacteria harbouring different <b>avirulence</b> <b>genes</b> induced the accumulation of transcripts of this P 450 gene. CYP 76 C 2 gene expression was moreover associated with various processes leading to cell death such as leaf senescence, ageing of cell cultures, wounding {{as well as with}} treatment with the necrotising heavy metal salt, lead nitrate...|$|R
