5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell across it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across her hair and on her mantle.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Burzahom's ceramic {{industry}} was mostly of hunting based culture and {{is different from}} the Chinese Neolithic pottery. The economy of the people was found to be based on hunting and gathering with a nascent stage of cultivation practices. Pottery made in Burzahom showed close affinity to those found in the Swat valley in Pakistan, particularly in respect of its shapes and decorations of the black ware pottery. The burial practices <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> tools recovered from the site were inferred as having close resemblance to those found in the North Chinese Neolithic culture.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{is used in}} roofing, currency, and for {{photographic}} technology {{known as}} the daguerreotype. Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty; copper continues {{to be used in}} construction of various types. Copper plating and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary copper production.|$|E
5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|The Diversity {{indices of}} the plant species were recorded; they were a {{richness}} of 48, diversity of 0.29 and evenness of 0.47 in summer. In winter, the respective figures were 81, 0.17 and 0.52. Species richness {{was found to be}} different in 48 samples of thin phumdis, 53 samples of thick phumdis and 14 samples on hard ground. The eight plant communities identified during winter and summer were Capillipedium, Leersia hexandra, Oenanthe javanica, Phragmites karka, Kyllinga triceps, Pteridium aquilinum, Zizania latifolia and Persicaria perfoliata. Zizania latifolia recorded the highest productivity with (13.90±5.01)g/m2 for winter and (102.96±26.03)g/m2 for summer. Greater productivity was recorded in summer (65.96g/m2) than winter (15.76g/m2).

40|$|Algebra is {{a branch}} of {{mathematics}} that deals with symbols and also the rules for manipulating those symbols, which are used to represent numbers and quantities in mathematical formulae and equations. It is needed and used in our everyday lives. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine students’ performance in algebra related to gender <b>and</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> schools. The research sample consisted of 317 students (135 boys and 182 girls) from three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> schools in Malaysia ie; national schools, Islamic-religious schools and boarding schools. Data were collected through an instrument known as the Algebra Achievement Test (AAT), and were then analyzed quantitatively using a two-way ANOVA test. Research findings showed that there were statistically significant main effects for gender <b>and</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> schools towards students’ achievement in algebra. However, no interactional effects were found between gender <b>and</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> schools that could influence the results obtained. It is concluded that gender <b>and</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> schools do effect students' achievement in algebra...|$|R

5|$|The {{arsenal of}} weapons {{includes}} pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, grenades, and throwing knives, among others. Guns have a finite magazine {{and must be}} reloaded after {{a certain number of}} shots, but the player may acquire and carry as many weapons as can be found in each mission. The player's initial weapon in most missions is James Bond's Walther PPK, called the PP7 special issue in-game. Most of the game's firearms are modelled on real-life counterparts (although their names are altered), while others are based on fictitious devices featured in the Bond films, such as the Golden Gun and Moonraker laser. The weapons vary in characteristics such as rate of fire, degree of penetration, <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part they hit.|$|E
5|$|The breed was {{developed}} in Iowa during the early 20th century, beginning with a cream-colored mare named Old Granny. The Great Depression threatened the breed's existence, but several breeders worked to improve the color <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> the breed, and in 1944 a breed registry was formed. The mechanization of farming in the mid-20th century led to {{a decrease in the}} breed's population and the registry became inactive for several decades. It was reactivated in 1982 and population numbers have slowly grown since then. However, population numbers are still considered critical by The Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships among}} stony corals were first {{examined in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. The two most advanced 19th century classifications both used complex skeletal characters; The 1857 classification of the French zoologists Henri Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime’s was based on macroscopic skeletal characters, while Francis Grant Ogilvie's 1897 scheme was developed using observations of skeletal microstructures, with {{particular attention to the}} structure and pattern of the septal trabeculae. In 1943, the American zoologists Thomas Wayland Vaughan and John West Wells, and Wells again in 1956, used the patterns of the septal trabeculae to divide the group into five suborders. In addition, they considered polypoid features such as the growth of the tentacles. They also distinguished families by wall type <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> budding.|$|E

5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current <b>and</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E
