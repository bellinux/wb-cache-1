5|$|After {{the end of}} the Assyrian Empire, Erbil {{was first}} {{controlled}} by the Medes and then incorporated into the Achaemenid Empire before it became part of the empire of <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> Great after the Battle of Gaugamela, which was fought near Erbil in 331 BC. Subsequently, after the partition of <b>Alexander</b> <b>the</b> Great Empire by his generals (known as Diadochoi), the city was called Arabella or Arbela and {{it was part of the}} Hellenistic Seleucid Kingdom. After the 1st c. BCE, the Roman and Parthian Empire fought over control of Erbil, or Arbira as it was known in that period. After the 1st c. AD, Arbela became an important Christian centre. During the Sassanid period, Erbil was the seat of a satrap (governor). In 340 AD, Christians in Erbil were persecuted and in 358, the governor became a martyr after he converted to Christianity. A Nestorian school was founded in Erbil by the School of Nisibis in c. 521. During this period, Erbil was also the site of a Zoroastrian fire temple.|$|E
