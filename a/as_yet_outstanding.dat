40|$|An <b>as</b> <b>yet</b> <b>outstanding</b> goal {{in quantum}} optics is the {{realization}} of fast optical nonlinearities at the single-photon level. This would allow {{for the implementation of}} optical devices with new functionalities such as single-photon switches/transistors 1, 2 or controlled-phase gates 3. Although nonlinear optics effects at the single-emitter level have been demonstrated in a number of systems 4 – 13, none of these experiments showed single-photon switching on ultrafast timescales. Here, we perform pulsed two-colour spectroscopy and demonstrate that, in a strongly coupled quantum dot–cavity system, the presence of a single photon on one of the fundamental polariton transitions can turn on light scattering on a transition from the first to the second Jaynes–Cummings manifold. The overall switching time of this single-photon all-optical switch 14 is ∼ 50 ps. In addition, we use the single-photon nonlinearity to implemen...|$|E
40|$|Relevance: The {{number of}} people {{surviving}} cardiac arrest is increasing. Associated with this, the {{number of people}} surviving with brain injury after cardiac arrest is also increasing. The long-term consequences have been likened to the long-term consequences of other causes of brain injury; which impact on quality of life for the individual and their family several years after the event. Multi-disciplinary rehabilitation is advocated for this patient group, which includes both cardiac and neurological rehabilitation. Brain injury rehabilitation guidelines exclusive to the cardiac arrest population are <b>as</b> <b>yet</b> <b>outstanding,</b> and it is unknown whether existing guidelines for adults with acquired brain injury of any cause, are being routinely applied. Purpose: This survey aimed to explore the current provision of acute NHS rehabilitation for adults with brain injury after cardiac arrest. The main objective was to investigate the extent to which current services met key recommendations from published literature and clinical guidelines, for brain injury rehabilitation. A secondary objective was to determine if there was a difference in adherence to these recommendations between hospital trusts with and without ´heart attack centres´; as increasing numbers of people are being treated in such centres after cardiac arrest. Methods/Analysis: A cross-sectional survey design was chosen, to provide quantitative data. A postal questionnaire was chosen as it would have the advantage of a known denominator population. A questionnaire was sent to each of the 144 acute NHS hospital Trusts in England. One physiotherapist from each trust was invited to respond. Individual guidelines were considered met if they were reported as being met ´always´ or ´almost always´ by respondents. Results: 52 questionnaires were included in the analysis; an overall response rate of 36...|$|E

40|$|The {{calculation}} of the two-loop corrections to the three-jet production rate and to event shapes in electron–positron annihilation requires the computation {{of a number of}} two-loop four-point master integrals with one off-shell and three on-shell legs. Up to now, only those master integrals corresponding to planar topologies were known. In this paper, we compute the <b>yet</b> <b>outstanding</b> non-planar master integrals by solving differential equations in the external invariants which are fulfilled by these master integrals. We obtain the master integrals as expansions in ǫ = (4 − d) / 2, where d is the spacetime dimension. The fully analytic results are expressed in terms of the two-dimensional harmonic Precision applications of particle physics phenomenology often demand theoretical predictions at the nextto-next-to-leading order in perturbation theory. Corrections to this order are known for many inclusive observables, such as total cross sections or sum rules. For 2 → 2 scattering and 1 → 3 decay processes, the {{calculation of}} next-to-next-to-leading order corrections is a <b>yet</b> <b>outstanding</b> task. One of the majo...|$|R

As leader of the Colonial Seamen’s Association and an important ‘class struggle Pan-Africanist’, he was the lynchpin of an anti-colonial maritime network in interwar London. Through his work in the Communist party in the early 1930 s and then in the International African Friends of Ethiopia and the International African Service Bureau, led by George Padmore and C. L. R. James, Braithwaite’s talents as organiser, speaker and writer came to the fore...|$|R
