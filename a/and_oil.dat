40|$|Fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> play a {{prominent}} role in U. S. dietary patterns. Recent concerns over the negative health consequences associated with fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> have led many to suspect structural change in demand conditions. Our analysis considers short run (monthly) demand relationships for edible fats <b>and</b> <b>oils.</b> In that monthly quantities of fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> are likely to be relatively fixed, an inverse almost ideal demand system specification is used. A smooth transition function is used to model a switching inverse almost ideal demand system that assesses short-run demand conditions for edible fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> in the United States. The results suggest that short-run demand conditions for fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> experienced a gradual structural shift that began in the late 1980 s or early 1990 s and persisted into the mid- 1990 s. Although this shift generally made price flexibilities more elastic, differences in scale flexibilities across regimes were modest in most cases. The results suggest that decreases in marginal valuations for most fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> in response to consumption increases are rather small.

40|$|The {{differences}} in intake amount of fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> in the intake ratios of the constituent fatty acids {{are closely related}} to prevention and contraction of the life style related diseases. In the present paper we investigated and analyzed the usage status of fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> for cooking in mass feeding facilities and in the home. This study shows that fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> were used properly in 86 % of cooking in mass feeding facilities and in 72 % in private homes. Twelve types of fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> were used in mass feeding facilities compared with 15 in private homes. Survey results indicate that soybean oil was used most frequently in 88 %of the mass feeding facilities, sesame oil in 76 %, butter in 64 %, margarine in 52 %and rapeseed oil in 32 %. Both olive <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> sesame <b>oil</b> were used most frequently in 48 % of home cooking sites, margarine and butter in 41 %and 40 %, respectively, <b>and</b> both rapeseed <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> corn <b>oil</b> in 38 %. Reasons for selecting cooking fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> in the mass feeding facilities were "good for health" and "adhere to the brand of manufacturer", whereas the home cooking sites specified "good for health" and "in use from a long time ago" as the major reasons. In the selection of fats <b>and</b> <b>oils.</b> their reasonable prices were common considerations. Both the mass feeding facilities and home cooking sites were careful about reasonable prices of fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> for their selection, and also careful about preventing oxidation and deterioration of the oils. A lot of fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> for food are manufactured and sold these days in Japan. A suitable selection of fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> for each dish is required in consideration of harmony with food, cookery and so on.

40|$|Fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> play a {{prominent}} role in U. S. dietary patterns. Recent concerns over the negative health consequences associated with fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> have led many to suspect structural change in demand conditions. We consider short run (monthly) demand relationships for edible fats <b>and</b> <b>oils.</b> In that monthly quantities of fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> are likely to be relatively fixed, we utilize an inverse AIDS specification. Our analysis consists of two components. In the first, we utilize a smooth transition function to model a switching inverse almost ideal demand system (IAIDS) that assesses short-run demand conditions for edible fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> in the U. S. Our results suggest that short-run demand conditions for fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> experienced a rather rapid structural shift in the early 1990 s. Although this shift generally made price flexibilities more elastic, differences in flexibilities across regimes are modest in most cases. Our results suggest that decreases in marginal valuations for most fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> in response to consumption increases are rather small. Scale flexibilities are relatively close to - 1, suggesting near homothetic preferences for fats <b>and</b> <b>oils.</b> An important distinction occurs for lard and tallow, which exhibit a very elastic scale response. This suggests that scale increases in the consumption of edible fats <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> will significantly decrease consumers' marginal valuation of these animal fats. A second segment of our analysis considers dynamic extensions to the IAIDS model that recognize habit effects. Although nested hypothesis testing supports the dynamic specification over the static IAIDS model, price and scale flexibilities are quite similar to the static case.

It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block.
