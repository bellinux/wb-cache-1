40|$|This paper investigates French {{field crop}} farms’ use {{of various types}} of labour during the period 1990 – 2007. We explore the {{determinants}} of {{the three types of}} labour used on farm (family labour, hired labour and contract labour), with a particular emphasis on the impact of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms and subsidies on the three labour types. We estimate a system of three equations, including a censored model, using the French Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) database. We find that hired labour and contract labour are substitutes as expected, but that hired labour and family labour are complements. This may reveal complementarities between management tasks (which are specifically for the farm head and family labour) and technical operations (the only operations performed by hired labour). In addition, we find that, in general, crop <b>area</b> <b>payments</b> and Single Farm Payments (SFP) have reduced farm labour, while agri-environmental <b>payments,</b> Less Favoured <b>Area</b> (LFA) <b>payments</b> and investment subsidies have increased it.

Analyses are based on efficiency calculations with 2001 - 2002 FADN data for fieldcrop farms, and on the same sample’s farmers’ intentions to remain in the sector and to expand their area post EU-accession under two scenarios: a hypothetical scenario of continuing pre-accession national policies, and a realistic scenario of fully decoupled SAP introduction with coupled national top-ups. Our results suggest that, before accession to the EU, the smallest inefficient farms remained in the sector thanks to the policy support. However, the SAP introduction could potentially give the right incentives to Lithuanian farmers for a quicker restructuring and an increase in farm efficiency, although such change may be impeded by the lack of available agricultural land.

40|$|The {{proposals}} for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy within the Mid Term Review of the European Commission fueled {{the discussion about}} the future of direct payments to farmers. The EU Commission recommends a decoupling of animal and <b>area</b> <b>payments</b> from the production by granting these direct payments as a payment claim per hectare of eligible farm land. However, introducing <b>area</b> tied <b>payments</b> the intended shift of payments â€œfrom the produce to the producerâ€ will not take place, but instead an increased transfer of payments to land owners seems likely. This study therefore analyses the impacts of changing the <b>area</b> <b>payments</b> for grand cultures into person-tied payments on the cereals market of the European Union. For the assessment of impacts homogenous natural locations are clustered. The clustering is based on the regional reference yields for cereals and the share of arable land of total agricultural area in different farm types of the regions. For these production locations total production costs for cereals, oilseeds, and protein crops are calculated {{as a function of the}} farm size in order to estimate a cost reduction potential subject to structural changes within agriculture. The main results are the following: 1) Prerequisites are good for the EU to cultivate cereals since a major part of the production is located in highly competitive regions. Thus the EU would remain a net exporter of cereals even producing under world market conditions. However, maintaining the intervention price system while abolishing the set-aside obligation could lead to an uncontrolled increase of cereal stocks. 2) Even on highly competitive locations a significant structural change is required in order to reduce costs and to yield profits without <b>area</b> <b>payments.</b> Depending on the development of the world market prices for cereals the model calculations find a reduction of the work force between 20 000 and 50 000 labor units. 3) Without <b>area</b> <b>payments</b> the profits per hectare and thus the rents would decrease notably and therefore result in a corresponding income loss for land owners. An exclusive granting of payment claims to the producers would in particular affect former farmers, whose rental incomes contribute substantially to their pension plans.

The payment formula {{is based on the}} Jarman underprivileged area index (UPA(8)) and aims at compensating general practitioners for increases in workload. DESIGN [...] Evaluation of the deprived <b>area</b> <b>payment</b> against the stated policy objective with a set of criteria for developing resource allocation formulas. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The degree to which the components of the Jarman index predict the workload of general practitioners; whether construction of the index is sensible and comprehensible; and how the formula incorporates the index and is likely to work in practice. RESULTS [...] The fact that the index relies on census data and the way the weighting was derived means that the formula will not accurately reflect the workload. The use of statistical transformations obscures the original policy intent. There has been no validation to support the application of the index as part of a national policy. The payments are not linked to the quality of service provided and may have the perverse effect of increasing list size. CONCLUSION [...] The formula used as the basis of the deprived area payments is poorly suited to the policy objective of compensating general practitioners for increases in workload.

At 1999 -prices, producing a fixed milk quota with low to moderate yielding cows (6000 to 6600 kg milk annually) is most profitable. Silage offered ad libitum is profitable. A three cut harvesting system is more profitable than two cuts. Changes in the milk price have no effects on production.
