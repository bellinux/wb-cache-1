5000|$|Hendrix biographer John McDermott calls [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'" [...] "a {{powerful}} blues prayer {{based on}} the salvation-train metaphor running through American folklore of every color and faith". A 1897 manuscript by Richard Spurling describes the gospel train as [...] "built by God to carry redeemed sinners safely from this 'wilderness' ... to heaven". The late-1800s spiritual [...] "The Gospel Train (Get on Board)" [...] uses the lyrics [...] "I hear the train a-comin'" [...] and associated songs reference a train station. Hendrix researcher Harry Shapiro adds the song [...] "delves deep into the well of blues history, recalling one of the classic motifs of the genre" [...] and compares it to [...] "Jim Crow Blues" [...] and [...] "Make My Getaway", two earlier blues songs about [...] "escaping trouble, be it political, social or personal". [...] "Jim Crow Blues", recorded in 1929 by Cow Cow Davenport, deals with getting away from racial segregation in an American town:In [...] "Make My Getaway", recorded in 1951, Big Bill Broonzy sings of leaving Arkansas to get over a broken relationship:Biographer Steven Roby sees a parallel in Hendrix's early life that {{is reflected in the}} lyrics for [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'". When he left home at 18, Hendrix departed by train for U.S. Army basic training in California. [...] "Jimi's confusion about leaving those he cared about coexisted with his eagerness to put his nightmarish existence in Seattle behind him", writes Roby. Hendrix's earliest recorded version in 1967 includes the versesAfter an energetic guitar solo, Hendrix announces [...] "Can you dig that, you see me gettin' it together, I'm tryin' to get my heart together that's all" [...] and concludes by singingHe nearly always introduced the song as [...] "Getting My Heart Back Together Again" [...] or [...] "Get My Heart Back Together", the latter of which was used for the first release of the song in 1971. In his August 1970 handwritten notes for the track listing of his proposed fourth studio album, Hendrix listed the song as [...] "Getting My Heart Back Together". It is unknown why it was renamed [...] "Hear My Train A Comin'" [...] for subsequent releases, although Hendrix sometimes introduced songs in concert using alternate names. Occasionally he added a train reference to the song title, such as [...] "Lonesome Train", [...] "I See My Train", and [...] "Waitin' Down at the Train Station". [...] As Hendrix developed the song, he added to the lyrics and included [...] "I'm gonna be a voodoo child", a reference to his 1968 composition [...] "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)". However, he stayed with the same theme and often prefaced his performances with a short commentary, such as at one of his best-known performances in Berkeley, California, in 1970: [...] Here's a story that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> been through ... About a cat runnin' around town and his old lady, she don't want him around {{and a whole lot of}} people from across the tracks are puttin' him down.

It’s somewhat nostalgic, which is the theme for this issue. Issue six takes you through the University of Wollongong’s past 60 years, looks into the effects of BlueScope and where Port Kembla is turning to beyond the steel industry, and gives insight into the horrific cruelty that is, puppy farming.

40|$|The {{last ten}} years have allowed me to mature some {{concepts}} and criteria in relation to malnutrition in the clinical practice. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> devoted all our efforts {{in an attempt to}} take it under control. The results, however, have shown to be insufficient in the clinical practice, because Hospital Undernutrition still persists in our hospitals and in fact, its prevalence is growing due to an ageing population. I think it is necessary to insist in renaming it as Clinical Undernutrition because it not only appears in hospital settings but it is present before and persists even after hospitalization; the latter reinforces the condition by forcing a change in the habits of the patient and the consequences of the treatments. I would also like to sustain that the risk is not caused by the undernutrition in itself but rather in the disruption of the nutritional balance which is a consequence of the aforementioned conditions and which is defined in a term: Trophopathy; that is, a disruption in the trophism or in the normal functioning of the nutritional status. This disruption constitutes the core risk that is associated with clinical undernutrition and the physical consequences of it. The disruption occurs internally and it will play havoc on cellular nutrition, tissues and further. It appears simultaneously in the blood, so it should be searched and detected there as it is the closest possible place to its origin. The new therapeutic procedures make it possible to cure some cases that in the past were impossible to treat. However, this also means increased risks and so requires a strict control to achieve the best results. Both illness and its treatment put homeostasis at risk and they will definitely impact the nutritional balance, being the latter the key objective in order to achieve or restore the healing process and health. Apart from the benefit obtained with the treatment, it is necessary to apply an appropriate nutritional support that will guarantee the least amount of risks which could derive from an imbalanced nutritional status. The use of automated systems to predict and control the risk factors during the clinical phase makes it possible to have a more thorough control of the illness from its origins, allowing an early diagnosis and treatment of it...|$|E
