3000|$|The 10 -item Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross and John, [2003]) {{was used}} to measure an individual’s {{tendency}} to use reappraisal and suppression strategies for emotion regulation. The Cognitive Reappraisal subscale has six items (α[*]=[*]. 79), and <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is “When <b>I</b> want to feel less negative emotion, I change the way I’m thinking about the situation”. The Expressive Suppression subscale has four items (α[*]=[*]. 73), and <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is “I control my emotions by not expressing them”. Participants rated each item on a 7 -point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). In the current study, alpha for the two subscales was [...]. 85 and [...]. 77 respectively.|$|R
3000|$|The {{economic}} perspectives {{promote the}} objective measures of success, that is, {{in terms of}} financial performance and other objectively verifiable economic parameters. On the other hand, there is increasing recognition that subjective measures that {{may not necessarily be}} economic also matter (Baron et al., 2016; Fisher, Maritz, & Lobo, 2014; Staniewski & Awruk, 2018). We, therefore, focus on subjective measures, and specifically, job satisfaction. Job satisfaction is recognized as an effective measure of subjective success, which represents the psychological domain of success (Dijkhuizen, Gorgievski, van Veldhoven, & Schalk, 2016; Staniewski & Awruk, 2018). In the present study, we adopted 11 items from the revised and shortened Minnesota Job Satisfaction Questionnaire (see items in Hirschfeld, 2000) measured on a 5 -point Likert scale (ranging from 1 [*]=[*]strongly disagree to 5 [*]=[*]strongly agree); which yielded a good Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of [...]. 86. <b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is: <b>I</b> am satisfied with the feeling of accomplishment I get from the job.|$|R
30|$|To assess {{self-assessment}} of L 2 writing proficiency, we also {{administered in}} Times 1 and 3 a questionnaire presenting descriptions of real-life tasks and asking students {{to what degree}} they thought each statement fit to their situation {{on a scale of}} 1 to 4 (1 [*]=[*]The description does not fit me at all. to 4 [*]=[*]It fits me well.). For example, <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> says <b>I</b> can coherently write an expository writing such as the one explaining task procedures if I use vocabulary and grammar that are used in a familiar situation (B 1.1 level; Tono, 2013, p. 301). We used Can-Do statements for writing developed by the CEFR-J (Common European Framework of Reference, Japan) project members. This project segmentalized six levels into 12 levels (Pre-A 1, A 1.1, A 1.2, A 1.3, A 2.1, A 2.2, B 1.1, B 1.2, B 2.1, B 2.2, C 1, and C 2) and developed descriptors to each level and skill (Tono, 2013). We used CEFR-J descriptors because they were empirically developed for Japanese learners of English. The survey consisted of 20 items that correspond to A 1.1 to C 2 levels. Students answered the questionnaire after completing Criterion® essays. The results of 20 items were averaged and used for analysis.|$|R
30|$|The MRSQ {{included}} 20 {{items and}} RBI 11 items. The items for both scales {{are presented in}} Appendix A. Both scales used a 5 -point Likert scale. The rating scale for the MRSQ, which measured frequency of strategy use, was specified as follows: I use this strategy 1 -Never, 2 - Rarely, 3 -Sometimes, 4 -Often, 5 -Always. <b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> reads: <b>I</b> make notes when reading in order to remember the information. The rating scale for the RBI, which measured a person’s response to a statement, was specified as follows: My response to this statement: 1 -Strongly Disagree, 2 -Disagree, 3 -Neutral, 4 -Agree, 5 -Strongly Agree. Prior to administering the questionnaire, the researcher met {{with a group of}} five graduate students in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Institute who evaluated the questionnaire for comprehensibility and appropriateness. The suggestions were to include an example question and response and to change GPA to CGPA in the questions. The latter term, used in India, represents a student’s cumulative grade-point average. In order to preserve paper at the IIT, the researcher was encouraged {{to reduce the number of}} questionnaire pages by making the format of the questionnaire more compact. In order to assure the equivalence of the U.S. and Indian formats, an independent experiment was subsequently conducted, comparing mean ratings for both formats. There were no significant differences in students’ ratings related to format for the RBI or MRSQ. Therefore, differences between U.S. and Indian students could not be attributed to the questionnaire formats. A detailed description of the experiment involving formats can be found in an additional file (see Additional file 1).|$|R

3000|$|The 21 -item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21; Lovibond and Lovibond, [1995]) {{was used}} to measure the {{presence}} of negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. The depression subscale measures hopelessness, anhedonia, lack of interest, and <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is “I felt that life was meaningless”. The anxiety subscale is an indication of one’s subjective experience of autonomic arousal and anxious affect, and <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is “I felt I was close to panic”. The stress subscale assesses levels of chronic non-specific arousal such as being easily agitated or irritable, and having difficulty relaxing, and <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is “I found it difficult to relax”. For each item, participants were asked to indicate {{the degree to which the}} statement applied to them over the past week, on a scale of 0 (Did not apply to me at all) to 3 (Applied to me very much, or most of the time). Scores of each of the subscales were calculated by summing the scores of the seven items in each subscale and multiplied by two to obtain comparable scores to the published norms for the DASS. The DASS has been shown to have high internal consistency and temporal reliability (Lovibond and Lovibond, [1995]), as well as good convergent and discriminant validity (Antony et al., [1998]). In the current study, alpha coefficients for the depression, anxiety and stress subscales were [...]. 88, [...]. 80, and [...]. 84, respectively.|$|R

30|$|Networking ability was {{measured}} by the networking ability dimension of Ferris et al.’s (2005) 18 -item political skill scale. Participants were asked to rate their agreement about their networking ability on a 5 -point scale (1 [*]=[*]strongly disagree, 5 [*]=[*]strongly agree). <b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> is “I {{spend a lot of time}} and effort at work networking with others.” Higher scores represent a higher ability in networking.

5000|$|Researchers {{typically}} measure ambivalent sexism at {{the individual}} level. The primary method used to measure an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism is the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), created by Glick and Fiske in 1996. The ASI is a 22-item self-report measure of sexism on which respondents indicate their level of agreement with various statements, which are placed on a 6-point Likert scale. It is composed of two sub-scales that may be independently calculated for sub-scale scores or may be averaged for an overall composite sexism score. The first sub-scale is the hostile sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items designed to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility, as previously defined. <b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> from the hostile sexism sub-scale is [...] "Women are too easily offended." [...] The second sub-scale is the benevolent sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items that aim to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy, as previously defined. <b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> from the benevolent sexism sub-scale is [...] "Women should be cherished and protected by men." ...|$|R

40|$|Starting {{with a set}} of {{weighted}} items, we want {{to create}} <b>a</b> generic <b>sample</b> of <b>a</b> certain size that we can later use to estimate the total weight of arbitrary subsets. For this purpose, we propose priority sampling which tested on Internet data performed better than previous methods by orders of magnitude. Priority sampling is simple to define and implement: we consider a steam of items i= 0, [...] .,n- 1 with weights w_i. For each <b>item</b> <b>i,</b> we generate a random number r_i in (0, 1) and create a priority q_i=w_i/r_i. The sample S consists of the k highest priority items.
