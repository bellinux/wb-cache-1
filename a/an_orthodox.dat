5|$|A {{possible}} {{legend of}} Prince Vladimir was recorded by Branislav Nušić in the 19th {{century in the}} city of Korçë, southeastern Albania, close to Macedonia. Ruins on top of a hill above Korçë were said to be remains of the court of a Latin (Catholic) king, whose kingdom neighbored the state of <b>an</b> <b>Orthodox</b> emperor. The king asked the hand of the emperor's daughter, who agreed to become his wife only if he built <b>an</b> <b>Orthodox</b> church. He did so, and she married him, but on the first night of marriage she killed him. She then became a nun, and the king's body was taken somewhere—he was not buried near his court. Macedonian Slavs inhabiting Saint Achillius Island in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece told of an emperor named Mirče. He lived on their island, where he was killed by a cousin of his out of jealousy, and his body was taken via Ohrid to Albania.|$|E
