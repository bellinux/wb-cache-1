[...] "I didn't want to come here, but when you insisted I did it to oblige you. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> {{considering}} what I took out of some of you on another occasion, it seemed the fair thing.

Acknowledge its {{existence}} at a collective level. To be a true witness to who we are as a people and to what has happened to us. That is the essential challenge for the Caribbean nations—who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> have been annihilated by history and yet who've managed to put themselves together in an amazing way. That's why I thought the book was somewhat hopeful at the end." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 5 April, Martin {{read the}} text of a letter he had {{received}} from MacArthur, dated 20 March, criticizing the Truman administration's priorities {{on the floor of}} the House. In it, MacArthur had written: It seems strangely difficult for some to realize that here in Asia is where the Communist conspirators have elected to make their play for global conquest, and that we have joined the issue thus raised on the battlefield; that here we fight Europe's war with arms while the diplomatic there still fight it with words; that if we lose the war to communism in Asia the fall of Europe is inevitable; win it and Europe most probably would avoid war and yet preserve freedom. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> we must win.

40|$|Plant {{virology}} in Africa Professor Roger Hull, of Norwich, England, {{writes in}} support of the Viewpoint article by Dr M Tresh published in Spore 76 entitled The future of plant virology in Africa. 'I strongly support the need for the enhancement of the input to virology in Africa. One only has to look at the problems in Uganda with ACMV 1 sweeping down from the north and BSV 2 advancing from the south. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> there are three aspects; diagnosis, epidemiology and resistance or control. On the first, I consider that the best approach is for there to be regional diagnostic centres, say southern Africa, eastern Africa and western Africa. Having regional centres overcomes some of the problems of quarantine. These can be set up initially targeted at one crop and then expanded to take in other crops. If they are linked to an industrialised country lab or labs the development of diagnostics can be done by cooperation. The epidemiology is best done by NARS 3 and here, once again, some input from outside the lab is needed. Also, {{there needs to be a}} forum whereby experiences and information can be exchanged on a regular basis - how about an African Society for Plant Pathology? With the increased use of information technology there could also be a website or sites for efficient communication. On control or resistance there is a strong case to be made for the use of transgenic protection against viruses. I have just completed a study on uptake pathways from transgenic rice and it is likely that there will be an initiative for testing RYMV 4 transgenic protection in Africa. So I would support the initial step of having a conference but this needs to have a target. I would suggest that the initial target could be the setting up of an appropriate forum and ad hoc group of people who could advise on how individual countries can benefit from all major advances in tackling their virology problems.

500|$|Law {{professor}} and legal commentator Eugene Volokh commented in 2003 {{that regardless of}} the behavior of real frogs, the boiling frog story is useful as a metaphor, comparing it to the metaphor of an ostrich with its head in the sand. Economics Nobel laureate and New York Times op-ed writer Paul Krugman used the story as a metaphor in a July 2009 column, while <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> that real frogs behave differently. Journalist James Fallows has been advocating since 2006 for people to stop retelling the story, describing it as a [...] "stupid canard" [...] and a [...] "myth". But following Krugman's column, he declared [...] "peace on the boiled frog front" [...] and said that using the story is fine <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> it's not literally true.|$|R

Your magic is but a small thing which seems great because so few can handle it. What miracle is it that makes the flower to grow, the child to be born, the Nile to rise, and the sun and stars to shine in heaven? What causes man to be half a beast and half a god and to grow downward to the beast or upward to the god--or both? What is faith and what is unbelief? Who made these things, through them to declare the purposes of life, of death, and of eternity? You shake your head, you do not know; how then can I know who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> am but foolish?

But <b>as</b> <b>you</b> wisely <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to me, I can’t do that, for {{it would look like}} guilt. If I could have gone to some distant place, I might have found relief in that, but the thing is not to be thought of, for the same reason. Hiding and {{escaping}} would be the construction in either case. It seems a little hard to be so tied to a stake, and innocent; but I don’t complain.’ ...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} a very great benefit to me that we drifted into {{collaboration}} largely in its beginning <b>as</b> an accident-when <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> my mistake over the webs of Drong's tail feather-and the mistake has proved to me well worth while.

"It only remains," [...] {{continued}} Syme quite unperturbed, [...] "to adopt {{some other}} method {{of breaking the}} ice (if I may so express it) between myself and the man I wish to kill. And since {{the course of a}} dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> with such recondite acumen), the only thing to be done, I suppose, is for the one party, as far as possible, to do all the dialogue by himself. And so I will, by George!" [...] And he stood up suddenly, his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea breeze.|$|R

Mr. Grewgious, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> quite fairly said just now, there is such an exceptional attachment between my nephew and me, that I am more sensitive for the dear, fortunate, happy, happy fellow than for myself.

The plants will be in tassel in a few days, and the crop must turn out most beneficent--truly, truly--there is a providence in all things; for, at first, I was for putting the corn on yonder hill-side, and the potatoes here; but old Hiram was led by some invisible agency to insist on this field for the corn, and the hill-side for the potatoes--and, now, look, and see what crops are in promise! Think of a nigger's blundering on such a thing?" ...|$|R
60|$|I take, then, {{this one}} {{institution}} as a test. As every normal man desires a woman, and children {{born of a}} woman, every normal man desires a house of his own to put them into. He does not merely want a roof above him and a chair below him; he wants an objective and visible kingdom; a fire at which he can cook what food he likes, a door he can open to what friends he chooses. This is the normal appetite of men; I do not say there are not exceptions. There may be saints above the need and philanthropists below it. Opalstein, now he is a duke, may have got used to more than this; {{and when he was}} a convict may have got used to less. But the normality of the thing is enormous. To give nearly everybody ordinary houses would please nearly everybody; that is what I assert without apology. Now in modern England (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> eagerly <b>point</b> <b>out)</b> {{it is very difficult to}} give nearly everybody houses. Quite so; I merely set up the desideratum; and ask the reader to leave it standing there while he turns with me to a consideration of what really happens in the social wars of our time.|$|R
6000|$|The second archer, who had {{curly hair}} and was pale, poetical, and rather effeminate, had merely gone {{out into the}} garden {{and stared at the}} moon.

[...] "It is easy to prove it," [...] said the archer with hysterical haste. [...] "Examine the moon through this particularly powerful telescope, and you will no longer find any traces of a man there." [...] The king glued his big blue idiotic eye to the telescope for about ten minutes, and then said, [...] "You are right: <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have often <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> scientific truth can only be tested by the senses.
