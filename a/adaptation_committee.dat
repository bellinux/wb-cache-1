5000|$|The outcome {{document}} of the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development - the Future we Want - {{recognized the need}} to remove barriers to the full and equal participation of women in decision making and management and the need to increase women in leadership positions. A report prepared by UN Women, the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, the Global Gender and Climate Alliance and the UNFCCC recognizes the structural inequalities that impede the representation of women in climate science, negotiations and policies and recommends greater gender balance in the UNFCCC and national delegations. [...] The report argues that the 'challenges of climate change cannot be solved without empowering women' and that women have been marginalized in international negotiations. It reports data that show weak representation of women in the institutions of the UNFCCC including the <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Committee</b> (25%), the GEF Council (19%) and the Expert Group (15%) and that overall women constitute less than 20% of delegation heads and less than 30% of delegation members at UNFCCC conferences.|$|E
40|$|Similar {{to other}} Western countries, {{approximately}} nine per cent of Australians aged over 65 {{are living with}} a dementia and for those aged over 85 the prevalence rate rises to up to 30 per cent. As the ageing population increases, the prevalence of dementia will increase (Guideline <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Committee,</b> 2016). It is doubtless an important healthcare issue. In the past 10 years, since the Australian Government published its first National Framework for Action on Dementia and the nomination of dementia as a National Health Priority, dementia care has achieved never imagined improvements. Dementiaspecific research and educational initiatives by the Dementia Collaborative Research Centres and Dementia Training Study Centres achieved unprecedented hope for consumers, family carers and clinicians about the new opportunities to improve the wellbeing {{and quality of life}} of individuals living with a dementia, and their family carers...|$|E

40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007, 2012 : 11) {{warned that}} the mega deltas in South Asia (e. g. the Ganges Brahmaputra Meghna River Basin) will be at great risk due to {{increased}} flooding, and the region's poverty would reduce {{the capacity of the}} inhabitants to adapt to change. This paper provides a "bottom up" impact approach which focuses on a methodological contribution for assessment of vulnerability and adaptation (V & A) in a riverine flood-prone area, "Islampur" in Bangladesh, where various impact assessment guidelines have been taken into consideration. In this study the evaluation of V & A assessments at community level has been accomplished mainly by a weighted matrix index value derived from two participatory rapid appraisals (PRAs). Based on the distribution pattern of various weighted value indices of V & A issues, the required adaptation techniques can be adopted for immediate policy-making, and appropriate actions should be undertaken through establishing community-based <b>adaptation</b> <b>committees</b> (CBAC).

30|$|Early on {{developed}} countries {{made it clear}} that such a mechanism should be subsumed by other institutional arrangements within the Convention such as the Cancún Adaptation Framework, Nairobi Work Programme or <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Committee.</b> Australia’s position on this was made clear at COP 17 : “Australia considers that the work programme under the Cancún Adaptation Framework provides a solid foundation for supporting action on adapting to loss and damage suffered {{as a result of the}} adverse impacts of climate change” (Australian Government 2011, p. 1). Norway then reinforced this position at COP 19 : “approaches to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change remains an integrated part of the Cancún Adaptation Framework” (Norwegian Government 2013, p. 1). Other major {{developed countries}} were strongly opposed to a separate mechanism and argued for it to be placed under the Cancún Adaptation Framework, or similar existing arrangements in the Convention.|$|E
40|$|The Durban {{agreements}} {{provide a}} mandate with which all greenhouse-gas emitting countries will {{commit to a}} common UN legal regime {{as early as possible}} but no later than 2015. Country parties also agreed that the new deal will take effect no later than 2020. For the first time, major emerging economies have agreed to negotiate a legal arrangement to reduce their national greenhouse gas emissions. EU 2 ̆ 7 s Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard notes that 2 ̆ 2 outcome with legal force 2 ̆ 2 is unclear consensus language but at least uses the term legal, an improvement over the Bali Roadmap. The new Green Climate Fund (GCF) has been established and can facilitate the dispersal of funds to poor countries. One of the areas still in need of work involves making substantial sums of money available now that the Green Climate Fund has been operationalized. The recommendation to raise funding via international shipping fees on carbon emissions was not retained in the final text. The new Climate Technology Centre and Network is well positioned to greatly enhance the diffusion of pro-poor, ecosystem based, environmentally sound technologies. The Climate Technology Centre and Network can help coordinate Green Climate Fund financing to share R 2 ̆ 6 D as well as existing mitigation and adaptation technologies. The annual Durban Forum is tasked with tracking capacity-building progress. The new <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Committee</b> is tasked with coordinating distribution of Green Climate Fund financing to low-income country adaptation measures, many of which will depend upon environmentally sound technology. Now that the Technology Mechanism is being established, low-income parties can develop and submit project proposals. These developments increase the ability of countries to cooperate to reach Cancun commitments agreed to last year, building upon innovative funding through the Green Climate Fund and adaptation coordination through the <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Committee.</b> Energy and ingenuity are core to bringing the Durban agreements to life. While we still struggle to agree on what constitutes a timely and robust response to climate destabilization, innovation is fueling common ground upon which to build multilateral trust. Discussing the TRIPS / UNFCCC nexus on technology transfer can help close the 6 - 11 gigaton(ne) greenhouse gas gap. Retaining trust needs to go beyond postponing controversy. Addressing Intellectual property rights is within political reach and should be addressed in an open and inclusive manner. It appears that the Global Environment Facility (GEF) will support the operationalization and activities of the technology mechanism. It remains important to provide a framework for innovation hubs that ensure “environmentally sound” technology transfer. Life cycle analysis, capacity building, and cultural sensitivity can become central discussions. Knowledge portals can share best practices may through on-line uploading/downloading of innovations. This can help spread environmentally sound distributed power, battery innovation, rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation, culturally sound solar cookers and a wide array of other environmentally sound technologies. In addition to online clearinghouse capacity building, a network of innovation centers to facilitate diffusion of climate friendly innovations can now become a reality through the new Technology Mechanism. Taking Stock – we are still on track for an unacceptable 3 to 4 °C rise in average world temperatures. Much remains to be done to get on track to limit average global temperatures to the political target of 2 or the scientific target of 1. 5 °C. To address the urgency chasm, actions need to occur at every level and at a much greater pace. Among these actions, countries can strengthen pledges, implement strict emission accounting procedures that address carry-over and double counting. It is important to realize that the journey is still a long one but to celebrate the significant international legal accomplishment set forth in Durban. The alliance among the EU, small island states, and least developed countries began to melt China, India, US frozen stances. Key emitting countries are now working together to flesh out a single legal arrangement to bring down greenhouse gasses. Innovation development, demonstration, and diffusion can help further enhance trust and close the emissions gap. While a political breakthrough, the success of the Durban agreement rests upon the ability of the international community to ramp up funding in order to accomplish both form and content – pledges and action. Poor countries within the G 77 reached out beyond larger emerging economies, encouraging major emerging economies to take on mitigation commitments. Collectively developing countries insisted Kyoto not end at an African gathering. The Kyoto Protocol has been extended, without Canada, Japan and Russia but including the newly listed greenhouse gas called nitrogen trifluoride that is used in semiconductor manufacturing. The EU conditioned extending the Kyoto Protocol upon launching new negotiations toward a comprehensive legal arrangement. Japan, Australia, Canada, Russia and the US insisted that a new agreement include major developing countries commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Durban Platform encompasses this diplomatic agreement. It is officially known as the 2 ̆ 2 Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action 2 ̆ 2 and has begun to be referred to as AG-DP. Another highly debated issue was included, namely to allow carbon capture and storage projects in the Clean Development Mechanism program under the Kyoto Protocol. A portion of these credits would be set-aside in a reserve given the uncertainty regarding carbon capture. The details of project reporting as well as national appropriate mitigation action reporting continue to be worked out. Forestry discussions are also still underway. Countries agreed to increased transparency and accountability via detailed guidelines for biennial emissions reporting, subject to expert review and formal consultation among countries. Developed countries and funding institutions are to submit assistance strategies. Countries are also continuing efforts to enhance shared understanding of the water / climate nexus. Doing so can help achieve effective, reasonable, and equitable (1) mitigation, (2) adaptation, (3) environmentally sound technology diffusion, and (4) funding. Climate adaptation and mitigation measures are to be coordinated with nationally defined development to achieve genuine sustainable development. The international community is now tasked with meaningful follow through on commitments agreed to in the Durban agreements...|$|E
40|$|The late 1970 s {{design for}} the Rosie Maternity Hospital on the Addenbrookes campus in Cambridge is a {{recurring}} type across the UK National Health Service, a framed three-storey courtyard configuration in brick masonry. It was selected {{as a case study}} project for the ‘Design and Delivery of Robust Hospitals in a Changing Climate’ project, pursuing the methodology developed for that research. Temperature data were collected in representative spaces within the hospital, over a two-year period. These revealed overheating in mild conditions relative to an observed 24 C threshold for sleep but concealed within the customary 28 C threshold marking the upper limit of acceptable conditions. The building was modelled using current climate data to predict 2010 conditions. The model was then calibrated against the observed 2010 data and used to predict the likely internal temperatures in current and 2030 s. The results indicated an increase in peak temperatures. Four adaptive intervention schemes were subsequently developed: an ‘enlightened’ industry standard ‘Passivhaus’-type option providing superinsulation, sealed glazing and heat recovery; a lower technology-based scheme promoting natural cross-ventilation by providing greater opening glazing area, opening up the plan, sunshading and additional insulation; an enhanced natural ventilation scheme glazing over the courtyards to provide supply air winter gardens, and an advanced natural ventilation option pursuing passive downdraught cooling. All four schemes were modelled using the projected current and 2030 s weather data and their performance was compared. The schemes were fully costed to yield relative ‘value for money’ guidance to National Health Service Trusts. Practical application: The Heat wave Plan for England 2014 warns National Health Service (NHS) organisations of the risks to patients, particularly the very young, the elderly and the seriously ill, from extreme summer heat events. 1 The Chief Medical Officer in her introduction challenges each NHS locality to plan well in advance of hot spells, as appropriate. This paper describes the likely extent of overheating risk and a series of potential adaptation plans for a recurring NHS hospital building type.
