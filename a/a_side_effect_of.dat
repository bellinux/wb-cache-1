5|$|<b>A</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> Baldwin's tour of Wales was {{the implied}} {{assertion}} of royal authority {{in a section}} of Henry's domains that had always been somewhat fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over the Welsh bishops, especially when he {{made a point of}} celebrating mass at every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate mass at St Asaph's Cathedral. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince who refused to appear before him and take the cross, Owain Cyfeiliog.|$|E
5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put {{together}} into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider that they had <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects {{on the development of}} science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E

5|$|Later, Allison {{acquired}} a 2 MeV Van de Graaff generator, and he recalled an old paper on producing lithium ions from minerals like Eucryptite. This {{allowed him to}} produce a 1.2 MeV lithium ion beam. He created hitherto unknown isotopes of boron and other light elements, and measured their neutron capture cross sections. <b>A</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> this work was a method to analyze surface materials where chemical analysis was unavailable. His colleague Anthony L. Turkevich subsequently used this to analyze {{the makeup of the}} Moon on the later Surveyor program missions. Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> testosterone replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use.

5|$|During the North American {{localization}} of Pokémon, a small {{team led}} by Hiro Nakamura went through the individual Pokémon, renaming them for western audiences based on their appearance and characteristics after approval from Nintendo Co. Ltd. In addition, during this process, Nintendo trademarked the 151 Pokémon names {{in order to ensure}} they would be unique to the franchise. During the translation process, it became apparent that simply altering the games' text from Japanese to English was impossible; the games had to be entirely reprogrammed from scratch due to the fragile state of their source code, <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the unusually lengthy development time. Therefore, the games were based on the more modern Japanese version of Blue; modeling its programming and artwork, but keeping the same distribution of Pokémon found in the Japanese Red and Green cartridges, respectively.|$|E
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), {{and the quality of}} eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E

5|$|The first {{science fiction}} magazine, Amazing Stories, {{appeared}} in 1926. By {{the end of}} the 1930s, the genre was flourishing in the United States, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several magazines. In the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active US magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 just four years later. Galaxys appearance in 1950 was part of this boom. According to sf historian and critic Mike Ashley, its success was the main reason for a subsequent flood of new releases: 22 more science fiction magazines appeared by 1954, when the market dipped again as <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> US Senate hearings into the putative connection between comic books and juvenile delinquency.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields {{when it is}} active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can {{be large enough to}} detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E
5|$|Eichengrün sent ASA to Dreser's {{pharmacology}} {{group for}} testing, {{and the initial}} results were very positive. The next step would normally have been clinical trials, but Dreser opposed further investigation of ASA because of salicylic acid's reputation for weakening the heart—possibly <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the high doses often used to treat rheumatism. Dreser's group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: diacetylmorphine (which the Bayer team soon branded as heroin because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengrün, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, went directly to Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low-profile trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production. Dreser wrote {{a report of the}} findings to publicize the new drug; in it, he omitted any mention of Hoffmann or Eichengrün. He would also be {{the only one of the}} three to receive royalties for the drug (for testing it), since it was ineligible for any patent the chemists might have taken out for creating it. For many years, however, he attributed Aspirin's discovery solely to Hoffmann.|$|E

5|$|In October 1939, {{conscription}} {{was introduced}} to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF. From January 1940, all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service. While a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds or because they would suffer financial hardship if forced to enter the military, the remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service. <b>A</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> this arrangement {{was the creation of}} two different armies with different conditions of service, one the part-volunteer part-conscript Militia and the other the all-volunteer AIF. This situation resulted in administrative and structural problems that existed throughout the war, as well as a sometimes bitter professional rivalry between the men of the two forces. Later, provision was made to allow Militia units to transfer to the AIF if sufficient numbers of personnel volunteered to serve under AIF terms of service. This required 65 percent of a unit's war establishment—or 75 percent of its actual strength—to volunteer and allowed whole battalions {{to become part of the}} AIF.|$|E
