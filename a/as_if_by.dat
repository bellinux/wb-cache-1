5|$|Forster's main interest, however, {{was again}} {{focused on the}} social {{behavior}} of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on {{he was to be}} a confident opponent of the ancien régime. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the Storming of the Bastille, he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne, that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with pastel work than with oil painting.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images of military power {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski likens the memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even leans back against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> a great weight. At the same time, the sheer size of the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense of strength and power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense of masculinity that pervades the work, from the phallic image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E

5|$|The miraculous {{story of}} the first known parishioner of the town, Bricstan, is {{documented}} in the Historia Ecclesiastica by the Chronicler Orderic Vitalis (1075 – c.1142). According to the legend, Bricstan was a pious free tenant from the town who had joined the monastery at Ely Cathedral in 1115 to begin training as a monk. However, {{he was accused of}} theft and imprisoned in London. The legend recounts that one night he had a vision of Saint Etheldreda coming towards him, and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> a miracle, his heavy chains fell from him and he was shackled no longer. When he awoke from his dream, he discovered that this was indeed true and he was free of his chains. The wife of Henry I, Matilda of Scotland, heard of the miracle, and she assured herself that he was no rogue or thief, issued a writ of pardon and declared him a free man.|$|E

25|$|The {{cinematic}} {{effects of}} anime differentiates {{itself from the}} stage plays found in American animation. Anime is cinematically shot <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that {{would be difficult to}} produce in reality. In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first; this can cause lip sync errors in the Japanese version.|$|E
25|$|He acted promptly. On {{the evening}} of 18 August, all the {{officers}} whom {{he thought he could}} trust received secret instructions to assemble in the great square facing the arsenal on the following morning. At ten o'clock on 19 August, Gustav mounted his horse and rode to the arsenal. On the way, his adherents joined him in little groups, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> accident, so that {{by the time he reached}} his destination he had about 200 officers in his suite.|$|E

25|$|I {{was well}} placed at table between {{one of the}} Miss McGillivray's and a singular-looking person of about fifty. He was plainly dressed, quiet, and observant. His figure was short and compact, and his black hair was worn long all round, and cut square, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> one stroke of the shears, just above the eyebrows. His {{complexion}} was of the gardener's ruddy brown, while the expression of his deeply-furrowed features was friendly and intelligent, but his cut-short nose gave him an odd look. His speech betrayed the Welshman, although he left his native hills when very young. I might have been spared this description of Mr David Thompson by saying he greatly resembled Curran the Irish Orator...|$|E
25|$|After beating Mars Bar in a foot {{race and}} goading him into {{crashing}} Piper's birthday {{party at the}} McNabs' house, Jeffrey is homeless again. He moves back into the buffalo pen, and runs for miles every morning before Two Mills wakes up. Before long, Mars Bar starts running with him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> coincidence, and they never {{say a word to}} each other. One day they come across a hysterical Piper McNab, who frantically leads them to Russell, stuck on the trolley trestle where Jeffrey's parents died. He walks away silently, nearly unconscious and stunned by fear, while Mars Bar rescues Russell, becoming a hero in his eyes. Jeffrey retreats once again to the buffalo pen, where Mars Bar leads Amanda to it. She brings him to her house in a huff, with Jeffrey and Mars Bar following her.|$|E
25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E

On 26 August, the princess departed from the Janelas Verdes palace, where she lived, and traveled to the island of Madeira.

500|$|As well as distortion, rock musicians {{have used}} audio feedback, which is {{normally}} undesirable. The use of feedback was pioneered by musicians such as John Lennon of The Beatles, Jeff Beck of The Yardbirds, Pete Townshend of The Who, and Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix {{was able to}} control feedback {{and turn it into}} a musical quality, and his use of noise has been described as [...] "sculpted - liquid and fire expertly shaped in mid-air <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> a glass blower." [...] Other techniques used by Hendrix include distortion, wah, fuzz, dissonance, and loud volume.|$|E

500|$|The {{piece is}} called [...] "Blueprint for a Landscape" [...] and {{consists}} of a dark-blue landscape of things being blown around <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> an incoming train. A New York Times reporter described it as [...] "fragmented images of scaffolding, birds, chairs and leaves, digitally collaged." [...] Another piece, in simple blue-and-white colors, consists of depictions of billowing sheets of paper. The work also serves the practical purpose of helping navigation, as the sheets are more closely packed together near the exits than {{in the middle of}} the station. The work features familiar objects—sheets of paper, scaffolding, birds, trees, and foliage—caught up in a whirlwind. Each entrance features a different shade of blue and a blueprint-style vector line design, a visual theme that is integrated with the architecture.|$|E
500|$|On 25 July, the {{battleship}} was sunk by the underwater nuclear test BAKER at Bikini Atoll. Unattentuated by air, the shock was [...] "transmitted directly to underwater hulls", and Arkansas, only 250yards from the epicenter, {{appeared to have}} been [...] "crushed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> a tremendous hammer blow from below". It appears that the wave of water from the blast capsized the ship, which was then hammered down into the shallow bottom by the descent of the water column thrown up by the blast. Decommissioned on 29 July, Arkansas was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 August. The ship lies inverted in about 180 feet of water at the bottom of Bikini Lagoon and there are many pictures of the wreck on the National Park Service website.|$|E
500|$|Other symbols, images, and allusions that {{appeared}} throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly. Moore mentioned that [...] "he whole thing with Watchmen {{has just been}} loads of these little bits of synchronicity popping {{up all over the}} place". Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic, citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl's airship. In a book of the craters and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the Galle crater, which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue. Moore said, [...] "We found {{a lot of these things}} started to generate themselves <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>by</b> magic", in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the [...] "Gordian Knot Lock Company".|$|E
