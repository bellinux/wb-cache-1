If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what remains is like a small <b>artichoke</b> <b>heart</b> that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make kōuka, a bitter {{vegetable}} available at any time of the year. Kōuka is delicious as a relish with fatty foods like eel, muttonbirds, or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef.

50|$|In the US, large globe {{artichokes}} are frequently prepared by removing all but 5 - 10 mm {{or so of}} the stem. To remove thorns, which may interfere with eating, around a quarter of each scale can be cut off. To cook, the artichoke is boiled or steamed.

40|$|Soluble peroxidases (SP), and ionically (IBP) and covalently (CBP) bound peroxidases were {{extracted}} from leaves and edible part of <b>artichoke</b> heads (<b>heart).</b> The peroxidase (POD) forms showed a characteristic electrophoretic pattern; in particular SP and IBP forms showed {{nearly the same}} pattern, while CBP was quite different. Several basic and acid POD isoforms were present in SP and CBP forms, whereas in IBP only basic components were found. The thermal stability of different POD forms was tested at different temperatures (70, 80, 90 and 100 °C). The leaf POD forms showed greater heat stability compared to the head ones. The heat sensitivity of three POD forms was different: the bound forms were characterized by a greater heat stability than the soluble form.
