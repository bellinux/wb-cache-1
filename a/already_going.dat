5|$|Originally, {{when the}} Wii U console was first {{shown at the}} E3 2011 in Los Angeles, Namco {{announced}} that they would develop a Tekken game for the Wii U, which was untitled at the time. However, at E3 2012, {{it was announced that}} Tekken Tag Tournament 2 would come to the Wii U, which was <b>already</b> <b>going</b> to come to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Tekken Tag Tournament 2: Wii U Edition is amongst the first third-party Wii U games that is available in both retail and as a downloadable format for the Nintendo eShop. In Japan, the downloadable version is available for a slightly lower price than the retail format.|$|E
25|$|JR begins {{drinking}} {{again and}} slips into depression. He is, however, {{able to recover}} from the relapse and reconcile with Babe. Months later, he and Babe are closer again, and are more about raising their son together while not being romantically intertwined with each other. But during a snowday with Babe and Little Adam, JR suggests to Babe that she keep the idea of them as lovers open for consideration. Having enjoyed her recent time with JR, Babe accepts his request. Still perplexed by Richie, she talks with him at times, her concern more directed at {{the fact that he has}} leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. His sister, Annie, is thought to be the best candidate to be his donor, and Babe is determined to convince her to save him. But her efforts are revealed hopeless when test results show that Annie is not a good donor match for Richie after all. The revelation comes that someone else in Pine Valley is the perfect bone marrow match for Richie. With the help of her mother, Babe discovers that JR is the match. Feeling that he will not donate the bone marrow on his own due to his hate for Richie, she decides to entice JR during a runway where she wears a sexy red dress. Once she gets his attention, she propositions him with a game of strip poker. If she wins, he will have to save Richie's life. If JR wins, he can have anything he wants in regards to her. The deal is made, and JR and Babe play for the prize at Babe's home. Both half naked by the time the game nears an end, it is JR who wins. But he surprises Babe with the news that he already knew he was a match for Richie, and that he was <b>already</b> <b>going</b> to help him. Babe is intrigued by this new, softer side of JR, and JR mentions to Babe how they both want each other. They embrace, and the two make love.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, former cyclist Davide Cassani {{claimed in}} a YouTube video that Fabian Cancellara {{had used a}} {{motorized}} bike during his victories at the Tour of Flanders and the Paris–Roubaix that year. In the video, Cassani showed a normal road bike on a stand and after he pressed a button, the pedals began to rotate. Cassani then alleged that a motor could easily be stowed in the seattube of the bike and the button {{to turn it on}} would be located on the handlebars. In the YouTube video, Cassani showed clips of Cancellara at the two races allegedly [...] "turning on" [...] the motor while riding and showing the drastic increase in speed. The claims caught steam since rumors were <b>already</b> <b>going</b> around about riders possibly using the new motor, the Gruber Assist, which could produce 100 Watts of power to aid the rider.|$|E

50|$|Sporadic {{fighting}} had <b>already</b> been <b>going</b> {{on since}} late 2007, after the insurgents had been routed from Diyala. In early 2008, however, al-Qaeda {{wanted to make}} it clear that they could still fight effectively in Iraq.|$|R

500|$|On February 12, 2012, Lil' Wayne {{said that}} Christina Milian had joined Young Money, and will release her fourth album through Young Money Entertainment. The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's <b>already</b> <b>going</b> to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all I have to do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Missouri {{applied for}} {{statehood}} first in 1818 various proposals for boundaries were put forth including a western boundary {{at the mouth}} of the Nodaway River about [...] west and the mouth of the Rock River (Illinois) opposite Rock Island, Illinois. [...] Missouri was <b>already</b> <b>going</b> to be the largest state in area when it entered the Union and there was concern about making it even bigger. [...] Sullivan was a delegate to the convention that was to ultimately declare the boundaries to be the two lines he had drawn.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{according}} to Iorga, Buzdugan was <b>already</b> <b>going</b> through a [...] "taming" [...] process, and warned the Romanians that Russian radicals were plotting a coup. While {{on the front}} lines, he helped {{save the life of}} the Romanian officer and fellow writer Camil Petrescu. On April 10, he attended the Bessarabian Schoolteachers' Congress, presided upon by Alexandr K. Schmidt and comprising educators of all nationalities. There, he agitated in favor of a split, calling on Romanian teachers to form their own [...] "cleanly Moldavian" [...] congress, and supporting the idea of intensive courses to formalize and standardize their language. He advocated the introduction of the Latin alphabet, to replace Cyrillic everywhere, including in zemstva schools. In May, with such autonomist goals in mind, Buzdugan, Pântea and Anton Crihan founded the newspaper Pământ și Voe, styled [...] "Organ of the Moldavian Socialist Revolutionary Party". Additionally, together with the playwright Sergiu Victor Cujbă, he founded a people's university and a peasants' theater.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, {{firearms}} (both {{legally and}} illegally held) {{were used in}} 18% of suicides. Some consider this a problem {{and would like to}} see stricter firearms legislation.

2500|$|Several critics {{noticed that}} the new album sounds {{different}} from Zola Jesus' earlier works. [...] "I just wanted to try out new ways to produce and different ways to write. And with this new record it's a lot more stripped down and there are way more acoustic elements as opposed to no acoustic elements. [...] I just wanted more breathing room, so people could insert their own experiences into the song, their own feelings into the song, as opposed to me forcing it on them with the densest sound possible", Danilova explained. Speaking to Prefix Magazine after her performance at the Pitchfork Music Festival, {{she said she wanted}} the album to be a step forward. [...] "n doing that, there was so, so much trial and error and so much quitting music {{at the end of the}} day", she admitted. Danilova said that the title of the album (meaning [...] "moving forward" [...] in Latin) appeared before the work on it began. [...] "I had it in mind beforehand because I knew that's what I was going through even before I sat down to work on the record, I was <b>already</b> <b>going</b> through that emotional process of trying to push myself", she said.|$|E

60|$|Wyllard {{said that}} he {{proposed}} doing so as he had a watch {{and one or two}} other mementoes that they might like to have, and when she told him how to reach Dufton Holme by a very round-about railway journey he supposed it lay somewhere in the dale to which he <b>already</b> purposed <b>going.</b> Then she turned to him again.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Austin, decisively. [...] "I'm {{far enough}} from where I'm <b>going</b> <b>already,</b> and one would {{scarcely}} fancy {{that there are}} many facilities for getting about in this country." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He's not shamming," [...] {{said the}} doctor, {{cautiously}} raising his knee; [...] "and I'll hold him."

60|$|There was {{but little}} fighting, however, for {{there were only}} ten or twelve pirates on either side, as their main force was {{distributed}} between the batteries and the ships. They were therefore very easily driven off, five or six of them being killed and the rest flying with all speed towards their village, where those who had escaped from the batteries were <b>already</b> <b>going</b> off in boats to the ships. The two midshipmen therefore returned to the schooner.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} the Hall they found {{that all of the}} others had come in, and that {{preparations}} were <b>already</b> <b>going</b> forward for the feast in the evening. For once Captain Putnam and George Strong, his main assistant, were going to allow the cadets to have their own way. Secretly the captain was tremendously pleased over the showing his pupils had made on the football field, for this happened to be a year when college athletics were in the ascendancy in all of the States.|$|E

60|$|These {{orders were}} {{delivered}} in a low, rapid voice. The men proceeded at once to obey them. At the same time Antoine and his comrade swung themselves down the cliffs, and were instantly lost to view. The young porter, whom he had named Rollo, was <b>already</b> <b>going</b> down the mountain at a smart run, and Jacques was on the ice-slope wielding his axe with ceaseless energy and effect, while Lawrence held the rope {{to which he was}} attached, and descended the rude and giddy staircase behind him.|$|E
60|$|Snowballing was <b>already</b> <b>going</b> on, and {{the white}} balls were flying in all directions. Dick had his hat taken off by Frank, and in return filled Frank's ear with snow. Tom and Fred got into a regular war at close quarters, {{and in the end}} Tom threw his {{opponent}} flat and stuffed snow down his neck. But then Larry came up with a huge cake of snow and nearly smothered Tom, and then a dozen leaped in, and a good-natured melee resulted, lasting {{for the rest of the}} playtime.|$|E
6000|$|... "I glanced up, {{and there}} sure enough, about half-way down the mountain, nearing the first fortification, the long-plumed double line of Nala's warriors was rushing down to battle, {{the bright light}} of the morning glancing on their spears. Afterwards we {{discovered}} that the reason of their delay {{was that they had}} been stopped by a river in flood, and could not reach the mountain crest by dawn. When they did reach it, however, they saw instantly that the fight was <b>already</b> <b>going</b> on, was 'in flower,' as they put it, and so advanced at once without waiting to light signal-fires.|$|E

500|$|LeMond was {{supported}} by his teammate George Mount, who observed, [...] "What's LeMond going to do?

LeMond made a good move and a good sprint...Boyer was not going to win that race. The best he could have got was fifth or sixth place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{very polite}} young gentleman {{at the box}} office sent us each a bunch {{directly}} we started work yesterday.

60|$|I {{could not}} but {{understand}} her {{to refer to}} Mr. Quale, the young gentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday. I was saved the disagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada coming up at a round pace, laughing and asking us if we meant to run a race. Thus interrupted, Miss Jellyby became silent and walked moodily on at my side while I admired the long successions and varieties of streets, the quantity of people <b>already</b> <b>going</b> to and fro, the number of vehicles passing and repassing, the busy preparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping out of shops, and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly groping among the swept-out rubbish for pins and other refuse.|$|E
60|$|As soon {{as all the}} English were in the boat, {{and well}} {{provided}} with necessaries, we felt at more liberty to move about the ship, and exert ourselves in taking care of her. The man at the wheel could {{keep an eye on}} the enemy,--the Dawn steering like a pilot-boat. Neb was sent aloft, to do certain necessary duty, and the top-gallant-sails being loose, the clew-lines were overhauled, and the sails set. I did this more to prevent the English ship from suspecting something wrong, at seeing a vessel running off, before the wind, under such short canvass, than from any desire to get ahead, since we were <b>already</b> <b>going</b> so fast as to render it probable we should pass the other vessel, unless we altered our course to meet her.|$|E
60|$|Each {{bought her}} own ticket at the {{entrance}} to Weasel Park. And each, as she laid her half-dollar down, was distinctly aware of how many pieces of fancy starch were represented by the coin. It was too early for the crowd, but bricklayers and their families, laden with huge lunch-baskets and armfuls of babies, were <b>already</b> <b>going</b> in--a healthy, husky race of workmen, well-paid and robustly fed. And with them, here and there, undisguised by their decent American clothing, smaller in bulk and stature, weazened not alone by age but by the pinch of lean years and early hardship, were grandfathers and mothers who had patently first seen the light of day on old Irish soil. Their faces showed content and pride as they limped along with this lusty progeny of theirs that had fed on better food.|$|E
2500|$|After Pettyfer {{completed}} filming Stormbreaker, he did {{not discuss}} the film with anyone at his school, citing {{the advice of his}} Stormbreaker star Ewan McGregor, who told him to keep his personal and professional lives separate. Pettyfer subsequently decided to leave school and concentrate on his film career, while studying drama at college, saying that [...] "When you have <b>already</b> experienced <b>going</b> out and working in the real world, and you come back to school, you just see it as a playground and you don't want to be there any more".|$|R
6000|$|Tony smiled curiously. “It {{is quite}} plain to me <b>already.</b> I’m <b>going</b> {{to stay here}} and see the affair through with you; then when the insurgents will let you go you’ll come with me, if it’s only for a week or two, and tell Violet that you have forgiven me. In the {{meanwhile}} Craythorne and my agent will take better care of Northrop than ever I could do. There is another point you don’t seem to have remembered. I should almost certainly be made a prisoner by the Spaniards if you sent me away.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I b'lieve it's {{going to}} rain," [...] said Cousin Sophia. [...] "We {{have had an}} awful lot of rain this fall <b>already.</b> It's <b>going</b> to make it awful hard for people to get their roots in. It wasn't so in my young days.

Gertrude Oliver answered it. [...] "Yes--what? What? Is it true--is it official? Thank you--thank you." ...|$|R
