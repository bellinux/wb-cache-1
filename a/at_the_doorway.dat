5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be seen for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doorway</b> of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a demon, the Slasher of Veils, while experimenting with inter-dimensional travel. Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room imbued with virtue. However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room. Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> to gain entrance.|$|E

25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E
500|$|In Hindu temples, Ganesha is {{depicted}} in various ways: as an acolyte or subordinate deity (...) as a deity related to the principal deity (...) or as the principal deity of the temple (...) , treated similarly to the highest gods of the Hindu pantheon. As the god of transitions, he is placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of many Hindu temples {{to keep out the}} unworthy, which is analogous to his role as Parvati’s doorkeeper. In addition, several shrines are dedicated to Ganesha himself, of which the Ashtavinayak (Sanskrit: अष्टविनायक; lit. [...] "eight Ganesha (shrines)") in Maharashtra are particularly well known. Located within a 100-kilometer radius of the city of Pune, each of the eight shrines celebrates a particular form of Ganapati, complete with its own lore and legend. The eight shrines are: Morgaon, Siddhatek, Pali, Mahad, Theur, Lenyadri, [...] Ozar and Ranjangaon.|$|E
500|$|... {{enough to}} make Capper scream. At {{some point during the}} week Pook and Leigh called at the house and were shown Capper, blindfolded and gagged, tied to the bed. By this time, Capper had been lying in her own urine and feces for several days and was placed in a bath {{containing}} concentrated disinfectant and scrubbed with a stiff brush with sufficient force to remove skin. Pook then used pliers to extract two of her teeth, which police later found at his house [...] "like some kind of macabre trophy." [...] Dudson said: [...] "I was stood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> with Jeanie [...] and Bernie [...] Cliff [...] took her gag off. He told her to open her mouth. He said: 'Right, I'm going to rip your teeth out'. He started hitting her teeth with the pliers. He got the pliers on and started pulling it out. But it just snapped and chipped. Then he hit them a few more times. He put the pliers on again and really, really pulled. He pulled Suzanne's head forward until there was a snap and he had the tooth in the pliers. He did the same again and he was laughing." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} {{consisted of}} one large room whose roof {{was supported by}} four stone columns with bell-shaped bases. Parallel to the inner walls of this room ran a stone bench, interrupted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways.</b> <b>The</b> outside walls, made of broad mud block, were bedecked with frequent niches. Each of the three walls, on the east, west, and south, had a very large stone doorway. A pair of massive bulls secured the western entrance; two Lamassu in the Assyrian style, albeit, of colossal proportions, stood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>doorway.</b> Engraved above {{each of the four}} colossi is a trilingual inscription attesting to Xerxes having built and fulfilled <b>the</b> gate. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> on <b>the</b> south, opening toward the Apadana, is the widest of the three. Pivoting devices found on the inner corners of all the doors indicate that they must have had two-leaved doors, which were possibly made of wood and covered with sheets of ornamented metal.|$|R

Now Granny Fox has very keen ears, oh, very keen ears, and she heard just what she hoped she would hear. She heard Danny Meadow Mouse running along one of his little tunnels under the snow.|$|R

They are similar in design with the {{apartment buildings}}, although many have projecting window bays. All of the double houses are two stories high, and many feature front porches.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} famous of this type of clock is the Old-Town Hall clock in Prague, Czech Republic. It is also known as the Prague orloj. The central portion was {{completed}} in 1410.

On the hour there is a presentation of statues of <b>the</b> Apostles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> above <b>the</b> clock, with all twelve presented at noon.
