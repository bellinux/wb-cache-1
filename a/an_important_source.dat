5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> {{of food for}} fish and other aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E
5|$|Another ice {{famine in}} 1870 then {{impacted}} both Boston and the Hudson, with a further famine following in 1880; {{as a result}} entrepreneurs descended on the Kennebec River in Maine as an alternative source. The Kennebec, along with the Penboscot and Sheepscot, was widely opened up for the ice industry, becoming <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source,</b> particularly in warm winters, {{for the rest of}} the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E

5|$|Capybaras are farmed {{for meat}} and skins in South America. The meat is {{considered}} unsuitable {{to eat in}} some areas, while in other areas it is considered <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> of protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation {{to allow it to}} be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As well as <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> {{of food for}} humans in poor arid regions the crop {{can also be used}} as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E

Agriculture picked up, and the railway system became <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> of income as well. Reitz was instrumental in the modernisation of farming, propagating new techniques and a scientific approach to the prevention of plagues. Here Reitz showed himself the agriculturalist and model farmer his father had been before him.|$|E
5|$|In late 1911, Atangana voyaged to Germany {{to teach}} Ewondo at the Colonial Institute of the University of Hamburg.

5|$|In {{the areas}} in which it was endemic, the emu was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> of meat to Aboriginal Australians.

5|$|It is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>source</b> of {{renewable}} energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power.

Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.|$|E
