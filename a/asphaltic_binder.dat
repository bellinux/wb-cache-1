40|$|Bottom ash is the {{principal}} waste stream fro m the combustion of municipal solid waste (MSW). It is comprised of grate ash (97 %), the slag material discharged {{at the end of}} the grate system and grate sffting (3 %), the material that melts or falls through the grate structure. This project was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of using municipal solid waste grate ash as an aggregate substitute in the construction of a pavement binder course for a portion of Rt. 3 in Laconia, New Hampshire. The research was conducted over a two year period during 1993 and 1994. This study is the culmination of an earlier two year characterization study between 1990 and 1992 that documented the physical and environmental characteristics of the bottom ash as it was produced at the Concord, N. H. waste-to-energy (WTE) facility and used in an <b>asphaltic</b> <b>binder</b> course. Together, these two studies provide a complete evaluation of the potential for using grate ash or bottom ash in asphalt binder course or as recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) in base courses in pavements...|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{modified}} asphalts (PMA) {{and warm}} mix asphalts (WMA) are technologies widely {{adopted in the}} paving industry. The first one is well established, while the second one is relatively new, but rapidly growing since it guarantees economic and environmental advantages. Until now PMA and WMA have been used disjointedly, {{but it would be}} useful to combine them to keep the advantages of both. One of the adopted solutions to obtain a warm effect is the addition of waxes to the <b>asphaltic</b> <b>binder.</b> Therefore, a ‘‘warm mix polymer modified asphalt’’ may be potentially obtained with a ternary asphalt/polymer/wax system. However, the final warm effect and performances of the binder will depend on the interactions between the three components. A preliminary investigation was done by mixing asphalt, styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer and a wax chosen among the following three categories: paraffinic, partially oxidized and maleic anhydride functionalized. The morphological and calorimetric analyses and solubility tests allowed identifying different behaviors depending on the wax type, which may preferentially interact either with the asphalt or with the polymer, thus influencing the whole binder structure. With regard to the ternary mixes, it was found that: (i) the paraffinic wax preferentially resides in the polymer- rich phase, and slightly enhances the asphalt-polymer compatibility; (ii) the partially oxidized wax prefers the asphaltene-rich phase and reduces the compatibility; (iii) it is not clear where the functionalized wax is located, but it has a considerable compatibilizing effect and strongly alters the colloidal equilibrium of the asphalt-polymer blend.

40|$|O ligante asfÃltico brasileiro oriundo de petrÃleo do Campo Fazenda Alegre (CAPFA), no estado do EspÃrito Santo, foi modificado por polÃmeros (SBS e EVA) e aditivos (Ãleo extensor, cal hidratada e LCC). As principais caracterÃsticas estruturais deste ligante puro e modificado foram analisadas utilizando-se de mÃtodos espectromÃtricos (RMN e FTIR), anÃlise tÃrmica (TGA, DSC) e microscÃpica (AFM). Os polÃmeros e aditivos foram caracterizados atravÃs da termogravimetria e calorimetria exploratÃria diferencial e por espectroscopia no infravermelho. O ligante asfÃltico modificado por polÃmeros e aditivos, e os efeitos reolÃgicos resultantes desta modificaÃÃo, tambÃm foram avaliados. A metodologia aplicada foi dirigida, principalmente, para a avaliaÃÃo das propriedades constitutivas dos materiais, utilizando-se de ensaios reolÃgicos baseados em especificaÃÃes Superpave. Os parÃmetros investigados visaram a avaliaÃÃo de problemas usuais como: deformaÃÃo permanente, trincas tÃrmicas e oxidaÃÃo. O envelhecimento oxidativo dos asfaltos foi avaliado a partir da anÃlise dos espectros no infravermelho e de ressonÃncia magnÃtica nuclear, alÃm da variaÃÃo de parÃmetros reolÃgicos. A estabilidade tÃrmica do CAPFA (puro e modificado) e dos asfaltenos foi analisada atravÃs de curvas termogravimÃtricas. Esta estabilidade parece ser influenciada pelas reaÃÃes secundÃrias de decomposiÃÃo e/ou oxidaÃÃo dos produtos e resÃduos formados. Foram separadas as duas principais fraÃÃes constituintes do ligante asfÃltico: os asfaltenos (17, 1 %) e maltenos (82, 9 %). O cÃlculo da massa molar dos asfaltenos atravÃs da osmÃmetria e GPC apresentou valores muito prÃximos (5963 e 6653 g/mol). Imagens do ligante obtidas atravÃs do uso da tÃcnica de microscopia de forÃa atÃmica (AFM) mostram a coexistÃncia de uma fase rica em asfaltenos em equilÃbrio. Imagens (AFM) do ligante quando modificado por polÃmero sugerem que parte da fraÃÃo maltÃnica Ã absorvida pelo polÃmero. O efeito mais significativo da incorporaÃÃo de polÃmeros ao asfalto Ã a melhoria da elasticidade. HÃ uma forte correlaÃÃo entre a resistÃncia Ã deformaÃÃo a alta temperatura e o G*. Para o ligante asfÃltico modificado verificou-se um aumento significativo no G* em baixas freqÃÃncias, onde a rede dos polÃmeros SBS e EVA Ã particularmente dominante, e um pequeno decrÃscimo no G* em freqÃÃncias mais altas. Observou-se tambÃm uma diminuiÃÃo na tan &# 948; e isto indica que ocorreu a formaÃÃo de 8 uma rede polimÃrica que proporciona ao ligante um carÃter elÃstico em temperaturas mais elevadas. A adiÃÃo dos polÃmeros SBS e EVA ao CAPFA proporcionou um aumento da rigidez e da elasticidade do ligante, mas, dentre as misturas asfÃlticas produzidas, observou-se que, antes e apÃs o envelhecimento, o ligante quando modificado por EVA e cal hidratada apresentou a maior rigidez, e quando modificado por SBS apresentou a maior elasticidade. A susceptibilidade relativa Ã temperatura das misturas asfÃlticas medida atravÃs da energia de ativaÃÃo de fluxo, mostrou que as misturas contendo EVA se degradam menos do que aquelas que contÃm SBS, uma vez que no polÃmero EVA nÃo existem duplas ligaÃÃes butadiÃnicas que se oxidam facilmente, como no caso do SBS. Os aditivos presentes nas misturas com o polÃmero EVA tambÃm contribuÃram para esta menor sensibilidade Ã temperatura, uma vez que a cal hidratada reduz o envelhecimento da mistura asfÃltica atravÃs da interaÃÃo com compostos polares reativos presentes no ligante e o LCC ser um {{excelente}} antioxidante. Quanto Ã estabilidade Ã estocagem do asfalto modificado por SBS, parece ocorrer a âquebraâ da estrutura coloidal polÃmeroasfalto em freqÃÃncias elevadas. The Brazilian {{asphalt binder}} from Fazenda Alegre oil reserve (CAPFA) {{in the state}} of EspÃrito Santo, was modified by polymers (SBS and EVA) additives (oil extensor, hydrated lime and LCC). The main structural characteristics of this pure and modified binder were analyzed using the spectroscopic methods (RMN and FTIR), thermal analysis (TGA, DSC) and through microscopy (AFM). The polymers and additives were characterized through thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy. The <b>asphaltic</b> <b>binder</b> modified by polymers and additives, and the resulting rheological effects of this modification, were also evaluated. The methodology that was applied was oriented mainly towards the evaluation of the constitutive properties of the materials, using rheological tests based on the Superpave specifications. The parameters investigated aimed the evaluation of the usual distresses such as: permanent deformation, thermal cracking and oxidation. The oxidative ageing of the asphalt was evaluated from analysis in the infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as the variations of the rheological parameters. The thermal stability of the CAPFA (pure and modified) and of the asphaltenic was analysed through the TG curves. This stability looks as if it is influenced by the secondary reactions of decomposition and/or oxidation of the products and residuals that have been formed. The two main constituent fractions of the <b>asphaltic</b> <b>binder</b> were separated: the asphaltenic (17, 1 %) and maltenic (82, 9 %). The calculation of the molar mass of the asphaltenic by osmometry and GPC demonstrated very similar values (5963 and 6653 g/mol). Images of the binders obtained through the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) show the coexistence of a rich phase in asphaltenic in equilibrium. Images (AFM) of the binder while modified by a polymer suggest that part of the maltenic fraction is absorbed by the polymer. The most significant effect of the polymer incorporation to the asphalt was the improvement of the elasticity. There is a strong correlation between the deformation resistance at high temperature and G*. For the modified asphalt binder, a significant increase was noted in G* in lower frequencies, where a network of the polymers SBS and EVA are particularly dominant, and a small decrease on G* in higher frequencies. It was also observed a decrease in the tan &# 948; and this indicates that the formation of a 10 polymeric network, which gives the binder an elastic stability at higher temperatures, has occurred. The addition of SBS and EVA to the CAPFA lead to an increase of the hardness and the elasticity of the asphalt binder, but among the asphaltic mixtures produced, it was observed, before and after ageing, that the binder modified by the EVA and the hydrated lime demonstrated a higher stiffness and the binder modified by the SBS demonstrated a higher elasticity. The susceptibility relative to the temperature of the asphalt mixtures measured through the flow activated energy, demonstrated that the mixtures containing EVA degrade themselves less than those that contain SBS. This happens {{due to the fact that}} there is no butadiene double bond in the polymer EVA that easily oxidizes, like in the case of the SBS. The additives present in the mixtures with the EVA polymer also contributed to a lower sensitivity to the temperature, once the hydrated lime reduces the ageing of the asphalt mixture through the interaction with the reactive polar molecules present in the asphalt binder and CNSL it is an excellent antioxidant. In regards to the stability of the storage of the modified asphalt by SBS, apparently occurs a âbreakâ of the colloidal polymer-asphalt structure in higher frequencies...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{previous}} works on polymers and regular bitumens, a new method {{for determining the}} molecular weight distribution (MWD) of <b>asphaltic</b> paving <b>binders,</b> using the phase angle (´) of the complex modulus measured in the linear viscoelastic domain, has been developed in this paper. MWDs of pure petroleum bitumens, natural bitumens, modified bitumens and arti-ficially aged bitumens are calculated by this method and compared with MWDs obtained by gel permeation chromatography. The two methods give comparable results, but the ´-method developed here is {{more sensitive to the}} molecular weight of species. This method is very simple to implement, and seems a powerful tool in the determination of MWD of bitumens, in the visualisation and repartition of modifiers in the bitumen matrix and in the ageing monitoring and quantification...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversityThe {{self-healing}} {{properties of}} viscoelastic asphalt materials {{have been widely}} recognized among pavement researchers which can result in extended service life of asphalt pavements. The study of asphalt healing has mainly fallen into two categories: (1) study the phenomenological behavior of healing and the factors that affect healing; and (2) study the fundamental mechanisms of healing. This research evaluates the self-healing properties and mechanism of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>binders</b> from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. It starts with the visualization of the healing phenomena using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and then studies the fracture healing properties of asphalt binders during damage-healing process. When asphalt binder is subjected to cyclic loading, deformation and fracture may develop simultaneously until fatigue failure. Also, healing (of fracture damage) may happen {{in conjunction with the}} recovery of viscoelastic deformation, making the analysis of healing complicated. To characterize the fracture healing properties of asphalt materials, this study presents an analytical method to evaluate the evolution of strain component caused by deformation and fracture during a fatigue process, and separates the contribution of viscoelastic recovery and fracture healing during a rest period. Applying the proposed methodology, the effect of two popular Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) additives (Sasobit/Evotherm) on fracture healing properties of asphalt binders is studied. Furthermore, the molecular investigation of healing mechanism is followed using the open-source code software LAMMPS (Large−scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). The mechanism of diffusion is investigated and found that healing increases with the temperature. Different models are built to study the effect of crack width on healing. The increased mechanical properties (density, bulk modulus, etc.) of the systems after healing determined in Molecular Dynamics simulation substantiates the mechanical fundamentals of the healing phenomena as found in macroscale evaluation. This research will provide significant contribution to the advancement of the healing study by recognizing the fracture healing of asphalt binders and developing preliminary study of healing mechanism using molecular dynamics simulation.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the suitability of utilizing dune sand as a paving construction material in hot desert-like areas of the world, where regions of sand dunes exist. The high availability, low cost, and excellent physical properties of the current surplus of elemental sulfur and the benefits given to <b>asphaltic</b> <b>binders</b> by sulfur raises the possibility of using sulfur in asphalt mixes to produce stable mixtures with locally obtainable dune sand. Characterization of various sulfur-asphalt-dune sand mixtures for highway construction were made. The materials used in this investigation were elemental sulfur, AR- 4000 (60 - 70 pen.) asphalt, and dune sand from Yuma, Arizona. The main variables include (a) proportion of sulfur and asphalt in the binder, (b) amount of binder in the mixture, (c) curing temperature, (d) test temperature, and (e) mixing techniques. The various mixtures were prepared by the one-wet mixing cycle technique. Similar dune sand mixtures with asphalt only were evaluated for comparison purposes. The different mixes were evaluated by the Marshall method, tensile strength tests (double punch), compression tests (standard and immersion), flexural tests (standard), dynamic modulus tests (double punch), and microscopic examinations of sulfur-asphalt binders and sulfur-asphalt-dune sand mixtures (thin sections). Preliminary characterizations of the various mixes were made on the basis of their Marshall stability, flow, density, and air void contents. Other engineering properties such as tensile strength, compressive strength, modulus of rupture, dynamic modulus, and microscopic studies were determined for selected mixes. The results consistently indicated that the sulfur-asphalt-dune sand mixes exhibited superior engineering characteristics and performance as compared to similar mixes without sulfur. The overall conclusion drawn from this study is that the dune sand which is not normally accepted for use as aggregate in asphaltic mixtures, can be used with the utilization of sulfur-asphalt binder systems to produce paving mixtures with compatible or better engineering properties in comparison to conventional asphaltic concretes...|$|R
