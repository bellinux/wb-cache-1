40|$|<b>Clod</b> {{crushing}} is <b>a</b> principal {{problem with}} soils of high clay content. Therefore, {{there is a}} need for determining the conditions for clod breaking and clod crushing.

Furthermore, the purpose was to determine the relationship between the specific energy requirement for clod crushing in the function of soil plasticity and the soil moisture content by the means of the developed tool and machine. The main result of the experiments is summarized in a 3 D diagram where the specific energy requirement for soil clod crushing is given in the function of the moisture content and the plasticity index for different clay soils...|$|R
