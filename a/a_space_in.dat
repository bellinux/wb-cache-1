John Nash eventually completed a design that saw Carlton House turned into two blocks of houses, with <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> between them. The building is still owned by the Crown Estates and leased by the Society; it underwent a major renovation from 2001 to 2004 {{at the cost of}} £9.8million, and was reopened by the Prince of Wales on 7 July 2004.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called Pylons. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon is to provide <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> which the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term pylon derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm {{that the relationship between}} the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Williamson {{offered his}} {{apartment}} in Kingston as <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> which gay Jamaicans could meet roughly every fortnight. In the early 1990s he purchased a large property on New Kingston's gentrified Haughton Street, converting part of this building into a gay nightclub that he called Entourage. Many of those who attended the club worked in the city's foreign embassies. Although the police tried to close it down, the club remained open for two years until Williamson was attacked by a patron carrying a knife, which was used to slash Williamson's arm. Although same-sex sexual relations between men were illegal in Jamaica, Williamson was openly gay.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{regarding}} {{moves to}} the Premier League came to nothing. By October, Žigić had appeared just once for Valencia, in the UEFA Cup, and an opportunity arose to join his former club, Racing Santander, on an emergency loan. This depended on the league allowing Racing to release Luis Fernández on medical grounds, because of a degenerative condition of his knee, thus freeing up <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> the first-team squad. The LFP's medical committee decided that the condition was not yet clearly career-ending, so any agreement with Žigić had to be held over until the January 2009 transfer window. In the meantime, he played in four more cup matches for Valencia, two domestic and two UEFA, and scored in three of them, but took no part in the league campaign.|$|E

Conversely, given <b>a</b> uniform <b>space</b> <b>in</b> the uniform cover sense, the supersets of ⋃{A × A : A ∈ P}, as P ranges over the uniform covers, are the entourages for <b>a</b> uniform <b>space</b> as <b>in</b> the first definition.

In 1930 the forest was made a scenic reserve, and the lake was purchased by the government from a Ngāti Raukawa farmer in 1981 and added to the reserve.|$|E

To ensure <b>a</b> <b>space,</b> <b>in</b> 1947, ABC submitted five applications for television station licenses, one for each market where it owned and operated a radio station (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Detroit). These applications all requested for the stations to broadcast on VHF channel 7, as Frank Marx, then ABC's vice-president of engineering, thought that the low-band VHF frequencies (corresponding to channels 2 through 6) would be requisitioned from broadcasting use and reallocated for the U.S. Army.|$|E

The church rented <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> a {{storefront}} location, but was forced to move due to zoning regulations, another incident that helped to shape his view of government overreach. The church rents a room at a Chesapeake hotel, where Jackson preaches every Sunday. Jackson founded Chesapeake's annual Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast, now in its 14th year.|$|E
25|$|Historically the forint was {{subdivided}} into 100 fillér (comparable to a penny), although fillér coins have been rendered useless by inflation {{and have not}} been in circulation since 1999.

The abbreviation for the fillér was f, also written after the number with <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> between.|$|E
25|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame, the material representation of <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> dialog with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those which may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
