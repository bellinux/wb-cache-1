It’s almost like being on LSD, but worse. It’s not good. You never want May out of control. You don’t {{want her to be}} paranoid." [...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power and I respect her. I understand that she’s going in the same direction I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> find these things out." ...|$|E
500|$|Britain's {{involvement}} in this {{became one of the}} most controversial parts of its Empire's history, and damaged its reputation in the Middle East for generations. According to historian Elizabeth Monroe: [...] "measured by British interests alone, [...] one of the greatest mistakes in [...] imperial history." [...] The 2010 study by Jonathan Schneer, specialist in modern British history at Georgia Tech, concluded that because the build-up to the declaration was characterized by [...] "contradictions, deceptions, misinterpretations, and wishful thinking", the declaration sowed dragon's teeth and [...] "produced a murderous harvest, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on harvesting even today". The foundational stone for modern Israel had been laid, but the prediction that this would lay the groundwork for harmonious Arab-Jewish cooperation proved to be wishful thinking.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Lil X on the weekend of July 4, 2010 in Los Angeles. [...] Minaj took to her Twitter, asking fans who {{they would like to}} see portray her love interest in the video. Minaj was interviewed on the set of [...] "Your Love" [...] by MTV News while wearing a pink and purple kimono as a geisha for the video. In the interview, Minaj said, [...] "We wanted to have geisha themes, samurai themes, stuff like that. I wanted to tell a love story. It's just kinda liking a guy, where he's not really for you to like — the forbidden fruit — and me and this other girl happen to like him <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to war." [...] The video premiered July 21, 2010 on MTV.com. Actor Michael Jai White portrays Minaj's love interest in the video.|$|E

500|$|Actor Gabriel Luna {{said that}} Robbie Reyes chose {{to work with}} Daisy Johnson after the last episode because [...] "I respect her power and I respect her. I {{understand}} that she’s going {{in the same direction}} I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> find these things out." [...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else. Now ... Gabe voices her very fear".|$|E

In Shadow of Obsession, Grayson remarks, [...] "The whole world is just a plaything to Darius." [...] Darius despises mortals : [...] "They are born, they love, they fight, they die - <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on." [...] Darius is nevertheless a beloved general. He [...] "always understood what his men needed - he knew them better than they knew themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guns N' Roses headlined the Friday {{night at}} Reading Festival 2010 and closed Leeds Festival two days later. Guns N' Roses was 58 minutes late {{coming on to}} the stage, and because of a curfew issued by Reading Council the band's set ended at midnight. The band was {{therefore}} not able to complete its set, but nevertheless attempted to play [...] "Paradise City" [...] without amplification while the audience sang along. Rose orchestrated fan frustration toward the organizers, telling fans that the group would not play at the Leeds Festival. However, two days later the band played the final night of the Leeds Festival, coming onto stage 30 minutes late, and cutting part of the encore, with Rose stating to the crowd, [...] "We come here to play for you but the cops and the promoters wanna fuck us in the ass. We would like to play a few more songs for you but we'll just play one." [...] During a concert on September 1, in Dublin, the band was over an hour late arriving on stage. Rose stopped the band {{in the middle of}} the second song, [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] after multiple bottles were thrown on stage, warning the crowd [...] "One more bottle <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> home. It's up to you. We would like to stay. We want to stay. We want to have some fun." [...] After another bottle was thrown, the band left the stage during the fourth song of the set. The band returned to the stage an hour later to finish the show.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with USA Today, Azalea talked about {{the concept of the}} music video, mentioning Spears's signature dance scenes, [...] "I think Britney's identity is really embedded in being a dancer, and that's something she really wanted to do as well. So there's a lot of dancing in the video, but I wouldn’t say it's necessarily centered around that." [...] When asked about the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candids from the video shoot, she explained that it would have a narrative and stated that Britney wanted to do a video where she got to dress up and play a character. Azalea revealed she looked to actress Geena Davis when modeling her style, describing her as [...] "the ultimate '80s pin-up hot, cool type of girl" [...] that Britney also liked. Spears added, [...] "I had called my manager and had some ideas about doing a Valley girl-type video. It was really kind of funny, because I had just watched Clueless on TV, and was like, 'It would be so fun to do something like that.' Then I saw Iggy's video, and I thought, 'Oh my God, to work with her would be heaven sent.'" [...] They brainstormed the concept for the video, deciding on a send-up of 1988 sci-fi comedy Earth Girls Are Easy, which starred Davis. Spears said, [...] "I do a makeover for her <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to a club. The best part about it was just us coming together with the clothes and doing the '80s haircuts. We were all about being characters, so it was kind of funny for us. We weren't taking ourselves so seriously".|$|E
