5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same <b>acoustic</b> <b>conditions,</b> and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} influence of room acoustic variations on listener loudspeaker preferences in multichannel audio reproduction, {{and the extent to}} which listeners adapt to the room acoustics. Listener preferences among 4 different 5 -channel loudspeaker systems were observed in 4 different virtual listening rooms via a binaural room scanning (BRS) measurement and playback system. To study room acoustic adaptation, 2 groups of listeners evaluated identical stimuli according to 2 different trial blocking schemes, termed either the successive or the intermixed treatment. In the successive treatment condition, the loudspeakers were evaluated under a given room <b>acoustic</b> <b>condition</b> before moving to the next block of trials, under a different room <b>acoustic</b> <b>condition.</b> In the intermixed treatment condition, the loudspeakers were evaluated under a different room <b>acoustic</b> <b>condition</b> on each trial within a given block of trials. Although loudspeaker preferences did not differ between these two different trial-blocking schemes, there was a significant influence of room acoustics on loudspeaker preferences. The room acoustic variation to which listeners were exposed also significantly influenced the observed patterns of loudspeaker preferences. These results can be summarized simply as follows: The most reflective listening room produced the lowest overall preference ratings, and also enabled listeners to report the largest differences in loudspeaker preference. It was also found that experienced listeners were more discerning of loudspeaker effects, whereas less experienced listeners were more influenced by room effects. The results indicate that both listening experience and room acoustics significantly influence how listeners formulate loudspeaker preferences...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} sea background noise (the acoustic environment of the offshore aquaculture system) and onshore aquaculture system's ambient noise on welfare of gilthead sea bream juveniles (Sparus aurata). In particular primary, secondary (biochemical and haematological indexes) and tertiary (growth performances) stress responses were evaluated. The experiment lasted 120 days during which two different playlists of acoustic stimuli were projected inside six experimental tanks (each condition was replicated in three tanks). Offshore aquaculture noise conditions were recreated as the typical acoustic field in proximity of an offshore sea cage for fish farming using a random sequence of quiet sea background and boat noises. The acoustic field inside an onshore open concrete tank for fish farming represented the onshore aquaculture noise conditions. The other three tanks were used as a control <b>condition</b> without <b>acoustic</b> projection. The weights and lengths of fish exposed to offshore aquaculture noise were higher than the specimens in the control and onshore aquaculture groups. Moreover, higher levels of serum cortisol, glucose, red blood cell count, haematocrit value and haemoglobin content {{and lower levels of}} white blood cells were recorded in fish groups from the control and onshore treatments. Reactive Oxygen Metabolites (ROMs) and Total Antioxidant Capacity (TACs) of fish exposed to the boat <b>acoustic</b> <b>condition</b> after 40 days showed a significant increase compared to those of fish of control group. After 80 days lower values of TACs were recorded in the boat <b>acoustic</b> <b>condition</b> compared to control and on-shore aquaculture <b>acoustic</b> <b>condition.</b> These results allow us to hypothesise that offshore aquaculture noise and the sea soundscape in particular positively influence growth performance and could reduce stress and improve the welfare of the sea bream. ...|$|R
