5|$|When the Munich town {{administration}} {{developed a}} constitution of its council, <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> {{was necessary for}} the purposes of asserting the authenticity of town-council documents. Appearing on a document of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has a picture of a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. The monk as a sole heraldic figure can be found on <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> dating from the year 1304, and on flags of the city since the middle of the 14th century. Colourful representations of the town's coat of arms stem from the 15th century.|$|E

50|$|The {{union of}} <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> couple is {{regarded}} as valid only if both individuals have kept their religious commitments and followed LDS teachings.

5|$|In any case, the {{succession}} of Nyuserre seems to have gone smoothly. <b>A</b> <b>seal</b> bearing both Nyuserre's and Menkauhor's names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre's mother Khentkaus II. A further seal {{is believed to have}} both Nyuserre's and Djedkare's names on it, Djedkare Isesi being Nyuserre's second successor. Taken together these seals reveal that, at the very least, Menkauhor and Djedkare did not perceive Nyuserre as an antagonist.|$|E
5|$|Other highly {{specialized}} feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous {{compared to the}} animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp.

5|$|Plans {{for the new}} Prospect Park Zoo, {{prepared}} by Aymar Embury II, were announced in March 1934.

Architect Embury designed a half circle of six brick buildings centered on <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> pool.

5|$|The {{originality}} of {{this document}} remains {{a matter of}} debate. Hans K.

Interpreter Walter Deeters says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that the document {{was intended to be}} read. Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that the document is not the original as it lacks <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> and the lines are unusually shaped.|$|E

5|$|Heralds {{could have}} {{attributed}} to Jesus the harp for arms inherited as {{a descendant of}} David. Nevertheless, the cross was regarded as Christ's emblem, {{and it was so}} used by the Crusaders. Sometimes the arms of Christ feature a Paschal lamb as the principal charge. By the 13th century, however, numerous indulgences had brought increased veneration for the instruments of the Passion. These instruments were described in heraldic terms and treated as personal to Christ much as a coat of arms (Dennys, 96). An early example in <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> from c. 1240 includes the Cross, nails, lance, crown of thorns, sponge and whips.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{coats of}} {{arms of the}} U.S. states {{date back to the}} {{admission}} of the first states to the Union. Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of ratification of the United States Constitution, many of the original colonies referred to themselves as states shortly after the Declaration of Independence was signed on 4 July 1776. Committees of political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers of the Articles of Confederation, Declaration of Independence, and United States Constitution. Several of the earliest adopted state coats of arms and seals were similar or identical to their colonial counterparts.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Vaballathus, Zenobia had other children; {{the image of}} a child named Hairan (II) appears on <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> impression with that of his brother Vaballathus; no name of a mother was engraved and the seal is undated. Odaenathus' son Herodianus is identified by Udo Hartmann with Hairan I, a son of Odaenahtus who appears in Palmyrene inscriptions as early as 251. David S. Potter, on the other hand, suggested that Hairan II is the son of Zenobia and that he is Herodianus instead of Hairan I.|$|E

As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation.

5|$|On 21 September, Nightstalkers flying MH-60 and Little Birds {{took off}} from the frigate USS Jarrett to track an Iranian ship, Iran Ajr. The Nightstalkers {{observed}} Iran Ajr turn off her lights and begin laying mines. After receiving permission to attack, the helicopters fired guns and rockets, stopping the ship. As Iran Ajrs crew began to push mines over the side, the helicopters resumed firing until the crew abandoned ship. Special Boat Teams provided security while <b>a</b> <b>SEAL</b> team boarded the vessel at first light and discovered nine mines on the vessel's deck, {{as well as a}} logbook revealing areas where previous mines had been laid. The logbook implicated Iran in mining international waters.|$|E
