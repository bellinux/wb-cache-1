5|$|It is an <b>asymmetrical</b> forces game, set in {{the late}} 21st century.|$|E
5|$|No. 2 Bastion – an <b>asymmetrical</b> bastion {{containing}} embrasures, {{and various}} British gun emplacements, magazines and a fire control tower.|$|E
5|$|Quarantine Bastion – a {{polygonal}} <b>asymmetrical</b> bastion with a demi-bastioned retrenchment. It is breached by {{a modern}} road.|$|E
5|$|Specimens of Archaeopteryx {{were most}} notable for their {{well-developed}} flight feathers. They were markedly <b>asymmetrical</b> {{and showed the}} structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a barb-barbule-barbicel arrangement. The tail feathers were less <b>asymmetrical,</b> again {{in line with the}} situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The thumb did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of stiff feathers.|$|E
5|$|The {{fin whale}} is usually {{distinguished}} by its tall spout, long back, prominent dorsal fin, and <b>asymmetrical</b> colouration.|$|E
5|$|Crawling with an {{alternating}} gait, hawksbill tracks left in {{the sand}} are <b>asymmetrical.</b> In contrast, the green sea turtle and the leatherback turtle have a more symmetrical gait.|$|E
5|$|Crucifix Bastion – a large <b>asymmetrical</b> bastion {{containing}} a 19th-century gunpowder magazine. It {{also had a}} concrete emplacement for a 9-inch BL gun, but this has been removed.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 British artist Marion Coutts recreated Hyde Park, {{along with}} Battersea and Regent's Park, {{as a set}} of <b>asymmetrical</b> {{ping-pong}} tables for her interactive installation Fresh Air.|$|E
5|$|Leo James Rainwater (December 9, 1917 – May 31, 1986) was an American {{physicist}} {{who shared}} the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 {{for his part}} in determining the <b>asymmetrical</b> shapes of certain atomic nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Msida Bastion – a {{polygonal}} <b>asymmetrical</b> bastion with a demi-bastioned retrenchment. A cemetery {{was built}} on its upper part in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|St. Gregory Bastion – an <b>asymmetrical</b> bastion {{with a long}} left face. It was {{altered by}} the British to house QF 6 pounder 10 cwt guns.|$|E
5|$|St. John Bastion, {{also known}} as Abercrombie's Bastion – a large <b>asymmetrical</b> bastion at St. Elmo Point, {{the tip of the}} Sciberras Peninsula. The bastion {{contains}} several British gun emplacements and magazines.|$|E
5|$|The firm {{bark and}} {{lanceolate}} leaves of P.lanceolata {{distinguish it from}} P.levis, with which it can be confused; the latter species has flaky bark and <b>asymmetrical</b> leaves.|$|E
5|$|The shops on {{the north}} side have {{cantilevered}} rear extensions. Consequently, the northern external façade of the bridge is <b>asymmetrical,</b> much altered and of no architectural merit, whereas the southern external side clearly shows the hand of Robert Adam.|$|E
5|$|Thrips have <b>asymmetrical</b> {{mouthparts}} {{unique to}} the group. Unlike the Hemiptera (true bugs), the right mandible of thrips is reduced and vestigial – and in some species completely absent.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is <b>asymmetrical</b> so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from {{different}} directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards {{the left side of}} the skull.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness {{in the back}} and neck, <b>asymmetrical</b> weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, difficulty swallowing, muscle pain, loss of superficial and deep reflexes, paresthesia (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to three days, and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.|$|E
5|$|Evolve is {{an action}} video {{game with a}} focus on both co-operative, and competitive, {{multiplayer}} gameplay. The game adapts a '4v1' <b>asymmetrical</b> structure where four players take control of the Hunters, while the fifth player controls the Monster. The Hunters' main objective is to track and hunt the Monster in a limited amount of time, while the Monster's goal is to evolve and make themselves more powerful.|$|E
5|$|Immobile Holliday junctions, with <b>asymmetrical</b> {{sequences}} that {{lock the}} strands {{in a specific}} position, were artificially created by scientists to study their structure {{as a model for}} natural Holliday junctions. These junctions also later found use as basic structural building blocks in DNA nanotechnology, where multiple Holliday junctions can be combined into specific designed geometries that provide molecules {{with a high degree of}} structural rigidity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the house's west wing was demolished, leaving {{it with the}} <b>asymmetrical</b> {{appearance}} it retains today. The house was converted into a school, and in 1870 a three-story extension {{was built in the}} Gothic Revival style to the northwest of the house.|$|E
5|$|Metis is tidally locked to Jupiter, and {{its shape}} is {{strongly}} <b>asymmetrical,</b> {{with one of}} the diameters being almost twice as large as the smallest one. It {{is also one of the}} two moons known to orbit Jupiter in less than the length of Jupiter's day, the other being Adrastea. It orbits within the main ring of Jupiter, and is thought to be a major contributor of material to the rings.|$|E
5|$|Other {{security}} features include lithographic print (the resulting background hinders camera counterfeiting), anti-copying line structures, perfect registration, microprinting, <b>asymmetrical</b> serial numbers and windowed security threads (thin ribbons {{woven into the}} paper). Polymer versions of the banknote include two clear windows and other {{security features}} that substitute its paper version. Several features that are invisible {{to the naked eye}} appear when both versions of the banknote are exposed under UV light.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe aztecorum is {{the type}} species of Guzmán's section Aztecorum, a group of bluing (i.e., psilocybin-containing) Psilocybe {{mushrooms}} characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to brown or brownish white when dry; spores that appear <b>asymmetrical</b> when seen in side view; and pleurocystidia that, when present, are hyaline (translucent). Other species classified in section Aztecorum are P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis.|$|E
5|$|St. Andrew's Bastion – an <b>asymmetrical</b> {{pentagonal}} bastion. It is two-tiered, {{with its}} lower part originally containing the Marsamxett Gate, which was demolished {{in the early}} 20th century. A small faussebraye is located beneath the bastion. Ponsonby's Column {{was built on the}} bastion in 1838, but it was destroyed by lightning in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an <b>Asymmetrical</b> World was {{published}} in hardcover format by Oxford University Press on 30 April 2012. A paperback version {{was published}} at the same time. It was also published as an e-book for the Amazon Kindle by Amazon.com on 1 March 2012. In September 2012, the work was published at Oxford Scholarship Online.|$|E
5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all <b>asymmetrical</b> in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
5|$|The linear {{component}} is active when the tissue pressure exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount {{specific to the}} tissue compartment. When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential kinetics. During gas uptake, tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, so it is always modelled by exponential kinetics. This results in a model with the desired <b>asymmetrical</b> characteristics of slower washout than uptake.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are short}} and angular, while the pelvic fins {{are long and}} relatively large. The dorsal fins are small, with the first dorsal fin origin lying behind the pelvic fin origins. There is no anal fin. The caudal peduncle is robust and lacks notches at the caudal fin origins. The <b>asymmetrical</b> caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|The writer Ain Hinsberg {{refers to}} the manor house having been {{designed}} as a mock-English castle. The castle is built to an <b>asymmetrical</b> plan, with single- and double-storied wings, turrets and a slate roof. The building has both single- and double-storied floors. It hosts seminars, training programmes and small conferences, and is fitted with three meeting rooms and dining facilities.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The <b>asymmetrical</b> high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, <b>asymmetrical</b> thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Grayson {{constructed}} Grayson's Tavern in Danville {{sometime around}} 1785. The <b>asymmetrical,</b> ell-shaped building faces south onto Walnut Street with a front entrance {{on the south}} and a side entrance on the west, which opens onto Constitution Square. The Mary Akin Memorial Herb Garden, located behind Grayson's Tavern, features a variety of herbs that were commonly cultivated in the area during the late 18th and early 19th century, including chives, fennel, honeysuckle, lavender, rosemary, sage, and thyme. The garden is maintained by the Garden Club of Danville and named for one of its long-time members.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1998 an {{optically}} thick dust shell obscured Sakurai's Object, causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star, until in 1999 it disappeared from optical wavelength observations altogether. Infrared observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily carbon in an amorphous form. In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly <b>asymmetrical,</b> as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134°, and inclination of around 75°. The disc is thought to be growing more opaque due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Evolve uses an <b>asymmetrical</b> {{multiplayer}} structure, where five players—four {{playing as}} hunters and one as the monster—battle {{against each other}} on an industrialized alien planet called Shear. The hunters' gameplay {{is based on the}} first-person shooter design, while the monsters are controlled from a third-person perspective. The hunters' goal is to eliminate the monster, while the monster's goal is to consume wildlife and evolve to make themselves stronger. The game can be played alone or with multiple players.|$|E
5|$|Fernandez was {{approached}} by fellow designer and stylist Formichetti to produce the dress, with it planned out {{over the course of}} a week, Formichetti having styled the look. The dress was <b>asymmetrical,</b> with a cowled–neck. Fernandez specifically chose cuts to ensure that the dress kept well. Flank steak was chosen as the material to use, with the meat coming from his family butcher. The dress required Gaga to be stitched into the outfit backstage.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an <b>asymmetrical</b> pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E
