5|$|As {{with prior}} drafts, {{the team with}} the worst overall record from the {{previous}} season selected first, with teams from the AL and NL alternating picks. If two or more teams had the same record, {{the team with the}} worse record from two seasons prior would draft higher. Because the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL selected first overall in 1986 Major League Baseball Draft, <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> team had the first pick in the 1987 draft. The final two selections in the first round both came from American League teams, as the AL had two more organizations than the NL.|$|E

5|$|Culbreth {{became a}} member of the {{official}} AL umpire staff in 1999, when multiple call-up umpires were hired to take the place of umpires who had participated in a mass resignation. He began his career on the AL staff, but in 2000 MLB merged the umpires from its two leagues. Culbreth wore #42 as <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> umpire, but he had to stop using that number after it was retired in recognition of Jackie Robinson.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Richards {{preferred}} to arrange his rotation so that Pierce started only every fifth or sixth day, holding him back against weaker teams but using him more often for big {{games against the}} powerful Yankees and Indians. Catcher Sherm Lollar later observed that although it was essentially a compliment to Pierce's ability, he might have picked up more victories and won 20 games sooner in his career had he faced each opponent more equally. With a 1–0 two-hitter at Washington on August 3, in which the White Sox won on an unearned run {{in the ninth inning}} with a hit batter, error and sacrifice fly, Pierce began a streak of 39⅔ consecutive scoreless innings – the longest such streak in the AL between 1926, when Ted Lyons had a 41-inning streak for the White Sox, and 1968; it remains the fifth longest ever by a left-hander, and the longest by <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> southpaw since 1905. The streak ended when he allowed two unearned runs against the Browns in the sixth inning on August 19; two additional earned runs in the tenth inning ended his streak, dating to July 29, of 49⅔ innings without an earned run, and gave him a 4–3 loss. He led the league in strikeouts (186) and was second in ERA (2.72), and on September 27 started for the White Sox in the final game in Browns history, winning 2–1 in 11 innings at St. Louis. His seven shutouts that season were the second most by <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> left-hander since 1916, matched only by Hal Newhouser's 1945 total of eight.|$|E
5|$|Ferrell was {{regarded}} as one of the best catchers in baseball during the 1930s and early 1940s. While playing for the Red Sox in 1933, he and his brother Wes were selected to play for the American League (AL) team in the inaugural 1933 Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July6, 1933. His 1,806games played as a catcher set <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> longevity record which stood for more than 40years. A seven-time All-Star, Ferrell was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984 by the Veterans Committee. After his playing career, he became a coach with the Senators, and later a scout and general manager with the Detroit Tigers. He died in July 1995.|$|E

5|$|The American League (AL) and the National League (NL) alternated picks {{throughout}} the first round; because an NL team drafted {{first in the}} 1986 MLB Draft, <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> team had the first selection in 1987. Having finished 67–95 in 1986, the Seattle Mariners had the worst record in the AL and thus obtained the first overall selection. The second selection went to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had the worst record in the NL.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} strong leaders {{who could take}} charge and steer America out of its crisis is seen in Gabriel Over the White House (1933), about a benevolent {{dictator}} who takes control of the United States. Walter Huston stars as a weak-willed, ineffectual president (likely modeled after Hoover) who is inhabited by the archangel Gabriel upon being knocked unconscious. The spirit's behavior {{is similar to that}} of Abraham Lincoln. The president solves the nation's unemployment crisis and executes <b>an</b> <b>Al</b> Capone-type criminal who has continually flouted the law.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro won 41 {{games in}} New York's 1904 season, still <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> record. New York contended for the AL pennant with the Boston Americans (later nicknamed the Red Sox); Johnson aided New York by helping the team acquire {{multiple}} players in trades, including Boston's Patsy Dougherty. Boston and New York {{faced each other}} in a season-ending five-game series that decided the pennant winner, and was played from October 7–10. Boston won two of the first three games, which meant that New York needed to win the two contests scheduled on October 10 to win the AL title. With the score of the first game tied 2–2 in the ninth inning, Chesbro threw a wild pitch that allowed a runner on third base to score, giving Boston a 3–2 victory that clinched the AL pennant; New York won the now-meaningless second game.|$|E

5|$|Feller {{started the}} 1952 season with three wins {{in his first}} five starts; one of the losses was an April 23 one-hitter against Bob Cain, who also allowed only one hit. Feller {{struggled}} {{for the rest of}} the season, and after an argument with an umpire over a strike call in late August, manager Al López shut Feller down for the season. He finished the season with a 9–13 record and a 4.74 ERA. He improved the following year, winning 10 games and losing 7 in 25 starts after Lopez gave him extra days of rest between appearances. The Indians won 111 regular season games during 1954, beating <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> record previously held by the 1927 New York Yankees. The 35-year-old Feller finished 13–3 on the year, earning his 250th pitching victory in a May 23 win and his 2,500th career strikeout in a win on June 12.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Zito {{became one}} of the best {{pitchers}} in baseball. On June 22, Zito won his 10th game of the season. It was the earliest that an A's pitcher had reached the 10-win mark since Bob Welch got there on June 15, 1990. Zito was named to the All-Star team {{for the first time in}} his career. On July 18, he went 7.1 innings while giving up no runs against the Angels. That win gave Zito a team-record 16th straight win at home. Zito again faced the Angels in his next start and produced similar results. He went 6.1 innings and gave up just one run. That win gave Zito the most wins by <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> pitcher (14). Zito would become the AL's first 15-game winner when he beat the Rangers. On August 23, Zito recorded his 18th win of the season, giving him one more than his previous career high of 17, in a game against the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} seasons with White Sox, Pierce's control {{problems}} continued; his 137 walks in 1950 tied {{him for the}} fourth most ever by <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> left-hander. But those seasons also included indications of his developing excellence, {{as well as the}} struggles he would face in gaining run support. On May 29, 1949, in just his sixth start with Chicago (and the 11th of his career), the 22-year-old Pierce was matched against 42-year-old Negro league legend Satchel Paige in a road game against the defending World Series champion Cleveland Indians. The pitchers' duel went into the 11th inning, when Pierce walked leadoff hitter Ken Keltner, followed by two bunt singles. After Pierce was replaced by a reliever and the next batter lined to shortstop Luke Appling, Lou Boudreau singled to give Cleveland a 2–1 win; Pierce had himself scored Chicago's only run after singling in the eighth inning. And on June 15, 1950 against the World Series champion Yankees, Pierce got his first career shutout – a 5–0 one-hitter, interrupted by rain delays in the second, fourth and fifth innings totaling over an hour and a half, with the only hit being Billy Johnson's single in the fifth inning.|$|E

5|$|Playing the Yankees on June 25, 1953, he {{was part}} of a rare {{defensive}} shift; leading 4–2 in the ninth inning, he was moved to first base, with Harry Dorish entering in relief. Pinch hitter Don Bollweg barely beat out a bunt single to first base, but Pierce than recorded a putout on Gil McDougald's grounder to third base. He then retook the mound, and after issuing a walk, gained the final two outs to finish the victory; the White Sox set <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> record by using five first basemen in the game. Pierce was also an excellent baserunner, and was used as a pinch runner 30 times between 1949 and 1957 – even scoring as a substitute for three-time stolen base champion Minnie Miñoso in a 5–4 victory over the Yankees on June 22, 1956.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2004 season, {{with a year}} {{remaining}} on his contract, Rivera signed a two-year extension worth $21million, with an option for a third year. That season, Rivera surpassed 300career saves and made his sixth All-Star team with 32saves at the midseason break, then <b>an</b> <b>AL</b> record. His final numbers for the year included a 1.94ERA and a career-high 53saves in 57opportunities; it was his third time leading the major leagues in saves. Along with winning a third AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, he placed third in the AL Cy Young Award voting. Following the Yankees' victory in the 2004 AL Division Series against the Minnesota Twins, Rivera returned home to Panama to mourn two relatives {{who had died in}} an accident in his swimming pool. Despite his status being in doubt for the 2004 AL Championship Series against the Red Sox, he returned to New York for Game 1 after attending the funeral in Panama earlier in the day. He recorded a save that night, as well as in Game 2. Although the Yankees led three-games-to-none in the series, Rivera blew saves in Games 4 and 5, and the Red Sox won both games in extra innings to avoid elimination. In Game 4, Boston's Dave Roberts pinch ran and stole second base against Rivera, eventually scoring on a single to tie the game. In Game 5, Rivera entered with a one-run lead with runners on base and allowed a sacrifice fly to tie the score. Although he allowed just one earned run in the 2004 postseason, he blew three of five save opportunities in the two series. Boston's comeback victories helped them become the first team in MLB history to win a best-of-seven series in which they trailed three-games-to-none.|$|E
