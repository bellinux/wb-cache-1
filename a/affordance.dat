40|$|How broad is {{the class}} of <b>affordances</b> we can perceive? <b>Affordances</b> (Gibson, 1979 / 1986) are {{possibilities}} for action provided to an animal by the environment-by the substances, surfaces, objects, and other living creatures that surround it. A widespread assumption has been that <b>affordances</b> primarily relate to motor action-to locomotion and manual behaviors such as reaching and grasping. We propose an account of <b>affordances</b> according to which the concept of <b>affordances</b> has a much broader application than has hitherto been supposed. We argue that the <b>affordances</b> an environment offers to an animal are dependent on the skills the animal possesses.

40|$|Ontological {{debates on}} the nature of <b>affordances</b> muddy the waters for interpreting, comparing, and critiquing {{research}} on technological <b>affordances.</b> The widespread use of <b>affordances</b> has naturalised the term, often masking the import of its evolving social science definitions. Diversity in applications of <b>affordances</b> across disciplines has led to calls to abandon the term altogether. Following an abridged survey of ontological debates about their general and more specific technological nature, I examine a selection of thematically linked and often-cited papers on technological <b>affordances.</b> I compare those with evolving social science theories of <b>affordances</b> and with various conceptualizations of technical <b>affordances.</b> Implications are discussed of ontological debates around subject-object and directions of agency for research on technological <b>affordances</b> for collaborative learning and co-creation of new knowledge. A rationale is posited for including actor network theory-informed research practices as a route toward richer understanding of technological <b>affordances</b> among the mesh of meaning making, knowledge sharing, and creation practices in networked teams’ activities.

40|$|We give a {{historical}} {{overview of the}} development of almost 50 years of empirical research on the <b>affordances</b> in the past and in the present. Defined by James Jerome Gibson in the early development of the Ecological Approach to Perception and Action as the prime of perception and action, <b>affordances</b> have become a rich topic of investigation in the fields of human movement science and experimental psychology. The methodological origins of the empirical research performed on <b>affordances</b> {{can be traced back to}} the mid 1980 ’s and the works of Warren (1984, 1988) and Michaels (1988). Most of the research in Ecological Psychology performed since has focused on the actualization of discretely defined actions, the perception of action boundaries, the calculation of pi-numbers, and the measurement of response times. The research efforts have resulted in advancements in the understanding of the dynamic nature of <b>affordances,</b> <b>affordances</b> in a social context and the importance of calibration for perception of <b>affordances.</b> Although <b>affordances</b> are seen as an instrumental part of the control of action most studies investigating <b>affordances</b> do not pay attention to the control of the action. We conclude that <b>affordances</b> are still primarily treated as a utility to select behaviour, which creates a conceptual barrier that hinders deeper understanding of <b>affordances.</b> A focus on action-boundaries has largely prevented advancement in other aspects of <b>affordances,</b> most notably an integrative understanding of the role of <b>affordances</b> in the control of action...|$|R

50|$|The term <b>affordance</b> {{is first}} used in human-computer {{interaction}} in the 1980s by Norman {{with the term}} perceived <b>affordance.</b> Relevant publications were: Gaver‘s seminal articles on technology <b>affordance</b> in 1991, affordances of media spaces in 1992, affordances for interaction, and then Bradner‘s notion of social <b>affordance,</b> where social affordances are action possibilities for social behavior.Social <b>affordance</b> is at first used in Computer Supported Collaboration Learning experiments. Computer support collaboration learning applications and users’ interactions are the major issue in social <b>affordance.</b> Social affordances are properties of Computer Supported Collaboration Learning environments which act as social-contextual facilitators relevant for the learner’s social interactions. This term afterwards applies to other human-computer interactions including human cognition responses, visual perceptions and it also refers to the ecological relationship between human and computers.|$|E

A sub-classification into stable and variable <b>affordances</b> was {{proposed in the}} framework of the ROSSI project (Borghi et al., 2010; Borghi and Riggio, 2015, 2009). Here, we present a coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional imaging studies on object interaction targeting consistent anatomical correlates of these different types of <b>affordances.</b> Our review revealed the existence of two parallel (but to some extent overlapping) functional pathways. The network for stable <b>affordances</b> consists of predominantly left inferior parietal and frontal cortices in the ventro-dorsal stream, whereas the network for variable <b>affordances</b> is localized preferentially in the dorso-dorsal stream. This is in line with the proposal of differentiated affordances: stable <b>affordances</b> are characterized by the knowledge of invariant object features, whereas variable <b>affordances</b> underlie adaptation to changing object properties...|$|R

40|$|The term “affordance” {{has been}} used in Information Communications Technology (ICT) based {{environment}} to explore the opportunities the educational technologies provide for students. Gibson (1979 / 1986) defines <b>affordances</b> as the possibilities that the environment offers for the perceiver. The perceiver and the environment make an inseparable pair. In the case of learning, <b>affordances</b> are those relationships that provide a “match” between something in the environment and the learner (Van Lier, 2004) as a whole. The learning environment is a complex system consists of different components and layers. By becoming integrated components of the environment, different learning entities, whether social or individual, constitute <b>affordances</b> for each other. Through interactions, these <b>affordances</b> are integrated, and transform into effectivities (Visser, 2001). Besides, according to Gibson, <b>affordances</b> are invariant. However, they can be increased when the intensity of stimulation changes. They can also form higher order <b>affordances</b> when primary <b>affordances</b> are always found in particular combinations. Finally, Gibson (1979 / 1986) argues that <b>affordances</b> are not neutral. A focus on <b>affordances</b> for learning in mobile technology-based environment helps us identify how the environment as an integrated whole provides support for students’ learning, what and how components of the environment interact to provide various <b>affordances.</b> published_or_final_versionCentre of Information Technology in Education, University of Hong Kong and Education and Manpower Bureau, the Government of the Hong Kong SA...|$|R

30|$|The {{choice of}} {{theoretical}} and analytical approach was made {{according to the}} empirical data material. An ecological perspective may explain how the physical environment impacts children’s movement behaviour (Gubbels et al. 2011). Gibson’s (1979) theory of <b>affordances</b> links together the perceptual and motor systems, and explains how the physical environment is interpreted by individuals as invitations to behavior and possibilities for action. Gibson’s theory has been considered as an directly perceived model of ecological perceptions and its focus on physical <b>affordances</b> in the environment. Heft (1988) further developed the theory of <b>affordances</b> {{as a means to}} describe how children perceive functionally significant properties in their environment and adapt their actions according to their own resources such as their strength, competence or fear. Kyttä (2006) connect a close relationships between children’s degree of independent mobility licence and actualization of <b>affordances</b> in the environments. Kyttä (2004) refers to potential <b>affordances,</b> which are opportunities inherent in the qualities of the environment (possible <b>affordances</b> of an environment or object), and realised <b>affordances,</b> which are opportunities the children use in the environment. The extent of potential <b>affordances</b> is defined by the individual’s qualities, such as physical skills and bodily proportions, as well as social needs and personals intention (Kyttä 2003). Therefor, the potential <b>affordances</b> can be different for each individual, group, people and situations. Environments involving a positive interrelationships between mobility licence and actualizing <b>affordances</b> also functions as a zone of proximal development (Vygotsky), which means that children are presented with a series of graduate zones of challenges slightly above their current levels of functioning (Kyttä 2006). Few mobility licences make it impossible to actualize <b>affordances.</b>|$|R

Notably, Gibson compares an <b>affordance</b> with an ecological niche emphasizing the way niches characterize how an animal lives in its environment. An <b>affordance</b> is independent of an individual's ability to recognize it or even take advantage of it, and so, {{should not be confused}} with a privately perceived world or a phenomenology of perception. An <b>affordance</b> is relational and characterizes the suitability of the environment to the observer, and so, depends on their capabilities.

40|$|Gibson's {{theory of}} <b>affordances</b> offers {{environmental}} psychology {{a method of}} examining the functional significance of environments for adolescents. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop rating scales that would measure the <b>affordances</b> of the home, neighbourhood, school and town centre for adolescents. The <b>affordances</b> measured related to two developmental needs in adolescence, the need for places of social interaction and for places of retreat. Five hundred and thirty-nine adolescents aged between 11 and 16 years rated the number of places available for 34 different <b>affordances</b> in each of the environments. The neighbourhood, school and town centre all supported both social interaction and retreat behaviours. The home environment did not support social interaction behaviours; it instead provided <b>affordances</b> for two different types of retreat, retreat involving close friends and retreat involving seeking out security. Gender and age differences in scale scores and how often the environments are used were also explored. In conclusion, utilising Gibson's theory of <b>affordances</b> enabled a systematic comparison of the <b>affordances</b> of adolescents' key environments to be carried out.
