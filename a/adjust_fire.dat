50|$|After almost 28 {{years as}} a {{commissioned}} or non-commissioned infantry officer, Poole retired from the United States Marine Corps in 1993. On active duty, he studied small-unit tactics for ten years and served for eight months as a rifle company commander in Vietnam (1968-69). After Vietnam, he developed, taught, and refined courses of instruction on maneuver warfare, land navigation, fire support coordination, call for fire, <b>adjust</b> <b>fire,</b> close air support, M203 grenade launcher, movement to contact, daylight attack, night attack, infiltration, defense, offensive Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), defensive MOUT, NBC defense, and leadership.|$|E
50|$|The {{offensive}} {{was launched}} {{in the early hours}} of 25 November 1942. It got off to a bad start, as fog and snowy weather grounded the planned air support. It also greatly reduced the effect of the massive artillery barrages preceding the main attacks, as it made it impossible for the forward artillery observers to <b>adjust</b> <b>fire</b> and observe the results.The northern thrust made little progress. The eastern attack across the frozen Vazuza river slowly ground forward. The two western thrusts made deeper penetrations, especially around the key town of Belyi.Still, the progress was nowhere near what the Soviets expected.|$|E
5000|$|The {{difficulties}} faced {{were not}} confined to the numbers of guns and the quantity of ammunition. The flat terrain, with dense jungle or open strips of tall grass, provided no vantage point from which to observe and <b>adjust</b> <b>fire.</b> Maps available for plotting targets were inaccurate and lacked detail. A workable map was constructed from air photos. Sound ranging was used in place of observation. By [...] "skilful calculation", fire could be delivered to an accuracy of 200 yds m. However, well-trained infantry would look to advance as near as 30 yds m to the fall of the shot. To improve visibility, forward observers would take to the trees, making them targets for Japanese snipers.|$|E

5000|$|Fire {{support is}} {{long-range}} firepower provided to a front-line military unit. [...] Typically, fire support {{is provided by}} artillery or close air support (usually directed by a forward observer), and is used to shape the battlefield or, more optimistically, define the battle. Warships, for example, have long provided naval gunfire support. Artillery observers allow <b>adjusting</b> <b>fire.</b> Fire support has been used {{since the advent of}} cannons in warfare as artillery. Fire support, as an extension, is the marriage of artillery to the forces in contact. It is the direct ability to properly use artillery. It is distinct from direct fire, which is provided by the forces in contact.|$|R

5000|$|The {{solution}} to the problem of observation arrived on 28 November in the form of [...] "slow, almost weaponless Wirraways" [...] of No. 4 Army Cooperation Squadron, RAAF. One of these aircraft was allotted to the 32nd Division and one to the 7th Division, to work with the artillery, initially for two hours during each morning. So successful were these planes, their availability was quickly increased, operating from both Dobodura and Popondetta. They were used to <b>adjust</b> <b>fire,</b> to identify targets and to lure enemy AA into disclosing their positions so they could be attacked with counter-battery fire. It was a dangerous job as the Japanese ordered that these planes be made priority targets.|$|E
5000|$|Using a {{standardized}} format, the FO sends either an absolute position or a position relative to another point, a brief target description, a recommended munition to use, and any special instructions, such as [...] "danger close" [...] (warning that friendly troops {{are close to}} the target, requiring extra precision from the guns). Firing begins with an adjustment phase where only a single gun fires, and if the rounds are not accurate, the FO will issue instructions to <b>adjust</b> <b>fire</b> in four dimensions (three spatial and one temporal). When the degree of accuracy is acceptable, the FO will then typically call [...] "fire for effect", unless the objective of that fire mission is something other than suppression or destruction of the target.

5000|$|The Type 89 {{discharger}} {{could also}} be used with a more powerful impact-detonated shell approaching the power of a light mortar. Weighing approximately two pounds (approx. 900 g), it was known as the Type 89 50mm shell, and was made in high explosive (HE), incendiary and smoke variants. To fire the shell (which had a nose-mounted impact fuse that detonated on contact), it was dropped base-down inside the tube of the discharger. By setting the Type 89 discharger at a fixed angle of 45 degrees, and varying distance to target by adjusting the size of a variable chamber space inside the discharger mechanism (See also the Granatnik wz. 36), soldiers could <b>adjust</b> <b>fire</b> onto multiple targets at varying ranges while firing the contact-detonated 50 mm shell through a single small clearing in the jungle canopy.

30|$|Historically, the Cross Timbers {{forest of}} Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas burned frequently. Fire {{managers}} in the region often have varied success when conducting prescribed fires, with one hypothesis being that fuel quality varies with litter age. This {{study was designed to}} determine the time-since-leaf-fall flammability characteristics of the two dominant tree species in the Cross Timbers, Quercus marilandica and Q. stellata. Principal components analysis indicated that the burn characteristics of both species are strongly influenced by time since the onset of leaf fall. The percent consumption of leaf litter and flame time of the two species began to diverge at 123 days after leaf fall and continued throughout the remainder of the study. There was no difference between the other flammability characteristics of ember time, total burn time, average temperature, and maximum temperature. Fuel consumption and fire behavior in hardwood leaf litter fuels can vary considerably, possibly as result of fuel mass loss from decomposition, which may due to a loss of flammable material. Our results show that the longer the time period from leaf fall to burn, the greater the change in burn characteristics of these two Quercus species. By identifying these similarities and differences between the leaf litter of dominant tree species, fire managers can <b>adjust</b> <b>fire</b> prescriptions to better meet burn objectives.|$|E

40|$|Effective fire {{prevention}} requires {{a better understanding}} of the patterns and causes of fire ignition. In this study, we focus on the interacting factors known to influence fire ignition risk, such as the type of veg- etation, topographical features and the wildland-urban interface (WUI; i. e. where urban development meet or intermingle with wildland). We also analyze the human activities and motivations related to fires and whether they differ depending on the type of vegetation and the location within/outside WUI. There were significant interactions between topography, type of vegetation and location within/outside WUI. The risk of ignition was in general higher at lower elevations, and this tendency was more marked in forested land covers (all plantations and open woodlands), with the noticeable exception of native for- ests. North-facing sites had lower fire ignition risk outside the WUI, especially in native forests, while southern aspects showed higher fire ignition risk, especially in open shrublands. However, this effect of the aspect was only significant outside WUI areas. In relation to causes, there were also interactions between human activities/motivations related to fires, the type of vegetation and the location within/out- side WUI. All forestry plantations appeared clustered in relation to fire causes, especially in the WUI, with high incidence of deliberately caused fires related to violent or mentally ill people and rekindle fires. In contrast, native forests, despite structural similarities with forestry plantations, showed more similarity with agricultural areas and open woodlands in relation to fire causes. In shrublands, there was a relatively high incidence of fires related to ranching, especially outside the WUI. This pattern of interactions depicts a complex scenario in relation to fire ignition risk and prompts to the importance of taking this complex- ity into account in order to <b>adjust</b> <b>fire</b> management measures for improved effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was carried {{through with the}} purpose to develop and to <b>adjust</b> <b>fire</b> behavior prediction models in laboratory experiments and burns under pine stands {{as well as to}} propose an artificial plot assembly methodology in field to monitor fire behavior. The "Laboratório de Incêndios Florestais da Universidade Federal do Paraná", located in Curitiba County, Paraná State and the "Laboratório de Pesquisa e Controle de Incêndios" of Rio Sagrado Industrial Química Ltda enterprise, located in Quatro Barras County, Paraná State, were both sites at which experiments were performed to a) evaluate the relationship between fuel weight and land slope considering fire spread variables b) define patterns of fire behavior based on fire burns on a flat landscape, with predetermined weight and fuel depth. The "Estação Experimental de Rio Negro", located in Rio Negro County, Paraná State, was the location chosen for the development and adjustment of fire behavior models based on burns under pine stands and the "Fazenda Experimental do Canguiri", located in Pinhais County, Paraná State, was used for the development of an artificial plot assembly methodology to monitor fire behavior based on burns with known variables. For the lab experiments, fuel weight, fuel depth and slope figures were predetermined. During the burns conduction in these environments, fire behavior variables such as fire spread and flame height, temperature and relative humidity were monitored. For burns under pine stands in Rio Negro, the characterization of the area was complemented by a superficial forest fuel sampling and the burns were conducted in plots with 50. 0 m². At the Canguiri farm, the development of the new methodology and burns were carried out in plots with dimensions of 2 x 6 meters, with fuel weight, fuel depth and further fuel arrangements predetermined and with the monitoring of wind, temperature and relative humidity. It was verified during the lab experiments that in inclinations less than 15 degrees, the fuel weight was the principal factor in the fire spread and that above 15 degrees, the slope was the principal factor in the fire spread. The second order polynomials models presented the best adjustment in the fire spread prediction according the slope, with R² above 0. 76. Fire spread prediction models were adjusted according to flame height (R² = 0. 8063) and fire intensity prediction according to flame height (R² = 0. 8272). A model comprising of variables such as flame height, temperature and relative humidity was also adjusted, providing R² equal to 0. 8436. Regarding burns under pine stands, of which its total fuel load provided an average of 32. 23 Mg ha- 1, the model to provide the most accurate estimate for fire spread was r = 0. 104716 + 0. 0124587 T - 0. 00400681 UR + 0. 0478819 Vv (R² = 82. 73) and for fire intensity was I = - 718. 028 + 1275. 87 hc + 8. 33757 UR (R² = 85. 23). The burns of artificial plots produced fire intensities between 30. 19 and 582. 22 kcal m- 1 s- 1, flame height between 0. 75 and 5. 63 meters and fire spread between 0. 19 and 3. 66 m min- 1. The results of this methodology allowed fire intensity prediction model adjustments based on flame height (R² = 0. 7999), wind speed (R² = 0. 7090) and fire spread estimate models based on flame height (R² = 0. 7995), wind speed (R² = 0. 7101) and relative humidity (R² = 0. 5661) ...|$|E
25|$|Pattern {{separation}} {{is the ability}} to differentiate one memory from other stored memories. Pattern separation begins in the dentate gyrus, a section of the hippocampus involved in memory formation and retrieval.

Place fields are extremely specific, as they are capable of remapping and <b>adjusting</b> <b>firing</b> rates in response to subtle sensory signal changes.
