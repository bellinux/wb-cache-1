30|$|The SBA is {{performed}} in two phases. The first phase identifies staying tags {{and a few}} <b>arriving</b> tags. In the phase, since SBA blocks most <b>arriving</b> tags, {{the probability of a}} staying tag colliding with <b>arriving</b> tags is low. The second phase identifies <b>arriving</b> tags that are not recognized in the first phase. To avoid excessive collisions caused by <b>arriving</b> tags, SBA counts the number of minor <b>arriving</b> tags that have responded in the first phase to estimate the number of <b>arriving</b> tags that will respond in the second phase. By generating proper queries, SBA significantly reduces collisions caused by these unrecognized <b>arriving</b> tags.|$|R
