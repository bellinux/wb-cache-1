5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Love</b> Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning songs about different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness. It veers between danceable, upbeat songs about cultivating a new romance and bluesy, meditative songs about how romances dissolve. In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, <b>A</b> <b>Love</b> Surreal deals more with feelings of lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|E
