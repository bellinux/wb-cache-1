5|$|In December 2009, it was {{announced}} that following the success of Bustracker, <b>an</b> <b>application</b> had been developed for the iPhone that is similar to the way Bustracker works. It allows people to download <b>an</b> <b>application</b> to their iPhone that enables them to see where their nearest bus stop is and when the bus is due. Although not developed by Lothian Buses or The City of Edinburgh Council, the application has now won the backing of both companies.

Like the iPhone application, this application is developed by an independent developer, backed by Lothian Buses and The City of Edinburgh Council, and is available free of charge.|$|E
