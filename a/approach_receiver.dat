40|$|Abstract: Identifying the {{cognitive}} capacity used by an animal to resolve its foraging task when facing ever-changing environmental conditions is a recent, central issue in behavioral ecology and cognitive science. Statistical confirmation of potential capacity through analysis of individual behavioral processes becomes an important research topic. New longitudinal data arisec as {{a sequence of}} global quality distri-butions, representing sparsely observed environmental dynamics. Such dynamics result from an individual animal’s decision-making process as it explores a patch that consists of a fixed amount of hosts. Three dynamic rules having distinct de-grees of cognitive capacities are analyzed under a time-varying Markov structure. From the perspective of goodness-of-fit, two tests statistics are proposed for cap-turing different aspects of dynamic changes in the environmental. It is found that the test that best embraces the concept of distribution via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve performs quite well.

The method uses a single frequency carrier replica for the baseband mixing process, enabling all satellites to perform mixing simultaneously and yielding considerable computational savings. To compensate for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) losses caused by using a single frequency carrier replica, the integration interval after despreading is divided into subintervals, and the output from each subinterval then compensated for the known frequency error. Using this <b>approach,</b> <b>receiver</b> processing times are shown to be reduced by approximately 21 % relative to the next fastest method when tracking seven satellites. The paper shows the mathematical derivation of the new algorithm, discusses practical considerations, and demonstrates its performance using simulations and real data. Results show that the new method is able to generate pseudorange and carrier phase measurements with the same accuracy as traditional methods. Stand-alone positioning accuracy is at the meter level, while differential processing can produce fixed ambiguity carrier phase positions accurate to the centimeter level.|$|E

Flight tests measured the accuracy {{and the ability to}} make <b>approaches.</b> <b>Receiver</b> reliability and susceptibility to atmospheric noise were also studied. Ground tests looked into grid stability and grid war page. Antenna tests were done to evaluate three antenna configurations [...] ADF, vertical whip, and trailing wire antennas. The measured accuracy met FAA AC 90 - 45 A requirements for all phases of flight. Loran-C was found to be satisfactory for approaches within AC 90 - 45 A specifications. Reliability was 99. 7 %, the receiver was insensitive to atmospheric noise. The time difference grid was stable in the long run. Antenna tests showed the ADF and vertical whip antennas to be suitable for airborne use. It is concluded that Loran-C is suitable for navigation as an alternative to VHF RNAV.

50|$|The {{critical}} information {{that allowed the}} receiver to compute location was a unique frequency curve caused by the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect caused an apparent compression of the carrier's wavelength as the satellite <b>approached</b> the <b>receiver,</b> and stretching of wavelengths as the satellite receded. The spacecraft traveled at about 17,000 mph, which could increase or decrease {{the frequency of the}} received carrier signal by as much as 10 kHz. This Doppler curve was unique for each location within line-of-sight of the satellite. For instance, the earth's rotation caused the ground receiver to move toward or away from the satellite's orbit, creating a non-symmetric Doppler shift for approach and recession, allowing the receiver to determine whether it was east or west of the satellite's north-south ground track.|$|R
