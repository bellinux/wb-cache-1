5000|$|The cementoenamel junction, {{frequently}} abbreviated as the CEJ, is {{a slightly}} visible anatomical border identified on a tooth. It is the location where the enamel, which covers the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown</b> of a tooth, and the cementum, which covers the anatomical root of a tooth, meet. Informally {{it is known}} as the neck of the tooth. [...] The border created by these two dental tissues has much significance as it is usually the location where the gingiva attaches to a healthy tooth by fibers called the gingival fibers.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown</b> {{and root}} tapers towards the apex, the mesial-distal {{dimension}} decreases, {{and so the}} mean mesial-distal dimension at the marginal crest of bone, which lies approximately 2 mm apical to the CEJ, is smaller. The tooth has the apico-coronal distance from the marginal crest of bone to the contact point {{in order to increase}} from the much narrower mesial-distal dimension to the greater mesial-distal dimension, and this distance is partially subgingival (below the gum line) and partially supragingival (above the gun line). Running room refers to this subgingival apico-coronal distance.|$|E
50|$|The {{junctional}} epithelium, a nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, lies immediately apical to the sulcular epithelium, which {{lines the}} gingival sulcus {{from the base}} to the free gingival margin, where it interfaces with the epithelium of the oral cavity.The gingival sulcus is bounded by the enamel of the crown of the tooth and the sulcular epithelium. Immediately apical {{to the base of}} the pocket, and coronal to the most coronal of the gingival fibers is the junctional epithelium. The JE attaches to the surface of the tooth by way of the EA with hemidesmosomes and is, on average, roughly 1 mm in width in the apico-coronal dimension, constituting about one half of the biologic width. The attachment of the JE to the tooth surface can occur on enamel, cementum, or dentin. The position of the EA on the tooth surface is initially on the cervical half of the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown</b> when the tooth first becomes functional after tooth eruption.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{developments}} in peri-implant surgical regenerative procedures, re-establishing the hard and soft tissue contour is still a challenge in cases with severe ridge deficiency. It becomes more difficult when incorrectly placed implants cause screw connections to come out onto the labial surfaces of the teeth. A two-part maxillary implant supported fixed restoration was constructed. The first part was consisted of a screw retained sub-structure that replaced gingival portions of the deficient maxilla {{and the second part}} was a cement retained super-structure that reconstructed the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crowns</b> of the lost teeth. In this way awkwardly placed implants did not interfere with the desired esthetic result. Another great advantage was that the alterations or repairs on cemented crowns can easily be carried out without compromising the entire construction...|$|R
40|$|The hardest {{tissue in}} the human body is the enamel which covers the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crowns</b> of teeth. It must be {{resistant}} to mechanical stress and the chemical attack of many substances from food, drinks and products of the metabolism of bacteria present in the oral cavity. These low pH substances dissolve the mineral components of enamel, cause tooth demineralization, and lead to decay or erosion damage with the irreversible loss of dental hard tissues and the necessity of their reconstruction. The range of dental materials intended for dental tissue reconstruction is extensive. Dental amalgam can be mechanically applied into the strongly stressed lateral segments of teeth. The use of amalgam is, however, in decline, with the possible health risks attributed to it, coupled with the need to extensively prepare tooth tissue promoting a shift towards using aesthetically and biologically favourable dental ceramic and polymeric materials instead. Current developments also concentrate on these materials to reinforce this, with polymeric composite materials based on methacrylates with varying amounts of inorganic fillers at the forefront. These materials are distinguished by their good mechanical and aesthetic properties and wear resistance. However, polymerization shrinkage and a strong hydrophobic nature does not allow for their direct bonding to hard dental tissues. Risks associated with the release of residual free monomers from the structure to the environment, which may cause health complications, mainly allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, have been monitored recently. Further development in the field of composite materials aims to reduce or completely eliminate these negatives...|$|R

40|$|O objetivo do presente estudo foi propor um protocolo para a aplicação da técnica de tomografia computadorizada cone beam para tecidos moles (ST- CBCT) como um método não-invasivo para avaliar o comprimento da coroa anatômica dos dentes anteriores e planejar cirurgias estéticas de aumento de coroa clínica, evitando a exposição indesejada da porção radicular. Dez pacientes jovens (média de idade de 22, 8 anos) com indicação para cirurgias estéticas de aumento de coroa clínica, mas sem indicação de procedimentos restauradores, foram incluídos neste estudo. As imagens de ST-CBCT foram analisados com um {{software}} de edição e análise de imagens (Pixelmator 3. 2), a coroa clínica, a coroa anatômica e a quantidade de gengiva que recobre o esmalte foram medidos. O valor médio do comprimento das coroas anatômicas dos incisivos centrais, incisivos laterais e caninos foi de 11, 06 mm, 9, 55 mm e 9, 77 mm, respectivamente. Os caninos demonstraram ser aproximadamente 1, 3 mm mais curtos do que os incisivos centrais. A ST-CBCT provou ser útil para avaliar o comprimento real da coroa anatômica e a quantidade de tecido gengival que precisa de ser removido cirurgicamente. Portanto, a técnica demonstrou ser útil para evitar a exposição indesejada raiz como resultado da cirurgia estética de aumento de coroa clínica, uma vez que permite que seja estimada a quantidade de coroa que está recoberta por tecido gengival. Sendo assim, um procedimento não-invasivo, útil para o planejamento de cirurgias estéticas aumento de coroa clínica. _________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe aim of {{the present}} report is to propose a protocol {{for the application of}} soft tissue - cone beam computed tomography (ST-CBCT) as a non-invasive method to assess the length of the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown</b> and plan esthetic crown lengthening surgeries avoiding undesired root exposure. Ten young patients (mean age of 22. 8 years) with indication for esthetic crown lengthening surgeries but no indication for restorative procedures were included in this study. The images from the ST-CBCT were analyzed with an image editor and analysis software (Pixelmator 3. 2) and the clinical crown, the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown</b> and the amount of gingiva covering the enamel were measured. The mean value of the length of the anatomical crowns of the central incisors, lateral incisors and canines were 11. 06 mm, 9. 55 mm and 9. 77 mm, respectively. Thus, the canines were approximately 1. 3 mm shorter than the central incisors. The ST-CBCT technic proved to be useful to assess the actual length of the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown</b> and the amount of gingival tissue that needs to be surgically removed, and therefore to prevent undesired root exposure. Thus it is a helpful non-invasive procedure for the planning of esthetic crown lengthening surgeries...|$|E
40|$|Objetives: This study define altered passive {{eruption}} (APE) {{and evaluate}} the morphology of the dentogingival unit. Material and Methods: 123 individuals subjected to clinical examination and parallel profile radiography of the upper central incisor. An evaluation {{was made of the}} correlation between the clinical diagnosis of APE and the degree of gingival overlap; by using a 19 % overlap to define APE (Kappa concordance index = 0. 7). The Mann- Whitney / Wilcoxon test was used to identify the variables influencing APE. Results: Statistically significant differences were observed between the teeth with and without APE: gingival width (p = 0. 0073), clinical crown length (p = 0. 0000), smiling exposed gums (p = 0. 0000), bone crest thickness (p = 0. 0030), connective tissue attachment thickness (p = 0. 0003) and biological width (p = 0. 0015). Conclusions: The APE is characterized by: a gingival overlapping of over 19 % of the length of the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown,</b> increased gingival width and gingival smile; furthermore is associated to a thick bone crest and connective tissue attachment. Statistical analysis confirms two morphological patterns of APE...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth filled with gutta percha and Resilon. Materials and Methods: A total of 60 freshly extracted single rooted teeth are selected and their <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown</b> removed at the CEJ. All samples were instrumented with the Step-back technique. Samples were randomly divided into three groups of 20 samples each: Group A obturated by lateral condensation with gutta percha and AH plus sealer, Group B obturated by lateral condensation with Resilon; Group C recieved no filling. Restored teeth were subjected to compressive loading in a universal testing machine. The results of fracture resistance recorded and statistical analysis done. Results: The mean and SD values for the groups are as follows: Group A- 536. 555 &# 177; 128. 816, Group B- 885. 943 &# 177; 194. 410 and Group C- 591. 066 &# 177; 68. 97. It was seen that samples of Group B showed the highest fracture resistance followed by Group C. Group A showed the least fracture resistance. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that filling the canals with Resilon increased the in vitro resistance to fracture of endodontically treated single canal teeth when compared with gutta percha...|$|E
40|$|Inaccuracy in {{landmark}} {{identification is}} regarded as the most important source of error in cephalometry. Better definition of landmarks should therefore contribute to better clinical decisions and research validity. This study primarily comprised of an ex vivo investigation on 50 extracted lower incisor teeth to determine whether radiopaque markers could be utilised to accurately assess lower incisor inclination. Fifty extracted lower incisor teeth were mounted onto a Perspex sheet. Radiopaque markers, manufactured from 1 mm wide strips of lead film from used peri-apical radiographs, were attached to the crowns of the mounted teeth. A lateral cephalometric radiograph was taken in accordance to standard radiographic procedures (radiograph A). This showed the true inclination of the teeth. A second radiograph was taken with the roots obscured (radiograph B). Three observers traced the inclinations of the teeth on radiograph B (from incisor edge through the middle of the labio-lingual crown-root junction). The determination was done on two different occasions and the assessments compared with the true inclination. Comparative statistical analysis was applied to the readings and the results indicated that this method compared favourably with other methods to determine incisor inclination. In addition, clinical application of opaque markers to the teeth of patients demonstrated the following: it indicated exactly which tooth was being assessed, provided clear definition of the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown</b> in the sagittal plane and served as a constant reference point for clinical, study model and cephalometric measurements. decisions and research validity. Opaque radiographic markers on teeth can contribute to more accurate cephalometric measurements in orthodontics, leading to better diagnoses, treatment planning and research validity.

40|$|One of {{the aims}} in {{treating}} traumatiseed teeth {{is to maintain}} {{the vitality of the}} pulp or allow conditions favourable for pulp revaseularisation. However, infection of the pulp and root canal system may prevent this. A number of pathways have been proposed that allow bacteria to invade the root canal system, however most of these pathways cannot account for pulp infection in teeth that did not sustain injury to the periodontal attachment. Enamel/dentine cracks have been proposed as a portal for backrial invasion of seemingly intact teeth and the aim {{of this study was to}} determine if bacteria could invade the root canal system after a simulated traumatic episode. Twenty intact and sound upper central incisors were chosen and prepared. One tooth was selected as a sterility control and the external crown surface of the remaining 19 teeth was subjected to infection with Streptococcus gordonii in a bacterial microleak-age model. Over 7 days samples of growth media from the root canal system were taken and tested for bacteria. Sixteen of the teeth did not demonstrate bacterial invasion over the time frame. These teeth were then prepared for testing in a pendulum impact device and were subjected to a blow which did not fracture the crowns or dislodge the tooth from its simulated alveolus. The teeth were then prepared and tested in the bacterial microleakagc model. After impact seven of the teeth demonstrated bacterial invasion of the root canal system (P= 0. 002). These teeth were then rcprcpared lor testing in the bacterial microleakagc model. The crowns of live teeth, selected at random, were coated with two layers of light cured unfilled resin, tin-remaining two were used as positive controls. All the teeth coated with resin did not demonstrate bacterial invasion (P= 0. 00), while the positive controls demonstrated invasion. The results suggested that enamel/dentine infractions were pathways for bacterial invasion of the root canal system of traumatiscd teeth. The application of unfilled resin to the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown</b> prevented infection. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate in vitro, the coronal microfiltration of two types of cements –zinc oxide-eugenol/silicone- using the obturation technique with lateral condensation. For this, 60 single-rooted teeth were used of recent extraction, to which the <b>anatomical</b> <b>crown</b> was sectioned to them; all the pieces were prepared crown-apical with gates-glidden drills and soon they were used Flex-o-file files with the step-back technique; the pieces were distributed at random in two groups: one of 30 pieces were obturated with cement sealant with zinc-eugenol oxide (ENDOFILL®) in conjunction with laterally condensed gutta-percha, and another group of 30 pieces were obturated with cement sealant with silicone (Roeko Seal Automix®) using the same technique. The samples were covered by varnish of nails in all the extension by the root, except in the coronal part and soon they were introduced in Chinese ink by 21 days for the entrance of the same one by passive filtration. The samples by fracture were sectioned to observe the coronal microfiltration of the Chinese ink, registering digital photographies of high precision. The coronal microfiltration was registered using the program Corel Draw X 3. In order to analyze the data statistically, the test was used t-student with which it determined that significant difference between the training groups exists One concludes that the teeth obturated with the cement sealant with silicone displayed minor coronal microfiltration, in degrees and millimeters, that the samples obturated with the cement sealant with zinc oxide - eugenol. El objetivo de esta investigación fue evaluar in vitro la microfiltración coronal de tinta de dos tipos de cementos –oxido de zinc-eugenol/silicona- utilizando la técnica de obturación con condensación lateral. Para esto se utilizaron 60 piezas unirradiculares de reciente extracción, a las cuales se les seccionó la corona anatómica; todas las piezas fueron preparadas de forma corono-apical con fresas gates-glidden y luego se utilizaron limas Flex-o-file con la técnica de retroceso (step-back); las piezas fueron distribuidas al azar en dos grupos: uno de 30 piezas recibió obturación con cemento sellador a base de óxido de zinc-eugenol (ENDOFILL®) utilizando la técnica de condensación lateral, y otro grupo de 30 piezas recibió obturación con cemento sellador a base de silicona (Roeko Seal Automix®) utilizando la misma técnica. Las muestras fueron recubiertas por barniz de uñas en toda la extensión de la raíz, excepto en la parte coronal y luego se introdujeron en tinta china por 21 días para el ingreso de la misma por filtración pasiva. Se seccionaron las muestras por fractura para observar la microfiltración coronal de la tinta china, registrándose fotografías digitales de alta precisión. Se registró la microfiltración coronal utilizando el programa Corel Draw X 3. Para analizar estadísticamente los datos, se utilizó la prueba t-student con la que se determinó que existe diferencia significativa entre los grupos de estudio Se concluye que los dientes obturados con el cemento sellador a base de silicona presentaron menor microfiltración coronal, en grados y milímetros, que las muestras obturadas con el cemento sellador a base de óxido de zinc-eugenol...|$|E
