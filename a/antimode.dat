40|$|The {{bifurcation}} {{diagram of}} a single-mode semiconductor laser {{subject to a}} delayed optical feedback is examined by using numerical continuation methods. For this, we show {{how to cope with}} the special symmetry properties of the equations. As the feedback strength is increased, branches of modes and <b>antimodes</b> appear, and we have found that pairs of modes and <b>antimodes</b> are connected by closed branches of periodic solutions (bifurcation bridges). Such connections seem generically present as new pairs of modes and <b>antimodes</b> appear. We subsequently investigate the behavior of the first connection {{as a function of the}} linewidth enhancement factor and the feedback phase. Our results extend and confirm existing results and hypotheses reported in the literature. For large values of the linewidth enhancement factor (alpha = 5 - 6), bridges break through homoclinic orbits.

40|$|Abstract. We analyse the {{stability}} of the steady-state solutions of the compound system formed by a single-longitudinal-mode semiconductor laser and an external reflector. Of the large number of these external cavity modes (ECMs) created in pairs of modes and <b>antimodes</b> by moderate feedback, the <b>antimodes</b> are always unstable, while the modes may be stable or unstable when created. The ECMs that have a large positive frequency shift with respect to the emission frequency of the solitary laser are unstable when created. In contrast, the ECMs that have a large, negative frequency shift are stable on creation and remain stable over a relatively large feedback range. For sufficiently large feedback an ECM that is created stable gives way to a time-dependent solution (limit cycle or torus) that is localized in phase space around the ECM; several time-dependent attractors may coexist. Approximating the dynamical equations, taking into account terms up to second order, we obtain relations for the amplitudes of the oscillations of the laser variables for these attractors. The external cavity length and the injection current are key parameters which determine these amplitudes. Our approximations are in good agreement with numerical simulations, and hold even far from the bifurcation points where these attractors originate. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We measure {{experimentally}} {{the effects}} of injection current modulation on the statistical distribution of time intervals between power-dropout events occuring in an external-cavity semiconductor laser operating in the low-frequency fluctuation regime. These statistical distributions are sensitive indicators {{of the presence of}} pump current modulation. Under most circumstances, we find that weak low-frequency (in the vicinity of 19 MHz) modu-lation of the current causes the dropouts to occur preferentially at intervals that are integral multiples of the modulation period. The dropout events can be entrained by the periodic perturbations when the modulation amplitude is large (peak-to-peak amplitude 8 % of the dc injection current). We conjecture that modulation induces a dropout when the modulation frequency is equal to the difference in frequency between a mode of the extended cavity laser and its adjacent <b>antimode.</b> We also find that the statistical distribution of the dropout events is unaffected by the periodic perturbations when the modulation frequency is equal to the free spectral range of the external cavity. Numerical simulations of the extended-cavity laser display qualitatively similar behavior. The relationship of these phenomena to stochastic resonance is discussed and a possible use of the modulated laser dynamics for chaos communication is described.

40|$|Catastrophe {{theory is}} a {{mathematical}} formalism for modeling nonlinear systems whose discontinuous behavior {{is determined by}} smooth changes in {{a small number of}} driving parameters. Fitting a catastrophe model to noisy data constitutes a serious challenge, however, because catastrophe theory was formulated specifically for deterministic systems. Loren Cobb addressed this challenge by developing a stochastic counterpart of catastrophe theory (SCT) based on Itô stochastic differential equations. In SCT, the stable and unstable equilibrium states of the system correspond to the modes and the <b>antimodes</b> of the empirical probability density function, respectively. Unfortunately, SCT is not invariant under smooth and invertible transformations of variables—this is an important limitation, since invariance to diffeomorphic transformations is essential in deterministic catastrophe theory. From the Itô transformation rules we derive a generalized version of SCT that does remain invariant under transformation and can include Cobb’s SCT as a special case. We show that an invariant function is obtained by multiplying the probability density function with the diffusion function of the stochastic process. This invariant function can be estimated by a straightforward time series analysis based on level crossings. We illustrate the invariance problem and its solution with two applications...|$|R
40|$|Modes, {{or local}} maxima, are often {{among the most}} {{interesting}} features of a probability density function. Given a set of data drawn from an unknown density, it is frequently desirable to {{know whether or not}} the density is multimodal, and various procedures have been suggested for investigating the question of multimodality in the context of hypothesis testing. Available tests, however, suffer from the encumbrance of testing the entire density at once, frequently through the use of nonparametric density estimates using a single bandwidth parameter. Such a procedure puts the investigator examining a density with several modes of varying sizes at a disadvantage. A new test is proposed involving testing the reality of individual observed modes, rather than directly testing the number of modes of the density as a whole. The test statistic used {{is a measure of the}} size of the mode, the absolute integrated difference between the estimated density and the same density with the mode in question excised at the level of the higher of its two surrounding <b>antimodes.</b> Samples are simulated from a conservative member of the composite null hypothesis to estimate p-values within a Monte Carlo setting. Such a test can be combined with the graphical notion of a "mode tree," in which estimated mode locations are plotted over a range of kernel bandwidths. In this way, one can obtain a procedure for examining, in an adaptive fashion, not only the reality of individual modes, but also the overall number of modes of the density. A proof of consistency of the test statistic is offered, simulation results are presented, and applications to real data are illustrated...|$|R
40|$|The Cytochrome P 450 {{family of}} enzymes is {{responsible}} for the majority of Phase I metabolism, and has been identified as an important source of pharmacokinetic variation in therapeutic responses. CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 2 D 6, metabolising > 35 % of commonly prescribed medications, are two of the most important pharmacogenetic markers that have been studied with the aim of improving treatment response and reducing adverse drug reactions. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AmpliChip CYP 450 Test (AmpliChip) was compared to a previously developed PCR-RFLP platform and a newly developed XLPCR+ Sequencing platform for the ability to identifying genotype and predicting phenotype for CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 2 D 6 respectively. The AmpliChip was found not to be genotypically comprehensive enough for evaluating CYP 2 C 19 genotype, not robust enough for determining CYP 2 D 6 genotype and inaccurate in predicting phenotype for both. The XLPCR+ Sequencing method identified three novel alleles and one sub-variant. Advances in online column-switching solid phase extraction generated a rapid and robust LCMS/ MS method for simultaneously quantifying the probe drugs omeprazole (CYP 2 C 19 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP 2 D 6 substrate) and their metabolites. <b>Antimodes</b> were identified for phenotypic cut-offs which offered measured phenotype for comparison to predicted phenotype. Omeprazole metabolism by CYP 2 C 19 correlated well with predicted phenotype in a demographically representative South African cohort. There are concerns regarding the use of omeprazole as a probe drug as participants predicted to be ultrarapid metabolisers for CYP 2 C 19 had similar rates to extensive metabolisers. Regardless of this concern, decreased metabolism was assigned to the CYP 2 C 19 * 15 for the first time. CYP 2 D 6 predicted phenotype correlated very well with measured phenotype, validating the suitability of dextromethorphan use for measuring CYP 2 D 6 metabolism. Substrate modified activity score using 0. 5 to predict intermediate metabolisers fine-tuned the XLPCR+ Sequencing platform for phenotype prediction. This finding, along with observations in CYP 2 C 19 metabolism of omeprazole, highlights the importance of substrate specific phenotype prediction strategies. Controversially, attempts to associate CYP 2 D 6 phenotype prediction with risperidone-related adverse drug reactions has yielded conflicting results. The XL-PCR+Sequencing platform was able to discount this association by predicting a variety of metabolisers in a pilot cohort selected to be experiencing risperidone-related adverse drug reactions. The comprehensive capability of the XL-PCR+Sequencing allowed for the identification of an additional novel allele in this cohort. The data presented in thisthesis has provided insight into the relationship between predicted and measured phenotype for CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 2 D 6 in the South African population. The XL-PCR+Sequencing platform can be used for future research or can be applied to improve treatment outcome. The LC-MS/MS method developed could be used for future evaluations of predicted and measured phenotype with the ability to be adjusted for therapeutic drug monitoring.

Among the different cytochromes responsible for drug disposition, cytochrome P 450 2 D 6 (CYP 2 D 6) is a polymorphic enzyme accountable for the clearance of 25 % to 30 % of medications used including cardiovascular and neuroactive drugs. Severe clinical implications can result from CYP 2 D 6 polymorphism, hence the significance of studying the incidence of different phenotypes in the white Lebanese population. Methods: A 30 -mg dose of dextromethorphan hydrobromide was administered to 156 volunteers. Urine samples were collected 8 hours after dextromethorphan administration then stored at - 80 [degrees]C until analysis for dextromethorphan levels and its metabolites using a sensitive, simple high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Results: The distribution frequency histogram of CYP 2 D 6 metabolic ratios (MRs) showed a bimodal distribution with {{a gap between the}} metabolic ratios of 0. 14 and 0. 31 corresponding to log MR between - 0. 85 and - 0. 51.

Blood samples {{were taken from}} 77 of these subjects for CYP 2 D 6 genotyping. Bimodality {{in the distribution of}} the log 10 debrisoquine/ 4 -hydroxydebrisoquine ratio was not evident from visual inspection and by kernel density analysis. The results of genotyping indicated that 82 % of the population were either homozygous for the wild-type CYP 2 D 6 gene or heterozygous for the wild type allele and the whole gene deletion. Eighteen per cent of the Sinhalese population were heterozygous for the CYP 2 D 6 B mutation and the wild-type allele. All of these genotypes give rise to the extensive metaboliser phenotype in white Caucasians. No CYP 2 D 6 A mutations were identified and no individuals who were homozygous for the mutant alleles were detected, which is in accord with an absence of phenotypic poor metabolisers of debrisoquine. The mutant CYP 2 D 6 allele frequency in Sinhalese (9 %) is only half that observed in white Caucasians. The S/R-mephenytoin ratio ranged from 0. 09 to 2. 27 (median 0. 38). By visual inspection and kernel density analysis the distribution of the S/R-mephenytoin ratio was bimodal and, using a value of 0. 9 for the <b>antimode,</b> 16 (14 %) subjects were poor metabolisers. In conclusion, the prevalence of the poor metaboliser phenotype in Sinhalese appears much lower for debrisoquine and higher for mephenytoin than in white Caucasians.

40|$|Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is {{the primary}} choice for sea ice {{monitoring}} due to its all-weather, day-and-night capability and regular delivery of high resolution images. This thesis presents methods for estimation of sea ice concentration and drift, a multi-sensor study of Baltic Sea ice radar signatures and an interferometric study of landfast sea ice. The ice concentration is determined by combining spatial autocorrelation and backscatter intensity in a neural network, which is trained with ice charts for the Baltic Sea. The root-mean-square error of the estimated concentration {{is found to be}} 7 percentage points for a spatially uniform distribution of ice concentrations. The ice drift is estimated from sequential SAR images by combining two methods: 1) areal matching by phase correlation, and 2) feature-based matching by detection and tracking of individual floes. The first method includes a module to resolve rotation. The second method is designed to assist tracking in the marginal ice zone and processes images in two steps: Firstly, by segmentation based on intensity thresholding to obtain objects corresponding to floes, and secondly, by feature tracking of floe outlines. A thresholding method that locates the <b>antimode</b> of imbalanced bimodal distributions is introduced, as well as a novel method for handling of aggregated floes. Assessment against manual measurements showed that up to 98 % of drift vectors were estimated correctly, though the number varies with image pair and internal settings. Further, the ice drift algorithm is applied to C-band SAR images from a two-week spring period in the Fram Strait, and the measured ice drift is compared to drift modelled by the ice-ocean model HIROMB. The model is shown to overestimate the drift by a factor 1 - 2. 5, attributable to an underestimated ice thickness, and to exhibit a 10 °- 30 ° offset in drift direction, independent of the drift direction. The thesis also evaluates the usefulness of spaceborne SAR sensors for ice charting. The traditionally employed C-band data is compared against X- and L-band data in terms of information content. It is found that L-band co-polarisation aids identification of ridge clusters and is less affected by microscale ice structures, whereas the information content in C- and X-band data is largely equivalent. Finally, interferometric acquisitions over landfast sea ice in the Bay of Bothnia demonstrate the capability of X-band SAR for small-scale deformation mapping of fast ice. Deformation occurs for example around leads, rocky islands and grounded ice ridges...|$|E
