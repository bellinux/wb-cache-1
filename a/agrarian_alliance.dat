40|$|É recorrente, na história brasileira, a atuação da burguesia agrária para limitar os alcances, as possibilidades e a viabilidade da refonna agrária no país. Nesses embates, suas associações de classe apresentam importantes funções. No presente trabalho, estudamos o discurso e a atuação de uma delas, em relação à reforma agrária, entre 1995 e 2001. Trata-se da Confederação da Agricultura e Pecuária do Brasil (CNA), a organização patronal rural que reúne o maior número e diversidade de filiados, sendo a única com caráter sindical em âmbito nacional. O objetivo deste estudo é demonstrar a influência da CNA sobre os rumos da reforma agrária no país, realizando uma análise comparativa do papel desempenhado por diferentes associações nacionais da burguesia agrária CMNP,OCB, SRB e UDR). Com isto, desejamos contribuir para a reflexão sobre o poder da burguesia agrária, suas alianças com outras classes e frações de classe e suas contradições, bem como os limites atuais e potenciais da reforma agrária no BrasilIn the Brazilian history it is {{recurring}} {{the fact}} of the agrarian bourgeoisie to limit the land reform reaches and possibilities in the country. In those discussions, their cIass associations pIay an important role. In the present work, we analyze the speech and the performance of one of these associations in reIation to the land reform in the period between 1995 and 2001. It is the National Agriculture Confederation of Brazil, the rural patronal organization which gathers the largest number and most diverse in kind of affiliated, being the only one with syndical character at a national extent. The objective {{of this study is to}} show the influence from the National Agriculture Confederation on the directions of the land reform in the country. We want to know also if the National Agriculture Confederation pIays any specific role in the disputes involving land reform compared to other national agrarian bourgeoisie associations (MNP, OCB, SRB and UDR). Thus, we intend to contribute to reflections about the power of the <b>agrarian</b> bourgeoisie, their <b>alliances</b> and contradictions with other classes and class fractions, as well as the potential and current limits of the land reform in Brazi...|$|R

5000|$|Andrew Jackson’s {{victory in}} the 1828 presidential race was {{achieved}} through harnessing the widespread social resentments and political unrest persisting since the economic crisis of 1819 and the Missouri Crisis of 1820. Jackson’s forces were immensely strengthened by {{the revival of the}} Old Republican North-South <b>agrarian</b> <b>alliance</b> and its state sovereignty precepts.Under the banner of [...] "Jackson and Reform" [...] the Democratic Party launched a spirited and sophisticated campaign against incumbent president John Quincy Adams, personifying him as a purveyor of corruption and fraudulent republicanism, and a menace to American democracy. At the heart of the campaign was the conviction that Andrew Jackson had been denied the presidency in 1824 only through a [...] "corrupt bargain" [...] devised by Adams and Clay; a Jackson victory promised to rectify this betrayal of the popular will.|$|E
