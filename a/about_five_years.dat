5|$|Sony {{announced}} The Last of Us Part II at the PlayStation Experience {{event on}} December 3, 2016. The story takes place <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> {{after the first}} game; Ellie and Joel return, with players controlling Ellie.

5|$|Banksia canei lacks a {{lignotuber}} {{and appears}} to regenerate from bushfire by seed, although its response to fire has been little studied. The follicles remain closed until burnt, although some do open spontaneously after five years or so. The fungus Banksiamyces toomansis, of the order Helotiales, infects older cones and seed, and hence seed older than <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> is often not viable. Plectronidium australiense is a species of anamorphic fungus that was recovered from a dead branch of B. canei at Healesville Sanctuary and described in 1986.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Littell {{decided to}} {{quit his job}} at Action Against Hunger and started {{research}} which lasted 18 months, during which he went to Germany, Ukraine, Russia and Poland, and read around 200 books, mainly about Nazi Germany, the Eastern Front, the Nuremberg Trials, and the genocide process. In addition, the author studied the literature and film archives of World War II and the post-war trials. Littell worked on this novel for <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> This book is his first novel written in French and his second novel after the science fiction themed Bad Voltage in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the aim {{to make use of}} {{renewable}} resources, the furniture in Poh Ern Shih for its resident monastics is made from bamboo. Bamboo is considered {{to one of the most}} ecologically friendly materials for use in home furnishing and flooring, because it can be harvested without felling the entire tree. There is therefore no need for replanting, and the bamboo is allowed to regain its full height again over <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> ready to be harvested again.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{with the}} {{reliability}} of early batches of transistors meant that the machine's {{mean time between failures}} was about 90 minutes, which improved once the more reliable junction transistors became available. The Transistor Computer's design was adopted by the local engineering firm of Metropolitan-Vickers in their Metrovick 950, in which all the circuitry was modified to make use of junction transistors. Six Metrovick 950s were built, the first completed in 1956. They were successfully deployed within various departments of the company and were in use for <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

5|$|Richard Hakluyt, {{the second}} of four sons, was born in Eyton in Herefordshire in 1553.

Hakluyt's cousin, also named Richard Hakluyt, of the Middle Temple, became his guardian.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{is black}} in the {{nominate}} subspecies but pale or yellowish in adults of the smaller Indian ginginianus. Rasmussen and Anderton (2005) suggest that this variation may need further study, particularly due to the intermediate black-tipped bill described in rubripersonatus. The facial skin is yellow and unfeathered down to the throat. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage but breeding males have a deeper orange facial skin colour than females. Females average slightly larger and are about 10–15% heavier than males. Young birds are blackish or chocolate brown with black and white patches. The adult plumage is attained only after <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dales {{decides to}} {{investigate}} Exley's hometown of Macon, Georgia, and discovers that {{a boy with}} Exley's name had vanished <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> previously. That night at the hotel, Dales hears noises from Exley's hotel room and breaks in, only to find Exley in his true form as an alien. Exley tells Dales that he was forbidden from intermingling with the human race but {{fell in love with}} the game of baseball and remained on Earth. Meanwhile, the Alien Bounty Hunter, who has been pursuing the renegade alien ever since he deserted his alien heritage, takes Exley's form and murders a scientist who is investigating the green ooze that Dales found. After learning of the attack, Dales warns Exley that he is now wanted by the police, and Exley goes into hiding.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{are unsure}} whether either chronicler was present that evening. According to Crane, Froissart {{wrote of the}} event <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> later, and the monk about ten. Veenstra speculates that the monk {{may have been an}} {{eyewitness}} (as he was for much of Charles VI's reign) and that his account is the more accurate of the two. The monk's chronicle is generally accepted as essential for understanding the King's court, however his neutrality may have been affected by his pro-Burgundian and anti-Orléanist stance, causing him to depict the royal couple in a negative manner. A third account was written in the mid-15th century by Jean Juvenal des Ursins in his biography of Charles, L'Histoire de Charles VI: roy de France, not published until 1614.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} Arkham Origins take place <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> before , in midwinter Gotham City. Batman, an {{experienced}} crime-fighter {{in the second}} year of his career, is not yet the veteran superhero of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. He is a mysterious force; even the police do not know whether he is a vigilante, a myth or a supernatural being. Batman has fought ordinary criminals and gangsters, and is accustomed to being stronger and faster than his opponents. However, on a snowy Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes: eight professional assassins hoping to collect a $50-million bounty placed on Batman's head by Black Mask. Villains (including the Joker) take advantage of the assassins' arrival to launch their own schemes, and Black Mask's henchmen instigate a rise in crime and gang activity in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> after mine closure.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} his residency in ophthalmology, Paul moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky. He has held a state-issued medical license since moving there in 1993. He received {{his first job}} from John Downing of Downing McPeak Vision Centers, which brought him to Bowling Green after {{completing his}} residency. Paul worked for Downing for <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> before parting ways. Afterwards, {{he went to work}} at the Graves Gilbert Clinic, a private medical group in Bowling Green, for 10years before creating his own practice in a converted one-story house across the street from Downing's office. After his election to the U.S. Senate, he merged his practice with Downing's medical practice. Paul has faced two malpractice lawsuits between 1993 and 2010; he was cleared in one case while the other was settled for $50,000. His medical work has been praised by Downing and he has medical privileges at two Bowling Green hospitals. Paul specializes in cataract and glaucoma surgeries, LASIK procedures, and corneal transplants. As a member of the Bowling Green Noon Lions Club, Paul founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic in 2009 to help provide eye surgery and exams for those who cannot afford to pay. Paul won the Melvin Jones Fellow Award for Dedicated Humanitarian Services from the Lions Club International Foundation for his work establishing the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic.|$|E
