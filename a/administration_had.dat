5|$|By {{the time}} President Reagan {{had given his}} first speech on the epidemic, some six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been {{diagnosed}} with AIDS and 20,849 had died of it. By the end of 1989, the year Reagan left office, 115,786 people {{had been diagnosed with}} AIDS in the United States, and more than 70,000 of them had died of it. It has been suggested that far fewer would have died, both then and in the decades that followed, if the Reagan <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> applied the same determination in combatting AIDS as the Ford <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> applied to fighting Legionnaires' disease.|$|E
5|$|Edsall's 2012 team {{compiled}} a 4–8 record, losing four quarterbacks to injury, and eventually starting a linebacker at the position. The team's record improved from 2011 nonetheless but still {{not as much}} as fans, alumni and the <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> hoped.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the Somali Republic's {{civilian}} government merged the Somali Credit Bank (Credito Somalo) with the Banca Nazionale Somala. The earlier trusteeship <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> established the Somali Credit Bank in 1954 in the Trust Territory of Somalia.|$|E

5|$|Administratively, the German <b>{{administration}}</b> <b>had</b> a Zivilverwaltung (Civil Administration) {{tasked with}} dealing with day-to-day matters {{and a network}} of local Kommandanturen in towns and cities across Belgium. It could also call on up to 80,000 soldiers. In most cases, however, the administration was content to use the existing Belgian civil service and local government for much of its administration.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, more {{resistance}} movements {{supported by}} Ethiopia's communist Derg <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> sprung {{up across the}} country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative center of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, about 5,500 {{people worked}} at Fornebu. Of these, 3,600 {{worked for the}} airlines, {{including}} ground services. The airport <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> 350 employees, including administration, air control, fire fighters, meteorology and maintenance. The remaining 500 people worked for other public offices, including the police and customs, as well as service employees working for private companies involved with passenger services.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch accused Sukarno and Hatta of {{collaborating with}} the Japanese, and denounced the Republic as a {{creation}} of Japanese fascism.

5|$|The {{building}} was built under a self-imposed comprehensive minority contracting {{and affirmative action}} package that met the city's 1985 30% hiring rule for public sector projects. Chicago mayor Harold Washington's <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> passed an edict that 30% of the work for public sector projects be set aside for minority and women-owned businesses. In a show of support for this rule, Stein & Co. and AT adopted the rule for their private development.|$|E

5|$|To a {{significant}} extent, the royal <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> achieved territorial stability by battening onto minsters. Well might late tenth-century polemicists blame kings of Wessex and their magnates, {{even more than}} the Vikings, for despoiling the Church's resources. The scars of the Viking raids had healed, but the secularization of minsters continued on its slow, consistent course.|$|E
5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks. ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.|$|E
5|$|Among Jones' other accomplishments {{were the}} passage of a {{mandatory}} seat belt law, an increase in funding for the state park system, and the phasing out of the state inheritance tax. He also established the state's largest-ever reserve trust fund using income from the state's sales, income, corporate, coal, severance, and property taxes. He exceeded his goal of having a 7.4percent minority representation in the state workforce, and appointed three times more African-Americans than the previous <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> recruited. He also appointed more women to government positions than his predecessor, including Sara Combs, the first woman to serve on the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> {{returned}} to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected {{members of his}} party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their {{candidate}} for president, a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly took aim at Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|Departing {{from the}} main central {{administrative}} system generally known as the Three Departments and Six Ministries system, which was instituted by various dynasties since late Han (202 BCE – 220 CE), the Ming <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> only one Department, the Secretariat, that controlled the Six Ministries. Following {{the execution of the}} Chancellor Hu Weiyong in 1380, the Hongwu Emperor abolished the Secretariat, the Censorate, and the Chief Military Commission and personally took charge of the Six Ministries and the regional Five Military Commissions. Thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers. The Grand Secretariat, at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork, was instituted, but without employing grand counselors, or chancellors.|$|E
5|$|Given Armstrong's concerns, the {{administration}} employed general counsel J. Patrick Abell {{to file a}} friendly test case to determine {{the constitutionality of the}} incentive package. While the suit was pending, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that the <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> failed to include the interest on the bonds used to finance the expenditures in its estimation of the cost; this, plus the cost overruns reported by the Herald-Leader, had already pushed the total cost of the package to about $354million by late September 1986. In October, Toyota agreed to cover the cost overruns associated with preparing the site for construction.|$|E
5|$|Guest and Knowles were {{summoned to}} the Defence Department and told to stop recruiting. The <b>Administration</b> <b>had</b> decided to raise a {{regiment}} in Rhodesia, and Guest joined the Salisbury battalion of the 1st Rhodesian Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant. The battalion was sent to South Africa to assist in suppressing the 1914 Maritz Rebellion by Boers opposed to fighting for Britain. It was not, however, deployed against the Rebellion and when it ended the battalion was sent, with the Imperial Light Horse, to reinforce the South African troops in the South-West Africa Campaign in German South-West Africa, present-day Namibia. They landed at Lambert's Bay on Christmas morning 1914, but made no contact with the enemy until they were sent to Swakopmund.|$|E
