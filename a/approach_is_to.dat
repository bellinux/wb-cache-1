The molecules are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
5|$|Gergonne's <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} the solution circles in pairs. Let {{a pair of}} solution circles be denoted as CA and CB (the pink circles in Figure6), and let their tangent points with the three given circles be denoted as A1, A2, A3, and B1, B2, B3, respectively. Gergonne's solution aims to locate these six points, and thus solve for the two solution circles.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomic {{analysis}} pipelines use {{two approaches}} in the annotation of coding {{regions in the}} assembled contigs. The first <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> identify genes based upon homology with genes that are already publicly available in sequence databases, usually by simple BLAST searches. This type of approach is implemented in the program MEGAN4.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{properties}} of graphene and its few-layers <b>are</b> engineered <b>to</b> make them highly conductive. Two different <b>approaches</b> <b>were</b> implemented <b>to</b> achieve this goal. One <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> increase the concentration of charge carriers by intercalation of acceptor FeCl 3 molecules between graphene planes. This resulted in a highly conductive yet transparent material which can be useful for applications. Another <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> increase the mobility of carriers by means of removing surface contamination in the current annealing process. Optimal annealing parameters were found and a reproducible cleaning method was suggested...|$|R

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships and}} heredity {{of a group}} of organisms is called its phylogeny. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships. As an example, species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless cactus such as an Echinocactus. However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.|$|E
5|$|The {{matching}} rules {{can be described}} in several ways. One <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|Another {{brute force}} <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> match up the {{frequency}} {{distribution of the}} letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E

5|$|One <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{acknowledge}} that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances {{of a general}} statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E
5|$|One inefficient {{approach}} {{to finding the}} GCD of two natural numbers a and b is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number b. The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with b, or exponentially {{in the number of}} digits. Another inefficient <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, {{so we have}} only {{to be sure that}} a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> look at the way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E
