25|$|Atmospheric GHG {{concentrations}} can {{be related}} to changes in global mean temperature by the climate sensitivity. Projections of future global warming are affected by different estimates of climate sensitivity. For a given increase in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>concentration</b> of GHGs, high estimates of climate sensitivity suggest that relatively more future warming will occur, while low estimates of climate sensitivity suggest that relatively less future warming will occur. Lower values would correspond with less severe climate impacts, while higher values would correspond with more severe impacts.|$|E
25|$|Radiative forcing is {{a measure}} of how various factors alter the energy balance of the Earth's atmosphere. A {{positive}} radiative forcing will tend to increase the energy of the Earth-atmosphere system, leading to a warming of the system. Between the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750, and the year 2005, the increase in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>concentration</b> of carbon dioxide (chemical formula: CO2) led to a positive radiative forcing, averaged over the Earth's surface area, of about 1.66 watts per square metre (abbreviated Wm−2).|$|E

25|$|Many {{possible}} triggering mechanisms {{could account}} for the beginning of a snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a supervolcano, a reduction in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>concentration</b> of greenhouse gases such as methane and/or carbon dioxide, changes in Solar energy output, or perturbations of Earth's orbit. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen equator as cold as modern Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|James Dewar, the {{scientist}} after whom the Dewar (vacuum flask) is named, {{spent much time}} studying activated carbon and published a paper regarding its adsorption capacity with regard to gases. In this paper, he discovered that cooling the carbon to liquid nitrogen temperatures allowed it to adsorb significant quantities of numerous air gases, among others, that could then be recollected by simply allowing the carbon to warm again and that coconut based carbon was superior for the effect. He uses oxygen as an example, wherein the activated carbon would typically adsorb the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>concentration</b> (21%) under standard conditions, but release over 80% oxygen if the carbon was first cooled to low temperatures.|$|E

Microaerophiles, like the obligate anaerobes, are damaged by normal <b>atmospheric</b> <b>concentrations</b> of oxygen. However, microaerophiles metabolise energy aerobically, and obligate anaerobes metabolise energy anaerobically. Microaerophiles therefore require oxygen (typically 2-10% O2) for growth.
