40|$|With the {{aggravation}} of {{acid rain}} pollution and the enlarging of the acid rain regions in China, the sensitivity evaluation of natural waters to acidification on a regional scale become increasingly important. Acidification models based on a single indicator cannot give much information on <b>aquatic</b> <b>acidification</b> because of their simplicity; yet acidification models based on physical, chemical, hydrological and/or biological processes are not suitable for large scale regional research because of their exceptional complexity. In this paper, a multi-indicator comprehensive model for <b>aquatic</b> <b>acidification</b> sensitivity is proposed and applied. This model comprises {{some of the most}} important factors that are considered to influence water acidification, in particular: acid neutralization capacity, acidification capacity, acidification sensitive index, cation exchange capacity of soil, pH of soil, and weathering shuck types of soil-forming. It highlights the key stages of <b>aquatic</b> <b>acidification</b> by acid neutralization capacity, acidification capacity, and acidification sensitivity index. The model thereby estimates the acidification sensitivity of natural waters by using these indicators according to a weighting system. Equal-weight and non-equal-weight approaches are separately used to combine the six indicators into an overall sensitivity index of <b>aquatic</b> <b>acidification.</b> The result derived from an application to China on a national scale indicates the practicability of this approach. In China, the sensitive natural waters emerge in Southern China, which is already a heavy acid rain region, and in Northeastern China where the rainwater is beginning to become much acidic...|$|E
40|$|Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{in the evaluation of}} chemical processes and or products in order {{to take into account the}} Supply Chain and its environmental constraints and burdens. Regarding to the environmental assessment of chemical processes and/or products two main variables need to be taken into account: Natural Resources Sustainability (NRS) and Environmental Burdens Sustainability (EBS). NRS includes the use of energy, water and materials whereas EBS is given by the environmental sustainability metrics developed by the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE). The main components of EBS have been classified in 5 environmental impacts to the atmosphere (acidification, global warming, human health effects, stratospheric ozone depletion and photochemical ozone formation), 5 aquatic media impacts (<b>aquatic</b> <b>acidification,</b> aquatic oxygen demand, ecotoxicity (metals), ecotoxicity (others) and eutrophication) and 2 land impacts (hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal). To reduce the number of variables and thus, the complexity, the development of a normalisation and weighting procedure is required. This work proposes the normalization of EB based on the threshold values of the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) and a similar procedure based on the values given by the BREF document on waste incineration for the NRS normalisation. This procedure will help in the decision making process in the waste management field and in the particular, in Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) ...|$|E
40|$|Air quality {{models are}} {{increasingly}} {{used to develop}} estimates of dry and wet deposition of sulfate and nitrate in watersheds (because of lack of measurements) {{in an effort to}} determine the acidifying deposition load into the aquatic systems. These models need to be rigorously evaluated to ensure that one can rely on the modeled quantities instead of the measured quantities. In the United State (U. S.), these models have been proposed for use in establishing national standards based on modeled quantities. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering <b>aquatic</b> <b>acidification</b> as the main ecological endpoint of concern in determining the secondary national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. Acidification is tied to depositions of sulfur and nitrogen, which are linked to ambient concentrations of the elements. As EPA proposes to use a chemical transport model in linking deposition to ambient concentration, it is important to investigate how the currently used chemical transport models perform in predicting depositions and ambient concentrations of relevant chemical species and quantify the variability in their estimates. In this study, several annual simulations by multiple chemical transport models for the entire continental U. S. domain are evaluated against available measurement data for depositions and ambient concentrations of sulfur oxides and reactive nitrogen species. The model performance results vary by evaluation time-scale and geographical region. Evaluation of annualized quantities (annual average ambient concentrations and annual total depositions) suppresses the large variances shown in the evaluation using the observation’s native shorter-term time-scales (e. g., weekly). In addition, there is a large degree of bias and error (especially for deposition fluxes) in the modeling results that brings to question the suitability of using air quality models to provide estimates of deposition loads. Variability in the ratio of deposition to ambient concentration, so-called the Transference Ratio that EPA has proposed to use in linking deposition to ambient concentration, is also examined. Our study shows that the Transference Ratios as well as total reduced nitrogen deposition, another modeled parameter EPA proposed to use in the process of determining the new secondary standard, vary considerably by geographical region and by model simulation...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of global amphibian declines {{is a testament}} to the profound effects of human-induced global change on natural environments. With amphibians being the most threatened of all vertebrate taxa, and also important bioindicators of environmental health, understanding the causes of their declines is critical for their conservation, and possibly the conservation of other species. While research over the past two decades has identified a range of potential causative agents, it has become widely accepted that amphibian declines are likely to be a result of complex interactions between multiple environmental stressors that lead to compounding negative effects. The overarching aim of this thesis was to examine the interactive effects of ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR) and other environmental stressors (predation and temperature) on the early life stages of a model amphibian species, the striped marsh frog Limnodynastes peronii. UVBR is highly damaging to living organisms and has increased globally as a consequence of stratospheric ozone depletion. The coincident timing of the beginning of stratospheric ozone depletion and the beginning of rapid amphibian declines in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s prompted interest in increased environmental UVBR as a potential contributor to amphibian declines with numerous studies showing that exposure to UVBR is detrimental to amphibians. UVBR has also been shown to interact synergistically with other environmental stressors, including a range of contaminants, <b>aquatic</b> <b>acidification,</b> low temperature, and infectious disease, such that the effect of the stressors combined is greater than that caused by the additive effects of the stressors independently. With the rapid disappearance of amphibian populations from seemingly pristine habitats around the world, understanding how UVBR interacts with natural stressors, such as predation and temperature, is particularly important given that anthropogenic stressors, such as contaminants, may have less of an impact in these habitats. The first specific aim of this thesis was to examine the independent and interactive effects of UVBR and predation stress in the form of predatory chemical cues (PCC) on L. peronii tadpole survival and morphology (Chapter 2). Using a controlled laboratory experiment the following questions were addressed: (1) do UVBR and PCC interact synergistically to enhance the mortality of tadpoles above the additive effects of the stressors independently?; and (2), does exposure to UVBR affect the ability of tadpoles to morphologically respond to PCC? UVBR and PCC were found to interact synergistically to enhance the mortality of L. peronii tadpoles by nearly two-fold above the additive mortality caused by the stressors independently. Exposure to UVBR was also found to suppress the development of predator-induced morphological defences. Specifically, tadpoles simultaneously exposed to UVBR and PCC did not develop the deep tail that was expressed by tadpoles exposed to PCC alone. A deep tail is a prominent feature of tadpoles exposed to predators and is strongly associated with increased tadpole survival in the presence of predators, thus the lack of a deep tail in tadpoles exposed to UVBR and PCC has implications for their fitness in a predator environment. The fitness consequences of UVBR-induced sublethal effects is poorly studied, thus the second specific aim of this thesis was to examine the independent and interactive effects of UVBR and PCC on a suite of traits of L. peronii embryos and tadpoles (embryonic hatching success and hatching time, post-hatch tadpole survival, size, morphology, behaviour, and locomotor performance), and assess tadpole survival time in a predator environment to evaluate the potential fitness consequences (Chapter 3). Exposure to a 3 − 6 % increase in UVBR, which is comparable to changes in terrestrial UVBR associated with ozone depletion, was found to have no effect on any of the traits measured, except survival time in a predator environment, which was reduced by 22 − 28 %. Exposure to PCC caused tadpoles to hatch earlier, have reduced hatching success, have improved locomotor performance, and survive for longer in a predator environment, but had no effect on tadpole survival, behaviour or morphology. Unlike the findings in Chapter 2, simultaneous exposure to UVBR and PCC resulted in no interactive effects. These findings demonstrate that increased UVBR has the potential to reduce tadpole fitness by compromising their ability to survive encounters with predators, though critically such an effect might not be detectable via some performance measures, such as locomotor performance, which was not altered by exposure to an increase in UVBR. Exposure to PCC, on the other hand, improves tadpole locomotor performance and fitness, which suggests that an increase in locomotor performance does confer some benefit to survival in a predator environment as one would expect, but with regard to the effects of UVBR, there are clearly additional factors that need to be considered when investigating predator-prey interactions. The third specific aim of this thesis was to evaluate the energetic costs associated with being exposed to UVBR, both alone and in combination with PCC (Chapter 4), in order to understand the physiological basis for the observed negative synergistic effect on tadpole survival in Chapter 2. While several studies have examined the lethal and sublethal effects of UVBR, alone and in combination with other environmental stressors, on amphibians, few have considered how UVBR affects amphibian metabolism, or how amphibian metabolism may change in response to exposure to other stressors in addition to UVBR. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, the independent and interactive effects of UVBR and PCC on the tissue and whole-animal metabolic rate (MR) and activity of L. peronii tadpoles were examined. Exposure to UVBR caused tissue MR to increase by 36 %, but whole-animal MR to decrease by 14 %, which is most likely due to tadpoles reducing their activity levels by 56 %. Exposure to PCC had no significant effect on tissue or whole-animal MR, but caused tadpoles to reduce their activity levels by 36 %, indicating that the whole-animal MR of tadpoles exposed to PCC is elevated relative to their activity levels. Compared to tadpoles exposed to neither stressor, tadpoles exposed simultaneously to UVBR and PCC showed no change in whole-animal MR despite reducing their activity levels by 62 %. These findings show that, for tadpoles, there is an energetic cost associated with being exposed to UVBR and PCC independently, and that this cost is greater when they are exposed to both stressors simultaneously. The synergistic negative effect of UVBR and PCC on tadpole survival found in Chapter 2 is therefore likely to arise as a consequence of the effect of these combined stressors on metabolic rate. The fifth and final aim of this thesis was to examine the thermal-dependence of UVBR effects in the context of an ecologically-relevant fluctuating UVBR and temperature regime to evaluate whether exposure to peak UVBR levels while the temperature is high (35 °C) is more detrimental to pre-metamorphic L. peronii than exposure to peak UVBR levels while the temperature is moderate (25 °C) (Chapter 5). This was examined by measuring embryonic hatching success and hatching time, post-hatch tadpole survival, size, morphology, locomotor performance, and survival time in a predator environment. Embryos exposed to peak UVBR levels at 35 °C hatched 10 h later than those exposed to peak UVBR levels at 25 °C, and as tadpoles, were smaller and consequently swam slower, but in a predator environment exhibited no difference in survival time. There was also no effect of experimental treatment on the hatching success of embryos, nor on the post-hatch survival of tadpoles. These findings, therefore, are not sufficiently strong to support the hypothesis that high temperatures enhance the negative effects of UVBR in pre-metamorphic amphibians. The results from these studies reveal that multiple stressors can interact in ways that are not necessarily predictable from single-factor studies, and that examination of the effects of UVBR in the absence of other ecologically-relevant environment stressors potentially underestimates the impact of UVBR on amphibian populations in natural systems. Researchers in amphibian conservation biology should therefore continue to utilise a multi-factorial experimental approach if we are to gain a comprehensive understanding of the stressors and mechanisms responsible for causing global amphibian declines...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the optimum way of recovering energy from the biodegradable fractions of municipal waste. A part-life cycle study was carried out on the following wastes; paper, food waste, garden waste, wood, non-recyclable mixed municipal waste and refuse derived fuel. The energy recovery processes considered were incineration, gasification, combustion in dedicated plant, anaerobic digestion and combustion in a cement kiln. Methods. The LCA was carried out using WRATE, an LCA tool designed specifically for waste management studies. Additional information on waste composition, waste collection and the performance of the energy recovery processes was obtained from a number of UK-based sources. The results take account of the energy displaced by the waste to energy processes and also the benefits obtained by the associated recycling of digestates, metals and aggregates as appropriate. Results and discussion. For all the waste types considered the maximum benefits in terms of climate change and non-renewable resource depletion would be achieved by using the waste in a cement kiln as a substitute fuel for coal. When considering the impacts in terms of human toxicity, <b>aquatic</b> ecotoxicity, <b>acidification</b> and eutrophication, direct combustion with energy recovery was the best option. The results were found to be highly sensitive to the efficiency of the energy recovery process and the conventional fuel displaced by the recovered energy. Conclusions and recommendations. This study has demonstrated that LCA can be used to determine the benefits and burdens associated with recovering energy from municipal waste fractions. However, the findings were restricted by the lack of reliable data on the performance of waste gasification and anaerobic digestion systems and on the burdens arising from collecting the wastes. It is recommended that further work is carried out to address these data gaps. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{environmental}} profile of laundry detergents at three time points (1988, 1992, and 1998) were compared {{on the basis}} of two distinct, complementary approaches: Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) and Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). The results are presented in this paper and its accompanying paper in this issue (Part I: Product Environmental Risk Assessment). Life-Cycle Inventory (LCI) data from The Netherlands and Sweden were used for this retrospective analysis. The chosen time period studied (1988 – 1998) spans significant, multiple formulation and process change in laundry detergents, including the introduction of compact, then super-compact, granular detergents. Cradle-to-Gate LCAs based on 1 kg of finished product (from raw material supply to packaged finished product leaving the suppliers site) revealed {{no significant differences between the}} products themselves, as manufactured between 1988, 1992 and 1998. Cradle-to-Grave LCAs based on 1000 wash cycles (from raw material supply to disposal of used product) indicated that the consumption of raw materials and energy, as well as environmental emissions (air, water and solid waste), decreased after the introduction of compact detergents in 1988. The LCAs revealed that a number of category indicator values decreased (for <b>acidification,</b> <b>aquatic</b> toxicity greenhouse effects, eutrophication, toxicity, ozone depletion and smog). Furthermore, the results of the LCAs support the conclusion that the differences between The Netherlands and Sweden are due to (1) differences in electrical generation between the countries, (2) differences in energy consumption during consumer use, (3) differences in detergent dosage per wash and (4) differences in the wastewater treatment infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|The PIAC-project {{has been}} a {{multidisciplinary}} survey on acid rain in China. One goal has been to document effects of airborne acidifying compounds on vegetation, soil, soil- and surface- water and aquatic biota. Other goals have been to exchange knowledge between Chinese and Norwegian scientists, as well as visiting research sites in highly polluted areas in China and evaluating their need of support in a future collaborative monitoring and research program. Besides doing field measurements, we have collected samples at more than 20 sites in three areas in China, i. e. Chongqing, Guiyang and Guangzhou. Data from this survey may also {{be used in the}} RAINS-Asia model work, where more data are needed to validate and improve this model. Our survey documents negative effects of air pollution on all ecosystem levels investigated. The air concentration of sulfur in the urban and nearby areas is very high. The concentration of volatile organic compounds is generally high, which means that intcreased NOx emissions in coming years may create increasing O 3 problems. Reduced photosynthetic activity in some plants is documented, as well as soil and surface water <b>acidification.</b> <b>Aquatic</b> biota also reflects the acidification status of the surface waters investigated. However, the degree of damage in these regions is difficult to assess, since too few sites are incorporated in the survey. Surface water acidification is currently not a major enviromental problem in China and will presumably not become one during the next decades. This report also contains a status report about acidification in China (in Appendix A) as well as a proposed framework for a monitoring program based on Norwegian experiences (in Appendix D) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) was conducted for Ethiopian rose cultivation. The LCA covered the cradle-togate production of all inputs to Ethiopian rose cultivation up to, and including transport to the Ethiopian airport. Primary data were collected about materials and resources used as inputs to, and about the product outputs from 21 farms in 4 geographical regions (i. e. Holleta, Sebeta, Debre Ziet, and Ziway). The primary data were imported in, and analyzed with the SimaPro 7. 3 software. Data {{for the production of}} used inputs were taken from the EcoInvent® 2. 0 database. Emissions from input use on the farms were quantified based on estimates and emission factors from various studies and guidelines. The resulting life cycle inventory (LCI) table was next evaluated with the CML 2 baseline 2000 V 2 /world, 1990 /characterization method to quantify the contribution of the rose cultivation chain to 10 environmental impact categories. The set of collected primary data was comprehensive and of high quality. The data point to an intensive use of fertilizers, pesticides, and greenhouse plastic. Production and use of these inputs also represent the major contributors in all environmental impact categories. The largest contribution comes from the production of the used fertilizers, specifically nitrogen-based fertilizers. The use of calcium nitrate dominates Abiotic Depletion (AD), Global Warming (GW), Human Toxicity (HT) and Marine Aquatic Ecotoxicity (MAET). It also makes a large contribution to Ozone Depletion (OD), Acidification (AD) and Fresh water <b>Aquatic</b> Ecotoxicity (FAET). <b>Acidification</b> (AC) and Eutrophication (EU) are dominated by the emission of fertilizers. The emissions from the use of pesticides, especially insecticides dominate Terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TE) and make a considerable contribution to Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity (FAET) and Photochemical Oxidation (PhO). There is no visible contribution from the use of pesticides to the other toxicity categories. Production and use of greenhouse plastic are another important contributors, and just a bit less than the contribution of calcium nitrate to Abiotic Depletion (AD). The results of this study clearly indicate nutrient management and emissions from pesticide use, especially insecticides, as a focus point for environmental optimization of the rose cultivation sector in Ethiopia...|$|R
40|$|Two common {{desires for}} {{individuals}} are {{to live in}} a society with a healthy and sustainable environment, and a growing and productive economy. Through environmental regulatory policy, governments pursue these objectives on behalf of their electorate. It can often be a difficult balancing act, however, as these objectives do not always fit well together. Industrial activities that drive and stimulate the economy often have negative and lasting impacts on the environment. In this dissertation, I look at the modeling of this tradeoff in both a static and dynamic setting, and in relation to two significant environmental concerns: climate change and <b>aquatic</b> ecosystem <b>acidification.</b> In the first essay, co-authored with Peter Berck, we consider the impact of an increase in regulated abatement standards on static measures of economic welfare. By limiting emissions, these standards effectively decrease a key factor of production. Using a theoretical general equilibrium model, we show that all else equal, an increase in regulated abatement will therefore decrease utility and make individuals in the economy worse off. While we generally expect utility to be concave in abatement, when accounting for changes in the household's consumption and input supply decisions, and the corresponding impacts on income, we find this will not always be the case. Using a CGE model of the California economy, we then consider the impact of both carbon reduction measures, and a rising carbon price, on indicators of economic welfare in California. We find that environmental and economic objectives do not always have to be at odds, and that under certain conditions, both the carbon reduction measures and the rising carbon price can lead to increases in indicators of economic welfare. We also find that although conditions for non-concavity of the welfare function exist in California, our primary indicator of economic welfare, real State Personal Income, is concave in the carbon price. In the second essay, I look at the application of optimal regulatory policy to achieve the recovery of a group of freshwater lakes from acidification. Assuming a social planner is able to perfectly regulate the emissions of local firms, I develop a dynamic programming model where the planner's objective is to minimize a social disutility function, consisting of the damages from acidified lakes and the cost of emissions abatement, subject to state equations that describe the impact of emissions reductions on lake water quality. To parameterize the state equations, I use a panel data set that monitors the recovery of 32 acidified lakes located in the region surrounding Sudbury, Ontario, Canada over a 24 -year period. I then use numerical methods to solve the control problem for the optimal path of emissions reductions, and the expected rate of lake recovery. My results show that optimal emissions reductions rely heavily on the assumed level of damages, and {{the current state of the}} lakes. If lakes are already in a recovery state, then at most reasonable estimates of environmental damages, further optimal abatement is zero. I also find that as the level of damages increases, the optimal abatement policy "jumps" to full abatement of emissions, and there is only a narrow region of lake quality where partial abatement is optimal. Due to the slow recovery process, however, it is possible for lakes to remain in this narrow interim region for extended periods of time, and for partial abatement to be optimal over this entire period...|$|R
