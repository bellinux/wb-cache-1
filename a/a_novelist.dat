5|$|Acton's severe {{judgement}} did {{not deter}} Waugh from {{his intention to}} be a writer, but it affected his belief that he could succeed as <b>a</b> <b>novelist.</b> For a time {{he turned his attention}} away from fiction, but with the gradual recovery of his self-confidence he was able to complete his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was published with great success in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1956 he was {{selected}} at the Staff School run by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

Phelps responded with great enthusiasm, asking Achebe if he could show it to his editor and publishers. Achebe declined, insisting that it needed more work.|$|E

5|$|Last Night in Twisted River took 20 {{years to}} {{conceive}} and write, {{and is a}} story within a story that shows the development of <b>a</b> <b>novelist</b> and the writing process. It uses many of the themes and plot devices that have already seen treatment in other works by the author. The career of the novelist in the book closely tracks the career of Irving himself, making it Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel.|$|E
5|$|Ng {{made her}} debut as <b>a</b> <b>novelist</b> with Tujuh Musim Setahun (Seven Seasons A Year) in 2002, which sold poorly. She gained {{recognition}} with her Indiana Chronicle trilogy, {{which consists of}} Blues (2004), Lipstick (2005) and Bridesmaid (2005). These works were classified as pop literature, but readers identified with the main characters— urban working women. Tempo magazine notes that the trilogy pioneered the metropop genre in Indonesia. Between Lipstik and Bridesmaid, another novel, The (Un)Reality Show, was released in 2005.|$|E

5|$|After {{his first}} novel, The Wooden Horse, in 1909, Walpole wrote prolifically, {{producing}} {{at least one}} book every year. He was a spontaneous story-teller, writing quickly to get all his ideas on paper, seldom revising. His first novel to achieve major success was his third, Mr Perrin and Mr Traill, a tragicomic story of a fatal clash between two schoolmasters. During the First World War {{he served in the}} Red Cross on the Russian-Austrian front, and worked in British propaganda in Petrograd and London. In the 1920s and 1930s Walpole was much in demand not only as <b>a</b> <b>novelist</b> but also as a lecturer on literature, making four exceptionally well-paid tours of North America.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, Vachss worked as an attorney, in New York City, specializing in child abuse cases; {{he also had a}} career as <b>a</b> <b>novelist.</b> The duality of Vachss' work as a lawyer prosecuting and {{defending}} real cases and as a crime fiction author writing about fictional criminals resulted in Vachss being compared to the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Vachss' eighth novel, Footsteps of the Hawk, in the Burke series featuring a vigilante private investigator of child abuse cases, was released just two months before the publication of Batman: The Ultimate Evil. He had wanted to approach the topic of sex tourism in southeast Asia, but had been unable to find a way for the Burke character to go there; the Batman character offered the chance for him to write about the topic.|$|E
5|$|Coward's most {{enduring}} {{work from the}} war years was the hugely successful black comedy Blithe Spirit (1941), about <b>a</b> <b>novelist</b> who researches the occult and hires a medium. A séance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a 1945 film, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in Blithe Spirit, alternating the piece with his comedy Present Laughter and his working-class drama This Happy Breed.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, {{after making}} 24 {{memorial}} tablets for the project, William De Morgan abandoned the ceramics business to become <b>a</b> <b>novelist,</b> {{and the only}} ceramics firm able to manufacture appropriate further tiles was Royal Doulton. Dissatisfied with Royal Doulton's designs, and preoccupied with {{the management of the}} Watts Gallery and Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton, Surrey, Mary Watts lost interest in the project. Work to complete it was sporadic and ceased altogether in 1931 with only 53 of the planned 120 tiles in place. In 2009, the Diocese of London consented to further additions to the memorial, and the first new tablet in 78 years was added.|$|E

The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.

5|$|This {{prompted}} Planché {{to begin}} campaigning for copyright {{to be extended}} to dramatic works. He gathered a group of dramatists (including John Poole, James Kenney, Joseph Lunn and Richard Brinsley Peak) who prevailed upon writer and MP George Lamb to introduce a bill in Parliament; but the bill did not pass its third reading. In 1832 Edward Bulwer-Lytton, <b>a</b> <b>novelist</b> and MP, was successful in getting a select committee set up to consider dramatic copyright, as well as theatrical censorship and the monopoly of the patent theatres on drama. Planché gave evidence before the select committee; the following year the Dramatic Copyright Act 1833 (3 Will IV c. 15) was passed.|$|E
5|$|When Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, his piece The Lottery became an immediate success and lasted for decades after. Combined with The Modern Husband, Fielding could have received up to 1,000 pounds from the plays' first run. This placed Fielding at the position of being the main contributor of plays to the Royal Theatre. Currently, Fielding is primarily viewed as <b>a</b> <b>novelist,</b> but his plays suggest that he wished to be a playwright and that his career would be in theatre. Although Fielding wrote twenty-six plays, {{only a handful of}} them were ever published in critical editions before 1990.|$|E
5|$|Written by James Follett, this {{involved}} monsters {{attacking a}} race of beings who live inside Halley's Comet, unaware that there is anything beyond it they believe that their world is the sum and total of the universe. Into the Comet would have used the companions of Romana and K9. Follett was <b>a</b> <b>novelist</b> who pitched this idea to script editor Douglas Adams circa September 1979 when they met up and discussed the forthcoming return of Halley's Comet. Unfortunately the storyline was rejected by Adams. Follett resubmitted Into the Comet to new script editor Christopher H. Bidmead around May 1980, but once again the storyline was not pursued.|$|E
