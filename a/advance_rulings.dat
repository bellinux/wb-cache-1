The regulations define a corporate business purpose as “a real and substantial non Federal tax purpose germane to the business of the distributing corporation, the controlled corporation or the affiliated group to which the distributing corporation belongs.” Reg. 1.355-2(b)(2) This is the biggest subjective area of the 355 requirements in which case by case facts can alter the final decision on passing the requirement. Many courts have ruled favorably for the corporations while others have ruled against.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} the OECD indicators for assessing the economic and trade impact of specific trade facilitation measures in OECD countries. Twelve trade facilitation indicators (TFIs) have been constructed, corresponding to the main policy areas under negotiation at the WTO, with the aim to estimate the impact of addressing specific facilitation hurdles in the trade procedures of a given country. For OECD countries, the policy areas that seem to have the greatest impact on trade volumes and trade costs are <b>advance</b> <b>rulings,</b> information availability, formalities and procedures and inter-agency cooperation. If all TFIs are added their cost reduction potential would reach almost 10 % of trade costs, which is an estimate consistent with existing literature. The use of individual trade facilitation indicators should enable countries to better assess which trade facilitation dimensions deserve priority. The OECD TFI project is now expanded to cover countries outside the OECD area. transparency, trade facilitation, WTO, trade flows, trade costs, simplification, customs...|$|E

The <b>advance</b> <b>ruling</b> system for tariff classification is expected to grant more legal certainty to international traders because they can communicate with customs authorities and receive a legally binding tariff classification decision in advance.

In this paper, the <b>advance</b> <b>ruling</b> systems for tariff classification in the European Union (EU), China and Taiwan will be compared.

40|$|In Japan, most tax {{scholars}} and practitioners {{have believed that}} the introduction of "advance-ruling" would dispel the uncertainty about tax consequences and facilitate transactions. However, Givati (2009) shows that in the U. S. <b>advance</b> <b>rulings</b> (Private Letter Ruling and Advance Pricing Agreements) are not frequently used. Givati (2009) argues that some taxpayers avoid applying for advance ruling {{not because of the}} "direct cost" of the application, but because of strategic disadvantages. For example, if a taxpayer applies for the advance ruling, the tax authority would audit this taxpayer more carefully. This essay has three purposes. The first is to introduce the U. S. advance ruling systems (Private Letter Ruling and Advance Pricing Agreement) to Japanese readers. The second is to analyze the data and arguments provided by Givati (2009). The Third is to consider how we can improve the advance ruling system in Japan. As a tentative conclusion, I suggest following two points in order to encourage taxpayers to apply for advance ruling and facilitate transactions; (1) the applicant's anonymity needs to be preserved against tax authority in order to avoid increasing the probability of tax audit, and (2) the applicant's privacy and trade secrets need to be protected against their business competitors by introducing some procedures before making the rulings public. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen {{the rise of a}} new model of {{production}} and consumption of goods and services, {{often referred to as the}} “sharing economy. ” Fueled by startups such as Uber and Airbnb, sharing enables individuals to obtain rides, accommodations, and other goods and services from peers via the Internet or mobile application in exchange for payment. The rise of sharing has raised questions about how it should be regulated, including whether existing laws and regulations can and should be enforced in this new sector or whether new ones are needed. In this Article, we explore those questions in the context of taxation. We argue that, contrary to the claims of some commentators, the application of substantive tax law to sharing is mostly (though not completely) clear, because current law generally contains the concepts and categories necessary to tax sharing. However, tax enforcement and compliance may present challenges, as a result of two distinctive features of sharing. First, some sharing businesses tend to opportunistically pick the more favorable regulatory interpretation if there is ambiguity regarding which rule applies or whether a rule applies. This leads to compliance and enforcement gaps. Second, the “microbusiness” nature of sharing raises unique compliance and enforcement concerns. We suggest strategies for addressing these dual challenges, including lower information reporting thresholds, safe harbors and <b>advance</b> <b>rulings</b> to simplify tax reporting, and targeted enforcement efforts...|$|E

40|$|In the U. S., {{there is}} the Internal Revenue Service's private letter ruling program (PLRP). A private letter ruling is a written {{statement}} issued by the National Office of the IRS to a taxpayer in order to interpret and apply the tax laws to the taxpayer's specific set of facts. The PLRP is one of major measures as <b>advance</b> <b>rulings</b> in the U. S. The purpose of the PLRP is {{to solve the problem}} that taxpayers frequently hesitate to move on important business transactions without some official assurances of tax consequences. In Japan, many people have discussed necessity of the advance ruling including the PLRP from the viewpoint of improving taxpayers' predictability on tax effect for more than 30 years. Recently, the National Tax Administration (NTA) -the tax authority in Japan, improved an operation that the NTA answers to taxpayers' questions on tax with document. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to clarify the differences between the new measure by the NTA and the advance ruling-mainly the PLRP, and then to comment whether still more measure such as the PLRP is indispensable or not in Japan. The differences are examined in; 1) basis, 2) purpose, 3) effect of the private letter or the answer by the NTA, 4) ruling Area or qualified questions, and so forth. In consequence, the feature of the NTA's new measure was summarized that; 1) It is not based on specific tax laws and regulations, 2) Its purpose includes not only the improvement oi taxoavers' predictability on tax effect but also the unification and transparency of tax administration, 3) It binds neither the NT A nor the tax-payer, 4) Qualified questions are limited to matters that contribute to many other taxpayers. In other words, matters that satisfy only specific taxpayer's demand shall be excluded from the qualified question. Concerning the necessity of introducing the PLRP in Japan, this paper concludes that it is not indispensable to adopt such device in the current situation because of the 5 main reasons; 1) purpose of a self-as-sessment system, 2) mission of certified public tax accountant, 3) proper taxation, 4) administration resources, 5) fair treatment for tax- payers...|$|E

This framework provides two valuable implications. First, it highlights two key administrative challenges that are underappreciated by the academic literature: the holdup and leniency problems.

While better information availability, <b>advance</b> <b>ruling</b> and appeal procedures mainly benefit small firms, the simplification of documents and automation tend to favor large firms' trade. This is coherent with the idea that while some elements of the TFA simply reduce the fixed cost of exporting (favoring small firms in particular), other chapters in the TFA reduce the scope for corruption at borders, making large firms less reluctant to serve corrupt countries...|$|R

40|$|Taxation and tax law cannot {{exist without}} biases because tax law {{can be seen}} per {{definition}} {{as a set of}} biases. Even if the state pursuing its fiscal policy cannot be neutral, one can expect to enforce the principle of equal treatment before the law. Besides, state intervention need be in proportion to the objectives of the policy of redistribution or economic stabilization. Also, fiscal policy need rely on a system of tax administration that operates in accordance with the principles of openness, good governance and legal certainty. It is ideal if the legal regulation of the procedure of tax administration is fully fledged. The legal regulation of the tax liability need be comprehensive and cover all the processes of gathering tax information, identifying the tax liability and collection of taxes. Moreover, tax administration and administrative law are inadvertently in a need of being completed by private law. Where tax authorities are not explicitly authorised by statutory law to act, they must rely on the principles that are in accordance with the constitutional order. Notably, in Hungary, there is no statutory law that would preclude the universal effect of the Civil Code, covering all the financial relations whether to be made between private persons or between private persons and the representative of the public. Finally, for the purposes of approximating an ideal tax system, the possibility of horizontal coordination must not be left out of consideration. In this context, legal and tax planning and the choice of legal and tax regimes by parties have come to the forefront.

40|$|Governing {{charitable}} organizations isn’t getting any easier. Not {{only has the}} number of organizations grown, but their legal complexity has increased as well. Charities {{play a crucial role}} in the economic, social, and cultural structures of society, but they are privately governed organizations with legal structures that closely resemble businesses. The better charities are run, the more they can contribute to their public missions and overall social welfare. The state does not dictate “how to ‘do’ charity,” but state attorneys general (“AG”) are the primary overseers of charity behavior, responsible for enforcing the obligations of loyalty, care, and obedience that fiduciaries have under the laws of every state. The AG’s burden is great because very few other parties are allowed to bring suit to enforce these duties. This paper is primarily concerned with institutionalizing better nonprofit governance by helping fiduciaries understand their obligations in difficult cases. The <b>advance</b> <b>ruling</b> process it advocates aims to strengthen the private governance of charities by growing a body of law one real question at a time. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that legal efforts to improve governance must continue along both a narrow path for individual charity problems and a wider one to better establish standards of behavior in the sector as a whole. There is a place in charity governance for best practices that are not law, and it is important to identify which issues are appropriate for attorney general enforcement as an application of law. General principles of good governance with the imprimatur of law can be made widely available either as legislation, regulation, or official state standards of best practices. These are worthwhile initiatives, but they are not my focus today...|$|R

We analyze ATRs from the taxpayers' and tax authorities' perspectives. Investors request ATRs if the fee does not exceed a certain threshold. We integrate this finding into the tax authorities' decision whether to offer ATRs.

Otherwise, ATRs may be beneficial only if the tax authorities restrict them to classes of investments or use investment-specific fees.

40|$|Politicians and tax {{practitioners}} often {{claim that}} tax uncertainty negatively affects investment. In many countries, firms can request fee-based <b>Advance</b> Tax <b>Rulings</b> (ATRs) to mitigate tax uncertainty. We analyze theoretically {{the circumstances under}} which investors request ATRs, how tax authorities should price them and how they can affect investment. We assume that tax authorities integrate investors' reasoning into their decisions. We find that it is often optimal for tax authorities to charge prohibitively high fees to discourage firms from requesting an ATR. However, we find that revenue-maximizing tax authorities offer ATRs if the ruling enables them either to significantly reduce their tax audit costs or to increase the probability of detecting ambiguous tax issues. Under certain circumstances, ATRs may effectively foster investment and potentially benefit both the tax authorities and taxpayers. Our results provide new explanations for why taxpayers that face high levels of tax uncertainty often do not request ATRs, even when the fee is rather low. Our results also hold when the tax authority maximizes social wealth instead of its revenues. Regulatory changes in ATR requirements might serve as a natural quasi-experiment for an empirical study of our predictions regarding investment decisions.
