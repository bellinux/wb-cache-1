500|$|There {{are several}} {{hypotheses}} regarding the evolutionary origin {{and maintenance of}} elongation in giraffe necks. The [...] "competing browsers hypothesis" [...] was originally suggested by Charles Darwin and challenged only recently. It suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, such as kudu, steenbok and impala, encouraged the elongation of the neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. This advantage is real, as giraffes can and do feed up to [...] high, while even quite large competitors, such as kudu, can feed up to only about [...] high. There is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower levels, and giraffes feed more efficiently (gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful) high in the canopy.

That day, the share price of Enron decreased to $20.65, down $5.40 in one day, after the announcement by the SEC that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by Enron, characterizing them as [...] "some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen".

2500|$|The {{motivation}} behind ANNs is {{not necessarily}} to strictly replicate neural function, but to use biological neural networks as an inspiration. A central claim of ANNs is therefore that it embodies some new and powerful general principle for processing information. Unfortunately, these general principles are ill-defined. It is often claimed that they are emergent from the network itself. This allows simple statistical association (the basic function of artificial neural networks) to be described as learning or recognition. Alexander Dewdney commented that, as a result, artificial neural networks have a [...] "something-for-nothing quality, one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity <b>about</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> good these computing systems are. No human hand (or mind) intervenes; solutions are found as if by magic; and no one, it seems, has learned anything".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} derided Friedman's {{idiosyncratic}} prose style, with its tendency to use mixed metaphors and analogies.

2500|$|Economist and New York Times {{columnist}} Paul Krugman {{has argued}} that Republican and conservative strategies in opposing healthcare are based on spite: [...] "At this point, the guiding principle {{of one of our}} nation’s two great political parties is spite pure and simple.

[...] He argued that Republican opposition to Medicare savings proposed by the President is [...] "utterly at odds both with the party’s traditions and with what conservatives claim to believe. Think <b>about</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> bizarre it is for Republicans to position themselves as the defenders of unrestricted Medicare spending. First of all, the modern G.O.P. considers itself the party of Ronald Reagan – and Reagan was a fierce opponent of Medicare’s creation, warning that it would destroy American freedom. (Honest.) In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich tried to force drastic cuts in Medicare financing. And in recent years, Republicans have repeatedly decried the growth in entitlement spending – growth that is largely driven by rising health care costs." ...|$|E

40|$|Amid all {{the flurry}} <b>about</b> organic agriculture, <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much land is {{dedicated}} to this version of sound farming? Well, {{it depends on the}} definition but according to an extensive survey by the German-based Ecology and Agriculture Foundation. Australia leads with 7. 6 million hectares, followed by Argentina (3 million) and Italy (1 million). Big areas maybe, but when expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total arable land they are far from stunning often mere pin-pricks on the map. The highest levels although still tiny are in Europe where organic methods are well organised, and registered. Papua New Guinea and Suriname head the list of ACP countries in that respect. The picture for Africa needs some adjusting. In the survey, data about registered practices were scarce, but the compilers recognise that in any case much of Africa s agricultural production complies with the standards for organic agriculture. Produce is rarely certified, since that is quite costly. The interest in Africa for organised organic agriculture is nonetheless growing, attracted by premium prices on the international market. Making comparisons between countries in different regions is not really indicative, add the compilers, because of differences in production intensity and crops.
