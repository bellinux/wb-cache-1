40|$|Details of the {{metabolism}} of <b>alpha-terpineol</b> by Pseudomonas incognita are presented. Degradation of <b>alpha-terpineol</b> by this organism {{resulted in}} the formation of a number of acidic and neutral metabolites. Among the acidic metabolites, beta-isopropyl pimelic acid, 1 -hydroxy- 4 -isopropenyl-cyclohexane- 1 -carboxylic acid, 8 -hydroxycumic acid, oleuropeic acid, cumic acid, and p-isopropenyl benzoic acid have been identified. Neutral metabolites identified were limonene, p-cymene- 8 -ol, 2 -hydroxycineole, and uroterpenol. Cell-free extracts prepared from <b>alpha-terpineol</b> adapted cells were shown to convert <b>alpha-terpineol,</b> p-cymene- 8 -ol, and limonene to oleuropeic acid, 8 -hydroxycumic acid, and perillic acid, respectively, in the presence of NADH. The same cell-free extract contained NAD+ -specific dehydrogenase(s) which converted oleuropyl alcohol, p-cymene- 7, 8 -diol, and perillyl alcohol to their corresponding 7 -carboxy acids. On the basis of various metabolites isolated from the culture medium, together with the supporting evidence obtained from enzymatic and growth studies, it appears that P. incognita degrades <b>alpha-terpineol</b> by at least three different routes. While one of the pathways seems to operate via oleuropeic acid, a second may be initiated through the aromatization of <b>alpha-terpineol.</b> The third pathway may involve the formation of limonene from <b>alpha-terpineol</b> and its further metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Monoterpenes {{limonene}} and its metabolic derivatives, <b>alpha-terpineol</b> and 1, 8 -cineol, {{commonly found}} as aroma wine components, were studied for their antimutagenicity by the bacterial reverse mutation assay on different strains. Substances were also tested for their antioxidant activity, i. e. radical scavenger, chelation, reduction, and lipid peroxidation inhibition. Limonene and its metabolites, <b>alpha-terpineol</b> and 1, 8 -cineol, resulted able to inhibit the chemically-induced mutagenesis, although {{with a different}} specificity. The antimutagenicity of limonene has been generally retained by its metabolites and sometimes increased. In particular, <b>alpha-terpineol</b> exhibited the strongest inhibition, moreover it showed to be a remarkable ferrous ions chelating agent. Limonene and 1, 8 -cineol were devoid of antioxidant activity.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether lactic acid bacteria (LAB), isolated from cheese, were able to degrade terpenes. Five strains of LAB were grown on M 17 and reconstituted skim milk in the presence of alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, <b>alpha-terpineol,</b> myrtenal, and alpha-campholenal. Cultures were incubated at 37 A degrees C and samples collected at 6, 24, and 48 h for analysis by headspace-solid phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, <b>alpha-terpineol,</b> and myrtenal degradation did not occur. Instead, all LAB cultures containing alpha-campholenal resulted in the almost complete disappearance of this substrate and the formation of a new monoterpenoid, tentatively identified as an isomer of borneol. In addition, the ability of the LAB strains to biosynthesize geraniol ex novo on both media was highlighted. This is the first evidence that LAB strains are able to modify and biosynthesize terpenoids. The results of this study could be used to play an important role in cheese traceability models based on the use of terpenes as plant biomarkers.

Hop oil is used in phytotherapy as a sedative, yet the bioactive substances responsible for this effect have not been conclusively clarified. Therefore, the focus of this study was placed on hop aroma substances that: (i) have been previously described to possess sedative properties, (ii) are suspected to have these properties due to structural features, or (iii) that are present in hop oil in high concentrations. While some compounds remained unchanged under the simulated physiological conditions, others underwent transformations to a great extent. Particularly interesting was the formation of <b>alpha-terpineol</b> and linalool from several different aroma compounds. <b>alpha-Terpineol</b> has been previously described as a bioactive compound with anti-inflammatory properties. Linalool is a well-known sedative compound and its formation during digestion could enhance the sedative effect of hop oil.

40|$|Background and {{the purpose}} of the study: Several plant {{essential}} oils, as well as terpenes present in essential oils, have shown gastroprotective activity. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the gastroprotective activity of α-terpineol, a monoterpene alcohol which is present in essential oils of various plants. Methods: The gastroprotective activity of α-terpineol was evaluated in rats by assessing the changes in ethanol and indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer scores and on gastric secretory volume and total acidity in pylorus-ligated rats. <b>Alpha-terpineol</b> was administrated orally at the doses of 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg one hour before administration of the ulcer inducing agents by the pylorus ligation procedure. The involvement of endogenous prostaglandins in the protective effect of α-terpineol in ethanol-induced gastric lesions test was assessed by administration of indomethacin (10 mg/kg, s. c.) 30 min before oral administration of α-terpineol at the dose of 50 mg/kg. Results: α-terpineol presented gastroprotective activity against ethanol-induced ulcers at the doses of 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg. Epoxy-carvone at the dose of 10 mg/kg did not present gastroprotective activity against ulcer induced by indomethacin, but at the doses of 30 and 50 mg/kg it attenuated the gastric damages induced by this agent significantly. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not prevent the gastroprotective effect of α-terpineol on ethanol-induced ulcers. <b>Alpha-terpineol</b> also did not affect the gastric secretion in pylorus-ligated rats. Major conclusion: The results suggest that α-terpineol presents gastroprotective action which does not involve either an increase in the synthesis of endogenous prostaglandin or a decrease in the gastric acid secretion...|$|E

The thesis consists of two parts [...] the first one is a literature review of selected plants and the second one is a practical part held in the laboratory at Department of Crop Science, Breeding and Plant Medicine at Faculty of Agriculture. In the practical part, drugs were individually analyzed using the methods taken from Czech pharmacopoeia. Samples from caraway were acquired from Agritec, s. r. o. company's breeding, lavender and chamomile came from the company Leros, s. r. o. and also from domestic production. Variation analysis of caraway proves that content of both examined substances [...] carvone and limolene [...] was highly affected by its genotype. Total content of essential oils, on the other hand, was not statistically affected by genotype. Four different variants were studied in chamomile. The content of essential oils in chamomile was statistically highly affected by monitored variants; the content of chamazulene was affected in the same way. Bisabolol oxide A was significantly affected by the variant of chamomile and so was apigenin- 7 -glucoside. Farnesene was not significantly affected by variant.

40|$|The {{target of}} the thesis was to study all of the {{available}} literary sources concerning the aromatic substances, focusing on terpene compounds and characterize the selected must muscat variety. In the experimental part was established the content of free and bound terpene compounds for these varieties both in the must {{and also in the}} wine made subsequently. The results obtained were processed and evaluated. There was selected six muscad varieties to study (Aromína, Cvětočnyj, Gőcseji zamatos, Irsai Oliver, Lena, Moravian Muscat) from vineyards of the horticultural fakulty in Lednice na Moravě. First there were established basic analytical values in the must (pH, sugar content, acidity) and then the content of the residual sugar and alcohol in the subsequently made wine. The terpene compounds in the must berries and wine were laid down by the extraction of an organic solvent and this modified extract was then used for GC-MS analysis. The most of all (free and bound) terpene compounds in the must (berries) showed Lena variety, followed by the Moravian muscat. Least of these substances contained the variety Cvětočnyj. The highest value from terpene compounds represented traditionally linalool (most in Moravian Muscat), geraniol (Lena), <b>alpha-terpineol</b> (Lena). Most of the terpene compounds in wine showed variety of Moravian muscat, followed by a variety of Cvětočnyj and Lena. Least of these substances contained the variety Aromína. The highest values were measured for linalool, 2, 6 -dimethyl- 3, 7 -octadien- 2, 6 -diol and <b>alpha-terpineol</b> were all found in the Moravian muscat. Overall, in the must (berries) were measured much higher concentrations of the terpene compounds than in wine. On average, most of these substances in the must and the wine showed Lena and Moravian muscat varieties. They can be therefore rocognized as the most aromatic varieties of these six selected ones...|$|E

40|$|Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt oxide (LSC) {{is a mixed}} ionic-electronic {{conductor}} (MIEC) ceramic {{suited for}} use as cathode material in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs). Extensive research is conducted on producing the cathode in the SOFC as a thin film to reduce operating temperatures and alleviate disadvantageous properties like high thermal expansion coefficient (TEC). One way of producing thin films is through ink-jet printing. Ink-jet printing is a cheap, simple and precise manufacturing method that produces less waste than other deposition methods. It is therefore of interest to explore the feasibility of producing LSC thin films this way. This thesis investigates the possibility of making a stable ceramic ink based on LSC. An LSC powder with the stoichiometry (La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2) 0. 995 CoO 3 was used, produced by CerPoTech AS through spray pyrolysis. The powder was suspended in ten different liquid systems, five based on <b>alpha-Terpineol,</b> Isopropanol and PVP and five based on Ethylene Glycol, Distilled Water and Dolapix CE 64. All inks were characterised to find their particle size distribution, density, viscosity and surface tension.

The antennal sensitivity may differ from one compound to another according to the sex. The difference in responses could be attributed to the sensitivity of olfactory receptors and/or the characterization of binding protein(s). The quality of biocontrol agent could be improved if the chemical interaction between beneficial natural enemies and the surrounding environment is intensively studied and we clearly understand the chemical ecology of each natural enemy...|$|E
40|$|Monoterpenes, {{the main}} {{constituents}} of essential oils, {{are known for}} their many biological activities. The present work studied the potential biological activity of twenty-seven monoterpenes, including monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated ones, against seed germination and subsequent primary radicle growth of Raphanus sativus L. (radish) and Lepidium sativum L. (garden cress), under laboratory conditions. The compounds, belonging to different chemical classes, showed different potency in affecting both parameters evaluated. The assayed compounds demonstrated a good inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent way. In general, radish seed is more sensitive than garden cress and its germination appeares more inhibited by alcohols; at the highest concentration tested, the more active substances were geraniol, borneol, (+/-) -beta-citronellol and <b>alpha-terpineol.</b> Geraniol and carvone inhibited, in a significant way, the germination of garden cress, at the highest concentration tested. Radicle elongation of two test species was inhibited mainly by alcohols and ketones. Carvone inhibited the radicle elongation of both seeds, at almost all concentrations assayed, while 1, 8 -cineole inhibited their radicle elongation at the lowest concentrations (10 (- 5) M, 10 (- 6) M) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDyBa 2 Cu 3 Oy (Dy- 123) thick {{films were}} {{fabricated}} from Dy 2 BaO 4, BaCuO 2, and CuO powders. We have added 0, 1, 2, and 4 wt% of Ag 2 O. Mixture of <b>alpha-terpineol</b> and 2 -ethyl acetate {{was used as}} a solvent, to which 100 nm-sized stoichiometric powdered mixture was added and grinded for several hours to form a highly dense paste. Thick film precursors were prepared by spreading the paste on MgO substrates with a screen printing technique. The films were sintered with a double-step annealing process. The Dy- 123 thick films obtained were of good quality. XRD analyses confirmed the formation of a high-quality c-axis oriented Dy- 123 for films annealed at 1070 oC for 10 min and at 880 oC for 2 h. Scanning electron microscopy showed the formation of large flat grains. Onset Tc was 91 K according to magnetization measurements. The present results suggest that this process might be useful for the preparation of large-area superconducting thick films on MgO substrates in a short processing time...|$|E
