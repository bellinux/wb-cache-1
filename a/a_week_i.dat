500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Watson left the P-I after he {{believed}} he was treated unfairly by a new editor, although he still contributed to the paper as a freelancer. Watson's criticisms of then Mariners owner George Argyros {{eventually led to the}} P-I reducing the frequency of his column. Watson remembered, [...] "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said he was thinking of cutting me back to one column <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>I</b> said maybe we should make it zero columns a week." [...] On October 30, 1983, after a hiatus of more than three decades, Watson's column appeared once again in The Seattle Times.|$|E

I was so against the [...] And I said to Joe, 'You've got to change this, you have to change this.'" [...] During Joe Biden's 2008 campaign to be the Democratic nominee, she continued to teach during the week and would join him for campaigning on weekends. She said that she would have taken an activist role in addressing education as her chief focus of concern as a potential First Lady. She also said that she was basically apolitical and would not seek inclusion in Cabinet meetings.|$|E

The radio station put [...] "Keep Away" [...] into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of [...] "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled [...] "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, [...] "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> (...) <b>I</b> was doing all this from my bedroom.

500|$|On 4 September 2014, Azalea {{announced}} {{that she would be}} reissuing her debut studio album The New Classic. On October 19 2014, the track list of Reclassified was released, which also included [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] as 9th track. On 23 October 2014, the track was available for streaming. A day later, the track was made available as an instant digital download track upon pre-ordering Reclassified via iTunes Stores. [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] was written by Iggy Azalea, The Invisible Men, Jon Mills, Darryl Reid and Jon Turner. It was produced by The Invisible Men and The Arcade. Lasting for a duration of 3:20 (three minutes and twenty seconds), [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] is built on [...] "club-ready" [...] electro handclap-based beats and heavy synthesisers. Lyrically, Azalea talks about her success and goes after her [...] "haters" [...] on the song. At one point, she raps: [...] "Haters gon' hate while critics critique, I pay them no mind whenever they speak / what they make a year I make in <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> know you can't stand it, just get you a seat!" [...] On the hook, she raps: [...] "Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy SZN / Until l get what I want, I ain't leaving… Simmer down bitch / It's Iggy SZN." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} negative reviews, a few reviewers {{had positive}} {{things to say}} about the song and video. Entertainment Weekly writer Joseph Lynch noted that there was [...] "something sickeningly catchy about this tune that keeps you coming back for more." [...] Rolling Stones Perpetua stated, [...] "When you see this video, you immediately notice everything that it does 'wrong', but it actually gets {{a lot of things about}} pop music right, if just by accident." [...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin, {{reviewing}} for The New York Times, praised Fincher's {{direction and}} editing of the film. She wrote that Fight Club carried {{a message of}} [...] "contemporary manhood", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism. Roger Ebert, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, called Fight Club [...] "visceral and hard-edged", but also [...] "a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy", whose promising first act {{is followed by a}} second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as [...] "trickery". Ebert later acknowledged that the film was [...] "beloved by most, not by me". He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of Fight Club at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that [...] "eeing it over the course of <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> admired its skill even more, and its thought even less." [...] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe opined that the film began with an [...] "invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz", but that it eventually became [...] "explosively silly". Newsweeks David Ansen described Fight Club as [...] "an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload" [...] and thought that the ending was too pretentious. Richard Schickel of Time described the director's mise en scène as dark and damp: [...] "It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry." [...] Schickel applauded the performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, but he criticized the film's [...] "conventionally gimmicky" [...] unfolding and the failure to make Helena Bonham Carter's character interesting.|$|E

Wood cited his [...] "first job on my own" [...] as Chief Ob-stacle, a continuing series of strips for a 1949 political newsletter. He entered the comic book field by lettering, as he recalled in 1981: [...] "The first professional job was lettering for Fox romance comics in 1948. This lasted about a year. I also started doing backgrounds, then inking. Most of it was the romance stuff. For complete pages, it was $5 a page... Twice <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> would ink ten pages in one day".|$|E

From Heidelberg, Rizal wrote his parents: [...] "I spend half {{of the day in}} the study of German and the other half, in the diseases of the eye. Twice <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> go to the bierbrauerie, or beerhall, to speak German with my student friends." [...] He lived in a Karlstraße boarding house then moved to Ludwigsplatz.

[...] Also, Kennedy and the Democrats hammered relentlessly at the administration's foreign and defense policies, citing a [...] "missile gap" [...] that left the U.S. at a disadvantage against the Soviet's ICBM forces. [...] This charge was proven untrue the following year. [...] Also, {{the collapse of the}} 1960 summit between Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khruschev, French President Charles de Gaulle and British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, over the downing of an American U-2 spy plane over Soviet territory provided Democrats with ample ammunition. In addition, on August 24, Eisenhower made what some consider the worst gaffe of his presidency by responding to a reporter's question about the contributions of Vice President Nixon to major decisions: [...] "If you give me <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> might think of one.

2500|$|Staten Island {{participated in}} the 1892 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) tournament with the Lorillard, Manhattan, and New York clubs. There were {{allegations}} of professionalism and the importation of ineligible Canadian [...] by those three teams, and Staten Island played only under protest. Miller was critical of the New York club in particular:"When a club deliberately imports six or eight {{of the best players}} in Canada, feeds them like fighting cocks, keeps them with nothing to do from one week's end to another but play lacrosse, and then plays them against a team composed of business men who don't get a chance to practice more than three or four hours <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> think it's about time to stop it ...

2500|$|Horowitz taught seven {{students}} between 1937 and 1962: Nico Kaufmann (1937), Byron Janis (1944–1948), Gary Graffman (1953–1955), Coleman Blumfield (1956–1958), Ronald Turini (1957–1963), Alexander Fiorillo (1960–1962) and Ivan Davis (1961–1962). Janis {{described his}} relationship to Horowitz during that period as a surrogate son, and he often traveled with Horowitz and his wife during concert tours. Davis was invited {{to become one of}} Horowitz's students after receiving a call from him the day after he won the Franz Liszt Competition. At the time, Davis had a contract with Columbia Records and a national tour planned. Horowitz claimed that he had only taught three students during that period. [...] "Many young people say they have been pupils of Horowitz, but there were only three. Janis, Turini, who I brought to the stage, and Graffman. If someone else claims it, it's not true. I had some who played for me for four months. Once <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>I</b> stopped work with them, because they did not progress." [...] According to biographer Glenn Plaskin, [...] "The fact that Horowitz disavowed most of his students and blurred the facts regarding their periods of study says something about the erratic nature of his personality during that period". Horowitz returned to coaching in the 1980s, working with Murray Perahia, who already had an established career, and Eduardus Halim.|$|E
