Using information collected by the 2001 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, this study examines the effects of underemployment on outcomes such as income, welfare dependence and subjective well-being. Results obtained imply that, while unemployment clearly has greater adverse consequences, underemployment is nonetheless associated with significant {{detrimental effects on the}} outcomes examined. Negative effects are found for both part-time employed and full-time employed workers who would prefer to work more hours, but effects are greater for underemployed part-time workers, and are particularly large for part-time workers who would like to work full-time. Indeed, for part-time workers seeking full-time employment, adverse effects attributable to underemployment are, for some outcomes, not far short of those attributable to unemployment...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} causes of {{unemployment}} persistence among the Belgian labour force. The underlying issue {{was to determine the}} impact of past unemployment spells on future labour market opportunities. Some European studies have demonstrated the existence of a true causal relationship between successive unemployment spells implying a stigmatisation effect for the unemployed. This so-called state dependence can occur through a reduction in human capital or through employer recruitment and labour retention practices. The model used is a dynamic random effects probit model controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and the initial condition problem.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the causes of unemployment persistence among the Belgian labour force. The underlying issue is to determine the eventual existence of a true causal relationship between successive unemployment spells. Design/methodology/approach - The model used is a dynamic random effects probit model controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and the initial condition problem. It was applied to the Panel Study on Belgian Households (1994 - 2002). Findings - The results suggest that while observed and unobserved heterogeneity explain between 57 per cent and 82 per cent of unemployment persistence, the remainder is induced by the presence of state dependence. All else being equal, an individual unemployed this year will be between 11. 4 and 33 percentage points more likely to be unemployed next year <b>as</b> compared with <b>an</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person.</b> Practical implications - The presence of a stigmatisation effect of unemployment means that the costs of unemployment are much higher than the simple loss of income and human capital associated with the current job loss. The study demonstrates the importance of concentrating efforts on the prevention of unemployment. Originality/value - The paper's contribution is to test again the hypothesis of the presence of state dependence in unemployment using a different technique, allowing, among other things, to control for exogenous variables. The paper demonstrates its existence and measures its contribution in the explanation of unemployment persistence in Belgium, besides that of observed and unobserved characteristics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 Concern {{over the}} low {{enrollment}} in homemaking classes prompted {{this study of}} the homemaking program in secondary schools in Bend, Oregon. Two questionnaires were constructed to obtain the opinions and beliefs of ninth, tenth, and eleventh-grade girls in Bend, Oregon, and their parents about the following: 1. What factors influence girls to enroll or not enroll in homemaking classes. 2. What factors parents consider in encouraging their daughters to enroll or not enroll in homemaking. 3. What girls and their parents believe should be taught in homemaking classes. 4. What types of homemaking classes and scheduling of those classes should be offered. The questionnaires were administered to the girls in Grade 9, 10, and 11 during a glass period. All girls who were present that day completed a questionnaire then took a parent questionnaire home for their parents to fill out. After the questionnaires were constructed they were pretested {{to determine if they}} would obtain the desired information. The data from the questionnaires were tabulated and organized into tables so that it could be analyzed and evaluated to try to determine ways to improve the program of homemaking education at the secondary level. The analysis of the data was organized into three sections. One deals with the girls' evaluations of homemaking education in Bend, Oregon; another deals with the parents' evaluations and the third draws together the similar and contrasting opinions and beliefs of the girls and their parents. In view of the beliefs and attitudes of the girls and their parents as shown in the study the following suggestions were made as possible next steps toward an improved homemaking education program in the Bend secondary schools. 1. Include different types of scheduling and different types of classes in the curriculum. 2. Reevaluate what is now being taught and try to place more emphasis on the areas of home management and relationships. 3. Carry out a better public relations program to inform the administration, other faculty, the community and the students in the school of the goals of the homemaking program. In light of the findings of the study, trends in education, and trends in high school education in Bend, Oregon, the writer proposes a new class to be offered on an experimental basis during the fall semester of 1962. The class would be scheduled to meet {{two or three times a}} week and would be a selected group or eleventh and twelfth-grade girls who were not planning to take any other homemaking. The center of emphasis of this class for young women would be upon development of attitudes, goals, and values to meet the problems of the changing times and upon the preparation for being <b>a</b> homemaker <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>employed</b> outside the home...|$|R

In modern societies, work-family conflict has been becoming a very common social phenomenon, one leading to serious consequences for individuals, families, and work organizations (Jacobs and Gerson 2004; Nomaguchi 2009). Some researchers consider time conflict (the distribution of time spent for work and family) <b>as</b> <b>a</b> basic form of work-family conflict. When more time is spent in the labor market, it may inevitably squeeze the time that can be spent at home (Greenhaus and Beutell 1985).|$|R
