5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it <b>always</b> <b>comes</b> first.|$|E

On November 16, 2006, Pelosi was {{unanimously}} chosen by her caucus as the Democratic candidate for Speaker, effectively making her Speaker-elect.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to smaller circuits, road racing drivers {{rely heavily on}} the use of flags. As it is impractical to have spotters covering all segments of a winding race track, the first indication to drivers of local hazards almost <b>always</b> <b>comes</b> from marshals stationed at various flag stations around the course. Missing or disregarding a flag can have critical consequences, as Mario and Michael Andretti discovered during a 1991 CART race in Detroit, Michigan. Michael came around a blind corner at high speed, without heeding the yellow flag being displayed—and plowed {{into the back of a}} CART safety truck tending to another disabled car. Fifteen seconds later, his father Mario disregarded the same madly waving yellows and crashed into the car the safety vehicle was trying to assist.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{recourse}} to biblical language, Leo also describes his own {{special relationship with}} St Peter in terms derived from Roman law. He calls himself the (unworthy) heir and deputy (vicarius) of Peter, having received his apostolic authority and being obliged to follow his example. On the one hand, Peter stands before him with a claim on how Leo is to exercise his office; on the other hand, Leo, as the Roman bishop, represents the Apostle, whose authority he holds. Christ, however, <b>always</b> <b>comes</b> out {{as the source of}} all grace and authority, and Leo is responsible to him for how he fulfills his duties (sermon 1). Peter is indeed the example for Leo's relationship to Christ. Thus, the office of the Roman bishop, with its universal significance, is grounded on the special relationship between Christ and St Peter, a relationship that cannot be repeated per se; therefore, Leo depends on St Peter's mediation, his assistance and his example {{in order to be able}} to adequately fulfill his role and exercise his authority as the Bishop of Rome, both in the city and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{genomics}} {{seeks to}} describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination {{by a combination of}} experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large numbers of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allow scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure. As opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often (but not <b>always)</b> <b>comes</b> before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.|$|E

25|$|In 1490 he {{received}} his Doctorate in Theology, though he never made any original contribution to Theology. He just {{was not interested in}} this abstract speculation. Indeed, in the disputations that he is recorded as having carried out, with other University Doctors, he <b>always</b> <b>comes</b> off second best. He was more interested in the practical means of salvation—in his terms, a return to poverty and complete self-denial—and these he preached, in a Flemish accent, but in powerful French. He followed the rule of Francis of Paola very strictly and preached that all priests and monks should do so too. By 1493, there were 80 students at the College. They only left when they went to a monastery or to become a parish priest. Standonck hoped by this means to reform the church. In the same year, the King had set up a Commission to examine abuses in the church and he was asked to give a lecture to them, which he did on 12 November at Tours. In this he set out a long list of demands. Most of these were familiar to church reformers—only fit and proper persons should be priests, there should be no money charged for their services, or for accepting a post. There should be free election (by fit and proper priests) of their bishops, or monks of their abbots, and all other religious positions (including teachers at the University). He added demands that the priests and monks should lead exemplary lives. This meant his by now well known strictly ascetic life—including enforcing celibacy among the clergy.|$|E

500|$|During a Minnesota summer, {{heat and}} {{humidity}} predominate in the south, while warm and less humid conditions are generally present in the north. [...] A main feature of summer weather in Minnesota and the Midwestern United States {{as a whole is}} the weakening of the jet stream, leading to slower movement of air masses, a general increase in the stability of temperatures, and less wind. The strong wind that does blow almost <b>always</b> <b>comes</b> from the south, bringing in warm temperatures and humidity. These humid conditions and a jet stream that has pushed into the northern parts of the U.S. initiate thunderstorm activity 30–40days per year.|$|E

I think it <b>always</b> <b>comes</b> down to story and character, and one form won't replace the other. Just like photography didn't replace painting. But maybe I'm blind to it." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly noted that CGI films (such as Shrek) were more likely to attract the teenage demographic typically not interested in animation, and called Atlantis a [...] "marketing and creative gamble".|$|E

In addition, they mined history books for interesting [...] "events, battle tactics, weapons, technologies and economic factors", according to Goodman. A list was drafted of 100 historical elements that excited the team, and it {{formed the basis of}} the project.

[...] As it had with Empire Earth, Stainless Steel delegated separate teams to the multiplayer and single-player modes of Empires.|$|E
500|$|Fey {{is known}} for her deadpan humor and delivery; her [...] "sardonic wit" [...] has become a {{trademark}} of hers, upon which several critics have commented in their reviews of Fey's work. According to Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara, Fey [...] "project both oblivious security and hyper-alert insecurity with the same expression" [...] in her performances, while The Chronicles Dillon Fernando wrote that the actress specializes in [...] "delectable, situational and ironic comedy". On Fey's comedic prowess, Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels enthused that his former employee [...] "has a very clear take on things ... It <b>always</b> <b>comes</b> from a place of intelligence and there is just an edge to it." [...] Michaels concluded, [...] "It's not fearful. It's strong and confident and you recognise the voice {{and most of the}} time you agree with it." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Christopher Goodwin believes that Fey [...] "fashioned her comic persona around her glasses", which she has worn since 1995; Fey joked that [...] "Glasses make anyone look smarter".|$|E
