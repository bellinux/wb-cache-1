40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of, and complications associated with, vasectomies performed in two medical clinics. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A private medical clinic {{and a family}} planning clinic at a teaching hospital in the Quebec City region, where one doctor performs all surgery. PARTICIPANTS: The 1223 men who underwent a first vasectomy between January 1994 and February 1996. INTERVENTIONS: Isolations of the vas deferens through the scrotum was performed using the no-scalpel technique in both <b>clinics.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> private <b>clinic</b> (n = 775), vasectomy was performed by ligature with tantalum clips. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> family planning <b>clinic</b> (n = 448), a combination of cauterisation of the abdominal end of the vas deferens, leaving the testicular end open, and fascial interposition with a clip was used. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of postoperative complications (painful granuloma; noninfectious inflammation of the vas deferens, epididymis, and testes; hematoma; infection; undiagnosed pain) and rate of recanalization (early and late). RESULTS: <b>At</b> <b>the</b> private <b>clinic,</b> 39 patients (5. 0 %) consulted for postoperative complications, compared with 55 patients (12. 3 %) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> family planning <b>clinic</b> (chi (2) 1 = 21. 0; P < 0. 001). Of the patients who underwent semen analysis, 15 (2. 8 %) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> private <b>clinic</b> and 4 (1. 2 %) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> family planning <b>clinic</b> experienced early or late recanalization (chi (2) 1 = 2. 2; P <. 14). CONCLUSION: The rate of consultation for postoperative complications was lower <b>at</b> <b>the</b> private <b>clinic</b> than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> family planning <b>clinic,</b> but <b>the</b> efficacy of the procedure appeared to be higher <b>at</b> <b>the</b> family planning <b>clinic.</b> <b>The</b> surgical techniques used <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two <b>clinics</b> might partially explain these differences...|$|R

Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) attempts to convince the curmudgeonly Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would be boring. Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because the cases are usually simplistic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic.</b>|$|E

5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit {{a provision in the}} law which permitted doctors to prescribe contraceptives for the prevention of disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic,</b> and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> and pays {{for it by}} pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E

At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E
5|$|To {{recover from}} her {{experience}} at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy. Her initial interest {{was in the}} work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved on to that of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's Brunswick Square, which was likely run {{under the jurisdiction of the}} London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as The Machinery of the Mind. While working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic,</b> she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the Theosophical Society and reading some of the organisation's literature. With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.|$|E

She tells Zak about her past and makes him promise to keep quiet. She pays Jared but when threatened by Zak, he reveals that Amy's affair with his father caused his family to break down. Zak makes Jared leave but Amy discovers she is pregnant and tells Cain, who demands she have a termination. Victoria suggests Amy tell Val but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinic,</b> learns that her pregnancy is too advanced for a termination and the baby is due in December. She tells Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) about the baby but insists that Belle keep it secret, scared of Cain's reaction. Amy gives birth to a baby boy in the church graveyard. Thinking he is dead, Amy wraps him in her jumper before leaving him in a telephone box and goes to David's house. She tells him what has happened and he learns that the baby has been found alive and taken to hospital. Knowing Amy needs medical attention, he waits for her to fall asleep and calls an ambulance, Val and Eric. At the hospital, she apologizes for keeping her pregnancy a secret and initially decides to keep the baby, now named Kyle, delighting Val and Eric. On Christmas Day 2011, Amy is bathing Kyle but freezes when she remembers her mother dropping her in the bath and giving her to social services. Amy runs away, leaving Kyle with Val, and confides in Victoria who helps her decide to give Kyle up for adoption.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} whether {{incorporation of}} an abuse assessment protocol into the routine procedures of <b>the</b> prenatal <b>clinics</b> {{of a large}} urban public health department led to increased referral for and assessment, identification, and documentation of abuse. METHODS: Evaluation was conducted at 3 matched prenatal clinics serving a total of 12, 000 maternity patients per year. Two <b>clinics</b> used <b>the</b> abuse protocol and 1 did not. An audit was performed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> on a randomly selected sample of 540 maternity patient charts for the 15 months before the protocol was initiated and of 540 records for the 15 months after the protocol was introduced. Ninety-six {{percent of the patients}} represented in the sample were Latina. RESULTS: <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> using <b>the</b> protocol, abuse assessment increased from 0 to 88 %.
