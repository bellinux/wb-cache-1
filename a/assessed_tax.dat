5000|$|However, {{there was}} also a dark side to Wang's {{financial}} management style and governance. It was said that he exercised his authorities harshly and extracted much from the people, causing the people to resent the imperial government. Under prior dynasties, taxes that the people paid in grain required that the people pay 20% surcharge in addition to the <b>assessed</b> <b>tax</b> amount, known as the [...] "bird and mouse surcharge" [...] (i.e., to account for the amount that would be eaten by birds and mice). Wang imposed an additional 20% surcharge, known as the [...] "agency surcharge," [...] greatly increasing the people's tax burden. Further, previously, whatever payments that imperial treasury made were made at a discount rate, paying 80% of what the nominal amount was. Wang decreased that rate to 77%. Further, Wang carried out frequent reassessments of the field values to increase the tax assessments, such that just after a few years of Wang's administration of these matters, the people were weary from these taxes. Both Wang and Yang, with whom Wang was particularly close because they were both from Tianxiong, disliked the learned people, such that, for supplies given as civilian officials' salaries, they gave second-grade supplies that were considered not military-grade material, referring to such materials as [...] "items of miscellany" [...] and giving them overly high assessed values. Further, he was harsh to those who violated the law, such that people who violated the laws on state monopolies over salt and alcohol were often executed even for very minor violations. The administrators under him manipulated his harshness to be even harsher, such that the people suffered greatly.|$|E
5000|$|The FairTax {{legislation}} would apply a 23% federal retail {{sales tax on}} the total transaction value of new retail goods and services purchases; in other words, consumers pay to the government 23 cents of every dollar spent (sometimes called tax-inclusive [...] - [...] as income taxes are calculated). The <b>assessed</b> <b>tax</b> rate is 30% if the FairTax {{is added to the}} pre-tax price of a good like traditional U.S. sales taxes (sometimes called tax-exclusive). The effective tax rate for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax rebates. The rebates would have the greatest impact at low spending levels, where they could lower a household's effective rate to zero or a negative rate. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and a household's effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending. For example, a household of three spending $30,000 a year on taxable items would devote about 6% of total spending to the FairTax after the rebate. A household spending $125,000 on taxable items would spend around 19% on the FairTax. The rebate would be paid in twelve monthly installments equal to 23% of poverty level spending for each household size and is meant to eliminate the taxation of necessities and make the plan progressive. [...] Economist Bruce Bartlett stated that if Americans perceive the monthly FairTax rebate as additional income, instead of a return on taxes paid, the tax rate could be viewed as proportional. Laurence Kotlikoff, Boston University economist, stated that Bartlett's assessment was flawed psychology or political science, and not based on economics or perceptions under the current tax system.|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. In the 1690 s, {{after more than a}} century of rapid growth, London emerged as the largest city of Christian Europe. The Crown's heavy demands for war finance created an innovative tax regime, the local records of which provide {{for the first time a}} comprehensive picture of the social and economic geography of the English capital. Earlier taxation records omit a substantial proportion of the total number of households in London or provide only a crude indication of their relative wealth. The aim of the project was to construct a 'snapshot' of London based on the surviving returns of the 'aids' levied in 1693 - 4, which record rental values for houses and other properties, and the value of the stock in trade of many householders for the entire metropolitan area north of the Thames. The method was to construct a series of databases from the manuscript returns and to provide a series of computer-based analytical tools, including a cartographic framework for spatial analysis, thus creating a directory and gazetteer of lasting value as a research tool. A further aim was to undertake extensive analysis of the material and to publish the results, principally in the form of a social atlas of the metropolis.
