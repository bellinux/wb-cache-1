5|$|The Romans had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> for {{the color}} green; {{it was the}} color of Venus, the goddess of gardens, {{vegetables}} and vineyards. The Romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Lyon, Vaison-la-Romaine, and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine. By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.|$|E
5|$|The many {{achievements}} of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats, Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty, made with the Hittites. Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> of its cultural legacy.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1876 Jenny Morris was {{diagnosed}} with epilepsy. Refusing {{to allow her to}} be societally marginalised or institutionalised, as was common in the period, Morris insisted that she be cared for by the family. When Janey took May and Jenny to Oneglia in Italy, the latter suffered a serious seizure, with Morris rushing to the country to see her. They then proceeded to visit a number of other cities, including Venice, Padua, and Verona, with Morris attaining <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> of the country than he had on his previous trip. In April 1879 Morris moved the family home again, this time renting an 18th-century mansion on Hammersmith's Upper Mall in West London. Owned by the novelist George MacDonald, Morris would name it Kelmscott House and re-decorate it according to his own taste. In the House's grounds he set up a workshop, focusing on the production of hand-knotted carpets. Excited that both of his homes were along the course of the River Thames, in August 1880 he and his family took a boat trip along the river from Kelmscott House to Kelmscott Manor.|$|E

5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E
25|$|Other {{signs of}} {{frustration}} {{with the status quo}} appeared with the bitter Asbestos Strike of 1949. It led to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> of labour and social-democratic issues in Quebec.|$|E
25|$|Severe liver injury {{can result}} from hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Elevated levels of bilirubin, {{hepatomegaly}} and fluid retention are clinical hallmarks of this condition. There is now <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> of the generalized cellular injury and obstruction in hepatic vein sinuses, and hepatic VOD has lately {{been referred to as}} sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). Severe cases of SOS are associated with a high mortality rate. Anticoagulants or defibrotide may be effective in reducing the severity of VOD but may also increase bleeding complications. Ursodiol has been shown to help prevent VOD, presumably by facilitating the flow of bile.|$|E

50|$|Vreeswijk {{worked and}} {{travelled}} to Latin America {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s and developed <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>appreciation</b> for its rich musical heritage.

25|$|A {{critical}} review of ancient DNA literature {{through the development}} of the field highlights that few studies after about 2002 have succeeded in amplifying DNA from remains older than several hundred thousand years. <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> for the risks of environmental contamination and studies on the chemical stability of DNA have resulted in concerns being raised over previously reported results. The dinosaur DNA was later revealed to be human Y-chromosome, while the DNA reported from encapsulated halobacteria has been criticized based on its similarity to modern bacteria, which hints at contamination. A 2007 study also suggests that these bacterial DNA samples may not have survived from ancient times, but may instead be the product of long-term, low-level metabolic activity.|$|E
25|$|One clear {{result of}} the renewal of the Anglo-French contest in the East Indies between 1778–1783 was <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> by the British of the {{strategic}} needs of their newly acquired possessions in Asia. The superimposition of a global struggle between European powers upon several localised Indian wars did unnerve the Company and seriously embarrass its presidencies. Furthermore, the war exposed the rival geo-political ambitions of the French and these in turn provoked the more stolid, unreflecting British to formulate their own logic of empire. When word reached India in 1778 that France had entered the war, the British East India Company moved quickly to capture French colonial outposts there, notably capturing Pondicherry after two months of siege.|$|E
25|$|The lower status {{given to}} works of {{decorative}} art {{in contrast to}} fine art narrowed {{with the rise of}} the Arts and Crafts movement. This aesthetic movement of {{the second half of the}} 19th century was born in England and inspired by William Morris and John Ruskin. The movement represented the beginning of <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> of the decorative arts throughout Europe. The appeal of the Arts and Crafts movement to a new generation led the English architect and designer Arthur H. Mackmurdo to organize the Century Guild for craftsmen in 1882, championing the idea that there was no meaningful difference between the fine and decorative arts. Many converts, both from professional artists' ranks and from among the intellectual class as a whole, helped spread the ideas of the movement.|$|E

Conversely, if a high degree of uncertainty exists regarding ability, entrepreneurs will avoid entering in such ventures because their perceived lack of ability will never overcome the systemic risk.|$|R

500|$|Julie Opipari of Manga Maniac Cafe {{gave the}} initial Gossip Girl manga a {{negative}} review, citing displeasure with {{the characters and}} plot. However, she acknowledged that this gave her <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> for Blair in the second volume, noting that Blair [...] "really {{had to learn how}} to rough it" [...] after losing her privileged lifestyle. She went on to state that [...] "Blair is one character that is fun to hate on. So imagine my surprise when I actually started to like her by the end of the book".|$|E
500|$|After {{turning away}} from gangsta rap, he {{developed}} <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> of the lyricism of Jay Z and Nas. His mother also gave him {{a record of the}} influential group The Watts Prophets, one of the first bands to use spoken words with music. [...] Although he was without a group for the first time, Fiasco continued to record music. One of these first self-recorded tracks was [...] "Could Have Been", which described the career options he could have pursued had he not begun rapping. [...] He viewed the song as a turning point in his career that marked a drastic change in the subject matter of his music. [...] "Could Have Been" [...] was released as a demo tape and discovered by MTV despite the fact that no video was created for the song.|$|E

50|$|Sibelius {{was of the}} {{generation}} of composers whose works modeled late 19th-century compositional methods. Like others, he had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>appreciation</b> for Wagner. Inspired by Wagner, Sibelius {{thought of himself as}} an operatic composer and thought that operas would be the focus of his career. He systematically studied the scores of Wagner's operas Tannhäuser, Lohengrin, and Die Walküre. He also attended a performance of Parsifal, which greatly affected him.|$|R

500|$|McDonald's {{arrival in}} Calgary was {{considered}} {{a turning point for}} the organization, one where his personality, demeanor and on-ice play came to define the Flames in the 1980s. [...] Poile argued that it signaled the true beginning of the team in its new market: [...] "The trade for Lanny McDonald was the start of the Calgary Flames franchise. [...] It gave us that Calgary identity, that Western Canadian flavor." [...] Columnist and co-author of McDonald's autobiography, Steve Simmons, agreed. He added that the personal and professional disappointments McDonald endured in Toronto and Colorado resulted in his gaining <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> of both the game and himself. [...] McDonald was extremely popular with his teammates and the fans wherever he played, {{as well as with the}} media – he was named Colorado's athlete of the year in 1980 by the state's sportswriters.|$|E
500|$|McCudden's last {{activity}} {{worthy of}} note before his return to France was his meeting with Frank Barnwell and Harold Barnwell, chief engineers at Vickers Limited. McCudden and the brothers exchanged information on aircraft design and operations. McCudden understood more of the technique of flying and flight while the brothers gained <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> of the pilot's perspective. After watching him fly the F.B.9, the brothers were convinced of his skill and consequently McCudden was invited to fly a number of their products. Among these machines was the Vickers F.B.16. McCudden claimed to have reached 136 miles per hour (mph) in the aircraft describing it as a [...] "nice bus". Other pilots noted it was faster than the French SPAD and the S.E.5. On {{the strength of this}} evaluation Vickers approached the War Office for its use on the frontline. It was not selected for production. McCudden believed the inaccessibility of the engine was a main factor in its rejection.|$|E

25|$|He had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>appreciation</b> {{of sacred}} music and was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> reader of works about art, but he detested {{physical}} activity.

An aversion to changes in his routine extended to his clothing: he wore the same coat until it tore, forcing his chamberlains to sew it on his body while he slept in it. He suffered from panic attacks when he heard thunder, staying in his rooms with the windows shut and receiving no one.|$|R
2500|$|The {{influence}} of the Arts and Crafts movement led to the decorative arts being given <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>appreciation</b> and status in society and this was soon reflected by changes in the law.
