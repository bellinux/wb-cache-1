5|$|In certain regions, {{presence}} or absence of certain scales may be <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> distinguish non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the {{presence or}} absence of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 SQL {{standard}} basically adopted Codd's proposal {{after an}} implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) {{as one of}} the most controversial features of SQL, he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was the least expensive form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if he so desires; for example, in order to avoid well known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent, coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information; for example, a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column.|$|E
5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler {{and was always}} looking for <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a saloon. They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many {{to believe that he}} fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told. He was portrayed in film only once before he died, and very briefly, in the 1923 film Wild Bill Hickok.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{estimates}} that 90% {{of world trade}} is transported on water, the shipping industry is probably less {{in the public eye}} than other sectors. Due to bigger vessels and economies of scale - partly also because of the appearance of standardized containers - the cost of shipping is quite cheap: a transport of a DVD player costs only $1.5 to reach Europe. Today’s most crowded sea route is between China and the US, which is also quite unbalanced, as the amount of goods travelling from China to the US are four times higher than the opposite direction. Also new routes can be opened - for example Russia’s Northeast Passage is <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get to Europe from China. High-tech Ports are also having ever better services.

In October 2009, it was released on Radio 1's Live Lounge – Volume 4, a compilation of Live Lounge recordings. Australian singer Stan Walker sang a jazzier version of the song on the seventh series of Australian Idol in October 2009. The same year, elementary school group PS22 chorus covered [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] (2009) during Billboards annual Women In Music luncheon held at The Pierre in New York City. In her short-lived Broadway revue [...] "All About Me" [...] in March 2010, Dame Edna Everage performed {{a version of the}} song with backup dancers Gregory Butler and Jon-Paul Mateo. It was also covered by Jeff Tweedy and British singer-songwriter Alan Pownall. According to Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly, Tweedy sang only a few bars; he gave [...] "Single Ladies" [...] an acoustic feel and recited the rest of the song's lyrics. He performed the hand movements that Beyoncé and her dancers do in the song's video. Pomplamoose, an American indie music duo consisting of Jack Conte and Nataly Dawn, recorded a cover of [...] "Single Ladies" [...] on video, which makes use of split screens to show Dawn on vocals and Conte playing the instruments.

Companies that provide short blocks may also offer performance improving engine work. Machine shop work can increase performance by boring out the engine to increase cylinder diameter (which increases internal volume), balancing rotating assemblies (such as the crankshaft), installing a higher performance camshaft, etc. Bored-out engines require larger pistons and new piston rings.

2500|$|More recent {{criticism}} {{has often been}} academic and limited to particular features. University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson wonders whether {{it makes sense for}} the Connecticut Compromise to give [...] "Wyoming the same number of votes as California, which has roughly seventy times the population". Levinson thinks this imbalance causes a [...] "steady redistribution of resources from large states to small states." [...] Levinson is critical of the Electoral College as it allows the possibility of electing presidents who do not win the majority, or even plurality, of votes. Five times in American history, presidents have been elected despite failing to win a plurality of the popular vote: 1824 (John Quincy Adams), 1876 (Rutherford B. Hayes), 1888 (Benjamin Harrison), 2000 (George W. Bush) and 2016 (Donald Trump).

2500|$|One way {{the agency}} makes data {{available}} to the public is by offering a Table Builder tool. It lets users access specific information from past surveys. For example, it's possible to [...] "build" [...] a table about population changes in the Wellington region of married persons using Table Builder—married Wellingtonians (not separated) increased in number from 148,014 (in 2001) to 151,884 (2006). Further, of the 151,884 in the year 2006, 648 lived in the Lambton section. Essentially it allows users to efficiently retrieve specific information from past surveys and censuses. It's <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> retrieve counts and permits what some market researchers call [...] "breakdowns". Columns can be chosen; rows can be chosen; and a table can be pulled together filtered by different variables. The agency does not yet offer end-users the capability to directly mine raw data to generate new statistics. Perhaps in the future users will have the power to access a virtual database of updated census counts, that is, to access a virtual database created [...] "as if the census was taken when the table was being pulled together"—and by using filters, weighting, projections, and easy-to-use software tools, create data which describes [...] "what's happening now". In the example, with such capabilities, one could say how many married (never-separated) Wellingtonians living in Lambton there were [...] "right now". Further, projections could be made. But there is no evidence in the Statistics New Zealand website that such a capability is yet offered, but it is possible this may happen in the future.|$|E
