But {{the quality of life in}} Kerala is regarded as better than in most parts of the third world. It compares favorably even with that in China. Kerala has the highest literacy rate in India (100 %), the lowest child mortality rate, highest life expectancy, high level of womenâ€™s literacy and education, and much better health standards. This fact is acknowledged even by UNDP and World Bank. The library movement in Kerala has contributed to this economic, social, political and educational development. All these dovetail each other so inextricably that library movement in Kerala is both a cause of social and economic development and also a result of that. Kerala has almost 4 libraries per village. This compares very favorably with <b>any</b> <b>Third</b> World <b>country.</b> Kerala library system owes less to the Government sponsorship and aid and more to voluntary effort of the people. Outstanding leaders of the freedom struggle including Shri EMS Namboodiripad, were actively involved in the library movement. Membes of political parties took library work as part of the constructive social service program of their organizations at the grassroots. From 1940 onwards left wing groups took up organization of libraries as part of their mass education program. The 100 % literacy achieved by the Kerala was with the participation and initiative of the 4000 odd libraries in the State. Now Kerala has launched the celebrated decentralized planning process and development and the libraries have a great role to play in it.

40|$|The {{prospect}} of a common currency for Australia and New Zealand has been canvassed by senior poli-ticians and bureaucrats, and {{has been the subject}} of academic debate. According to Mundell (1961), a high degree of internal labour mobility is a desirable feature of currency unions. This study looks at the extent to which long-term migration between Australia and New Zealand responds to output shocks. Estimated VAR models and panel Granger-causality tests demonstrate that shocks to relative per capita output have a significant and symmetrical impact on migration flows between Australia and New Zealand, and most of the impact is felt after about one year. Separating the shocks to Australia and New Zealand shows that 'pull' effects are more important than 'push' effects. Additionally, the trajectory of the Australian economy proves particularly influential for the choice of New Zealand emigrants. Although permanent migration responds intuitively to the state of the economy in Australia and New Zealand, the level of these migration flows is low in comparison to Australian inter-state migration; yet it is high in relation to <b>any</b> <b>third</b> <b>country.</b> Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd/University of Adelaide and Flinders University 2006. ...|$|E
