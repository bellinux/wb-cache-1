5|$|Kastner's {{reasons for}} not making the {{document}} public are unknown. Vrba believed {{until the end of}} his life that Kastner withheld it in order not to jeopardize negotiations between the <b>Aid</b> <b>and</b> Rescue Committee and Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer in charge of the transport of Jews out of Hungary. Shortly after Vrba arrived in Slovakia from Auschwitz in April 1944, Eichmann proposed to the <b>Aid</b> <b>and</b> Rescue Committee in Budapest (specifically to Kastner, Joel Brand and Hansi Brand) that the Nazis trade up to one million Hungarian Jews for 10,000 trucks and other goods from the Western Allies. The proposal came to nothing, but in exchange for money and other goods Kastner did obtain safe passage to Switzerland for 1,684 Jews on what became known as the Kastner train. Vrba believed that Kastner suppressed the Vrba–Wetzler report in order not to damage those negotiations with the SS.|$|E

40|$|Background While {{skin cancer}} {{incidence}} is rising throughout Europe, general practitioners (GP) feel unsure {{about their ability}} to diagnose skin malignancies. Objectives To evaluate whether the GP has sufficient validated clinical decision <b>aids</b> <b>and</b> tools for the examination of potentially malignant skin lesions. Methods We conducted a review searching Medline and the Cochrane Library. In addition, reference lists and personal archives were examined. Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity but also {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different clinical decision <b>aids</b> <b>and</b> tools. Results No clinical decision aids or tools for the examination of non-pigmented lesions are available. Clinical decision <b>aids</b> <b>and</b> tools for the examination of pigmented lesions have mostly been studied in secondary care and, in primary care, randomised clinical trials comparing the additional value of a clinical decision aid or tools to care are scarce. Conclusion Sufficiently validated clinical decision <b>aids</b> <b>and</b> tools for the examination of potentially malignant skin lesions are lacking in general practice. The clinical decision <b>aids</b> <b>and</b> tools available in primary care need to be studied...|$|R

A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E
