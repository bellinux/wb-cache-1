I divide Heidegger’s unusual terms (existentiales) from “Being and time” into the categories <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> and inauthenticity and provide examples of each from the field of sport. In further I analyse the ethical standpoint <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> which is in the centre of both ethical and sociological discourse today. Taylor´s conceptions of moral ideal and culture <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> are critically assessed. Ferrara´s models <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> appear to me as a good basis for various utilization in the area of sport. Finally, I argue for a mixed model <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> that includes both antagonistic and integrative elements...|$|R

40|$|It was {{of primary}} {{interest}} {{to examine the}} affective consequences of conformity to gender stereotypes, and to assess if feelings of social approval and authenticity mediate the relationship between conformity and affect. Therefore, we utilized an Electronic Momentary Assessment methodology to capture University of Maryland students’ engagement in gender stereotypical behavior, and their emotional and social experiences during their daily social interactions. Counter to expectations, we found that regardless of one’s own gender, enacting gender prescriptions enhanced feelings <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> and feelings <b>of</b> social approval, and enacting proscriptions reduced feelings <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> and feelings <b>of</b> social approval. Enacting prescriptions predicted more positive affect and enacting proscriptions predicted a more negative affective experience.

40|$|In {{the recent}} neuroethics literature, {{there has been}} {{vigorous}} debate concerning the ethical implications {{of the use of}} neurotechnologies that may alter a person’s identity. Much of this debate has been framed around the concept <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> The argument <b>of</b> this chapter is that the ethics <b>of</b> <b>authenticity,</b> as applied to neurotechnological treatment or enhancement, is conceptually misleading. The notion <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> is ambiguous between two distinct and conflicting conceptions: self-discovery and self-creation. The self-discovery conception <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> is based on a problematic conception of a static, real inner self. The notion of self-creation, although more plausible, blurs the distinction between identity and autonomy. Moreover, both conceptions are overly individualistic and fail sufficiently to account for the relational constitution of personal identity. The authors propose that a relational, narrative understanding of identity and autonomy can incorporate the more plausible aspects of both interpretations <b>of</b> <b>authenticity,</b> while providing a normatively more illuminating theoretical framework for approaching the question of whether and how neurotechnologies threaten identity. 20 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how Messianic Jews {{understand their}} faith {{as a unique}} form <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> On one level, both Messianic Jewish claims <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> and critics <b>of</b> Messianic <b>authenticity</b> reflect the same semiotic logic of what I call the "evaluative grammar <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> " The evaluative grammar <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> values causal/metonymic indexes over manipulated symbols and is undergirded by a suspicion that general appearances are symbolically manipulated in order to mask actual indexical underpinnings. This paper argues that the strong stance on Messianic Jewish authenticity in this community is facilitated by the employment of the evaluative grammar <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> within a model of reality strongly influenced by the eschatology and epistemology of American Christian fundamentalism. The indexical underpinnings of the cosmos within this model of reality make it logical to conceive of the Messianic Jewish movement as a unique manifestation of authentic biblical religion. This mode <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> is briefly compared to that reflected in the discourse of critics <b>of</b> Messianic Jewish <b>authenticity</b> who tend to employ this evaluative grammar within a more natural/ historical model of reality. This ethnographic example is useful for exploring {{some of the basic}} contours <b>of</b> conflicts over <b>authenticity,</b> including how the value-laden domains of knowledge and agency are implicated in these conflicts. It also illustrates how the evaluative grammar <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> exemplifies a shared cultural value that, due to its internal logic, tends to engender division and cultural heterogeneity as much, or more, than it engenders cultural consensu...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new formalisation <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> and proof <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> These security properties constitute essential requirements for secure electronic commerce {{and other types}} of binding telecooperation. Based on the notions of formal language theory, <b>authenticity</b> and proof <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> are defined relative to the agents' knowledge about the system. Abstraction by language homomorphisms satisfying particular properties preserves the respective security properties from a higher to a lower level of abstraction. Thus, the new formalisation is suitable for a top-down security engineering method. The approach is demonstrated by a typical e-commerce example, a price-offer transaction. We present specifications of this example on two different abstraction levels. On the lower of these abstraction levels, Asynchronous Product Automata (APA) are used to model cryptographic protocols, and properties of cryptographic algorithms are formally described by abstract secure channels...|$|R

Further analyses are used to determine the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> to other motivational reasons for visiting the park, and how the level <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> experienced at ACHNHP affects how respondents rate the importance and performance of many park setting attributes. Using motivation for authenticity and importance/performance variables as predictors, visitor knowledge, perceptions of crowding and conflict, and overall satisfaction are assessed. The results suggest that while authenticity is important for park visitors, experience outputs are difficult to forecast because of correlation among independent variables and homogeneity of park visitors.

5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity.

Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the <b>authenticity</b> <b>of</b> evidence.|$|E

40|$|Although many {{perspectives}} {{suggest that}} authenticity {{is important for}} well-being, people do not always have {{direct access to the}} psychological processes that produce their behaviors and, thus, are not able to judge whether they are behaving consistently with their personality, attitudes, values, motives, and goals. Even so, people experience subjective feelings <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> and inauthenticity, raising the question of factors that influence people’s judgments of whether they are being authentic. The present studies used descriptive, correlational, experimental, and experience sampling designs to examine possible influences on self-judgments <b>of</b> <b>authenticity,</b> including the congruence between people’s behavior and inner dispositions, the positivity of the behavior, their personal beliefs about <b>authenticity,</b> features <b>of</b> the interaction, and trait authenticity. Studies 1 A and 1 B examined the role of people’s beliefs about <b>authenticity</b> in self-judgments <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> Studies 2 A and 2 B investigated the criteria that people use to judge their behavior as authentic versus inauthentic and challenged those criteria to see whether self-perceived authenticity was affected.
