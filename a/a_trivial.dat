A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E

Noticing the commotion, Mahesh tries to calm everyone down but Jimson, furious at Mahesh's authoritative stance, beats him up. Vincent breaks up the fight. Embarrassed, Mahesh vows to get back at Jimson and pledges that he will wear slippers only after he has avenged his humiliation.|$|E
5|$|Many Sudokus {{have been}} found with 17 clues, {{although}} finding them is not <b>a</b> <b>trivial</b> task. A paper by Gary McGuire, Bastian Tugemann, and Gilles Civario, released on 1 January 2012, explains how it was proved through an exhaustive computer search that the minimum number of clues in any proper Sudoku is 17, and this was independently confirmed in September 2013. A few 17-clue puzzles with diagonal symmetry were provided by Ed Russell, after a search through equivalence transformations of Gordon Royle's database of 17-clue puzzles. Sudoku puzzles with 18 clues {{have been found}} with 180° rotational symmetry, and others with orthogonal symmetry, {{although it is not}} known if this number of clues is minimal in either case. Sudoku puzzles with 19 clues have been found with two-way orthogonal symmetry, and again it is unknown if this number of clues is minimal for this case.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{thought that}} the victory {{at the battle of}} Suipacha {{strengthened}} his perspective, as the Junta would have defeated its enemies. He considered that Moreno's animosity was rooted in the aforementioned mutiny of Álzaga, as Moreno took part in it. The victory was celebrated at the barracks of the Patricians, where the officer Anastasio Duarte, who was drunk, made a toast to Saavedra, as if he was the king of the Americas. Moreno drafted the Honours Suppression decree when he knew about it, which suppressed the ceremonies and privileges {{of the president of the}} Junta inherited from the former office of viceroy. However, Saavedra signed it without complaint. The Regiment of Patricians resented Moreno because of this, but Saavedra considered that it was a disproportionated response to <b>a</b> <b>trivial</b> issue.|$|E

5|$|The Importance of Being Earnest, <b>A</b> <b>Trivial</b> Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E
5|$|There {{were serious}} {{scientific}} {{objections to the}} process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that <b>a</b> <b>trivial</b> characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.|$|E

Louis allied himself with the Welsh, Scots and Bretons, and the French king attacked Normandy. Henry responded by attacking Chaumont-sur-Epte, where Louis kept his main military arsenal, burning the town {{to the ground and}} forcing Louis to abandon his allies and make a private truce. Henry was then free to move against the rebel barons in Brittany, where feelings about his seizure of the duchy were still running high.|$|E

A principal G-bundle X is reducible to <b>a</b> locally <b>trivial</b> principal G'-bundle X' if {{and only if}} there exists a local trivialisation of X such that all transition functions take values in G'. We prove a noncommutative-geometric counterpart of this theorem. To this end, we employ the concept of <b>a</b> piecewise <b>trivial</b> principal comodule algebra as a suitable replacement of <b>a</b> locally <b>trivial</b> compact principal bundle. To illustrate our theorem, first we define a noncommutative deformation of the Z/ 2 Z-principal bundle S^ 2 →RP^ 2 that yields <b>a</b> piecewise <b>trivial</b> principal comodule algebra. It is the C*-algebra of a quantum cube boundary whose each face is given by the Toeplitz algebra. The Z/ 2 Z-invariant subalgebra defines the C*-algebra of a quantum RP^ 2. It is given as a triple-pullback of Toeplitz algebras. Next, we prolongate this noncommutative Z/ 2 Z-principal bundle to a noncommutative U(1) -principal bundle, so that the former becomes a reduction of the latter instantiating our theorem. Moreover, using K-theory results, we prove that the prolongated noncommutative bundle is not trivial. Comment: 29 pages, one example removed into a different pape...|$|R
