5|$|By the 1970s Atheis {{had become}} part of the Indonesian junior and senior high school curriculum. In 1974 Sjumandjaja adapted the novel into a film with the same title. The film, shot on a Rp. 80 million (US$193,771) budget, mimicked the novel's {{non-linear}} plot. Intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Indonesia's religious communities, upon its release faced with controversy. Ultimately, the Indonesian censorship bureau passed the film after several cuts. Though it was a commercial failure, Sjumandjaja's Atheis was well received by critics.|$|E
5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Cantor, a devout Lutheran, believed the theory had been communicated {{to him by}} God. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> {{the uniqueness of the}} absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E
5|$|Ecgric's successor, Anna, acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the {{increasing}} power of Penda throughout his reign. In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda's sister, Penda drove {{him from his}} kingdom and into exile. Anna {{was strong enough to}} offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.|$|E

50|$|One {{variation}} on traditional cross country is mountain running, which incorporates significant uphill and/or downhill sections <b>as</b> <b>an</b> additional <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the course.|$|R
5|$|In Europe, {{the teachings}} of Galen {{continued}} to dominate the academic community and his doctrines were adopted as the official canon of the Church. Andreas Vesalius questioned some of Galen's beliefs of the heart in De humani corporis fabrica (1543), but his magnum opus was interpreted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the authorities and he was subjected {{to a number of}} attacks. Michael Servetus wrote in Christianismi Restitutio (1553) that blood flows {{from one side of the}} heart to the other via the lungs.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, the British {{flotilla}} was captured, but Carleton narrowly escaped {{and made}} his way to Quebec City. Montgomery's kind treatment toward the captured British prisoners caused several officers to express their concern. Montgomery saw this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> his authority and this, along with the lack of discipline in the army, caused Montgomery to threaten resignation. Letters from Washington in which Washington also expressed his troubles with the discipline of troops convinced Montgomery to continue his command.|$|E
5|$|The European Super Cup {{was founded}} in the early 1970s, {{as a means to}} {{determine}} the best team in Europe and serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Ajax, the strongest club side of its day. The proposal by Dutch journalist Anton Witkamp, a football match between the holders of the European Cup and Cup Winners' Cup, failed to receive UEFA's backing, given the recent Cup Winners' Cup winners Rangers had been banned from European competition. Witkamp nonetheless proceeded with his vision, a two-legged match played between Ajax and Rangers in January 1973. The competition was endorsed and recognised by UEFA a year later.|$|E
50|$|Fell running, trail {{running and}} {{mountain}} running {{can all be}} considered variations on traditional cross country which incorporate significant uphill and/or downhill sections <b>as</b> <b>an</b> additional <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the course.|$|R
50|$|Sissel v. United States Department of Health & Human Services was {{a lawsuit}} filed by the Pacific Legal Foundation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{constitutional}} <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.|$|R
5000|$|The (self-styled) legitimatism of the ECF, {{developed}} {{into an international}} movement with strong Spanish support as well as Latin American roots, set itself up <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rival <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the IPA.|$|R
5|$|The {{resolution}} {{passed with}} 9 supports and no opposition. Supporting nations included the United States, the United Kingdom, Republic of China, France, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Norway and India. Aleš Bebler, delegate from Yugoslavia, abstained from voting. The Soviet Union's delegate had boycotted all UN meetings because of procedural disagreements {{earlier in the}} year. Soviet ambassador to the United Nations Yakov Malik had been personally ordered not to attend the UNSC meetings by Soviet premier Joseph Stalin. Lie was {{a strong supporter of}} the resolution, as he saw the conflict <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the authority of the UN.|$|E
5|$|The second theme Garner {{identified}} was {{the divide}} between ideal and nonideal theory, which he understands as a way political theory {{may be used to}} contextualise animal ethics and further the debate. Ultimately, for Garner, Cochrane's theory serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> abolitionism, which, Garner fears, both polarises the debate and is unrealistic. The themes of this review were built upon in Garner's 2013 book A Theory of Justice for Animals. In the course of his review of the book, Garner looked forward to the release of Cochrane's second book, Animal Rights Without Liberation, which offers a lengthier defence of the interest-based rights theory.|$|E
5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhrás Ó Murchú, sought nominations to run as an independent candidate. This was widely seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the authority of Micheál Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna Fáil members.|$|E
5000|$|In a July 1541 {{communication}} with Irish chiefs, James assumed {{the style of}} [...] "Lord of Ireland" [...] (dominus Hiberniae), <b>as</b> <b>a</b> further <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Henry VIII, lately created King of Ireland.|$|R

5|$|During {{the debate}} on the bill, New York's Francis B. Cutting demanded that Breckinridge retract or explain a {{statement}} he had made, which Breckinridge understood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> duel. Under the code duello, the challenged party selected the weapons and the distance between combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces and suggested the duel be held in Silver Spring, Maryland, on his friend, Francis Preston Blair's estate. Cutting had not meant his remark as a challenge, but insisted that he was now challenged and selected pistols at 10 paces. While their representatives tried to clarify matters, Breckinridge and Cutting made amends, averting the duel. Had it taken place, Breckinridge could have been removed from the House; the 1850 Kentucky Constitution prevented duelists from holding office.|$|E
5|$|His father distrusted or {{was jealous}} of George's popularity, which contributed to the {{development}} of a poor relationship between them. The birth in 1717 of George's second son, Prince George William, proved to be a catalyst for a family quarrel; the king, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The king was angered when George, who disliked Newcastle, verbally insulted the duke at the christening, which the duke misunderstood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> a duel. George and Caroline were temporarily confined to their apartments on the order of the king, who subsequently banished his son from St James's Palace, the king's residence. The Prince and Princess of Wales left court, but their children remained in the care of the king.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accession}} in Great Britain, George's {{relationship with}} his son (which had always been poor) worsened. George Augustus, Prince of Wales, encouraged opposition to his father's policies, including measures designed to increase religious freedom in Britain and expand Hanover's German territories {{at the expense of}} Sweden. In 1717 the birth of a grandson led to a major quarrel between George and the Prince of Wales. The King, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The King was angered when the Prince of Wales, disliking Newcastle, verbally insulted the Duke at the christening, which the Duke misunderstood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> a duel. The Prince was told to leave the royal residence, St. James's Palace. The Prince's new home, Leicester House, became a meeting place for the King's political opponents. George and his son were later reconciled at the insistence of Robert Walpole and the desire of the Princess of Wales, who had moved out with her husband but missed her children who had been left in the care of the King. However, following the quarrel at the baptism, father and son would never again be on cordial terms.|$|E
50|$|Fascism first {{appeared}} in Italy with the rise to power of Benito Mussolini in 1922. The ideology {{was supported by a}} large proportion of the upper classes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the threat of communism.|$|R
50|$|Due to its artifactual nature, {{psychiatric}} comorbidity {{has been}} considered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Kuhnian anomaly leading the DSM to a scientific crisis and a comprehensive review on the matter considers comorbidity <b>as</b> <b>an</b> epistemological <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> modern psychiatry.|$|R
5000|$|Nogizaka46 {{was named}} after the {{location}} of the SME Nogizaka Building, which houses Sony Music Japan’s office. Their producer Yasushi Akimoto also said that the number [...] "46" [...] was chosen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> AKB48.|$|R
5|$|An ally of Illinois' Stephen A. Douglas, Breckinridge {{supported}} {{the doctrine of}} popular sovereignty as expressed in Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act. He believed passage of the act would remove the issue of slavery from national politics – although it ultimately had the opposite effect – and acted as a liaison between Douglas and Pierce to secure its passage. During {{the debate on the}} House floor, New York's Francis B. Cutting, incensed by a statement that Breckinridge had made, demanded that he explain or retract it. Breckinridge interpreted Cutting's demand <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> duel. Under code duello, the individual being challenged retained the right to name the weapons used and the distance between the combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces. He also specified that the duel should be held at Silver Spring, Maryland, the home of his friend Francis Preston Blair. Cutting, who had not intended his initial remark as a challenge, believed that Breckinridge's naming of terms constituted a challenge; he chose to use pistols at a distance of 10 paces. While the two men attempted to clarify who had issued the challenge and who reserved the right to choose the terms, mutual friends resolved the issue, preventing the duel. The recently adopted Kentucky Constitution prevented anyone who participated in a duel from holding elected office, and the peaceful resolution of the issue may have saved Breckinridge's political career.|$|E
25|$|The US and Australian {{reaction}} to the war had also been mixed, with fears of a Yellow Peril eventually shifting from China to Japan. American figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Lothrop Stoddard saw the victory <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> white supremacy. A few Australian invasion literature novels appeared.|$|E
25|$|Catlin’s vision had no {{immediate}} effect. In the east, romantic portrayals of nature by James Fenimore Cooper and Henry David Thoreau and painters Thomas Cole and Frederick Edwin Church began {{to compete with}} prevailing view of wilderness <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> overcome. Slowly unspoiled nature and spectacular natural areas of the West became better known, the idea of saving such places became of interest.|$|E
5000|$|His textbook, Systematic Programming: An Introduction, was {{considered}} a good source for students who wanted {{to do more than}} [...] "just coding".

5000|$|Coons v. Geithner is {{a lawsuit}} filed on August 12, 2010, by the Goldwater Institute <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{constitutional}} <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act legislation passed in March 2010. The lawsuit was dismissed on December 19, 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{assassination}} {{is significant}} because it was perceived by Austria-Hungary <b>as</b> <b>an</b> existential <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> her and in her view provided a casus belli with Serbia. The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph was aged 84, so the assassination of his heir, so soon before he was likely {{to hand over the}} crown, was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Austrian polity. Many ministers in Austria, especially Berchtold, argue this act must be avenged. Moreover, the Archduke, who had been a decisive voice for peace in the previous years, had now been removed from the discussions. The assassination triggered the July Crisis, which turned a local conflict into a European, and then a worldwide, war.|$|R
25|$|He {{became famous}} in the West as a rancher and gunslinger, getting arrested for murder a few times. He was always acquitted. Known as an adventurer, he was quick to anger and was engaged in {{numerous}} duels throughout his life; he notoriously sent Theodore Roosevelt what the latter interpreted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> a duel, though nothing came of it.|$|E
25|$|For some, WNTD is seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> {{individual}} {{freedom of choice}} or even a culturally acceptable form of discrimination. From ignoring WNTD, to participating in protests or acts of defiance, to bookending the day with extra rounds of pro-tobacco advertisements and events, smokers, tobacco growers, and the tobacco industry {{have found ways to}} make their opinions of the day heard.|$|E
25|$|The Tauranga Campaign was a six-month-long armed {{conflict}} in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty in early 1864, {{and part of}} the New Zealand wars that were fought over issues of land ownership and sovereignty. The campaign was a sequel to the invasion of Waikato, which aimed to crush the Māori King (Kingitanga) Movement that was viewed by the colonial government <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the supremacy of the British monarchy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{incident}} {{has been}} credited with first making American policymakers aware of growing popular resentment to U.S. policies in Latin America.
