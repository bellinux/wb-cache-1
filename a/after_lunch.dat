5|$|This was {{the inaugural}} Lord's Test and England won by an innings after a century by A. G. Steel and fine bowling by Ted Peate and George Ulyett. The game ended just <b>after</b> <b>lunch</b> {{on the third}} day.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>lunch,</b> Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately <b>after</b> <b>lunch,</b> and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Perowne {{goes on to}} his squash match, still {{thinking}} about the incident. He loses the long and contested game by a technicality in the final set. <b>After</b> <b>lunch</b> he buys some fish from a local fishmonger for dinner. He visits his mother, suffering from vascular dementia, who is cared for in a nursing home.|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>lunching</b> in the {{basement}} of the Medical School Philip went back to his rooms. It was Saturday afternoon, and the landlady was cleaning the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Some {{time in the}} afternoon, I know; {{somewhere between}} three and four, I should say. I know I had not been back long <b>after</b> <b>lunching</b> at the Travellers'. I {{generally}} leave there about three, {{and it is not}} more than five minutes' walk up to the Albany.' ...|$|R
60|$|When, <b>after</b> <b>lunching</b> {{and seeing}} round the ship, Miss Terry and Arthur found {{themselves}} in the steam launch waiting for Mrs. Carr, who was saying good-by to the captain and looking after her precious box, Arthur {{took the opportunity to}} ask his companion what she knew of Lord Minster.|$|R
5|$|The {{next morning}} he complained of heart trouble, {{collapsed}} shortly <b>after</b> <b>lunch</b> and {{was taken to the}} hospital. The doctors discovered that he had ruptured an important blood vessel and immediate surgery was needed to fix it. The operation failed to fix the problem, and he died early in the morning on 10 February 1962. His son, Michael, succeeded him as Baron Birkett.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter {{passed through the}} Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer {{republic}} with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day <b>after</b> <b>lunch</b> and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds and grass and the more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was also}} quiet <b>after</b> <b>lunch,</b> and after one {{long period of}} defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, {{eliciting}} a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
50|$|On 20 September 1929 the London Stock Exchange {{committee}} immediately suspended all {{shares of}} the Hatry group, which had been worth about £24 million. On that day Hatry and his leading associates confessed to fraud and forgery {{in the office of}} Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and <b>after</b> <b>lunching</b> at the Charing Cross Hotel were jailed.|$|R

6000|$|He {{had found}} {{work at the}} {{laboratory}} unsatisfactory, and <b>after</b> <b>lunching</b> at his club he had come home and gone to his study in order to think out the discussion he contemplated with her. She came in {{to him as he}} sat at his desk. [...] "Busy?" [...] she said. [...] "Not very," [...] he answered, and she came up to him, kissed his head, and stood beside him with her hand on his shoulder.|$|R
5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during {{the mid to}} late afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference <b>after</b> <b>lunch.</b> Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, {{they are more likely to}} become belligerent and unproductive.|$|E
5|$|Kimi Räikkönen had {{the fastest}} {{time on the}} first day, {{with a time of}} 1:28.833. Rain <b>after</b> <b>lunch</b> caused the test to be halted, when the test resumed Räikkönen was forced to finish early when his car {{experienced}} electronic problems. Scott Speed achieved the second fastest time, two tenths of a second behind Räikkönen, with Seven tenths separating the first eight drivers. The Red Bull team focused on testing their suspension. Rubens Barrichello and Christian Klien shared testing for the Honda team over the day, however Klien's engine failed on his first lap. James Rossiter in the Super Aguri completed the most laps with 115.|$|E
5|$|The cheese {{course was}} {{served by a}} Maître d'hôtel on a trolley. White's rules {{dictated}} that <b>after</b> <b>lunch,</b> the cheese was reviewed {{to ensure that a}} sufficient serving was left to present for the dinner seatings. One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the trolley into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn {{against the wall of the}} kitchen while berating him for not replacing them. Due to the ripeness of the cheese, they remained glued to the wall for the rest of the service.|$|E

6000|$|<b>After</b> <b>lunching</b> I had an hour's {{pleasant}} {{conversation with}} the genial landlord and his buxom good-looking wife; they were both natives of a New Forest village and glad {{to talk about it}} with one who knew it intimately. During our talk I happened to use the words--I forget what about--"As a tree falls so must it lie." [...] The landlady turned on me her dark Hampshire eyes with a sudden startled and pained look in them, and cried: [...] "Oh, please don't say that!' ...|$|R
50|$|George Fayne and Nancy Drew go to Oklahoma, where Jim Haber {{introduces}} them to Carson Drew's {{old friend}} Dr. Langford, {{who is in}} crisis. Langford heads an archaeological dig but strange things are happening at the site. There are cave-ins and thefts in the vaults of the Red Clay artifacts. There, Nancy spots Frank and Joe Hardy, and <b>after</b> <b>lunching</b> together, Nancy finds out that they are there {{on the case of}} missing truck shipments that contained uranium and heavy water - materials used to make an atom bomb.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day Kennedy and Clark {{drove into the}} Delta area, while the other senators flew back to Washington D.C. They were accompanied by Evers, Wright, Moore, Edelman, Carr, {{a dozen or so}} reporters from state and national newspapers and the Big Three television networks, and an assortment of U.S. Marshals, state highway patrolmen, and local police. That morning the senators reviewed anti-poverty programs underway in Greenville and a nearby tent city that had been established by striking farm workers. <b>After</b> <b>lunch,</b> Kennedy's and Clark's motorcade traveled at speeds over 80mph down U.S. Route 61 to visit locations specifically selected by Wright and Moore.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>lunch,</b> Hutton rocked {{onto the}} front foot, played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 2/32. The English opener had been {{uncertain}} against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Later in the afternoon, Denis Compton and captain Norman Yardley played Johnson cautiously but safely; in particular, Yardley repeatedly driving a series of overpitched balls from Johnson for runs. Johnson took the last two wickets to fall on the second day, having Alec Coxon caught and bowled for 19 and Laker caught behind for 28 after the pair had put on 41. England were out early on the third morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>lunch,</b> Morris was bowled for 62, {{knocking}} a {{ball from}} Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep {{from a long}} hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat {{three times in a}} row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the new ball.|$|E

60|$|<b>After</b> the <b>lunch</b> was {{disposed}} of, Richard took a short {{stroll through}} the town. He did not go far, for he had the two valises with him, and they were heavy.|$|R
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} lineup for the Second Test at Lord's. Bradman elected to bat, allowing Lindwall {{more time to}} recover from a groin strain before being required to bowl. Hassett came in to join Morris at 2/87 when Bradman fell soon <b>after</b> <b>lunch</b> on the first day. The new ball was available, but England had declined to take it. Bedser beat Hassett second ball with a delivery that moved back in, but the appeal for lbw was turned down. However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain finally called for a replacement ball. Journalist and retired Australian cricketer Bill O'Reilly said that the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a failure to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). <b>After</b> <b>lunch,</b> there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E
5|$|Immediately <b>after</b> <b>lunch,</b> Lindwall made a {{confident}} appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) against Washbrook, {{but was not}} supported behind the stumps by a silent Saggers, and the umpire ruled against the tourists. At the other end, Hutton square drove Toshack for four, bringing up his fifty in 125 minutes. He followed this with another boundary in the same direction, and Washbrook back cut Lindwall for four more at the other end. This brought up England's 100, its first without loss for the series. Washbrook then on-drove a ball to the boundary and brought up his half-century, as Bradman pondered how to capture Australia's first wicket. England brought up 150 without loss 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief rain interruptions. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.|$|E

5|$|Johnston {{returned}} with the second new ball <b>after</b> <b>lunch</b> to remove Tom Dollery with another yorker, leaving England at 4/97. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook’s in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston’s variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. Late in the day, Johnston took the catch as Lindwall removed Evans, who had taken a wild slash to leave England at 7/216. In the final minutes of play, Johnston extracted an edge from Compton on 64, but Tallon dropped the catch. On the second morning, Tallon dropped Comptonthen on 73for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston, who eventually ended the England innings on 363 by removing Young. Compton had added a further 81 after being dropped from Johnston's bowling to end unbeaten on 145. Johnston had bowled the most overs of the Australians and been the most economical.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>lunch,</b> Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>lunch,</b> {{the light}} was again poor, but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress {{in the hope that}} the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless {{the light was}} so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.|$|E
