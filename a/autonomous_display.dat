40|$|Abstract. Developing <b>autonomous</b> agents <b>displaying</b> {{rational}} and goal-directed {{behavior in a}} dynamic physical environment requires the integration of {{a great number of}} separate deliberative and reactive functionalities. This integration must be built on top of a solid foundation of data, information and knowledge having numerous origins, including quantitative sensors and qualitative knowledge databases. Processing is generally required on many levels of abstraction and includes refinement and fusion of noisy sensor data and symbolic reasoning. We propose the use of knowledge processing middleware as a systematic approach for organizing such processing. Desirable properties of such middleware are presented and motivated. We then argue that a declarative stream-based system is appropriate to provide the desired functionality.

The new <b>Autonomous</b> Statutes <b>display</b> a twofold mistrust. First,there is mistrust of the Central Parliament and its General Electoral Bill, dueto its heavy regulation of regional elections. Second, there is mistrust of theParliament of the Autonomous Community, which is restricted in two ways:a) by including the subjects that should be in an electoral bill in the AutonomousStatute; b) by means of the “consensus trap”, which requires a high level ofagreement among Parliamentary groups in order to pass the electoral bill,which in all likelihood will prevent the changes from being made, as the politicaland institutional future of the groups involved is at stake. If we add two further factors (the application of 116 articles the GeneralElectoral Bill to the autonomous elections and the Autonomous Statute regulation on electoral matters), and we discount one factor (the lack of innovationin the autonomous regional system), it is clear that the Electoral Billsof the Autonomous Communities will be redundant, too detailed and willcover too little.

30|$|The phase-plane {{analysis}} {{discussed above}} {{demonstrates that the}} resonant properties {{are not expected to}} be directly linked to the stability properties of the underlying autonomous system. The time scales corresponding to intrinsic oscillations, if they exist, are determined by the stability properties of the stable foci, which reflect the long term behavior of trajectories. In contrast, the time scales corresponding to the resonant frequency do not involve the stability properties of the fixed points of the underlying autonomous system (nodes or foci) but rather the initial transient behavior of trajectories as described above. This initial transient behavior is the link between the autonomous and forced systems. This transient dynamics is associated with either the onset of intrinsic oscillations (foci) or a “sag” (node) typically observed in the response of h-currents to constant inputs [11]. Importantly, as we demonstrated in Sect.  3.3, <b>autonomous</b> systems may <b>display</b> qualitatively similar transient behavior for nodes and foci, even though the long time behavior of the corresponding trajectories is qualitatively different (see Fig.  4 b).|$|R
40|$|We study an {{ensemble}} of neurons that are coupled through their time-delayed collective mean field. The individual neuron is modelled using a Hodgkin–Huxley-type conductance model with parameters chosen {{such that the}} uncoupled neuron <b>displays</b> <b>autonomous</b> subthreshold oscillations of the membrane potential. We find that the ensemble generates a rich variety of oscillatory activities that are mainly controlled by two time scales: the natural period of oscillation at the single neuron level and the delay time of the global coupling. When the neuronal oscillations are synchronized, they can be either in-phase or out-of-phase. The phase-shifted activity is interpreted {{as the result of}} a phase-flip bifurcation, also occurring in a set of globally delay-coupled limit cycle oscillators. At the bifurcation point, there is a transition from in-phase to out-of-phase (or vice versa) synchronized oscillations, which is accompanied by an abrupt change in the common oscillation frequency. This phase-flip bifurcation was recently investigated in two mutually delay-coupled oscillators and can play a role in the mechanisms by which the neurons switch among different firing patterns.

It was hypothesized that students in <b>autonomous</b> environments would <b>display</b> higher achievement, effort, and intrinsic motivation. There were no controlling teachers found in this study, so all of the students were in autonomous classrooms. The hypothesis was suppported in part since most of the students showed high achievement and effort in their autonomous environments. Unfortunately, a comparison to students in controlling environments was not possible. For this reason, the teachers were divided into three autonomous groups (low autonomy, moderate autonomy, and high autonomy).

40|$|The {{question}} for many designers of intelligent systems {{is no longer}} whether to incorporate emotion and motivation, but how to do so. This question has strong consequences for the autonomy and flexibility of a system {{and its ability to}} respond to novel, unpredictable or changing environments – in other words, the degree of intelligence it will <b>display.</b> <b>Autonomous</b> agents that learn through situated embodiment in a rich and changing environment may require a very different approach to emotion and motivation than systems in which procedures are written to cover all contingencies and choices are made among known alternatives, albeit using a sophisticated decision process.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore the relationship between bureaucracies and counselling. More specifically, this research will examine how bureaucratic structures influence counsellors' attitudes and occupational behaviour. Based on the distinction between autonomous and heteronomous bureaucracies, two contrasting work settings were defined and operationalized. The attitudes of counsellors were measured using the concept 'bureaucratic orientation' and counsellors' jobs were examined using the dimensions standardization and specialization of occupational practice. [...] Forty counsellors were interviewed. Nineteen counsellors were from autonomous settings and twenty-one from heteronomous settings. Interviews consisted of open and close-ended questions and lasted approximately one hour. [...] The findings indicate that counsellors' attitudes within bureaucratized settings are determined {{not only by the}} degree of bureaucratization within each organizational setting, but also by the length of time spent in the work unit, level of education, and the position held within the organization. The findings also indicate that specialization and standardization of occupational practice are positively correlated with bureaucratization. [...] Differences by gender were found to be significant. Women in counselling were found to be marginalized. On all the dimensions measured, women were subordinate to men. Women were also over- represented in highly bureaucratized settings. Female counselors were more bureaucratically oriented than males, had spent less time in the organization than males, and were more likely to possess vocational as opposed to academic degrees. In contrast, males were over-represented in <b>autonomous</b> settings, <b>displayed</b> lower levels of bureaucratic orientation than females, had spent more time in the organization, and were more likely to possess advanced academic degrees. [...] The evidence does not support the existence of bureaucratic- professional conflict, although the potential for this conflict exists to a greater degree in autonomous work units than in highly bureaucratized (heteronomous) work units. The research also points to the socialization aspect of education and the type of education undertaken by counsellors as being major factors in formulating attitudes towards bureaucracies and in determining the place of employment. ...|$|R

Flaw- response models provide a fast and cheap alternative to test- piece trials but their use involves prior knowledge about the model's theory and application, requiring an experienced NDT engineer.

40|$|Nicotinic synapses in the <b>autonomous</b> {{nervous system}} <b>display</b> use-dependent {{plasticity}} but {{the contribution of}} cellular environment, {{as well as the}} presynaptic mechanisms implicated in this process remain to be determined. To address these questions synaptic function was assayed in rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons microcultured in isolation from any other cell type and compared to those microcultured in the presence of Schwann cells of ganglionar origin. Schwann cells were not required for synapse formation in vitro because functional cholinergic autaptic synapses were established in both experimental conditions. The number of synapses was comparable between the two culture conditions but the frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents was enhanced in those neurons grown in direct contact with glial cells. Autapses displayed facilitation and depression, both processes being determined by the fraction of vesicles from the readily releasable pool discharged by an action potential. At high release probabilities vesicles were more efficiently mobilized, thus promoting depression, whilst low release probabilities made facilitation likely to occur. Schwann cells did not modify significantly facilitation but increased synaptic depression. In single cell microcultures, paired pulse stimuli showed a monoexponential recovery from depression with a time constant of ∼ 60 ms, while in microcultures developed together with glial cells, recovery was bi-exponential with a significantly slower time course. Altogether these results show that Schwann cells from sympathetic ganglia directly modulate use-dependent plasticity of nicotinic synapses in vitro by enhancing short-term depression...|$|R

However, while sensors tend to generate noisy and incomplete quantitative data, reasoning often requires crisp symbolic knowledge. The gap between sensing and reasoning is quite wide, and cannot in general be bridged in a single step. Instead, this task requires a more general approach to integrating and organizing multiple forms of information and knowledge processing on different levels of abstraction in a structured and principled manner. We propose knowledge processing middleware as a systematic approach for organizing such processing. Desirable properties of such middleware are presented and motivated. We argue that a declarative stream-based system is appropriate to provide the desired functionality and present DyKnow, a concrete implemented instantiation of stream-based knowledge processing middleware with a formal semantics.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} estimations of cost {{functions for}} {{a panel of}} firms from the Uruguayan commercial private banking sector, testing for economies of scale and scope and technical change between 1989 and 1993. Using a translog specification with fixed effects for bank operating costs, the paper demonstrates the inexistence of economies of scale for all classes of bank size as measured by their total number of employees. However, the finding of constant returns to scale {{in the case of}} smaller banks suggests that this class of banks has cost advantages over those of bigger size. These results and the concavity of the cost function show the absence of a natural monopoly. Regarding scope economies, no significant complementarities between products were found except for the biggest banks, where banking services and loans show an important degree of complementarity. Two approaches are made to the study of technical change: fitting a standard time trend and a time-specific index, which both give consistent results {{in the case of the}} average firm. Results differ however by firm size: in the smaller firms there was not any significant change affecting products or inputs, while the average and bigger ones not only <b>displayed</b> <b>autonomous</b> change but also showed increasing returns in the holdings of government bonds. The time index method (applied only to average firms) suggests this change takes place since 1991. While across all the period in neither case the hypothesis of neutrality of technical change (in Hick's sense) could be rejected, the time index method suggests that some kind of labour-saving technical change was undertaken between 1989 and 1990. ...|$|R
40|$|The female {{gametophyte}} {{of higher}} plants gives rise, by double fertilization, to the diploid embryo and triploid endosperm, which develop in concert {{to produce the}} mature seed. What roles gametophytic maternal factors play in this process is not clear. The female-gametophytic effects on embryo and endosperm development in the Arabidopsis mea, fis, and fie mutants appear {{to be due to}} gametic imprinting that can be suppressed by METHYL TRANSFERASE 1 antisense (MET 1 a/s) transgene expression or by mutation of the DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM 1) gene. Here we describe two novel gametophytic maternal-effect mutants, capulet 1 (cap 1) and capulet 2 (cap 2). In the cap 1 mutant, both embryo and endosperm development are arrested at early stages. In the cap 2 mutant, endosperm development is blocked at very early stages, whereas embryos can develop to the early heart stage. The cap mutant phenotypes were not rescued by wild-type pollen nor by pollen from tetraploid plants. Furthermore, removal of silencing barriers from the paternal genome by MET 1 a/s transgene expression or by the ddm 1 mutation also failed to restore seed development in the cap mutants. Neither cap 1 nor cap 2 <b>displayed</b> <b>autonomous</b> seed development, in contrast to mea, fis, and fie mutants. In addition, cap 2 was epistatic to fis 1 in both autonomous endosperm and sexual development. Finally, both cap 1 and cap 2 mutant endosperms, like wild-type endosperms, expressed the paternally inactive endosperm-specific FIS 2 promoter GUS fusion transgene only when the transgene was introduced via the embryo sac, indicating that imprinting was not affected. Our results suggest that the CAP genes represent novel maternal functions supplied by the female gametophyte that are required for embryo and endosperm development...|$|R
40|$|The CDC 34 (UBC 3) protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a 125 residue tail that {{contains}} a polyacidic region flanked on either side by sequences of mixed composition. We show that although a catalytic domain is essential for CDC 34 activity, a major cell cycle determinant of this enzyme is found within a 74 residue segment of the tail {{that does not include}} the polyacidic stretch or downstream sequences. Transposition of the CDC 34 tail onto the catalytic domain of a functionally unrelated E 2 such as RAD 6 (UBC 2) results in a chimeric E 2 that combines RAD 6 and CDC 34 activities within the same polypeptide. In addition to the tail, the cell cycle function exhibited by the chimera and CDC 34 is probably dependent on a conserved region of the catalytic domain that is shared by both RAD 6 and CDC 34. Despite this similarity, the CDC 34 catalytic domain cannot substitute for the DNA repair and growth functions of the RAD 6 catalytic domain, indicating that although these domains are structurally related, sufficient differences exist to maintain their functional individuality. Expression of the CDC 34 catalytic domain and tail as separate polypeptides are capable of only partial function; thus, while the tail <b>displays</b> <b>autonomous</b> structural characteristics, there is considerable advantage gained when both domains coexist within the same polypeptide. The ability of these and other derivatives to restore partial function to a cdc 34 temperature-sensitive mutant but not to a disruption mutant suggests that interaction between two CDC 34 polypeptides is a requirement of CDC 34 activity. Based on this idea we propose a model that accounts for the initiating steps leading to multi-ubiquitin chain synthesis. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} formulation {{that represents}} the motion of a particle under the simultaneous influence of two gravitational fields is identified as the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR 3 BP). This model of an <b>autonomous</b> dynamical system <b>displays</b> both ordered and chaotic behavior. For some behaviors, simple linear analysis relative to a numerically determined point solution in the problem is sufficient to reveal interesting aspects of the motion, while other scenarios require more extensive procedures to capture the unique features comprising the dynamical behavior. This balance between predictability and complexity that is exhibited in the CR 3 BP, along with the typical approaches for its analysis, supplies excellent justification {{for the application of}} relatively straightforward techniques typically applied in more complicated problems. Among these, a number of versatile analysis tools are based on the concepts of the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) and Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS). ^ Lagrangian coherent structures appear as height ridges, or curves of constrained maxima, in a field of FTLE values. Application of interactive visualization, numerical methods, and parallel computation is employed to obtain FTLE data and the associated LCS. These results are compared with known structures to further establish LCS as a useful tool for application in the CR 3 BP and to demonstrate LCS as a seed for a variety of additional research questions. Results associated with potential applications to mission design are supplied, and comparisons between LCS methods and concurrent research efforts involving other, more familiar, approaches are generated with particular focus on the advantages of FTLE and LCS methods. Ultimately, this analysis serves to validate the concepts of FTLE and LCS as an effective means to further understand the complex behavior in the CR 3 BP. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The European Pollutant Emission Register in Spain (EPER-Spain) is {{a public}} {{inventory}} of pollutant industries created by decision of the European Union. The location of these industries is geocoded and the first published data correspond to 2001. Publication of these data will allow for quantification {{of the effect of}} proximity to one or more such plant on cancer and all-cause mortality observed in nearby towns. However, as errors have been detected in the geocoding of many of the pollutant foci shown in the EPER, it was decided that a validation study should be conducted into the accuracy of these co-ordinates. EPER-Spain geographic co-ordinates were drawn from the European Environment Agency (EEA) server and the Spanish Ministry of the Environment (MOE). The Farm Plot Geographic Information System (Sistema de Información Geográfica de Parcelas Agrícolas) (SIGPAC) enables orthophotos (digitalized aerial images) of any territorial point across Spain to be obtained. Through a search of co-ordinates in the SIGPAC, all the industrial foci (except farms) were located. The quality criteria used to ascertain possible errors in industrial location were high, medium and low quality, where industries were situated at a distance of less than 500 metres, more than 500 metres but less than 1 kilometre, and more than 1 kilometre from their real locations, respectively. Results Insofar as initial registry quality was concerned, 84 % of industrial complexes were inaccurately positioned (low quality) according to EEA data versus 60 % for Spanish MOE data. The distribution of the distances between the original and corrected co-ordinates for each of the industries on the registry revealed that the median error was 2. 55 kilometres for Spain overall (according to EEA data). The <b>Autonomous</b> Regions that <b>displayed</b> most errors in industrial geocoding were Murcia, Canary Islands, Andalusia and Madrid. Correct co-ordinates were successfully allocated to 100 % of EPER-Spain industries. Conclusion Knowing the exact location of pollutant foci is vital to obtain reliable and valid conclusions in any study where distance to the focus is a decisive factor, {{as in the case of}} the consequences of industrial pollution on the health of neighbouring populations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Kinaesthetic Learning Activities (KLA) are {{techniques}} for enhancing the motor learning process {{to provide a}} deep understanding of fundamental skills in particular disciplines. With KLA learning takes place by carrying out a physical activity to transform empirical achievements into representative cognitive understanding. In disciplines such as medical education, frequent hands-on practice of certain motor skills {{plays a key role}} in the development of medical students' competency. Therefore it is essential that clinicians master these core skills early on in their educational journey as well as retain them for the entirety of their career. Transferring knowledge of performing dexterous motor skills, such as clinical examinations, from experts to novices demands a systematic approach to quantify relevant motor variables with the help of medical experts in order to form a reference best practice model for target skills. Additional information (augmented feedback) on certain aspects of movements could be extracted from this model and visualised via multi-modal sensory channels in order to enhance motor performance and learning processes. This thesis proposes a novel KLA methodology to significantly improve the quality of palpation training in medical students. In particular, it investigates whether it is possible to enhance the existing abdominal palpation skills acquisition process (motor performance and learning) with provision of instructional concurrent and terminal augmented feedback on applied forces by the learner's hand via an <b>autonomous</b> multimodal <b>displays.</b> This is achieved by considering the following: identifying key motor variables with help of medical experts; forming a gold standard model for target skills by collecting pre-defined motor variables with an innovative quantification technique; designing an assessment criteria by analysing the medical experts' data; and systematically evaluating the impact of instructional augmented feedback on medical students' motor performance with two distinct assessment approaches(a machine-based and a human-based). In addition, an evaluation of performance on a simpler task is carried out using a game-based training method, to compare feedback visualisation techniques, such as concurrent visual and auditory feedback as used in a serious games environment, with abstract visualisation of motor variables. A detailed between-participants study is presented to evaluate the effect of concurrent augmented feedback on participants' skills acquisition in the motor learning process. Significant improvement on medical students' motor performance was observed when augmented feedback on applied forces were visually presented (H(2) = 6 : 033, p < : 05). Moreover, a positive correlation was reported between computer-generated scores and human-generated scores, r = : 62, p (one-tailed) < : 05. This indicates the potential of the computer-based assessment technique to assist the current assessment process in medical education. The same results were also achieved in a blind-folded (no-feedback) transfer test to evaluate performance and short-term retention of skills in the game-based training approach. The accuracy in the exerted target force for participants in the game-playing group, who were trained using the game approach (Mdn = 0 : 86), differed significantly from the participants in control group, who trained using the abstract visualisation of the exerted force value (Mdn = 1 : 56), U = 61, z = - 2 : 137, p < : 05, r = - 0 : 36. Finally, the usability of both motor learning approaches were surveyed via feedback questionnaires and positive responses were achieved from users. The research presented shows that concurrent augmented feedback significantly improves the participants' motor control abilities. Furthermore, advanced visualisation techniques such as multi-modal displays increases the participants' motivation to engage in learning and to retain motor skills...|$|R
