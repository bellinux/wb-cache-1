5|$|Cameroon has a {{high level}} of {{religious}} freedom and diversity. The predominant faith is Christianity, practiced by <b>about</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> the population, while Islam is a significant minority faith, adhered to by about one-fifth. In addition, traditional faiths are practiced by many. Muslims are most concentrated in the north, while Christians are concentrated primarily in the southern and western regions, but practitioners of both faiths can be found throughout the country. Large cities have significant populations of both groups. Muslims in Cameroon are divided into Sunnis (including Wahhabis), Shias, Sufis, and non-denominational Muslims.|$|E

5|$|In {{the modern}} era, Cluj's {{population}} experienced two phases of rapid growth, {{the first in}} the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital. <b>About</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, natural increase was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.|$|E
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony fishes. In the western Indian Ocean, <b>about</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> its diet consists of fishes, in particular ponyfish and anchovies, with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid prawns. Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E

30|$|Discussion This {{study is}} the first to assess renal {{recovery}} in critically ill myeloma patients with severe AKI, in the era of bortezomib therapy. First of all, survival and renal recovery in our study are much higher than previously reported. <b>About</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>of</b> the patients were alive at day 60, and 41  % had recovered their baseline renal function. We identified two prognostic factors which can be considered as surrogates of more aggressive malignancies.|$|R
30|$|<b>About</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>of</b> the {{metabolites}} that {{we identified}} as responsive to drought and associated with tolerance were unknowns (Fig.  5). Identifying {{a large number}} of unknowns is not surprising and it is estimated that plants have up to 1 million metabolites (Saito and Matsuda 2010) while commercial libraries generally include only a few thousand. It will therefore require a major effort and investment to reveal the nature of these molecules and the underlying pathways.|$|R

About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of the digestive tract (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) {{may be the first}} symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, may represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only <b>about</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) {{and the fact that it}} is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991; {{however, the}} full implementation of declaration only came into effect on 8 October 1991. In the meantime, tensions escalated into overt war when the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and various Serb paramilitary groups attacked Croatia. By {{the end of}} 1991, a high-intensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced Croatia to control of only <b>about</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> its territory. The various Serb paramilitary groups then began pursuing a campaign of killing, terror and expulsion against the non-Serb population in the rebel territories, killing thousands of Croat civilians and forcing at least 170,000 from their homes.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in <b>about</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of}} the greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E

5|$|Elemental {{chlorine}} is commercially {{produced from}} brine by electrolysis. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine {{led to the}} development of commercial bleaches and disinfectants, and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, <b>about</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, and many intermediates for the production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{also called}} the First Kashmir War. The war started in October 1947 when Pakistan feared that the Maharajah of the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu would accede to India. Following partition, states were left to choose whether to join India or Pakistan or to remain independent. Jammu and Kashmir, {{the largest of the}} princely states, had a {{predominantly}} Muslim population ruled by the Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh. Tribal forces with support from the army of Pakistan attacked and occupied parts of the princely state forcing the Maharajah to sign the Agreement to the accession of the princely state to the Dominion of India to get Indian military aid. The UN Security Council passed the Resolution 47 on 22 April 1948. The fronts solidified gradually along what {{came to be known as}} the Line of Control.

40|$|Ductal {{carcinoma}} in situ (DCIS), {{accounting for}} 15 - 25 % of all breast cancers, is frequently diagnosed by mammographic examination. This heterogeneous disease requires a rigorous local treatment based, in <b>about</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>of</b> cases, on conservative surgery and radiotherapy. DCIS are currently classified {{on the basis of}} nuclear grade. Most lesions, and especially high nuclear grade DCIS, are limited to one quadrant. Micropapillary DCIS are likely to be of larger size/extent and thus a conservative approach is often difficult.

Miners, who worked mostly in the Ruhr area, did not have this tradition but developed a certain skepticism of bureaucratic structures. About 450 of them joined the FVdG before World War I, a sign of what was to come after the war.|$|E
