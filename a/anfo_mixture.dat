50|$|MISTY PICTUREwas {{the fourth}} {{test in the}} MISTY CASTLE series of {{large-scale}} High Explosive (HE) tests sponsored by the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA). The test was run on 14 May 1987. The explosive consisted of 4685 tons of an Ammonium Nitrate and Fuel Oil (<b>ANFO)</b> <b>mixture</b> loaded in bulk into a 44-foot radius fiberglass hemisphere. This is equivalent to 3900 tons of TNT. Detonation of this charge provided an airblast and ground motion environment which was used by numerous agencies to collect basic explosive environmental data and to test a variety of systems and equipment in a simulated nuclear environment. The resulting overpressure from the detonation simulated the approximate equivalent airblast of an 8 kiloton nuclear device.|$|E

50|$|After World War II, methylammonium nitrate {{was largely}} ignored by {{explosives}} manufacturers, {{in favor of}} less-costly ammonium nitrate. Ammonium nitrate-fuel oil <b>mixtures</b> (<b>ANFO)</b> were sufficient for most large-diameter explosives uses.|$|R
40|$|The Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of NIOSH {{conducted}} research {{to determine the}} safe operating conditions for using recycled (used) lubricating oil from mining equipment as a partial replacement for diesel fuel to make ANFO-type blasting agents. The use of recycled oil (RO) conserves energy, reduces oil imports, and reduces mining costs. Since RO has a variable composition, there was concern that the additives/impurities it contains may cause ANFO made with RO to be unstable (as compared to regular ANFO) at high summer ambient storage temperatures. Reactivity of RO with zinc was also a concern. Thermal stability tests were conducted to help quantify and resolve these issues. <b>ANFO</b> <b>mixtures</b> (0. 66 lb/ 300 g) were put into sample containers made of steel, stainless steel, and galvanized (zinc coated) steel pipe fittings, which were heated in isothermal ovens. The experimental parameters were temperature settings of 14020 F (6020 C) and 17620 F (8020 C), four sample container (pipe fitting) metal combinations, and nominal heating periods of one and three days. The ANFO samples contained 6...|$|R
50|$|The {{best known}} {{blasting}} agent is <b>ANFO</b> explosive, a <b>mixture</b> containing primarily ammonium nitrate {{with a small}} quantity (typically around 6%) of fuel oil, most commonly diesel fuel. Other fuels and additives are used as well.|$|R
50|$|<b>ANFO</b> is a <b>mixture</b> of 94% {{ammonium}} nitrate ("AN") and 6% fuel oil ("FO") widely {{used as a}} bulk industrial explosive. It is used in coal mining, quarrying, metal mining, and civil construction in undemanding applications where the advantages of ANFO's low cost {{and ease of use}} matter more than the benefits offered by conventional industrial explosives, such as water resistance, oxygen balance, high detonation velocity, and performance in small diameters.|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{there have been}} small scale tests {{available}} for evaluating the toxic fumes production by cap-sensitive explosives (DOT Class 1. 1), but these {{could not be used}} with blasting agents due to the large charge sizes and heavy confinement required for proper detonation. Considering the extensive use of blasting agent in construction and mining, {{there is a need to}} determine the quantities of toxic fumes generated by blasting agents. At the International Society of Explosive Engineers Twenty Third Annual Conference on Explosives and Blasting Technique in 1997, the authors reported on a facility for detonating large (4. 54 kg), confined blasting agent charges in a controlled volume that had been constructed at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Pittsburgh Research Lab 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Experimental Mine. Since 1997, this facility has been used to collect data on toxic fumes produced by the detonation of various ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (<b>ANFO)</b> <b>mixtures</b> and several cap-sensitive explosives. ANFO composition ranging from 1 to 10 percent (pct) fuel oil have been studied. As expected from previous studies, with an increase in fuel oil content the carbon monoxide production increases, while nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide production decrease. The detonation velocity varies from 3, 000 to 4, 000 m/sec for the 1 to 10 pct range of fuel oil content, suggesting that ANFO mixes with improper fuel oil content may appear to detonate properly, while their fume production differs significantly from optimum. The study also considers such factors as degree of confinement, water contamination, and aluminum content on blasting agent fume production. Results indicate that water contamination of the ANFO has little effect on carbon monoxide production, but causes significant increase in nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide production. Decreasing confinement from Schedule 80 steel pipe to 0. 4 -mm thick sheet metal also has little effect on carbon monoxide production, but significantly increases nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide production. Adding 5 and 10 pct aluminum to the ANFO had no clear effect on carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, or nitrogen dioxide production...|$|R
