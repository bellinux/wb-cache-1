5|$|Kurzanov {{and colleagues}} in 2003 {{designated}} six teeth from Siberia as Allosaurus sp. (meaning {{the authors found}} the specimens to be most like those of Allosaurus, but did not or could not <b>assign</b> <b>a</b> species). Also, reports of Allosaurus in Shanxi, China go back to at least 1982.|$|E
5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to <b>assign</b> <b>a</b> Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl, they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
5|$|Special {{abilities}} are another {{important aspect of}} Chocobo Racing. Before each race, the player is prompted to <b>assign</b> <b>a</b> special ability to the selected character. During a race, the player can only activate the chosen special ability when the meter in the upper left-hand corner of the screen is full. After using the special ability, the player must wait for the meter to recharge to use it again.|$|E
25|$|The wing was <b>assigned</b> <b>an</b> {{additional}} Air Defense Group in September 1954 {{when the}} 4700th Air Base Group at Stewart Air Force Base, New York was <b>assigned</b> <b>an</b> operational fighter squadron and redesignated the 4700th Air Defense Group. The 4707th was also <b>assigned</b> <b>an</b> additional radar unit two months later.|$|R

5|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to <b>assign</b> <b>a</b> limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage {{for the rest of the}} lemmings.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{appropriated}} {{funding for}} the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of freeways across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to <b>assign</b> <b>a</b> new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the west) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates. Major decommissioning of former routes began with California's highway renumbering in 1964. The 1985 removal of US66 is often seen {{as the end of}} an era of US highways.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} scales for rating the {{strength}} of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and <b>assign</b> <b>a</b> rating.|$|E
5000|$|Classification and {{clustering}} {{are examples}} of the more general problem of pattern recognition, which is the assignment {{of some sort of}} output value to a given input value. Other examples are regression, which <b>assigns</b> <b>a</b> real-valued output to each input; sequence labeling, which <b>assigns</b> <b>a</b> class to each member of a sequence of values (for example, part of speech tagging, which <b>assigns</b> <b>a</b> part of speech to each word in an input sentence); parsing, which <b>assigns</b> <b>a</b> parse tree to an input sentence, describing the syntactic structure of the sentence; etc.|$|R

5|$|After the 76ers {{got off to}} an 0–16 {{start to}} the season, Okafor was {{involved}} in a street fight with taunting individuals on November 25 in Boston. On November 30, with additional reports surfacing that Okafor had been involved in various controversial and dangerous off-the-court situations, the 76ers agreed to a request to <b>assign</b> <b>a</b> security guard to accompany Okafor in public. On December 1, Okafor and the 76ers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 103–91. The win ended the longest losing streak in the history of major professional sports in the United States (28 games going back to the prior season) and the worst start in NBA history (tied with the 2009–10 New Jersey Nets at 0–18). The next day, video surfaced on TMZ of a second fight in Boston from November. Okafor was subsequently suspended by the 76ers for two games. He returned from suspension against the San Antonio Spurs on December 7, recording 10 points and 4 rebounds off the bench in a 119–68 defeat. On January 16, 2016, he recorded 25 points and 10 rebounds in a 114–89 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, helping the 76ers snap a four-game losing streak and improving their record to 5–37. On January 27, 2016, he was named to the 2016 NBA All-Star Game weekend Rising Stars Challenge lineup.|$|E
5|$|Artist Takayoshi Sato {{corrected}} {{inconsistencies in}} the plot, and designed the game's cast of characters. As a young employee, Sato was initially restricted to basic {{tasks such as}} font design and file sorting. He also created 3D demos and presentations, and taught older staff members the fundamentals of 3D modeling. However, he was not credited for this work as {{he did not have}} as much respect within Konami as older employees. Sato eventually approached the company's higher-ups with a short demo movie he had rendered, and threatened to withhold this technical knowledge from other staff members if he was not assigned to 3D work. As a consequence, his superior had to give in to his demand, and he was allowed to do character designs. Instead of relying on illustrations, Sato conceived the characters of Silent Hill while creating their computer-generated models. He gave each their own distinctive characteristics, but made Harry almost completely neutral as he wanted to avoid forcing interpretations of the game on the players. Creating the skull shapes for the faces of the American cast was difficult because he had no Caucasian co-workers to use for reference. Although Sato was largely responsible for the game's cinematics and characters at this point, his superior still did not want to fully credit his work, and intended to <b>assign</b> <b>a</b> visual supervisor to him. To prevent this from happening, Sato volunteered to create the full-motion videos of Silent Hill by himself. Over the course of two and a half years, he lived in the development team's office, as he had to render the scenes with the approximately 150 Unix-based computers of his coworkers after they left work {{at the end of a}} day.|$|E
