5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>display</b> and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

5000|$|The {{very first}} [...] "programmable calculator/computer" [...] was marketed {{in the second}} half of the 1960s, {{starting}} with the Italian machinery Programma 101 (1965) computer at typewriter size. More desktop models were introduced in 1971, leading to a model programmable in BASIC in 1972. This one used a smaller version of a minicomputer design based on read-only memory (ROM) and had small one-line LED <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>displays.</b> They could draw computer graphics with a plotter.|$|R

50|$|Most {{handsets}} utilized a monochrome LCD display {{capable of}} displaying 7 or 10 digits, with green or orange LED backlighting. The better featured handsets used a 7 digit <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>display,</b> {{and offered a}} color LCD display as an option.|$|E
50|$|A tote {{board is}} a large numeric or <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>display</b> used to convey information, {{typically}} at a race track (to display the odds or payoffs for each horse) or at a telethon (to display the total amount donated to the charitable organization sponsoring the event).|$|E
50|$|Annunciator panels were {{relatively}} costly to install in a plant {{because they had}} dedicated wiring to the alarm initiating devices in the process plant. Since incandescent lamps were used, a lamp test button was always provided to allow early detection of failed lamps. Modern electronic distributed control systems usually require less wiring since the process signals can be monitored within the control system, and the engraved windows are replaced by <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>displays</b> on a computer monitor.|$|R

50|$|MDC-systems have {{an option}} for {{selective}} calling. By pressing a series of keys on the encoder-decoder, the base station operator can send a data packet that activates a lighted indicator or makes the radio beep. On some radio models with <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>displays,</b> the display may flash CALL until a reset button is pressed. On radio models with ten key pads, mobile radios may be programmed to selectively call one another in this manner. In order to call a radio, the calling party must know the four-digit MDC identity of the radio to be called.|$|R
50|$|The HP-41C {{series are}} programmable, expandable, {{continuous}} memory handheld RPN calculators made by Hewlett-Packard from 1979 to 1990.

50|$|In 2008 Victor {{launched}} the PL8000 printing calculator. The PL8000 contained many industry firsts including an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>display,</b> alphanumeric printer, Prompt Logic guides for the user, Loan Wizard, personalized text messages, reprint key, and HELP key. The PL8000 {{was also the}} fastest and quietest printing calculator available at that time.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, {{most of these}} {{flexible}} handheld units belong to the class of graphing calculators. Before the mass-manufacture of inexpensive dot-matrix LCDs, however, programmable calculators usually featured a one-line numeric or <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>display.</b> The Big Four manufacturers of programmable calculators are Casio, Hewlett-Packard, Sharp, and Texas Instruments. All of the above have also made pocket computers in the past, especially Casio and Sharp.|$|E

40|$|Image {{quality as}} a general notion relates both to {{elementary}} and to complex visual functions. In this paper we deal {{with a few of}} them, which correspond to some lines of research at our Institute. We start with threshold predictions in time and space domains by means of elementary response functions, which have been recently developed considerably, although full generalization has not yet been achieved. As to suprathreshold stimuli, the responses of subjects usually have to be scaled. Here we deal with some problems connected with scaling techniques. After a brief discussion of the applicability of notions on visual conspicuity and visual search to image quality problems, we finally discuss reading from <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Custom {{design for}} a {{particular}} customer {{is a thing of}} the past. Modern mobile radio equipment is [...] "feature rich". A mobile radio may have 100 or more channels, be microprocessor controlled and have built-in options such as unit ID. A computer and software is typically required to program the features and channels of the mobile radio. Menus of options may be several levels deep and offer a complicated array of possibilities. Some mobile radios have <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>displays</b> that translate channel numbers (F1, F2) to a phrase more meaningful to the user, such as [...] "Providence Base", [...] "Boston Base", etc. Radios are now designed with a myriad of features to preclude the need for custom design.|$|R
50|$|Some {{systems have}} {{technical}} limitations that may constrain {{the amount of}} information an error message can contain. For example, a printer with a sixteen-character <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>display</b> can only show a very limited amount of information at once, so it may need to display very terse error messages. Even with computer monitors, the programmer must consider the smallest monitor that a user might reasonably use, and ensure that any error messages will fit on that screen.|$|E
50|$|The {{alphanumeric}} LCD {{screen of}} the HP-41C revolutionized {{the way a}} pocket calculator could be used, providing user friendliness (for its time) and expandability (keyboard-unassigned functions could be spelled out alphabetically). By using an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>display,</b> the calculator could tell the user what was going on: it could display meaningful error messages ("ZERO DIVIDE") instead of simply a blinking zero; it could also specifically prompt the user for arguments ("ENTER RADIUS") instead of just displaying a question mark.|$|E
50|$|A 4L's four status LEDs {{will also}} light in unusual {{patterns}} to indicate service requirements; for example, a lit error {{light and a}} lit ready light would indicate a fuser problem (usually just needs to be reseated - most 4L problems can be resolved by simply disassembling the printer, cleaning it, then reassembling it). This was much more cryptic than the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>display</b> of earlier models like the II/IID, III/IIID, IIP, and IIIP, as {{it was impossible to}} determine the meaning of the patterns of LEDs without comparing them against a manual (or having their meaning memorized, which some technicians exposed to them often might actually do, intentionally or not). Interestingly, the 4L used early light pipes, with surface-mounted LEDs on the control board {{on the left side of}} the printer, and plastic channels to conduct light from the lit status LEDs to the top of the printer. The LaserJet 4/4 Plus/4M/4M Plus retained an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>display,</b> and in fact upgraded from the LCD displays of earlier models by using a 16-character alphanumeric dot-matrix vacuum fluorescent display. To this day, professional-grade LaserJets retain more comprehensive displays.|$|E

40|$|Among {{optical field}} effect {{phenomena}} of known solid state materials, only three {{are suitable for}} alphanumeric displays: (i) electric field switching of the spontaneous birefringence, (ii) electric field induced birefringence and (iii) electric field switching of the spontaneous optical rotatory power (electrogyration). The birefringence effects are necessarily coupled with mechanical deformations, whereas electrogyration is not. Among the known ferroelectrics, only a few, Gd/sub 2 /(MoO/sub 4 /) /sub 3 /, boracites Bi/sub 4 /Ti/sub 3 /O/sub 12 /, Bi/sub 4 /TiO/sub 3 / and PLZT come close to meeting the requirements for <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>displays.</b> For large scale production, the development of shear free or very low shear compositions-for single crystals, layers and ceramics-appears mandatory.
