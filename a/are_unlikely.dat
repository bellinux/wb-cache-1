5|$|Although the {{problems}} of listing maximal cliques or finding maximum cliques <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be fixed-parameter tractable with the parameter , they may be fixed-parameter tractable for other parameters of instance complexity. For instance, both problems {{are known to be}} fixed-parameter tractable when parametrized by the degeneracy of the input graph.|$|E
5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to occur. The only {{reported}} hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at different times.|$|E

5|$|In {{setting up}} {{protected}} reserves, efforts generally {{also have to}} be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.|$|E
5|$|One {{problem with}} {{counting}} attacks on humans {{is that the}} copper shark is so similar to other requiem sharks. Victims and witnesses <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to correctly identify which type of genus Carcharhinus shark {{is responsible for the}} attack. Experts trying to confirm shark attacks by species warn that their statistics undercount the number of attacks by requiem sharks like the copper.|$|E
5|$|Paul Davies, {{a member}} of the SETI Post-Detection Taskgroup, has stated that post-detection protocols, calling for {{international}} consultation before taking any major steps regarding the detection, <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be followed by astronomers, who would put the advancement of their careers over the word of a protocol that is not part of national or international law.|$|E

The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge, a new crossing between the Woolwich Ferry and the Dartford Crossing, was cancelled by Boris Johnson when he replaced Livingstone as mayor in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The gods {{involved}} in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. The enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to have been divided among the priests alone, so {{it is likely that}} the celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.|$|E
5|$|The new {{research}} suggests that the rocky centres of super-Earths <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because they appear to hold on to their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E

5|$|The two Crex crakes <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be {{confused}} with other rails, since most sympatric short-billed rails are smaller, with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills. The European water rail and the African rail have long pointed bills.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2007). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because they <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. When last assessed in 2007, the population trend was stable.|$|E
5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E

5|$|A {{review of}} {{metformin}} overdoses reported to poison control centers {{over a five-year}} period found serious adverse events were rare, though the elderly appeared to be at greater risk. A similar study in which cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg were more likely to involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. In healthy children, unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|Blackbuck are {{severely}} affected by natural calamities such as floods and droughts, {{from which they}} can {{take as long as}} five years to recover. Wolves are major predators; a study found that old rutting bulls might be vulnerable to wolves. Cheetahs and pariah dogs are the other predators. Juveniles are also hunted by jackals. Village dogs are reported to kill fawns, but <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to successfully hunt and kill adults.|$|E

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a slight risk of poisoning where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as ethylene glycol causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence. Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. They <b>are</b> <b>unlikely</b> to possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material {{left over from the}} earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E
