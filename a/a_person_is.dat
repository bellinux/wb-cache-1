Moreover, an order can only be sought where <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> being physically detained, and not {{if he or she is}} merely under some other form of restriction such as being out on bail.|$|E

5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, wherein <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will. The second path is Nivritti-karma, wherein <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and rebirth.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially when <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of}} the imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E

Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.|$|E

5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism.

5|$|The {{enactment}} specifies {{the amount}} of time which must elapse after <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> released from prison for serving time for particular groups of crimes.

5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis.

A common example of overuse of this procedure is the practice of performing ultrasonography routinely on patients without indication after knee or hip replacement.|$|E
