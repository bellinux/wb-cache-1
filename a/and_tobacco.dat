40|$|OBJECTIVES: Use of <b>tobacco</b> <b>and</b> alcohol during {{childhood}} predicts heavy {{use of these}} substances and use of illicit drugs during adolescence. This study aims to identify developmental correlates of <b>tobacco</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use among elementary-school children. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were used to measure <b>tobacco</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use, multiple indicators of child competence, parenting behaviors, and parental modeling of <b>tobacco</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use {{in a sample of}} 1470 third- and fifth-grade children. Both self-report and teacher-rated assessments were obtained, which allowed collateral testing of study hypotheses. RESULTS: Children's <b>tobacco</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use was strongly related to low scores on several measures of child competence, both self-reported and teacher rated. Children's <b>tobacco</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use was also associated with less effective parenting behaviors and with parental use of <b>tobacco</b> <b>and</b> alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Children's early experience with <b>tobacco</b> <b>and</b> alcohol is associated with weak competence development and exposure to socialization factors that promote risk taking. Interventions to prevent early use of <b>tobacco</b> <b>and</b> alcohol are needed...|$|R

Diamond mining {{was active in the}} Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain calico and muslin (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to Java and the Far East. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed.

However, during the 1890s, manufacturing growth slowed dramatically. The Panic of 1893 and subsequent depression and the overproduction of grain made St. Louis mills considerably less productive and valuable. Flour milling was halved and most other industries suffered similar declines.|$|E
