5|$|Late at night, Hilarion mourns at Giselle's {{grave in}} the forest, but is frightened {{away by the}} arrival of the Wilis, the ghostly spirits of maidens betrayed by their lovers. The Wilis, led by their merciless queen Myrtha, haunt the forest at night to seek revenge on <b>any</b> <b>man</b> they encounter, forcing their victims to dance until they die of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during his}} college tour, Chapman {{mentioned}} that a television audience member {{had written to}} the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, adding that the Bible said <b>any</b> <b>man</b> who lies with a man should be taken out and stoned. With other Pythons already aware of his sexual orientation, Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E

5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both {{the living and the}} dead. Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to <b>any</b> <b>man</b> who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E
5|$|London was {{the premier}} centre for boxing because the aristocratic {{supporters}} of the sport dispersed to their country estates {{during the summer months}} but tended to congregate in the city for the winter period. Birmingham was often portrayed as second only to London for the sport and in 1789 there were a series of challenges issued by fighters from the Birmingham area to opponents based around London. The challenges were intended to demonstrate the level of organisation and confidence among the Birmingham boxers and their supporters. Three of these challenges were accepted, including that from Perrins to Tom Johnson. Perrins had already issued a general challenge, offering to fight <b>any</b> <b>man</b> in England for a prize of 500 guineas, having beaten all challengers in the counties around Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{doubt this}} traditional account, arguing instead that the monarchy {{evolved into a}} government led by elected magistrates. Remnants of the monarchy, however, were reflected in republican institutions, such as the religious office of rex sacrorum ("king of the sacred") and the interregnum (a period of time presided over by an interrex when the offices of consul, praetor, and dictator were all vacant). There, is, however, certainly evidence that the early Republic {{was a time of}} violent change, with the word rex carrying the same connotations as tyrant and laws which declared forfeit the life and property of <b>any</b> <b>man</b> who plotted to install himself as a king or tyrant.|$|E

5|$|After a time, Himmler {{found that}} the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and {{sometimes}} did not kill the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered {{physical and mental health}} problems, and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of Einsatzgruppe D, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that <b>any</b> <b>man</b> who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.|$|E
5|$|At Branga, Shiva {{learns that}} the only person aware of the {{medicine}} recipe is a bandit named Parashuram, who leads a secluded life and kills <b>any</b> <b>man</b> coming near his abode in the jungles. Shiva and his men defeat Parashuram, and to his surprise comes {{to know that he}} is a Vasudev, the group of scholars who have been guiding him on his journey. Parashuram is also surprised to see Shiva as the fabled Neelkanth; in remorse for his actions, he severs his left hand. He gives the recipe of the medicine to the people of Branga and leaves for Kashi with Shiva. At Kashi, Shiva is introduced to Ganesh and Kali by Sati. Shiva recognizes Ganesh as the Naga who tried to attack on Sati and as the killer of Brahaspati. Severely angered, he leaves Sati and takes up residence at the Branga locality. One day, while playing with Kartik at a local park, three lions attack them and Ganesh becomes severely injured while saving Kartik. Shiva forgives him and together with Sati, confronts Daksha, who confesses to murdering Sati's first husband and denouncing Kali and Ganesh. Daksha blames Shiva for causing distrust between him and Sati, who disgusted with Daksha's deeds, asks him to leave Kashi and go back to Meluha.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal <b>any</b> <b>man.</b> The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} the lives of women that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E

5|$|The British {{relief of}} Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning {{of the war}} against the Boers. Morale {{plummeted}} among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that <b>any</b> <b>man</b> who deserted in this time of need should be shot. He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so, along with a few thousand foreign volunteers (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians). When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war. Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May Lord Roberts took Johannesburg. Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to Machadodorp, and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a tag team elimination match, in which The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) teamed with the Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobbs) to face Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake). The rules stated that when <b>any</b> <b>man</b> was eliminated, his tag team partner {{would also be}} eliminated. Blake Beverly and Typhoon began the match, but Beau and Earthquake soon entered the ring as well. The Natural Disasters gained control of the match by attacking Blake Beverly, and the Nasty Boys entered the ring to assist the Disasters. Blake attacked Sags and tagged out of the match. Beau entered but was bodyslammed by Sags; Sags got distracted, however, which allowed Beau to suplex him and bring DiBiase into the match. Money Inc. took turns attacking Sags until Earthquake entered the ring. Earthquake performed an Earthquake splash by sitting on Beau Beverly to pin him and eliminate both Beverly Brothers. Earthquake fought DiBiase, but both men eventually left the ring and were replaced by their partners. Typhoon performed a splash on Schyster but was tripped by DiBiase. Schyster pinned Typhoon to eliminate The Natural Disasters. While Schyster was celebrating, Sags quickly pinned him to win the match for the Nasty Boys.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Roger Just {{states the}} main {{principle of the}} epiklerate was that no man could become the guardian of the property without also becoming the husband of the epikleros. Just uses this principle to claim that <b>any</b> <b>man</b> adopted by the father of an epikleros was required to marry the epikleros. Just states that the forcible divorce and remarriage of an epikleros was based on this principle, arguing that if {{the father of the}} epikleros had not adopted the first husband, the husband was not really the heir. Just sees the development of the epiklerate as flowing from Solon's desire to keep the number of Athenian households constant. According to Just, before Solon's legislation, the epikleros was just treated as part of the property, but that Solon's reforms transformed the epikleros into a transmitter of the property and her son the automatic heir to her father's estate.|$|E

5|$|Domitian was {{declared}} emperor by the Praetorian Guard {{the day after}} Titus' death, commencing a reign which lasted more than fifteen yearslonger than <b>any</b> <b>man</b> who had governed Rome since Tiberius. Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage, expanded the border defenses of the Empire, and initiated a massive building programme to restore the damaged city of Rome. In Britain, Gnaeus Julius Agricola expanded the Roman Empire as far as modern day Scotland, but in Dacia, Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory {{in the war against}} the Dacians. On September 18, 96, Domitian was assassinated by court officials, and with him the Flavian dynasty came to an end. The same day, he was succeeded by his friend and advisor Nerva, who founded the long-lasting Nervan-Antonian dynasty. Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate, with which he had a notoriously difficult relationship throughout his reign. Senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories after his death, propagating the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern history has rejected these views, instead characterising Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat, whose cultural, economic and political programme provided the foundation for the Principate of the peaceful 2nd century. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's.|$|E
5|$|They {{are taken}} {{to the home of}} the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of Kôr, a once mighty {{civilisation}} that predated the Egyptians. The queen and her retinue live under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of Kôr. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants <b>any</b> <b>man</b> who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of telegnosis and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to see into the future. She tells Holly that she has lived in the realm of Kôr for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). Later, when Holly inadvertently and secretly discovers Ayesha in her hidden chamber, he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead.|$|E
