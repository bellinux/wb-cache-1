He was survived by two sons; his widow, who had been an invalid for some years, died six months later.|$|R

5|$|Most {{histories}} of professional Australian sculling commence with this event. By 1877, Australia had a vigorous interest in sport, and {{a class of}} professional athletes was emerging. Far from defeating him, the match of 30 June 1877 gave Rush new energy. After <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of retirement, he began to train and compete, mastering the sliding seat. He regained his Australian Championship in September 1881.|$|E
5|$|Although Koniecpolski had a stutter, {{when he was}} 15, {{through his}} father's {{influence}} in the royal court, he secured an appointment as starosta (mayor) of Wieluń. In 1603 he began studying at the Kraków Academy, and after several years {{he was sent to}} the royal court by his father so that he could continue his education in a more practical fashion. He is believed to have stayed there <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> He may also have undertaken a tour of Western Europe for several months, spending the majority of his time in France before returning to his family's estates.|$|E
5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of sea service before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'. From the 18th century {{until the second}} half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their turn on a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.|$|E

5|$|After the Great Uprising, the Prussians rose {{a number}} of times against the Knights, but these uprisings were much smaller in scale and posed no real danger to the Teutonic Knights, who could {{concentrate}} on further conquests. The number of uprisings is variously considered to be two or three.. They were suppressed within <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> and showed exhaustion and division of the Prussian tribes. The third uprising in 1276 was provoked by Skalmantas, leader of the Sudovians, who successfully raided Teutonic lands. The next year he, with help from the Lithuanians, led 4,000 men into the Culmerland (Chełmno Land). The uprising failed to spread after Theodoric, vogt of Sambia, convinced the Sambians not to join the insurrection; Natangians and Warmians had also accepted baptism and promised their loyalty to the Knights. The Pogesanians alone continued the fight and were crushed. Survivors with their Bartian chief escaped to Hrodna in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania where they joined some of the Bartians, Skalvians, and all of the Nadruvians, who fled there after the Great Uprising.|$|E
5|$|As {{the senior}} member of the Hamdanid dynasty, he {{inherited}} the family power base around Mosul from his father, and was able to secure it against challenges by his uncles. Hasan became involved in the court intrigues of the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad, and, between 942 and 943, he, with the assistance of his brother Ali (known as Sayf al-Dawla), established himself as amir al-umara, or de facto regent for the Abbasid caliph. He was driven back to Mosul by Turkish troops, however, and subsequent attempts to challenge the Buyids who seized control of Baghdad and lower Iraq ended in repeated failure. Twice, his capital Mosul was captured by Buyid forces, which were, however, unable to defeat local opposition to their rule. As a result of his failures to retain power, Nasir al-Dawla declined in influence and prestige. He was eclipsed by the actions of his brother Ali, who established his rule more firmly over Aleppo and northern Syria. After 964, Nasir al-Dawla's eldest son Abu Taghlib exercised de facto rule over his domains, and in 967, Abu Taghlib and his brothers deposed and imprisoned their father, who died in captivity <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later.|$|E
5|$|Like {{his father}} and {{brothers}} before him, Ted attended Harvard College. In his spring semester, {{he was assigned to}} the athlete-oriented Winthrop House, where his brothers had also lived. He was an offensive and defensive end on the freshman football team, with his play being characterized by his large size and fearless style. In his first semester, Kennedy and his classmates arranged to copy answers from another student during the final examination for a science class. At the end of his second semester in May 1951, Kennedy was anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year, and he had a classmate take his place at a Spanish language examination. The ruse was immediately discovered and both students were expelled for cheating. In a standard Harvard treatment for serious disciplinary cases, they were told they could apply for readmission within <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> if they demonstrated good behavior during that time.|$|E

5|$|Most bovids are polygynous. In a few species, {{individuals}} are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be {{slightly larger than}} males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This {{is the case in}} duikers and other small bovids. The time taken for the attainment of sexual maturity by either sex varies broadly among bovids. Sexual maturity may even precede or follow mating. For instance the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of age. On the contrary barbary sheep females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual maturity. The delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay Weston Phipps was {{the second}} son of Pownoll Phipps and Phipps' third wife, the Irish-born Anna Charlotte Smith. Born at the family estate, Oaklands, in Tipperary, Ireland, he was named Ramsay in honor of an uncle who pioneered slave {{emancipation}} in the West Indies, and Weston after another uncle, a scientific clergyman. By 1841, his father had returned to England, to reside in Kent, where the family lived in Yalding. They lodged at the Parsonage with a local farmer, Ramsey Warde; Ramsey Warde was also a relative of Phipps' mother. The family of four included three-year-old Ramsay, his older brother, Pownoll (age five), his mother (age 30) and his father. Eventually, two more children joined the family: Henrietta Sophia and Robert Constantine, twins born 23 September 1841. The boy died 9 October, but Henrietta lived into adulthood, marrying Lieutenant-Colonel William Smith. After suffering a bout of measles in spring 1847, Ramsay Phipps attended Mr. Barron's School at Stanmore with his older brother, Pownoll, {{with the intent to}} following his brother in <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> to Rugby in Warwickshire.|$|E

A revolution is a certainty. How much better that that revolution should be conducted in a dignified manner; that I, with my reputation for democracy which I have carefully kept before the eyes of my people, should be elected President of the new Spanish Republic, even if it is the gold of the American who places me there. In <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> time, what may happen who can say? This craving for a republic is but a passing dream. Spain, at heart, is monarchical.

5|$|The cantata falls {{relatively}} {{early in}} Bach's chronology of cantata compositions.

He scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-partchoir only in the chorale, and an unusual Baroque instrumental ensemble of four violas, cello, bassoon and basso continuo. When he performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, he added two recorders to double viola I and II an octave higher.|$|R
