25|$|The basic {{utilitarian}} rationalization {{for research}} on human beings is the ends justify the means. This means that any sort of research on a human being is justified {{by the possibility of}} successfully saving others. For example, all cancer research would be justified by the possibility of finding a cure for cancer, which would inevitably save the life of many others. The utilitarian argument focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number of people or the greater good. Under the utilitarian justification it is a person's duty to sacrifice himself or herself if it would save others as long as the individual person's societal worth is less than the combined societal worth of the others. Therefore, if either a doctor or <b>a</b> <b>homeless</b> <b>person</b> must die to save the lives of many others, the homeless person must sacrifice himself since he is worth less to society than the doctor.|$|E

After eighteen months, the library staff felt they still were not doing enough and [...] "analyzed program participation trends supplemented by observation and anecdotes" [...] in order to better understand the information needs of homeless people. When it was understood that these needs are complex, additional customer service training was provided to all staff who were interested. Once the staff more fully understood the needs of homeless people, it was determined that many programs in place already, with a few minor adjustments, would be helpful to homeless people.
