5|$|After her defeat, Bondfield {{returned}} to her NUGMW post. The TUC, suspicious of her perceived closeness to MacDonald, was cool towards her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> re-elected to the General Council. She remained Labour's candidate at Wallsend; {{in the general election}} of 1935 she was again defeated. She never {{returned to}} parliament; she was adopted as the prospective Labour candidate for Reading, but when it became obvious that the election due for 1940 would be delayed indefinitely by war, she resigned her candidacy.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Evstafi {{began on}} 13 July 1904, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 23 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 3 November 1906. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> completed until 28 May 1911.

5|$|HMS Agamemnon {{was ordered}} in 1904 {{and was the}} first warship built by the William Beardmore and Company's Dalmuir Naval Construction Works. She was laid down on 15 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 23 June 1906 before the dockyards themselves were finished. Her completion was greatly delayed by labour troubles and by the diversion of the 12-inch (305mm) guns intended for her to expedite completion of HMS Dreadnought, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> finally completed until June 1908, six months before her sister Lord Nelson.|$|E
5|$|HMS Lord Nelson {{was laid}} down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at Jarrow on 18 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 4 September 1906. Her completion was greatly delayed by the diversion of her 12-inch (305mm) guns and turrets to expedite completion of , <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> fully completed until October 1908. Although {{she was not the}} last pre-dreadnought laid down for the Royal Navy, she was the last one commissioned.|$|E
5|$|Puglia {{was built}} by the new Regia Marina {{shipyard}} in Taranto, the first major warship to be built there. Her keel was laid down in October 1893, and she was launched on 22 September 1898. Fitting-out work {{proved to be a}} lengthy process, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> ready for service until 26 May 1901. By this time, her design was over ten years old and the ship was rapidly becoming obsolescent; in comparison, Germany had already commissioned the world's first light cruisers, the , which were significantly faster and better armed. This new type of ship rapidly replaced protected cruisers like Puglia.|$|E

5|$|Swordfish {{was ordered}} from Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company on 18 August 1913 {{although}} she was not laid down until 28 February 1914. The start of the First World War six months later greatly hindered her completion, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> launched until 18 March 1916. HMS Swordfish was commissioned on 28 April 1916, before completion, and renamed HMS S1 that same day. She was not completed until 21 July.|$|E
5|$|The air {{groups of}} the sisters were {{decimated}} in the battle, which forced Zuikaku to return to Japan with Shōkaku for resupply and aircrew training, and neither carrier {{was able to take}} part in the Battle of Midway in June. En route to Japan, Shōkaku was caught in a severe storm and nearly capsized as the weight of the water used to put out the fires had compromised her stability. Repairs took three months <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> ready for action until late August.|$|E
5|$|When Bågenholm {{was pulled}} out of the water, her pupils were dilated, her blood was not circulating, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> breathing. Falkenberg and Næsheim, both doctors, began giving her {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR). The rescue helicopter soon arrived and Bågenholm was brought to the Tromsø University Hospital in an hour. The helicopter emergency team continued to give her CPR during the flight, and she was ventilated with oxygen. She was also treated with a defibrillator, but to no effect.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Ioann Zlatoust {{began on}} 14 November 1903, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 13 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 13 May 1906. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War. For example there was a period of seven months in 1907 where virtually no work was done on the ship <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> completed until 1 April 1911. Ioann Zlatousts turrets had originally been intended for a reconstruction of the elderly pre-dreadnought , but they were diverted to Ioann Zlatoust after that reconstruction was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Marceau {{was ordered}} in October 1880, {{but was not}} laid down until 27 January 1882 at the Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée {{shipyard}} in La Seyne-sur-Mer. Work proceeded slowly, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> launched until April 1890. This {{was a result of}} the influence of Admiral Théophile Aube, who was the Minister of Marine in 188687; Aube was a staunch advocate of the so-called Jeune École and opposed new battleship construction. Fitting out work was completed much more quickly, however, and she was commissioned into the French fleet on 14 March 1891. After her commissioning, she joined a French fleet that visited Kronstadt and was inspected by Czar Alexander III of Russia. On the return voyage, the fleet stopped in Spithead, where Queen Victoria reviewed the ships. This {{turned out to be the}} only time Marceau operated in the Atlantic; after returning to France, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron, where she remained for the duration of her career.|$|E
5|$|Voroshilov {{began her}} postwar {{modernization}} in April 1954, but encountered {{the same issues}} as Maxim Gorky. Unlike her half-sister, she was selected for conversion as a testbed for missile development as Project 33 on 17 February 1956. The conversion process was quite prolonged, as her armament was removed and she received an entirely new superstructure and masts; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> recommissioned as OS-24 until 31 December 1961. She was modernized under Project 33M from 11 October 1963 to 1 December 1965. Converted to a floating barracks on 6 October 1972, she was briefly redesignated as PKZ-19 before being sold for scrap on 2 March 1973. Voroshilovs 14-ton propeller and 2.5-ton stop anchor are {{on display at the}} Museum of Heroic Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol on Sapun Mountain in Sevastopol.|$|E

5|$|Richard Beitzen resumed escort {{work and}} laid mines in the Skagerrak until she ran aground again in November. Repairs were slow <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> fully {{operational}} until 15 February 1945. The ship was badly damaged by radar-equipped bombers while screening a convoy {{on the morning}} of 24 April and put into Oslo, Norway for repairs that were not completed {{before the end of the}} war the next month. Richard Beitzen was captured by the British on 14 May and temporarily turned over to the Royal Norwegian Navy on 15 July while the Allies decided on the disposition of the captured ships. She was allocated to Britain at the end of 1945 and was then towed to Rosyth in February 1946. Richard Beitzen was ordered to be used as a target in September, but a heavy leak three months later caused her to be beached lest she sink. Temporary repairs were made and she was allocated for disposal in January 1947. Richard Beitzen was allocated to C. W. Dorkin for breaking up the following year and she was towed to their facility in Gateshead on 10 January 1949.|$|E
