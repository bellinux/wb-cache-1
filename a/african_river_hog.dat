40|$|In view of {{the concern}} over {{potential}} infection hazards {{in the use of}} porcine tissues and organs for xenotransplantation to humans, we investigated the diversity of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) genomes in the DNA of domestic pigs and related species. In addition to the three known envelope subgroups of infectious gamma retroviruses (PERV-A, -B, and -C), classed together here as PERV group γ 1, four novel groups of gamma retrovirus (γ 2 to γ 5) and four novel groups of beta retrovirus (β 1 to β 4) genomes were detected in pig DNA using generic and specific PCR primers. PCR quantification indicated that the retroviral genome copy number in the Landrace × Duroc F 1 hybrid pig ranged from 2 (β 2 and γ 5) to approximately 50 (γ 1). The γ 1, γ 2, and β 4 genomes were transcribed into RNA in adult kidney tissue. Apart from γ 1, the retroviral genomes are not known to be infectious, and sequencing of a small number of amplified genome fragments revealed stop codons in putative open reading frames in several cases. Analysis of DNA from wild boar and other species of Old World pigs (Suidae) and New World peccaries (Tayassuidae) showed that one retrovirus group, β 2, was common to all species tested, while the others were present among all Old World species but absent from New World species. The PERV-C subgroup of γ 1 genomes segregated among domestic pigs and were absent from two <b>African</b> species (red <b>river</b> <b>hog</b> and warthog). Thus domestic swine and their phylogenetic relatives harbor multiple groups of hitherto undescribed PERV genomes...|$|R
50|$|Species in the Safari Park include: Springbok, Spider Monkey, African Lions, Macaws, Capuchin, Fischer's Lovebirds, Sable Antelope, Ostrich, African Warthogs, Olive Baboons, Red <b>River</b> <b>Hogs,</b> Ring-tailed Lemur, Spotted Hyena.|$|R

50|$|The red <b>river</b> <b>hog</b> {{lives in}} rainforests, wet dense savannas, and forested valleys, and near rivers, lakes and marshes. The species' {{distribution}} ranges from the Congo area and Gambia {{to the eastern}} Congo, southwards to the Kasai and the Congo River. The exact delineation of its range versus that of the bushpig is unclear; but in broad terms, the red <b>river</b> <b>hog</b> occupies western and central Africa, and the bushpig occupies eastern and southern Africa. Where the two meet, they are sometimes said to interbreed, although other authorities dispute this. Although numerous subspecies {{have been identified in}} the past, none are currently recognised.|$|R

50|$|Red <b>river</b> <b>hogs</b> breed seasonally, so {{that the}} young are born {{between the end of}} the dry season in February and the {{midpoint}} of the rainy season in July. The oestrus cycle lasts 34 to 37 days. The male licks the female's genital region before mating, which lasts about five to ten minutes. Gestation lasts 120 days.|$|R
50|$|Opened in 2016, {{this exhibit}} is extensive, {{home to a}} small pod of Hippopotamus, {{as well as a}} herd of Nyala and Red <b>river</b> <b>hog.</b> The exhibit is complimented by massive Baobab trees and a metal net, {{spanning}} the entire enclosure. This is because the exhibit also houses many African birds such as Hamerkop and Eurasian spoonbill.|$|R
50|$|The Australian Realm {{is viewed}} from a boardwalk. Although it {{originally}} displayed Australian animals, {{it is currently}} {{in a state of}} redevelopment. This exhibit opened with red kangaroo, dama wallaby, parma wallaby, emu, black swan, cereopsis, radjah shelduck, and magpie goose. The small seasonal exhibit, which formerly housed warthogs and aardwolf, currently houses red <b>river</b> <b>hog.</b>|$|R

The gorilla density of 1.6 individuals/km² within the Dzanga sector {{is one of}} the highest densities ever reported for the western lowland gorilla.|$|R
50|$|Six {{acres of}} land holding 17 {{separate}} exhibits and 23 species of mammals and birds. Mammals include chimpanzees, warthogs, red <b>river</b> <b>hogs,</b> cheetahs, Grévy's zebras, white rhinoceroses, hippopotami, klipspringer, De Brazza's monkey, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs.

40|$|This study {{provides}} basic {{data on the}} species richness, spatial distributions, and densities of large- and medium-sized mammals in two Community Hunting Zones (CHZs 13 and 14) located in the northern periphery of Boumba-Bek National Park, southeastern Cameroon. The survey was conducted along 126 2 -km transects and 101 recce walkways between transects, over a total of 398 km. A total of 31 species, or groups of species, of large- and medium-sized mammals were observed. The highest encounter rates (ERs) were recorded for red duikers (8. 74 signs/km), blue duiker (6. 12), and brush-tailed porcupine (4. 42). Relatively high ERs (0. 5 or more) were observed for elephant, red <b>river</b> <b>hog,</b> tree pangolin, yellow-backed duiker, and gorilla. Human activities including hunting and snaring were widely observed in the study area. Spatial distribution analysis revealed that different species were affected differently by human activities. In CHZ 13, an area more populated by humans, populations of red duikers and red <b>river</b> <b>hog,</b> important game animals for the local people, appeared to have decreased. In contrast, duikers and red <b>river</b> <b>hog</b> remained in CHZ 14 at similar levels as in the neighboring national parks. These results suggest that areas neighboring the park can exist in different stages of animal deterioration; therefore, the situation should be examined carefully to elaborate an effective wildlife management model that contributes {{not only to the}} conservation of biodiversity but also to the sustainable use of bushmeat by local people...|$|R
