500|$|On {{the way out}} of Hades, Euridice {{is delighted}} to be {{returning}} to earth, but Orfeo, remembering the condition related by Amore in act 1, lets go of her hand and refusing to look at her, does not explain <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She does not understand his action and reproaches him, but he must suffer in silence (Duet: [...] "Vieni, appaga il tuo consorte"/"Viens, suis un époux"). Euridice takes this to be a sign that he no longer loves her, and refuses to continue, concluding that death would be preferable. She sings of her grief at Orfeo's supposed infidelity in the aria [...] "Che fiero momento"/"Fortune ennemie" [...] (in 1774, there is a brief duet before the reprise). Unable to take any more, Orfeo turns and looks at Euridice; again, she dies. Orfeo sings of his grief in the famous aria [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?"/"J’ai perdu mon Eurydice" [...] ("What shall I do without Euridice?"/"I have lost my Euridice") Orfeo decides he will kill himself to join Euridice in Hades, but Amore returns to stop him (1774 only: Trio: [...] "Tendre Amour"). In reward for Orfeo's continued love, Amore returns Euridice to life, and she and Orfeo are reunited. After a four-movement ballet, all sing in praise of Amore ("Trionfi Amore"). In the 1774 version, the chorus ("L’Amour triomphe") precedes the ballet, to which Gluck had added three extra movements.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I cannot say <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that will}} do any good,' he resumed. 'It would be awkward--either seeing or {{communicating}} with her again. The best plan to adopt will be to let matters take their course--she'll find it all out soon enough.' ...|$|E
