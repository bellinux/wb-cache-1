25|$|It {{follows from}} the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the Airy {{functions}} that both Ai(x) and Bi(x) have an infinity of zeros on the negative real axis.

40|$|In this paper, we {{estimate}} the star-diaphony and the diaphony of the Roth sequence and the Zaremba sequence using their L 2 -discrepancy formula given by Halton and Zaremba (see [3]), and White (see [17]).

25|$|For maximum {{likelihood}} estimations, a model {{may have a}} number of nuisance parameters. For the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>behaviour</b> outlined to hold, the number of nuisance parameters should not increase with the number of observations (the sample size). A well-known example of this case is where observations occur as pairs, where the observations in each pair have a different (unknown) mean but otherwise the observations are independent and normally distributed with a common variance. Here for 2N observations, there are Nnbsp&+nbsp&1 parameters. It is well known that the {{maximum likelihood}} estimate for the variance does not converge to the true value of the variance.|$|E
