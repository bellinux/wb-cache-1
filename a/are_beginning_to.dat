5|$|I {{finally began}} my {{prescribed}} regime of hormones to continue my overdue gender transition in February. It's been such an amazing relief for {{my body and}} brain to finally come into alignment with each other. My stress and anxiety levels have tapered off quite considerably. Overall, things <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> move along nicely.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{relationships}} between pterosaurs is still unsettled. Many studies of pterosaur {{relationships in the}} past have included limited data and were highly contradictory. However, newer studies using larger data sets <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> make things clearer.

5|$|Individual nations <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{note the}} effect of fishing on seamounts, and the European Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a {{detailed}} study {{of the effects of}} fishing on seamount communities in the North Atlantic. Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E

5|$|Modern Shift: In todayâ€™s society, we <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> see a {{shift in}} gender {{representation}} in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{may also}} have been drawing upon various {{references}} to ravens in mythology and folklore. In Norse mythology, Odin possessed two ravens named Huginn and Muninn, representing thought and memory. According to Hebrew folklore, Noah sends a white raven to check conditions while on the ark. It learns that the floodwaters <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> dissipate, but it does not immediately return with the news. It is punished by being turned black and being forced to feed on carrion forever. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, a raven also begins as white before Apollo punishes it by turning it black for delivering a message of a lover's unfaithfulness. The raven's role as a messenger in Poe's poem may draw from those stories.|$|E
5|$|Raynor is {{only ever}} {{depicted}} by his unit portrait {{through the course}} of StarCraft and Brood War. He is later shown in StarCraft II as a physically strong yet casually dressed character, wearing his combat gear over his normal clothes, which are further described in the novels as well-worn and rough in appearance. Raynor has a neatly trimmed moustache and beard, which by the time of StarCraft II <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> grey. His StarCraft II model also reveals the presence of tattoos on both his arms. In addition, a number of pieces of concept art depict Raynor smoking. Unlike other characters, Raynor isn't seen wearing a uniform at any point during the series, with the rare exceptions of when he is encased in marine combat armour. Raynor is often depicted riding a modified vulture hovercycle, which he uses for transport and in open land combat.|$|E

5|$|Red Dead Redemption spans two fictitious United States {{counties}} and a fictitious Mexican state: New Austin, West Elizabeth, and Nuevo Paraiso. New Austin and West Elizabeth are adjacent {{to each other}} and share a southern border with Mexico. Nuevo Paraiso is a Mexican state, separated from U.S. territory by the San Luis river. The game takes place primarily in the year 1911, featuring the final decade of the American Frontier and the cowboy and outlaw archetypes that shaped it. The landscape of the Wild West is beginning to fade and modern technologies like automobiles, machine guns, and oil drilling projects <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> appear.|$|E
5|$|When Picard {{returns to}} the Enterprise, he discovers that {{survivors}} from the Borg sphere have invaded the ship and <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> assimilate both the Enterprise and its crew. Once they have assimilated the ship, the Borg plan {{to use it to}} attack and conquer Earth. Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with corrosive coolant used in the warp core. The assault fails and Data is captured; he meets the Queen of the Borg Collective, who attempts to turn him to her side. A frightened Sloane ambushes the captain, but he soon gains her trust and they escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by using the holodeck to create a weapon.|$|E

25|$|A {{wholesale}} electricity market exists when competing generators {{offer their}} electricity output to retailers. The retailers then re-price the electricity {{and take it}} to market.

Large end-users seeking to cut out unnecessary overhead in their energy costs <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> recognize the advantages inherent in such a purchasing move.
