He was heavily involved in the editorial process leading to the supplements to A, 100 Hymns for Today, More Hymns for Today, Worship Songs Ancient <b>and</b> <b>Modern,</b> and Hymns Ancient <b>and</b> <b>Modern</b> New Standard, which combined the best of the original book with that from the supplements into a single volume, and also the most recent revision, Common Praise. He had particularly argued for the inclusion of the Spiritual, Steal Away, and this was amongst the music used at his funeral.|$|E
