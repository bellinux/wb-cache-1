5|$|Fish {{and chips}} {{is a hot}} dish {{consisting}} of battered fish, commonly <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> or haddock, and chips. It is a common take-away food.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{fish species}} in Massachusetts include bass, carp, catfish, and trout, while {{saltwater}} {{species such as}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod,</b> haddock, and American lobster populate offshore waters. Other marine species include Harbor seals, the endangered North Atlantic right whales, as well as humpback whales, fin whales, minke whales, and Atlantic white-sided dolphins.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-16th century, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> fishing {{developed}} on the Murman Coast in the north. The 1560s saw a {{rapid growth of}} international trade, with the Russian merchants from {{different regions of the}} country arriving to the peninsula to trade with the merchants from Western Europe. In 1585, however, the trade was moved to Archangel, although the settlement of Kola was still permitted to trade locally produced goods.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} {{is named after}} a stream, the stream is 5 km long and the stream and settlement's name etymology is an abundance of cods (calhau) by the lowest part of the stream in the <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>cods</b> are mainly rarely founded today. It {{is the source of}} Ribeira dos Calhaus.|$|R

5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod,</b> Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{from this}} era {{used to cover}} most of the site, and it is {{believed}} the Norse inhabited the site continuously from the ninth to the 14th centuries. Excavations in the 1930s by Alex Curle found the first confirmed Norse longhouse in the British Isles and later digs in the 1950s found evidence of fishing and farming activities. Sheep, cattle, pigs and ponies were kept, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod,</b> saithe and ling were eaten, and whale and seal bones have also been found along with {{the remains of a}} single dog. Chicken bones are rare in the Norse levels.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of the fishery. Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E

50|$|As apex predators, heavy fishing of cod in the 1990s and the {{collapse}} of American and Canadian cod stocks resulted in trophic cascades. Overfishing cod removed a significant predatory pressure on other Atlantic fish and crustacean species. Population-limiting effects on several species including American lobsters, crabs, and shrimp from cod predation have decreased significantly, and the abundance of these species and their increasing range serve as evidence of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod’s</b> role as a major predator rather than prey.|$|R
50|$|For centuries {{there were}} {{plentiful}} cod, other fish and crustaceans, which supplied a thriving fishing industry. The eventual {{collapse of the}} <b>Atlantic</b> northwest <b>cod</b> fishery led to local mass unemployment {{during the second half}} of the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|To {{underscore}} {{that the}} feast represents an exotic bygone world of pre-partition Poland, Mickiewicz {{added to this}} a list of random dishes, ingredients and additives, whose names he found in Compendium ferculorum and which had already been forgotten in his own time: kontuza (soup of boiled and sieved meat), arkas (sweet milk-based jelly), blemas (blancmange), pomuchla (<b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod),</b> figatele (meatballs), cybeta (civet), piżmo (musk), dragant (tragacanth), pinele (pine nuts) and brunele (prunes). This {{is followed by a}} similar enumeration of various kinds of fish, whose names are likewise taken from the inventory at the beginning of Czerniecki's book. A description of a white-apron-clad chef and a reference to Prince Ossoliński's banquet in Rome, both found in Book 11, are also clearly inspired by Czerniecki's characterization of a master chef and his dedication, respectively.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin is marketed {{under the}} trade name ColdZyme for {{prevention}} of common cold by the Enzymatica company, {{the same company}} that also made the underlying study wherein people administering <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin by oral spray {{on a daily basis}} were infected to a lesser degree if inoculated with rhinovirus.|$|E
25|$|Young <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> or haddock {{prepared}} in strips for cooking is called scrod. In the United Kingdom, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> {{is one of}} the most common ingredients in fish and chips, along with haddock and plaice. Cod's soft liver can be tinned (canned) and eaten.

25|$|Cod {{is popular}} {{as a food}} with a mild flavour and a dense, flaky, white flesh. Cod livers are {{processed}} to make cod liver oil, {{an important source of}} vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). Young <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> or haddock prepared in strips for cooking is called scrod. In the United Kingdom, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> {{is one of the most}} common ingredients in fish and chips, along with haddock and plaice.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{significant}} commercial fisheries of many salt-water species, including <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod,</b> haddock and halibut, {{although some of}} these are in decline.|$|E
25|$|The {{northwest}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> {{has been}} regarded as heavily overfished throughout its range, resulting in a crash in the fishery in the United States and Canada during the early 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|Fisheries: At {{least one}} {{researcher}} {{has attempted to}} perform Hubbert linearization (Hubbert curve) on the whaling industry, as well as charting the transparently dependent price of caviar on sturgeon depletion. [...] The <b>Atlantic</b> northwest <b>cod</b> fishery was a renewable resource, but the numbers of fish taken exceeded the fish's rate of recovery. The end of the cod fishery does match the exponential drop of the Hubbert bell curve. Another example is the cod of the North Sea.|$|R
50|$|Before confederation, most Inuit {{lived in}} small {{settlements}} {{of a few}} families in isolated harbours and on islands {{off the coast of}} Labrador. During the 1950s and 1960s many communities across the province was resettled to larger population centres as part of a provincial government-sponsored program. the collapse of the <b>Atlantic</b> northwest <b>cod</b> fishery also had a huge impact on NunatuKavut like it had on the province as a whole and many people left the province to find work elsewhere.|$|R
25|$|Their {{wholesome}} {{flesh is}} whitish and flaky but firmer and tougher and less desirable {{than that of}} the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod.</b> The stock of Greenland cod has been strongly reduced in recent years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua) {{live in the}} colder {{waters and}} deeper sea regions {{throughout}} the North Atlantic. Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) is found in both eastern and western regions of the Pacific.|$|E
25|$|Technologies {{that contributed}} to the {{collapse}} of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Cod</b> include engine power vessels and frozen food compartments aboard ships. Engine power vessels had larger nets, larger engines, and better navigation. The capacity to catch fish became limitless. In addition, sonar technology gave an edge to catching and detecting fish. Sonar was originally developed during World War II to locate enemy submarines, but was later applied to locating schools of fish. These new technologies, as well as bottom-trawlers that destroyed entire ecosystems, contributed to the collapse of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Cod.</b> They were vastly different from old techniques used, such as hand lines and long lines.|$|E
25|$|Seafood Watch {{have placed}} {{on their list}} of seafood that sustainability-minded {{consumers}} should avoid the following demersal fish: sturgeon (imported wild), Chilean seabass, <b>cod</b> (<b>Atlantic,</b> imported Pacific), flounder (Atlantic), halibut (Atlantic), sole (Atlantic), grouper, monkfish, orange roughy, demersal shark, red snapper and tilapia (Asia farmed).|$|R
5000|$|Crosbie's final cabinet {{post in the}} Mulroney {{government}} was Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. On July 1, 1992 Crosbie visited Bay Bulls, Newfoundland and Labrador to celebrate Canada Day. Crosbie was greeted by an angry throng of Newfoundlanders concerned about rumours of a proposed moratorium on the <b>Atlantic</b> northwest <b>cod</b> fishery. He famously yelled out [...] "I didn't take the fish from the God damned waters." [...] He oversaw the decision to close the cod fishery industry in Atlantic Canada due {{to the collapse of}} cod stocks. Crosbie called this decision, which put some 35,000 Newfoundlanders out of work, the hardest political moment of his life.|$|R

25|$|Cod {{fisheries}} are fisheries for cod. Cod is {{the common}} name for fish of the genus Gadus, belonging to the family Gadidae, and this article is confined to the three species that belong to this genus: the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod,</b> the Pacific cod and the Greenland cod.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 {{northwest}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>cod</b> quota is 23,000 tons, representing {{half the}} available stocks, while the northeast Atlantic quota is 473,000 tons.

40|$|Nine {{samples of}} <b>Atlantic</b> poor <b>cod,</b> Trisopterus minutus minutus, {{collected}} from the Bay of Biscay to Trondheimsfjord, Norway, were analysed using three minisatellite DNA loci, amplified using PCR and screened with an automated sequencer. One focus {{was found to be}} polymorphic. F-ST analysis using the polymorphic locus indicated that 2. 2 % of the total genetic diversity detected was due to differences among samples (F-ST = 0. 022; P < 0. 001). The only significant pair-wise heterogeneity was found between the Faroe Bank and each of the other samples. This is consistent with previous analyses of the same samples using 11 polymorphic allozyme loci. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The Liberal Party focused {{its effort}} in regaining support in Atlantic Canada, where {{the party had}} {{suffered}} serious losses in the 1997 election to the New Democratic Party and Progressive Conservative Party due to the Liberal government's imposition of quotas on <b>Atlantic</b> Canadian <b>cod</b> fisheries and the government's cuts to unemployment insurance benefits. Chrétien gained support during the campaign from former New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna and former Chrétien government minister and then the current Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Brian Tobin resigned as Premier and ran as a Liberal Party candidate in his province. During the campaign, Chrétien apologized to Atlantic Canadians for {{the negative impact of}} employment insurance reforms which had caused hardship in Atlantic Canada.|$|R
25|$|Cod-like fishes are {{a number}} of round benthopelagic species {{belonging}} to the order Gadiformes, such as <b>Atlantic</b> and Pacific <b>cod,</b> morid cod, haddock and pollock, including the highly commercial Alaska pollock. Cod-like fishes are often found in large schools over sandy or muddy bottoms. They have a barbel (fleshy filament) on their lower jaw which they use to detect prey buried in the sand or mud. Some migrate to warm water in winter to spawn.|$|R
