5|$|Early in his Provisional Theatre conductorship Smetana {{had made}} a {{powerful}} enemy in František Pivoda, the Director of the Prague School of Singing. Formerly a supporter of Smetana's, Pivoda was aggrieved when the conductor recruited singing talent from abroad rather than from Pivoda's school. In an increasingly bitter public correspondence, Pivoda claimed that Smetana was using his position to further his own career, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> composers.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, {{as there is}} an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, {{and the performance of}} the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E

5|$|The National Assembly for Wales {{announced}} on 6 November 2007 {{that it was}} {{to pay off the}} outstanding loan of £13.5million from HSBC and also increase the annual funding. From April 2008, the National Assembly for Wales have given a grant to the Wales Millennium Centre with £3.5million per annum for 3 years. This would only repay the capital debt and not any ongoing operating loss as the Centre remains profitable. The money used to pay the debt came from unallocated funds from the Assembly's previous budget and it was said by the Minister for Heritage, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, that the new money allocation would not come <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> art projects from other parts of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow {{the rest of the family}} to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Operation Matterhorn was not successful. The nine raids {{conducted}} against Japan via {{bases in}} China succeeded only in destroying Ōmura's aircraft factory. XXBomber Command lost 125 B-29s {{during all of}} its operations from bases in India and China, though only 22 or 29 were destroyed by Japanese forces; {{the majority of the}} losses were due to flying accidents. The attacks had a limited impact on Japanese civilian morale but forced the Japanese military to reinforce the home islands' air defenses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> areas. These results did not justify the large allocation of Allied resources to the operation, however. Moreover, the diversion of some supply aircraft flown between India and China to support XXBomber Command's efforts may have prevented the Fourteenth Air Force from undertaking more effective operations against Japanese positions and shipping. The official history of the USAAF judged that the difficulty of transporting adequate supplies to India and China was the most important factor behind the failure of Operation Matterhorn, though technical problems with the B-29s and the inexperience of their crews also hindered the campaign. The adverse weather conditions common over Japan also limited the effectiveness of the Superfortresses, as crews that managed to reach their target were often unable to bomb accurately due to high winds or cloud cover.|$|E
60|$|As long {{as there}} was any {{appearance}} of success, the spirit of aggrandizement, and consequently the spirit of mutual jealousy, seized upon all the coalesced powers. Some sought an accession <b>of</b> territory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> France, some <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> each other, some <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> third parties; and when the vicissitude of disaster took its turn, they found common distress a treacherous bond of faith and friendship.|$|R

50|$|Some {{monitors}} {{are designed}} exclusively for gamers, featuring higher refresh rates and improved response times <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> a lower resolution. E-sports, or competitive gamers, often favor higher framerates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> reduced color accuracy, preferring TN panels over IPS panels.|$|R
25|$|In December 2006, Kofi Annan, former UN Secretary-General, {{accused the}} Human Rights Council of {{focusing}} {{too heavily on}} the Arab–Israeli conflict, while allowing it to monopolize attention <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> situations where violations are no less grave or even worse.|$|E
25|$|After his arrest, Bourque {{admitted}} {{responsibility to}} the shootings and claimed that he committed them {{in an attempt to}} spark a rebellion against the Canadian government, which he believed was oppressive, corrupt, and serving only the wealthy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> citizens.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the federal}} government's denial that Malaysia is an Islamic state, the {{previous}} administration under Abdullah Badawi gradually furthered the agenda of Islamic supremacy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> religions. The spread of Christianity is a particular sore point for the Muslim majority. The Malaysian government has also persecuted Christian groups who were perceived to be attempting to proselytize to Muslim audiences.|$|E
5000|$|His basic {{case against}} {{protectionism}} {{was that it}} benefited <b>the</b> rich <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor, <b>the</b> industrialists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> farmers and others, as is indicated {{in the title of}} his widely circulated pamphlet, [...] "Foes of the Farmers" [...] (1874).|$|R

50|$|For example, {{we should}} think of two {{countries}} that both make cards and pencils {{and use the}} same amount of time to make one unit of items (see table). Country one can make 4 pencils if they specialize just in pencils <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> one card, but this country can also make ¼ <b>of</b> a card <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> one pencil. <b>The</b> same logic goes for country two: if country two makes only pencils, it will make 2 pencils <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> 1 card.|$|R
25|$|Bracken is a well-adapted {{pioneer plant}} which can {{colonise}} land quickly, {{with the potential}} to extend its area by as much as 1–3% per year. This ability to expand rapidly is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> plants and wildlife, can cause major problems for land users and managers. It colonises ground with an open vegetation structure but is slow to colonise healthy, well managed heather stands.|$|E
25|$|Several other hilltop sites {{came into}} {{existence}} in the broader region {{at the same time}} as the Heuneburg, about 700 BC. Initially, they may have been similar in size and population. Strikingly, most of them were abandoned around 600 BC, i.e. when the Heuneburg settlement was reorganised. It is possible that the Heuneburg had become so powerful as to attract population <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> sites.|$|E
25|$|Class members often receive {{little or}} no benefit from class actions. Examples cited for this include large fees for the attorneys, while leaving class members with coupons or other awards of {{little or no}} value; {{unjustified}} awards are made to certain plaintiffs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> class members; and confusing notices are published that prevent class members {{from being able to}} fully understand and effectively exercise their rights.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Ridley {{suggests}} in [...] (2003) {{the wonderful}} {{diversity of the}} human species is not hard-wired in our genetic code, our environments are critical.

5000|$|For Khomyakov, {{socialism}} and capitalism were equally repugnant offspring of Western decadence. The West failed to solve human spiritual problems, as it stressed competition <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> co-operation. In his own words, [...] "Rome kept unity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> freedom, while Protestants had freedom but lost unity".|$|R

25|$|Criticisms of the {{doctrine}} continue as before. Critics argue judges are making determinations of policy and morality that properly belong with legislators ("legislating from the bench"), they are reading doctrines and principles into the Constitution that are not expressed in or implied by the document, or they are claiming power to expand the liberty of some people <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> people's liberty (such as in Dred Scott v. Sandford).|$|E
25|$|This {{expansion}} did {{not occur}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> sites. East Salamanca was chosen in 1906 for a new roundhouse, enginehouse, and classification yard, thanks to a location convenient to the Buffalo, Middle, and Rochester Divisions. The introduction of the huge Class XX 2-8-8-2 Mallets in 1918 necessitated construction of appropriate shop facilities at East Salamanca. This included electric jacks that could lift the Mallet off the ground.|$|E
25|$|Zhu Yuanzhang, {{also called}} the Hongwu Emperor, was born of a peasant family and was {{sympathetic}} towards peasants. Zhu enacted a series of policies designed to favour agriculture <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> industries. The state gave aid to farmers, providing land and agricultural equipment and revising the taxation system. The state also repaired many long-neglected canals and dikes that had aided agriculture. In addition, the Ming dynasty reinstated the examination system.|$|E

25|$|At random times {{throughout}} the game, though commonly in colonizing new planets, the player is presented with ethical {{choices in the}} form of events where a wide-ranging decision needs to be made. Typically the good choice will cost the player something (either directly or indirectly). Conversely, the evil choice can bring benefits, albeit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> civilizations or the player's own population. A neutral choice is also presented as a compromise. To keep the game's ethics uncontroversial, the choices are made very clear-cut.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the common heather (Calluna vulgaris) only a few taller plants occur here, none {{of which can be}} classed as characteristic species. Amongst them are the wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa) and common juniper (Juniperus communis). Ordinary sand heath is the most widespread of the heathland types. Its proportion has increased in recent decades <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>expense</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> heath habitats. This reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air, the increase in plant litter (Rohhumusauflagen) and the natural ageing of the heathland.|$|E
