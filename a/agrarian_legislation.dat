Agrarian reform is viewed as a necessary condition for agricultural modernization and rural industrialization and the fundamental mooring for global competition. After 12 years of implementing the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) in the Philippines, the Department of Agrarian Reform and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources have redistributed 5. 33 million hectares of land that account for 53. 4 percent of the total farmland. This accomplishment represents 66 percent of the total CARP scope. About 3. 1 million rural poor households, who constitute about forty-two percent of the total agricultural population, have directly benefited from the land redistribution.

40|$|Russian {{agrarian reform}} failure {{is a direct}} result of {{ignoring}} the nature of agrarian institutions inherited from Soviet times and the application of a liberal neo-classical approach in the law making process. The most important problem which presents impediments to agrarian reform is the role of collective farms as the mechanisms of survival for rural communities. Rural dwellers understand very well that if former collective/state farms were substituted by real private enterprises, then they would lose access to resources from collective/state farms for their subsistence household farms, the only source of their survival. They also understand that only a minority of them could create agricultural businesses and the majority would not be employed in the new private agricultural enterprises. That is why they resist any transformation of their collective/state farms. They resist not as individuals, but as a community. So members of the community who wish to create private enterprises are under pressure from the community worried about subsistence household farms. <b>Agrarian</b> reform <b>legislation</b> provided rural dwellers with a very powerful tool for this resistance: privatisation of collective and state farms by members of these farms on an egalitarian basis. The authors of land reform legislation did not worry about that because they were neo-classical economists. They estimated that the most important thing is the right of owners of land and asset shares to buy and sell them. According to them, the inclusion of this right into legislation is sufficient to start a process of creation of viable agricultural enterprises on the land of former collective and state farms, with the subsequent concentration of land and other assets in the hands of the most efficient farmers.

50|$|Also in December, {{the king}} {{appointed}} Carp {{to form a}} Conservative cabinet, bypassing the PCD altogether.

The controversial appointment pushed the PCD into an alliance with the PNL. However, {{it may have been}} intended by Carol as a subtle attack on Carp: although he favored the PC, he felt that Carp was arrogant and incapable of forging a governing coalition. He may also have believed that Carp would lose his own elections. Nevertheless, the new administration reflected an understanding between the various factions of the party. Carp represented the Junimea club, as did his ministers Marghiloman, Constantin C. Arion and Titu Maiorescu. Mihail G. Cantacuzino and Dimitrie S.

5000|$|He {{is first}} {{mentioned}} as a patrikios and quaestor in a Novel Law on the estates of stratiotai, which he composed and which is usually dated to 947 or slightly later. The Novel, following the principles on <b>agrarian</b> <b>legislation</b> established by Romanos I (r. 920-944), demanded the return to the peasants of any land allotted by the state {{which they had been}} forced to sell to the magnates (the dynatoi), with the provision that the price of the land should be repaid in full except by the poorest peasants. If improvements had been made in the meantime, then these too should be recompensed {{in the case of the}} smaller local magnates and small monasteries. Since Theophilos Erotikos is known to have held the post of quaestor in March 947, Theodore's appointment to the post must have been between that date and ca. 949. He remained in this post both under Constantine VII (r. 944-959) as well as under his successor Romanos II (r. 959-963), being mentioned again in a Novel issued in 960 or 961. At this time, he had risen to the rank of magistros. In the 960/1 Novel, [...] "Theodore regulated the procedure for the restitution of peasants' and soldiers' properties illegally acquired by the dynatoi" [...] (A. Kazhdan).|$|E
50|$|Although {{the exact}} {{composition}} of the dynatoi class {{has been the subject}} of considerable scholarly debate (cf. Lemerle), in economic terms, it encompassed the wealthy land-owners as opposed to the middling and small landowners, the penetes (πένητες). The former were usually members of military families, who had been able to use their influence to grab up the extensive lands that had been abandoned, especially in Asia Minor, as the result of the invasions of the 7th and 8th centuries. As the Empire's military position recovered from the 9th century on, these lands became profitable again, and major provincial magnate families began to appear. Among the main examples are the Phokades and the Maleinoi, who almost monopolized the senior administrative and military posts in Asia Minor in the early and middle 10th century. The dynatoi were able to use their political and financial strength to enrich themselves at the expense of the penetes, who had hitherto formed the main pillar of Byzantine society and economy. Consequently, several emperors from Romanos I Lekapenos (reigned 920-944) to Basil II (r. 976-1025) enacted <b>agrarian</b> <b>legislation</b> to combat the activities of the dynatoi, and to prevent their acquisition of the stratiotika ktemata, the military lands allocated to the maintenance of the thematic armies. Basil II in particular showed care to check the dynatoi through the imposition of the allelengyon ("mutual guarantee") tax, making them liable to pay the taxes of their poorer neighbours.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, the {{democratically elected}} Guatemalan {{government}} of Colonel Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán was toppled by U.S.-backed forces led by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas who invaded from Honduras. Assigned by the Eisenhower administration, this military opposition was armed, trained and {{organized by the}} U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (see Operation PBSUCCESS). The directors of United Fruit Company (UFCO) had lobbied to convince the Truman and Eisenhower administrations that Colonel Arbenz intended to align Guatemala with the Soviet Bloc. Besides the disputed issue of Arbenz's allegiance to Communism, UFCO was being threatened by the Arbenz government’s <b>agrarian</b> reform <b>legislation</b> and new Labor Code. UFCO was the largest Guatemalan landowner and employer, and the Arbenz government’s land reform included the expropriation of 40% of UFCO land. U.S. officials had little proof to back their claims of a growing communist threat in Guatemala; however, {{the relationship between the}} Eisenhower administration and UFCO demonstrated the influence of corporate interest on U.S. foreign policy. United States Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was an avowed opponent of Communism, and his law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, had represented United Fruit. His brother Allen Dulles was the director of the CIA and a board member of United Fruit. United Fruit Company is the only company known to have a CIA cryptonym. The brother of the Assistant Secretary of State for InterAmerican Affairs, John Moors Cabot, had once been president of United Fruit. Ed Whitman, who was United Fruit’s principal lobbyist, was married to President Eisenhower's personal secretary, Ann C. Whitman. Many individuals who directly influenced U.S. policy towards Guatemala in the 1950s also had direct ties to UFCO.The overthrow of Arbenz, however, failed to benefit the Company. Its stock market value declined along with its profit margin. The Eisenhower administration proceeded with antitrust action against the company, which forced it to divest in 1958. In 1972, the company sold off the last of their Guatemalan holdings after over a decade of decline.|$|R
40|$|A new {{regulation}} of sec. 131 of the Civil Code (cc.) is deserving particular {{attention in the}} aspect of defining a place and role of indvidual farms in the socio-economic system. It is a new substantiation of a general clause of interpretation and application of civil law provisions formulated in sec. 4 c. c. In its impact the regulation exceeds a role of the interpretational directive. It is the most exhaustive, in our legislation, formulation of a relation of the State to individual farms. Two question's are the subject off detailed discussions i. e. : a) individual farms as a stable and equal in rights element of the socio-economic system, b) guarantees of ownership and complete protection of individual farms. There is an apparent interrelation between the- guarantees of ownership and complete protection afforded by the State to individual farmls, and recognizing these farm's as a stable and equal in rights element of the socio-economic system. Yet, the guarantees of ownership and complete protection do not preempt the State's right of intervention. It seems justified {{to say that the}} ownership of individual farms is guaranteed by the State in certain limits and under certain conditioms. The {{regulation of}} sec 131 c. c, will be expressing current trends in the legislation determined by political considerations, until it is reflected in the Constitution.

40|$|In Mexico, the bdemocratization {{of natural}} assetsQ through an agrarian reform process laid the {{territorial}} {{foundation for the}} establishment of a large community forest sector. The common property regime and agrarian policies established by the Mexican Revolution also created a common form of governance for all of rural Mexico. Concepts from common property theory and social and natural capital are used to analyze this sector and its emergence. It is argued in this paper that agrarian reform laws have been more crucial in creating a large CFE than specific forest <b>legislation.</b> <b>Agrarian</b> reform distributed forest lands to communities and provided a template for community governance that could later serve as an institutional platform for the development of CFEs. Forest laws and programs have been important in different places and periods in developing this potential, by providing subsidies, training, and markets for incipient CFEs. Forest legislation also served, at different periods, to empower communities to take more responsibility for managing their own forests. More recently, major new funds have been directed at subsidizing some aspects of community forest management. The agrarian governance platform has shown flexibility in being able to develop and adapt more entrepreneurial organizational forms. However, there are a wide range of forms that have evolved, ranging from making the enterprise directly dependent on the community governance structures to creating a clear division between community and entrepreneurial governance through Community Councils and Managers, and to dissolution of the single CFE model into subcoalition enterprises.

50|$|The populares {{reached the}} height of their {{ascendancy}} four times. The first one was with the Gracchi brothers, who mobilised the plebeians in support of their land reform and their challenge to senatorial supremacy (133 BC and 122 BC). The second time was with Gaius Marius and his son Gaius Marius the Younger, when the Marians (the supporters of Marius, who were populares) seized power and held Rome from 87 BC to 82 BC. They were defeated in Sulla's Second Civil War. The third time was when Julius Caesar was elected as consul in 59 BC {{with the support of}} Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompey, who formed an informal alliance with Caesar which historians call the First Triumvirate (60-53 BC). Caesar managed to pass an agrarian law for a land reform. This had not been achieved since the agrarian law of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus of 133 BC. All subsequent attempts at <b>agrarian</b> <b>legislation</b> had been thwarted by the opposition and obstructionism of the optimates. Tensions between populares and optimates had increased with the Catiline conspiracy (63 BC) against the consulship of Marcus Tullius Cicero (an optimate) during which Cicero, supported by a final decree (senatus consultum ultimum) of the senate, had some of the conspirators executed without trial. There were demonstrations against these summary executions and this display of arbitrary senatorial power. There were two attempts to counter senatorial dominance which failed, but were popular. The proponents were Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos Iunior, a plebeian tribune, and Caesar, who at the time was a praetor. This enhanced Caesar's popularity and was a help for his creation of the First Triumvirate three years later. The fourth time was with Caesar's Civil War, when Caesar held power from 49 BC to when he was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar relied on the support of the people for his power. After the defeat of Sextus Pompey (the son of Pompey) in the Sicilian Revolt by the Second Triumvirate in 36 BC, popularis ceased to be a relevant political label.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the role the}} Supreme Court of India has tried to carve for itself in the Indian political system. An introductory section describes institutional characteristics of the Court and assesses its troubled attempts to define a proper doctrine of judicial review. Subsequent sections discuss Court rulings concerned with the "right to property" and affirmative discrimination for Untouchables. It is shown that the Court garnered strong support among educated and propertied {{segments of the population}} for its defense of an independent adjudication of issues arising out of <b>agrarian</b> reform <b>legislation.</b> It is also shown that the Court was capable of imposing flexible and effective standards over affirmative discrimination, despite the incapacity of elected leaders to resolve inherent moral and political problems arising out of the identification of beneficiaries. These outcomes bring into question the tendency of existing research to ignore as inconsequential the role played by judicial institutions in rapidly developing societies. Examination of cases concerned with property rights reveals that the Court was faced with genuine affronts to its integrity as an institution. These affronts {{came in the form of}} constitutional amendments which would have enabled elected elites to bypass altogether judicial imposition of constitutional limitations. The Court's reaction to this threat radically departed from the passive role usually assigned by analysts to the courts in the Third World. Giving itself the unique power to reject amendments to the Constitution, the Court projected a militant ideological defense of its proper function. This study carefully {{analyzes the}} political setting which made such a defense possible. It is suggested that the Court achieved a temporary triumph precisely because of the growing incapacity of alternate institutions to process difficult social demands. This explanation for judicial assertiveness is reinforced in the decisions concerned with affirmative discrimination. The rise of Supreme Court dominance over standards governing policies in this area is traced to conceptual and practical difficulties which courts seem uniquely equipped to handle. It is shown that non-judicial institutions were utterly unprepared to resolve inherent conflicts between group and individual rights implicit within caste-based affirmative discrimination. The Court could "resolve" such conflicts by deliberate obfuscation of legal categories identifying beneficiaries. Not faced with the practical implementation of programs under its scrutiny, the Court was required only to devise a legal language which would satisfy the need to legitimize such programs while keeping them limited to the genuinely needy. Detailed examination of these policy conflicts shows that it is possible for judicial institutions to articulate and act upon their own prerogatives in a country undergoing instability and institutional decay. Comparable research for other countries is suggested in the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|This thesis scrutinises the emergence, expansion, {{operations}} {{and effects of}} community-driven development (CDD) programmes, referring to {{the most popular and}} ambitious form of local, participatory development promoted by the World Bank. On the one hand, this thesis draws on the writings of Antonio Gramsci to explore new ways of contextualising and understanding CDD programmes along the lines of hegemony and transformism, as promoting social stability and demobilising counter-hegemonic challenges under conditions of democratisation and decentralisation, in support of economic liberalisation. On the other hand, it scrutinises the performative operations of CDD discourse in producing, legitimising and reproducing interventions, along the lines of "anti-politics," inspired by the Foucauldian approaches of James Ferguson and Tania Li. It also examines the performances elicited by CDD discourse, which "hails" politicians as "progressive" leaders, and "interpellates" the population as an "empowered" and "civil" society. Focusing on "Kalahi," the "flagship" CDD programme of the World Bank in the Philippines, in the "showcase" Province of Bohol, this research also reveals that CDD interventions, ostensibly designed to promote popular participation in local governance, have in practice worked to shore up the position of entrenched local machine politicians, and to undermine local peasant and fishermen's organisations mobilised to demand implementation of <b>agrarian</b> reform and <b>legislation</b> restricting large-scale fishing. Kalahi, the thesis further shows, was from the outset also intertwined with the expansion of agro-business and tourism ventures in the province, and with counterinsurgency operations. In parallel, Kalahi discourse has promoted new discursive styles of leadership, which have enabled local politicians to enhance their political clout and to reinforce their popular support base, whilst practices and institutions have remained essentially unchanged. Overall, this thesis thus shows that CDD programmes have worked to shore up hegemony in rural localities throughout the Philippines, and elsewhere across the developing world...|$|R

The period is comprised by two distinct regime-epochs -the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner between 1954 and 1989 and the introduction of democratisation following the downfall of Stroessner. Constructing a historical synthesis, the thesis focuses on explaining the underlying and internal factors within the development in question. It analyses the regimes' institutional framework -examining the hierarchical relation between institutions within the framework as a whole, as well as it {{examines the}} relations between the regimes and political, economic, and social interest groups as potential actors of institutional change. The theory of Douglass C. North on institutions and institutional change is applied as an analytic tool in understanding the regime building and consolidation on a meta-level. With basis in this institutional analytical framework the thesis examines the development in the regime building and consolidation in perspective of <b>agrarian</b> <b>legislation.</b> Between 1954 and 2008 Paraguay remained a mainly rural society. Agriculture constituted the main engine of national economic growth, at the same time providing a vital source of survival to the mainly rural Paraguayan population. The thesis recognises the regulation of agricultural resources and agricultural activity as a key component in the search for political stability and legitimacy in the two regime-epochs. In the Stroessner period the <b>agrarian</b> <b>legislation</b> is interpreted from its political value as an instrument of control and as an expression of the character of the regime. Under democratisation the thesis examines the <b>agrarian</b> <b>legislation</b> as having a function in, as well as constituting an expression of, the mechanisms at work in the emerging democracy...|$|E
40|$|Since 1986, FAO has {{assisted}} the Government of the Philippines in designing its agrarian reform programme. In August and September 1986, FAO led a United Nations Inter-Agency Mission on Agrarian Reform, which {{was followed by}} a Policy Workshop on Agrarian Reform in December 1986 and February 1987. The Government subsequently requested assistance to prepare a study on the financial, administrative and managerial implications of the new agrarian reform law and to organize a Congress for People's Agrarian Reform: project TCP/PHI/ 6760 had these objectivesThe project provided the services of an expert national consultant, the Director of the Institute of Agrarian Studies at the University of the Philippines in Los Ba¤os, who undertook a study that reviewed the process of agrarian reform and made policy proposals, in close cooperation with the National Economic Development Authority. One of the major outcomes of the project was the preparation of a policy document, which included detailed proposals for the institutional arrangements needed for a Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Programme (CARP), and suggested a strategy for its implementation. It identified the scope of the reform and presented recommendations on land survey and titling, land evaluation, credit, extension services and infrastructural support, and on compensation payments and incentives for land ownersA further important outcome was the organization of a Congress for a People's Agrarian Reform (CPAR) that was held between 29 and 31 May 1987. It enabled representatives of farmers' organizations to express their views on proposed <b>agrarian</b> reform <b>legislation</b> for the first time. This was followed by the creation of an informal federation, called the CPAR Group, that cooperates with the Government in some aspects of implementing the agrarian reform programmeThe issues that remained to be resolved are many and complex. It was therefore recommended that the Government benefit from the experience other countries have had in land reform, and it was proposed that the new project, GCP/PHI/ 040 /ITA, `Technical Support to the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Programme', which is about to begin, provide this advice through its specialists in agrarian reform, agricultural training, and in land resources managementA comprehensive training programme was also recommended. It should include courses for the staff of the Department of Agrarian Reform on the objectives of CARP and the procedures by which it will be implemented; the training of technicians from the Department of Agriculture in appropriate production techniques for the beneficiaries of land reform; and the training of farmer leaders to ensure their active participation in the reform. A number of studies of immediate relevance to the implementation of CARP are needed: these include an assessment of training needs; the development of a strategic plan for CARP, including the timing and costing of the programme elements; a socio-economic benchmark survey, and the study of the necessary institutional arrangementsThe success of the agrarian reform programme would depend upon cooperation between the Government and the farmers who are its beneficiaries. This process has been successfully launched within the framework of project TCP/PHI/ 6760 and the follow-up project, TCP/PHI/ 8851, which was implemented between 15 September 1987 and 15 September 1988; it was recommended that the Government continue to give it high priorit...|$|R
40|$|This paper follows {{one local}} agrarian {{communities}} and tequila industrialist Eladio Sauza through the bureaucratic avenues of Mexico’s post-revolutionary land reform. Over 14, 115 hectares of land were redistributed as ejidos—landholding communities endowed by the agrarian reform—in the municipality of Tequila between 1927 - 41. The uphill battle agrarian reformists waged against Sauza {{to assert their}} right to land {{is not simply a}} story of victimization or economic setbacks. It is also an inquiry into the lives of individuals who through the state sponsored ejido system became empowered and integrated into the nation’s revolutionary project. Before the land reform tequila companies produced the agaves needed for the process of distillation; shortly thereafter they became dependent on ejidatarios for their supply of agave. Using the correspondences, memos, and letters of Sauza, as well of those of the agraristas of El Medineño, I show that their stories are not only indicative of the change that the industry faced; their stories are also part of a larger national narrative on {{the development and implementation of}} <b>agrarian</b> and labor <b>legislation</b> in the Mexican countryside. What was ordained into law by decrees, more than often unfolded on the ground in different ways than the law intended. Although the legislative frameworks for land reform were provided from above, they remained mute as to how to implement them and were highly susceptible to the pressure from landowners and local communities. Very little is known about the community leaders and those early participants in local agrarian reform movements that did not achieve national notoriety. We may never know the full extent of the backgrounds of the agraristas, but what the sources and this paper do convey are that among them were natural-born leaders adept in the politics of reform who sought justice in the name of the Revolution. Overwhelmed by revolution in land ownership that threatened to cripple his tequila business, Eladio Sauza fought for his definition of justice while trying to dictate the terms of his surrender to the revolutionary process. This story explores and historicizes the origins of conflict and reform in post-revolutionary Mexico—assessing its impact on the ground, to its people, and an industry...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a strong}} tradition, {{particularly}} in the Greek sources, that Cato the Younger formed {{the focus of the}} opposition to the consul Caesar in 59, even that he placed his life at risk in the forum in an effort to prevent Caesar's <b>agrarian</b> <b>legislation</b> from being passed by the comitia tributa. This view is found in Plutarch's Life of Cato and, to a lesser extent, in his other Republican Lives, and it is repeated by both Appian in the Civil Wars and Dio Cassius. In the absence of Cicero's evidence for forensic resistance mounted by Cato in 59, only the 'Greek' tradition informs us of any overt opposition to Caesar's <b>agrarian</b> <b>legislation</b> in 59. We need to examine its trustworthiness by a study, first of Plutarch, since he gives the earliest and most circumstantial account, and secondly, of Appian and Dio, who appear to follow Plutarch. This study will then allow us to make some observations about both the level of resistance offered to Caesar's laws and the means used by Caesar to try and obtain compliance...|$|E
