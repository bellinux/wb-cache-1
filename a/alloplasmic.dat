40|$|Abstract Background <b>Alloplasmic</b> lines {{provide a}} unique tool to study nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. Three <b>alloplasmic</b> lines, with nuclear genomes from Triticum aestivum and {{harboring}} cytoplasm from Aegilops uniaristata, Aegilops tauschii and Hordeum chilense, were investigated by transcript and metabolite profiling {{to identify the}} effects of cytoplasmic substitution on nuclear-cytoplasmic signaling mechanisms. Results In combining the wheat nuclear genome with a cytoplasm of H. chilense, 540 genes were significantly altered, whereas 11 and 28 genes were significantly changed in the <b>alloplasmic</b> lines carrying the cytoplasm of Ae. uniaristata or Ae. tauschii, respectively. We identified the RNA maturation-related process {{as one of the}} most sensitive to a perturbation of the nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction. Several key components of the ROS chloroplast retrograde signaling, together with the up-regulation of the ROS scavenging system, showed that changes in the chloroplast genome have a direct impact on nuclear-cytoplasmic cross-talk. Remarkably, the H. chilense <b>alloplasmic</b> line down-regulated some genes involved in the determination of cytoplasmic male sterility without expressing the male sterility phenotype. Metabolic profiling showed a comparable response of the central metabolism of the <b>alloplasmic</b> and euplasmic lines to light, while exposing larger metabolite alterations in the H. chilense <b>alloplasmic</b> line as compared with the Aegilops lines, in agreement with the transcriptomic data. Several stress-related metabolites, remarkably raffinose, were altered in content in the H. chilense <b>alloplasmic</b> line when exposed to high light, while amino acids, as well as organic acids were significantly decreased. Alterations in the levels of transcript, related to raffinose, and the photorespiration-related metabolisms were associated with changes in the level of related metabolites. Conclusion The replacement of a wheat cytoplasm with the cytoplasm of a related species affects the nuclear-cytoplasmic cross-talk leading to transcript and metabolite alterations. The extent of these modifications was limited in the <b>alloplasmic</b> lines with Aegilops cytoplasm, and more evident in the <b>alloplasmic</b> line with H. chilense cytoplasm. We consider that, this finding might be linked to the phylogenetic distance of the genomes. The authors thank Prof. S. S.

40|$|Background: Wheat is an {{excellent}} plant species for nuclear mitochondrial interaction studies due to availability of large collection of <b>alloplasmic</b> lines. These lines exhibit different vegetative and physiological properties than their parents. To investigate the level of sequence changes introduced into the mitochondrial genome under the <b>alloplasmic</b> condition, three mitochondrial genomes of the Triticum-Aegilops species were sequenced: 1) durum <b>alloplasmic</b> line with the Ae. longissima cytoplasm that carries the T. turgidum nucleus designated as (lo) durum, 2) the cytoplasmic donor line, and 3) the nuclear donor line. Results: The mitochondrial genome of the T. turgidum was 451, 678 bp in length with high structural and nucleotide identity to the previously characterized T. aestivum genome. The assembled mitochondrial genome of the (lo) durum and the Ae. longissima were 431, 959 bp and 399, 005 bp in size, respectively. The high sequence coverage for all three genomes allowed analysis of heteroplasmy within each genome. The mitochondrial genome structure in the <b>alloplasmic</b> line was genetically distant from both maternal and paternal genomes. The <b>alloplasmic</b> durum and the Ae. longissima carry the same versions of atp 6, nad 6, rps 19 -p, cob and cox 2 exon 2 which {{are different from the}} T. turgidum parent. Evidence of paternal leakage was also observed by analyzing nad 9 and orf 359 among all three lines. Nucleotide search identified a number of open reading frames, of which 27 wer...|$|E

The sixteen iso-genomic <b>alloplasmics</b> were compared for expression of male sterility and for some traits related to field performance. In cmsN. bigelovii, N. debneyi, N. exigua, N. megalosiphonor N. suaveolens stamens were absent, in cmsN. tabacum, N. glauca, N. goodspeedii or N. undulata stamens were absent or rudimentary, in cmsN. eastii, N. glutinosa or N. plumbaginifoliastamen tissue became petaloid, in those from N. knightiana and N. raimondiithey were morphologically normal. Female organ morphology was changed in cmsN. goodspeedii, N. occidentalis, N. exigua, N. debneyior N. bigelovii, seed set was reduced only in cmsN. occidentalis. Plant height in most <b>alloplasmics</b> {{was similar to that}} of the fertile variety but was strongly depressed by the cytoplasms of N. glutinosa, N. eastiiand N. plumbaginifolia. Leaf area was positively affected by N. amplexicaulis, N. bigeloviiand N. undulatacytoplasms, unaffected by N. suaveolens, N. tabacumand N. glaucacytoplasms and negatively affected by the remaining cytoplasms mostly because of the narrowing of the leaf blade. Cured leaf yields from cmsN. bigelovii were higher than those of Wislica. Leaf yields from cmsN. amplexicaulis, N. suaveolens, N. glauca or N. tabacum were not affected by the alien cytoplasm, whereas those from the remaining <b>alloplasmics</b> were depressed to different extents.

Four <b>alloplasmic</b> tomato lines, containing the nuclear genome of tomato and the plastome of L. hirsutum LA 1777 Humb. & Bonpl., an accession collected at high-altitude in Peru, were reciprocally crossed with 11 tomato entries with a high inbreeding level and a wide genetic variation, resulting in a set of 44 reciprocal crosses. Irrespective of growth temperature, <b>alloplasmic</b> families with alien chloroplasts of L. hirsutum (h) were on average characterized by a high shoot biomass, a large leaf area, and a low specific leaf area in comparison with their euplasmic counterparts. These results do not directly point to an advantageous effect of h-chloroplasts on biomass accumulation at low temperature but rather towards a small general beneficial effect on growth and/or distribution of assimilates. Significant chloroplast-related differences in photosynthetic performance, however, were not detected at both temperature regimes, indicating that h-chloroplasts can properly function in a variable nuclear background of L. esculentum. It is concluded that chloroplast substitution is not an effective method for breeding tomato plants with improved low-temperature toleranc...|$|E

The high crossability {{of this species}} {{with other members of}} the Triticeae tribe {{promoted}} the devel-opment of the new species £ Tritordeum Ascherson et Graebner. Hexaploid tritordeum was developed from the hybrid derived from the cross between H. chilense (used as female parent) and durum wheat. The interest of H. chilense is based on the presence of traits poten-tially useful for wheat breeding, including high endosperm carotenoid content, septoria tritici blotch resistance and abiotic stress tolerance. Besides, the variability at cytoplasm level is also important in this species. The development of common wheat–H. chilense <b>alloplasmic</b> lines (nucleus from wheat and cytoplasm from H. chilense) results in fertile or male sterile geno-types, depending on the accession donating the cytoplasm.

40|$|In {{somatic cell}} hybrids and cybrids of Nicotiana, {{research}} has indicated {{the presence of a}} hierarchy of organelle dominance between various species. This putative hierarchy was based on results using biochemical selection of hybrids. I tested the possibility that biochemical selection pressure biased the results. Protoplasts of various <b>alloplasmic</b> substitutions of Nicotiana were fused together; heterologous fusion events were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Leaves of plants regenerated from these fusion events were analyzed to identify the types of chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA present. ^ The results reported here indicate that the hierarchy of organelle dominance appears to be a real phenomenon, even when selective pressures are removed. Chloroplasts from Nicotiana undulata strongly outcompeted chloroplasts from N. tabacum. Chloroplasts from N. suaveolens and N. glauca equally competed with chloroplasts from N. tabacum. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed that mitochondria segregated independently from chloroplasts in the N. undulata - N. tabacum and N. glauca - N. tabacum fusions, but not in the N. suaveolens - N. tabacum fusions. After heterologous fusion events, mitochondrial DNA recombination was detected in some plants, but chloroplast DNA recombination was not observed. ^ In addition, male fertility was restored in a plant regenerated from a fusion between protoplasts of two cytoplasmic male sterile, <b>alloplasmic</b> substitutions. These <b>alloplasmic</b> substitutions contained the cytoplasm of N. suaveolens or N. plumbaginifolia, each in a N. tabacum nuclear background. Thus both nuclei were identical but each of the two protoplast types had the cytoplasm of either N. suaveolens or N. plumbaginifolia. The fertile plant contained N. plumbaginifolia chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA restriction patterns, and displayed a floral morphology intermediate between the N. plumbaginifolia alloplasmically substituted parent and fertile N. tabacum. The flowers of the fertile plant were only able to set seed when manually pollinated. ...|$|E

The predominant system for pollination control of most field crops today is {{cytoplasmic male sterility}} (CMS).

A common way to produce CMS plants is to combine the nuclear genome from one species with the mitochondria from another; plants of such origin are described as <b>alloplasmic</b> CMS.

40|$|Floral organ {{formation}} {{has been the}} subject of intensive study for over 20 years, particularly in the model dicot species Arabidopsis thaliana. These studies have led to the establishment of a general model for the development of floral organs in higher plants, the so-called ABCDE model, in which floral whorl-specific combinations of class A, B, C, D, or E genes specify floral organ identity. In Arabidopsis, class A, B, C, D, E genes encode MADS-box transcription factors except for the class A gene APETALA 2. Mutation of these genes induces floral organ homeosis. In this review, I focus on the roles of these homeotic genes in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), particularly with respect to the ABCDE model. Pistillody, the homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures, occurs in cytoplasmic substitution (<b>alloplasmic)</b> wheat lines that have the cytoplasm of the related wild species Aegilops crassa. This phenomenon is a valuable tool for analysis of the wheat ABCDE model. Using an <b>alloplasmic</b> line, the wheat ortholog of DROOPING LEAF (TaDL), a member of the YABBY gene family, has been shown to regulate pistil specification. Here, I describe the current understanding of the ABCDE model for floral {{organ formation}} in wheat...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Alloplasmic</b> wheat {{lines with}} Aegilops crassa {{cytoplasm}} often show homeotic conversion of stamens into pistils under long-day conditions. In the pistillody-exhibiting florets, an ectopic ovule is formed within the transformed stamens, and female sterility is also observed because of abnormal integument development. Results In this study, four wheat Bell 1 -like homeobox (BLH) genes were isolated and named WBLH 1 to WBLH 4. WBLH 1 / WBLH 3 / WBLH 4 expression {{was observed in}} the basal boundary region of the ovary in both normal pistils and transformed stamens. WBLH 2 was also strongly expressed in integuments not only of normal ovules in pistils {{but also of the}} ectopic ovules in transformed stamens, and the WBLH 2 expression pattern in the sterile pistils seemed to be identical to that in normal ovules of fertile pistils. In addition, WBLH 1 and WBLH 3 showed interactions with the three wheat KNOX proteins through the BEL domain. WBLH 2, however, formed a complex with wheat KNOTTED 1 and ROUGH SHEATH 1 orthologs through SKY and BEL domains, but not with a wheat LIGULELESS 4 ortholog. Conclusions Expression of the four WBLH genes is evident in reproductive organs including pistils and transformed stamens and is independent from female sterility in <b>alloplasmic</b> wheat lines with Ae. crassa cytoplasm. KNOX-BLH interaction was conserved among various plant species, indicating the significance of KNOX-BLH complex formation in wheat developmental processes.

A common way to produce CMS plants is to combine the nuclear genome from one species with the mitochondria from another; plants of such origin are described as <b>alloplasmic</b> CMS. This thesis describes the production and molecular characterization of a novel <b>alloplasmic</b> CMS system produced from rapeseed (Brassica napus) (+) Arabidopsis thaliana somatic hybrids. A population of 170 B. napus (+) A. thaliana somatic hybrid lines was backcrossed to B. napus and 22 lines with male sterility and/or aberrant flower morphology were found. Nine of these were analysed for RFLP and found to contain nuclear and plastid DNA from B. napus, whilst the mitochondrial genomes were frequently recombined containing both B. napus and A. thaliana DNA. Besides the male-sterile trait, the majority of the lines displayed homeotic conversions of anthers to carpeloid organs. Vegetative growth was reduced to some extent in some of the lines. One CMS line segregated both fertile and sterile plants. Fertility co-segregated with molecular markers from A. thaliana chr III. By a dihaploidisation strategy we produced plants with a disomic addition of A. thaliana chr III, which had a stable inheritance of the fertile phenotype. Global mitochondrial mRNA expression was analysed in the fertility-restored line, the corresponding CMS line, B. napus and A. thaliana. Run-on experiments showed that transcriptional activities were highly variable between B. napus and A. thaliana and that in the CMS line transcriptional activity was reduced for several ribosomal protein genes and increased for orf 139. Steady-state levels were more homogenous in comparison to transcriptional activities showing that RNA turnover is an important regulatory mechanism. Increased transcript abundance of several genes was observed in the CMS line, often correlated with presence of longer transcripts. Transcripts of three A. thaliana loci, orf 139, orf 240 a and orf 294 accumulated in the CMS line, but with reduced levels in the restored line. The orf 139 and orf 294 transcripts accumulated differentially in a tissue and genotype-specific manner, while orf 240 a was constitutively expressed throughout the plant. Both orf 240 a and orf 294 transcripts can be polyadenylated, thus providing an explanation for their post-transcriptional regulation. Segregation analysis of sterile and fertile <b>alloplasmic</b> lines indicates that orf 139 and orf 240 a are less likely candidates to be responsible for the male-sterile phenotype, whereas the orf 294 can be CMS-associated. However, it is likely that more than one locus in the A. thaliana mt-DNA could encode CMS in the nuclear background of B. napus...|$|E

Dynamic changes in mitochondrial number, shape, size, and cellular location takes place during the cell cycle possibly impacting the process itself and leading to distribution of this organelle into daughter cells. The genes that underlie these changes are beginning to be identified in model plants such as Arabidopsis. In animals disruption of the drp 1 gene, a homolog to the plant drp 3 A and drp 3 B, delays mitochondrial division. This mutation results in increased aneuploidy due to chromosome mis-segregation.

To avoid the confounding effects of segregating nuclear alleles, an inbred maize line was utilized. Cytolines with Z. mays teosinte cytoplasms were generally indistinguishable from maize. However, cytolines with cytoplasm from the more distantly related Z. luxurians, Z. diploperennis, or Z. perennis exhibited a plethora of differences in growth, development, morphology, and function. Significant differences were observed for 56 of the 58 characters studied. Each cytoline was significantly different from the inbred line for most characters. For a given character, variation was often greater among cytolines having cytoplasms from the same species than among those from different species. The characters differed largely independently of each other. These results suggest that the cytoplasm contributes significantly to a large proportion of plant traits and that many of the organelle genes are phenotypically important...|$|E
40|$|Plastids in Nicotiana tabacum are {{normally}} {{transmitted to the}} progeny by the maternal parent only. However, low-frequency paternal plastid transmission {{has been reported in}} crosses involving parents with an alien cytoplasm. Our objective was to determine whether paternal plastids are transmitted in crosses between parents with the normal cytoplasm. The transplastomic father lines carried a spectinomycin resistance (aadA) transgene incorporated in the plastid genome. The mother lines in the crosses were either (i) <b>alloplasmic,</b> with the Nicotiana undulata cytoplasm that confers cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS 92) or (ii) normal, with the fertile N. tabacum cytoplasm. Here we report that plastids from the transplastomic father were transmitted in both cases at low (10 − 4 - 10 − 5) frequencies; therefore, rare paternal pollen transmission is not simply due to breakdown of normal controls caused by the alien cytoplasm. Furthermore, we have found that the entire plastid genome was transmitted by pollen rather than small plastid genome (ptDNA) fragments. Interestingly, the plants, which inherited paternal plastids, also carried paternal mitochondrial DNA, indicating cotransmission of plastids and mitochondria in the same pollen. The detection of rare paternal plastid transmission described here was facilitated by direct selection for the transplastomic spectinomycin resistance marker in tissue culture; therefore, recovery of rare paternal plastids in the germline is less likely to occur under field conditions...|$|E
40|$|Cultivated in {{temporary}} area grasses have evolved from common ancestor about 1. 5 {{million years ago}} and maintain many similarities especially in cytoplasm genome. Chloroplast genome of those grasses consist of some 135, 000 bp and approximately 100 functional genes. Genetic similarity of chloroplast genomes was evaluated by DNA hybridization with conservative probes and by sequencing of hot spots in intergeneric regions. Those methods are less useful for intraspecies studies, and PCR-fingerprinting was offered for this particular case. Information content of PCR markers may be increased by application of primers complementary to (a) DNA repeats abundant in genome or (b) DNA fragments participating in modification events. Distribution of small (7 - 10 bp) inverted DNA repeats located in 100 - 4000 bp {{from each other and}} thus capable to serve as PCR primers was studied in complete cereal genomes. The repeats flanking from 10 to 30 PCR-able fragments of the chloroplast DNA were chosen as AP-PCR primers and real PCR fingerprints obtained for wheat and 15 <b>alloplasmic</b> barley lines were compared to expected ones. Comparing to PCR analysis with random primers (RAPD), the selected primers produced bands of significantly (3 - 4 folds) higher PIC (Polymorphism Information Content), and GD (Genetic Diversity). Thus, PCR-fingerprinting with primers homologous for selected from sequence inverted repeats proved to be useful for genome variability studies...|$|E

The present study was undertaken to screen the male sterile and restorer lines among the crosses of five male sterile lines andthirty inbreds of pearl millet. Five isogenic <b>alloplasmic</b> male sterile lines (ICMA 94111 A, 81 A, ICMA 88004 A, PT 5054 Aand 732 A) were crossed with thirty inbreds in line x tester design, so as to obtain 150 F 1 hybrids. F 1 ’s were categorized asrestorers (> 80 % pollen fertility), partial restorers (20 to 79 % pollen fertility), partial maintainers (10 - 19 % pollen fertility) and maintainers (< 10 % pollen fertility). Among the 150 hybrids studied, 43 complete sterile and 24 complete fertile hybridswere identified. The two inbreds namely PT 5259 and PT 5773 recorded sterility with four male sterile lines out of five malesterile lines used.

Zamojska 4. The collection includes also a cytoplasmic male sterile (cms) analogue of cv. Zamojska 4 with mutated cytoplasm of N. tabacum. Some of the alloplasmics were originally obtained in this laboratory (N. amplexicaulis, N. eastii, N. exigua, N. glauca, N. knightiana, N. raimondii). The remaining ones were acquired from other laboratories and backcrossed into Zamojska 4. All alien cytoplasms except that of N. knightiana produced full male sterility in Zamojska 4. The extent of male organ modifications varied from {{complete absence of}} stamens (N. suaveolens, N. tabacum) to petaloid and stigmatoid structures (most common effect) to malformed stamens (N. amplexicaulis, N. glauca) to apparently normal stamens (N. raimondii, N. knightiana). The majority of the alloplasmics showed response to tentoxin that was compatible with the cytoplasm donor.

40|$|To {{investigate}} cytoplasmic {{effects on}} homeotic floral morphology, Nicotiana tabacum and N. suaveolens protoplasts were fused and cybrids obtained to {{contrast with the}} sexual <b>alloplasmic</b> line Nta(sua) S. Nta(sua) S contains the nucleus of N. tabacum and cytoplasm of N. suaveolens while cybrids derive from fused cells where the cytoplasms can interact. The three mate-sterile somatic cybrid plants analyzed contained mitochondria with N. tobacum and N. suaveolens mtDNA sequences, but not at[the N. tabacum or all the N. suaveolens mtDNA sequences were present. The flowers were N. tabacum-like but with a split corolla (not observed in Nta(sua) S) and the whorl of stamens replaced by a whorl of carpet-like structures. Based on scanning electron microscopy the carpelloid stamens had a characteristic N. tabacum stigma, a style of variable length and a pseudo-ovary with ovule-like structures. The Southern blot data were consistent with mtDNA recombination. These genomic changes were maternally inherited. Chloroplasts were either of the N. tabacum or N. suaveolens type. AFLP analysis showed transfer of variable amounts of N. suaveolens nuclear DNA. However, it {{is the presence of}} the N. suaveolens sequences and/or absence of N. tabacum sequences in the mitochondria that correlates with the homeotic floral morphology. These cybrids wilt facilitate the analysis of the role of, mitochondrial DNA sequences in floral organ identity; which has received limited attention in genetic flowering models based primarily on Arabidopsis research.

40|$|Using the nucleus-{{cytoplasm}} hybrids {{with the}} cytoplasm of Aegilops uniaristata, male sterility-fertility restoration relationship was investigated. This cytoplasm caused complete or high selfed seed sterility in three common wheats, Slm, Ar and Splt, while nine common wheats, Tve, P 168, CS, N 26, JF, Sk, S 615, Sphr and Cmp restored fertility to this cytoplasm. In {{order to determine}} chromosome arm carrying the fertility-restoring gene, telosomic analysis has been carried out. Ditelosomic 1 BL of CS became completely sterile by the cytoplasm of Ae. uniaristata, while ditelosomic 1 BS became male fertile. Thus, {{the location of the}} fertility-restoring gene that was designated as Rfun 1 has been determined to be on the short arm having a nucleolar organizer of chromosome 1 B of CS. In the <b>alloplasmic</b> heterozygote, 1 B/ 1 B- 1 R or 1 B/ 1 BL (hemizygous as to the Rfun 1 gene), the normal 1 B chromosome was preferentially transmitted to diploid offspring through the female gamete. The relationships between the Rfun 1 gene, a nucleolus-organizing region and preferential transmission of chromosome 1 B were discussed.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyAllan K. FritzHeat {{stress is}} one of the major {{environmental}} constraints for wheat production worldwide. High temperature during grain filling in wheat leads to a significant reduction in yield. In this research, three different projects were completed. The first project was to study cytoplasmic effects on heat tolerance in wheat, where ten different <b>alloplasmic</b> lines of wheat were backcrossed with four different wheat varieties: „Karl 92 ‟, „Ventnor‟, „U 1275 ‟ and „Jagger‟. The nuclear genome of the <b>alloplasmic</b> lines was substituted by backcrossing six times using the recurrent parents as males. During the fifth and/or fourth backcross, reciprocal crosses were made to develop NILs (Near Isogenic Lines) for cytoplasm. Sixty-eight NILs and their parents were evaluated in growth chambers for post-anthesis heat tolerance. Plants were grown in the greenhouse and placed under heat stress for 14 days starting at 10 days after anthesis. Growth chambers were maintained at 35 °/ 30 °C for heat stress and the greenhouse was maintained at 20 °/ 15 °C as the optimum temperature. Effects of high temperature on chlorophyll content and Fv/Fm (a chlorophyll fluorescence measuring parameter) were found to be significant. Cytoplasms 1, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10 provided greater tolerance in one or more nuclear backgrounds. These results indicated that cytoplasmic effects can contribute to heat tolerance of wheat. The second project focused on identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for thylakoid membrane damage (TMD), SPAD chlorophyll content (SCC) and plasma membrane damage (PMD), as these traits are found to be associated with resistance to heat stress and contributes to relatively stable yield under high temperature. A RIL (Recombinant Inbred line) population of a cross between winter wheat cultivars „Ventnor‟ and „Karl 92 ‟ was evaluated using two different temperature regimes (20 °/ 15 °C, 36 °/ 30 °C) imposed at ten days after anthesis. The aforementioned traits were evaluated and associated with various molecular markers (SSR, AFLP and SNP). The putative QTL associated are localized on chromosomes 6 A, 7 A, 1 B, 2 B and 1 D and have the potential to be used in marker assisted selection for improving heat tolerance in wheat. In the third project, a transgenic approach to increase grain fill during high temperatures was investigated. Grain fill is reduced at temperatures above 25 °C in wheat partly due to the inactivity of soluble starch synthase. We isolated a soluble starch synthase gene from rice that has the potential to overcome this deficiency during high temperatures and placed it behind both a constitutive promoter and an endosperm-specific promoter. Transgene expression and the effects of the transgene expression on grain yield-related traits for four generations (T 0, T 1, T 2 and T 3) were monitored. The results demonstrated that even after four generations, the transgene was still expressed at high levels, and transgenic plants produced grains of greater seed weight than Bobwhite control plants under the same environmental conditions. Thousand-seed weight under high temperatures increased 21 - 34 % in T 2 and T 3 transgenic plants when compared to the non-transgenic control plants. In addition, the duration of photosynthesis was longer in transgenic wheat than in non-transgenic controls. Our study demonstrated that expression of rice soluble starch synthase gene in wheat can improve wheat yield under heat stress conditions...|$|E
