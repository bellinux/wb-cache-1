5000|$|Analytical challenges: The hp-FEM is more {{difficult}} to understand from the <b>analytical</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> than standard FEM. This concerns numerous techniques, such as the discrete maximum principles (DMP) for elliptic problems. These results state that, usually with some limiting assumptions on the mesh, the piecewise-polynomial FEM approximation obeys analogous maximum principles as the underlying elliptic PDE. Such results are very important since they guarantee that the approximation remain physically admissible, leaving no possibility of computing a negative density, negative concentration, or negative absolute temperature. The DMP are quite well understood for lowest-order FEM but completely unknown for the hp-FEM in two or more dimensions. First DMP in one spatial dimension were formulated recently.|$|E

Still other authors who have differing approaches to embouchure development include Louis Maggio, Jeff Smiley, Jerome Callet. and Clint McLaughlin.|$|E

It also specifies five distinct phases of the production activity chain where consumers can become involved in co-production. The model offers researchers an analytical framework conducive for more advanced studies of the phenomenon from both descriptive and <b>analytical</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Managers {{can use it to}} segment consumers according to their tendencies to engage in co-production and suggests bases for developing corresponding offers of co-production possibilities which focus on diverse consumer benefits...|$|R

Moreover, in the latter cases the compatibility condition between the initial data v_ 0 and the flux f(t) in t= 0, that is f(0), is studied without constrain for the behavior of the initial data. These aspects make the results of special interest as in the case of time periodic solutions or as in the case of the steady solutions as limit of unsteady solutions...|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} {{vegetation}} has beneficial effects {{for the formation}} of tufa, excessive concentrations of organic substances within the water have adverse effects on these formation processes. Excessive plant cover has adverse effects on mineral sedimentation. Down the Korana River from the Korana bridge, for example, travertine creation ends quite quickly, in spite of the supersaturation with calcium bicarbonate, because of the increased concentration of organic matter in the water. The park authorities have therefore begun systematic removal of excessive vegetation along the barriers. Water purity is the decisive factor for tufa formation. The water at the influx to the Plitvice Lakes is defined as pure from an <b>analytical</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> The Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) value of the water barely exceeds 2.5 mg/L at the influx to the Upper Lakes (Matica). At the Lower Lakes higher concentrations are measured (5.15 mg/L). At the springs of other Croatian rivers in the karst region similar concentrations have been recorded.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} masonry infills {{is an issue}} that has {{attracted}} the attention of several researchers in the past, both from the experimental and <b>analytical</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Nevertheless, the results are often questionable due to the large variability of masonry properties, the limited number of tests carried out and the large number of influencing factors. This paper addresses this limitation by using numerical analysis as a simulation of an experimental laboratory, and by performing a sensitivity analysis about the influence of the different influence factors. The modelling approach has been validated using the experimental results of two masonry walls subjected to horizontal loading. The parametric study subsequently carried out allowed to propose a strut-and-tie model that provides a novel simplified expression for the failure of infill walls belonging to frames subjected to horizontal loading. The proposed model is compared with other models available in the literature exhibiting superior performance and constituting a simple and versatile tool for design. CAPES. UFV...|$|R
40|$|Dredged {{contaminated}} sediments {{are considered}} as waste and landfilled. Reuse in public works is considered. The environmental impact must be assessed, {{and in particular}} the emission of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in percolating water. The kinetics of desorption of POPs from soil or sediment particles is important both from environmental and <b>analytical</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Desorption rates <b>of</b> POPs are important in predicting the transport of these compounds between different environmental media, their bioavailability, and the effect of remediation processes at contaminated sites. It has been shown that a large part of POPs (generally over 50 %) are strongly adsorbed to the condensed organic matter (char or soot - also called black carbon) with very slow desorption kinetics. However, today the risk assessment and the regulations are based on the total POPs content. For high contamination, reuse is there from not allowed (in fill, building materials, bricks, and mounds). A kinetic desorption approach could reassess management of contaminated materials taking into account the labile (rapidly-desorbed) fraction instead of the total POP content...|$|R

50|$|Predecessors {{included}} Friedrich List. The Historical school largely controlled {{appointments to}} Chairs of Economics in German universities, {{as many of}} the advisors of Friedrich Althoff, head of the university department in the Prussian Ministry of Education 1882-1907, had studied under members of the School. Moreover, Prussia was the intellectual powerhouse of Germany and so dominated academia, not only in central Europe, but also in the United States until about 1900, because the American economics profession was led by holders of German Ph.Ds. The Historical school was involved in the Methodenstreit ("strife over method") with the Austrian School, whose orientation was more theoretical and a prioristic. In English speaking countries, the Historical school is perhaps the least known and least understood approach to the study of economics, because it differs radically from the now-dominant Anglo-American <b>analytical</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Yet the Historical school forms the basis—both in theory and in practice—of the social market economy, for many decades the dominant economic paradigm in most countries of continental Europe. The Historical school is also a source of Joseph Schumpeter's dynamic, change-oriented, and innovation-based economics. Although his writings could be critical of the School, Schumpeter's work on the role of innovation and entrepreneurship {{can be seen as a}} continuation of ideas originated by the Historical School, especially the work of von Schmoller and Sombart.|$|E

40|$|Lightning {{events that}} take place between cloud and ground, the so called “cloud-to-ground” discharges, can cause damage when they strike {{directly}} or strike nearby to a structure. For low and medium voltage power distribution networks, indirect lightning events are more frequent than direct strikes, and may cause power outages, disturbances, or failure of electronic and electrical equipment, due to the over-voltages produced. In {{order to reduce the}} effects of lightning flashes, it is necessary to provide suitable protection measures. An accurate evaluation of lightning induced voltages is therefore essential. Recent progress in the area of lightning induced voltages is significant, both from numerical and <b>analytical</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Most <b>of</b> the analytical results proposed so far in literature are approximated and/or incomplete, as will be shown in the thesis. The aim of the work is to present new analytical approaches to the evaluation of lightning induced voltages on overhead power lines, that allow to overcome errors and/or approximations present in the solutions available in the literature. Predictions of the proposed solutions will be also compared to those based on the other approaches found in the literature in order to check their validity and accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{visualization}} of scientific field structures {{is a classic}} of scientometric studies. This paper presents a domain analysis of the library and information science discipline based on author co-citation analysis (ACA) and journal cocitation analysis (JCA). The techniques used for map construction are the self-organizing map (SOM) neural algorithm, Ward’s clustering method and multidimensional scaling (MDS). The {{results of this study}} are compared with similar research developed by Howard White and Katherine McCain [1]. The methodologies used allow us to confirm that the subject domains identified in this paper are, as well, present in our study for the corresponding period. The appearance of studies pertaining to library science reveals the relationship of this realm with information science. Especially significant is the presence of the management on the journal maps. From a methodological standpoint, meanwhile, we would agree with those authors who consider MDS, the SOM and clustering as complementary methods that provide representations of the same reality from different <b>analytical</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Even so, the MDS representation is the one offering greater possibilities for the structural representation of the clusters in a set of variables...|$|R

The author has been trying to investigate the factorial analyses of those abilities and traits required in the main courses of study. 　The {{purpose of the present study}} is to inquite into the factorial structure supposed to exist among various abilities concerned with science courses in the junior high school. Fifteen tests of achievement were sonstructed from four areas of science course, i. e. physics, chemistry, biology. These tests were administered to one hundred and twenty-four pupils of a junior high school. The scores were intercorrelated and the matrix was analysed by means of the group factor analysis. 　The mental abilities expressed in terms of the fifteen variables are so highly intercorrelated that the first basic factor which is conceived as the so-called genetal intellectual factor “g ” occupies the most part to the variance. This factor is located especially high by the tests of explanatory understanding in physics and chemistry. 　Among the four group factors obtained from the residuals of the first common factor, two are statistically and psychologically significant. One represents the ability of problemsolving in physics and chemistry, while the other shows the observational knowledge in the field of biology. This fact seems to admit the difference between “understanding through thinking　” and　“knowledge through observation. ”　Thus, as a whole, this study gives some partial verfications, from factor <b>analytical</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> for the theoretical hypotheses which the auther has proposed about the structure of human abilities in school learnings...|$|R
