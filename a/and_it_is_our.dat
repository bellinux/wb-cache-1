We performed an audit of rectal examination and assessed whether this made any difference to the management of children with acute abdominal pain. We looked at the records of 48 children from 1989 and 49 children from 1985 presenting with abdominal pain. We found that the rate of rectal examination was halved in this time. Diagnostic accuracy was similar in the two groups, and the morbidity rate was the same. These findings call into question the need for routine rectal examination in children with suspected appendicitis...|$|R

2500|$|On August 8, 2013, Lavabit, a Texas-based secure email service {{provider}} reportedly used by Snowden, abruptly {{announced it was}} shutting down operations after nearly 10 years of business. The owner, Ladar Levison, posted a statement online saying he would rather {{go out of business}} than [...] "become complicit in crimes against the American people." [...] He also said that he was barred by law from disclosing what he had experienced over the preceding 6 weeks, and that he was appealing the case in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Multiple sources speculated that the timing of the statement suggested that Lavabit had been targeted by the US government in its pursuit of information about Snowden. The following day, a similar email service, Silent Circle, preemptively shut down in order to [...] "prevent spying". Snowden said about the Lavabit closure, [...] "Ladar Levison and his team suspended the operations of their 10-year-old business rather than violate the Constitutional rights of their roughly 400,000 users. The President, Congress, and the Courts have forgotten that the costs of bad policy are always borne by ordinary citizens, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> job to remind them that there are limits to what we will pay."
