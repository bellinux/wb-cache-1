500|$|Armstrong {{acknowledged}} Aldrin's {{completion of}} the post landing checklist with [...] "Engine arm is off", before responding to Duke with the words, [...] "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." [...] Armstrong's unrehearsed change of call sign from [...] "Eagle" [...] to [...] "Tranquility Base" [...] emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: [...] "Roger, Twan— Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot." ...|$|E

Van pulls up, <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> come out with a table, crates of records. They unscrew the base of the light pole, take their equipment, attach it to that, get the electricity – Boom! We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E

500|$|The {{landing on}} the surface of the Moon {{occurred}} several seconds after 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969, at which time one of three -long probes attached to three of the Lunar Module's four legs made contact with the surface, a panel light inside the LM lit up, and Aldrin called out, [...] "Contact light." [...] Armstrong shut the engine off and said, [...] "shutdown." [...] As the LM settled onto the surface, Aldrin said, [...] "Okay. Engine stop", then they both called out some post-landing checklist items. After a ten-second pause, Duke acknowledged the landing with, [...] "We copy you down, Eagle." [...] Armstrong announced the landing to Mission Control and the world with the words, [...] "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." [...] Aldrin and Armstrong celebrated with a brisk handshake and pat on the back before quickly returning to the checklist of tasks needed to ready the lunar module for liftoff from the Moon should an emergency unfold during the first moments on the lunar surface. After Armstrong had confirmed touch-down, Duke re-acknowledged, and expressed the flight controllers' anxiety: [...] "Roger,Twang -- Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> about to turn blue - we're breathing again - thanks a lot!" [...] During the landing, Armstrong's heart rate, at one point, reached 160 beats per minute, according to section 12-1 of the NASA Apollo 11 Mission Report.|$|E
2500|$|On December 17, Prime Minister Harper {{suggested}} that the attacker {{may not have been}} acting alone, but did not elaborate. In an interview on national television, Harper would not confirm he was hidden in a closet during the shootings, but said his first concern was to extricate himself from the location. [...] "All you hear is a whole lot of shooting coming towards you, and you don't know if that's a firefight or whether it's just <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> with automatic weapons wiping everybody out in their path." [...] After the incident, Harper's first call was to his mother to reassure her.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1966, Duke {{was one of}} the 19 {{selected}} for NASA's fifth group of astronauts. In 1969, {{he was a member of}} the astronaut support crew for Apollo 10. He then served as CAPCOM for Apollo 11, the first landing on the Moon, where his distinctive Southern drawl became familiar to audiences around the world. [...] As CAPCOM, he became the voice of a Mission Control nervous by a long landing that almost expended all of the Lunar Module Eagles fuel. [...] Duke's first words to the Apollo 11 crew on the surface of the Moon were flustered, [...] "Roger, Twank... Tranquility, we copy you on the ground.

The comments were described as an allusion to the phrase [...] "White Men Can't Jump", and were labeled as inappropriate by New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell.|$|R
2500|$|McKay's pregame {{concern over}} his team's pass defense proved prophetic, as Seattle Seahawks backup quarterback Steve Myer passed for four touchdowns. Myer {{replaced}} an injured Jim Zorn, and threw two touchdowns to Steve Largent, one to Duke Fergerson, {{and one to}} Sherman Smith. The Seahawks still needed two late interceptions to seal the victory, as the Buccaneers’ offense achieved their highest point total to date. Gary Huff completed 18 of 32 pass attempts for 217 yards, but was intercepted four times. His audible to beat a Seattle blitz resulted in a 67-yard touchdown pass to Morris Owens, and Anthony Davis had a 1-yard touchdown run. Owens gained 166 yards, a Buccaneers single-game record that stood for four years. Allan Leavitt contributed three field goals. McKay blamed the defensive letdown to the team's tendency to stop playing pass coverage when the quarterback would roll out, {{and said that they}} tackled [...] "like <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> from a junior high school team".|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Thierry Nguyen {{scored the}} PC version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "well-meaning but {{ultimately}} flawed." [...] He too disliked Billy's levels, especially the platforming sections. He concluded [...] "Call of Juarez {{is a game}} we wanted to like, as it has most of the requisite elements that we {{look for in a}} Western. It's just that the really sloppy platforming and box-moving, which take up a good chunk of the game, puts a big damper on any joy that we might find in shooting up bandits and cowboys." [...] Sterling McGarvey also scored the Xbox 360 version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "yet another Tex-Mex shooter that seems to have been made by <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> who've watched a few too many Westerns but haven't figured out how to get the ambience and authenticity of the historical period down." [...] He praised the shooting mechanics, but concluded [...] "For the most part, Call of Juarez has taken two core ideas and melded them into a game. [...] There will be inevitable comparisons to Neversoft's GUN, but CoJ feels much more a next-gen version of the lackluster Dead Man's Hand than anything else." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{business}} had so increased that Mr. Mortimer R. Guilfogle, the manager, had told Rabin, the head traveling-salesman, {{that he was}} going to appoint an assistant manager. Should he, Mr. Wrenn queried, try to get the position?

2500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{compared}} it to changing the title of The Little Mermaid to Beached.

5000|$|Girls' {{games and}} toys, {{as opposed to}} boys' games and toys, are a large yet {{difficult}} market for the children's toy industry.
