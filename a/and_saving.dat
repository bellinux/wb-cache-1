Although performing better than ever, the Alpha tracks could not compete with K-25 and the new K-27, which had commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, thereby cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> $2million a month.|$|E

Although there exists an extensive literature on financial sector development <b>and</b> <b>savings</b> levels in developing countries, there {{does not seem to}} exist satisfactory work on the above nexus for sub-Saharan African countries, particularly Zambia.

5|$|Biggs and Wedge, {{inspired}} by two Star Wars {{characters of the}} same name, appear in numerous titles as minor characters, sometimes as comic relief. The later titles in the series feature several males with effeminate characteristics. Recurring creatures include Chocobos and Moogles.

Moogles, on the other hand, are white, stout creatures resembling teddy bears with wings and a single antenna. They serve different capacities in games including mail delivery, weaponsmiths, party members, <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> the game. Chocobo and Moogle appearances are often accompanied by specific musical themes that have been arranged differently for separate titles.|$|E

5|$|Abel, Nephilim, KOS-MOS {{and chaos}} choose {{to stay on}} Michtam, drawing all Gnosis to them and using a {{dimensional}} shift to move that region of space to Lost Jerusalem. Their actions {{and the release of}} chaos's Anima energyâ€”which is accelerating the universe's deathâ€”will delay the universe's destruction, giving Shion time to find Lost Jerusalem and discover the key to changing humanity's will <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> the universe. During the escape, Jin sacrifices himself to save Shion. The resultant explosion of energy from the dimensional shift destroys the U.M.N., rendering faster-than-light travel impossible. Shion goes with Jr. and Allen on the Elsa to find Lost Jerusalem, while MOMO stays behind with Ziggy to reconstruct a new travel network with Scientia's help. In the mid and post-credit scenes, a badly-damaged KOS-MOS floats through space and is contacted by chaos, saying they will both awake when they are needed. KOS-MOS is last seen drifting towards Lost Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A shortcoming {{of this approach is}} the engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E
5|$|Charitable trusts in English law are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} {{dedicated}} to charitable goals.

Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education, the advancement of health <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|E
