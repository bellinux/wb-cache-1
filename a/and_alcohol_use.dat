The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use.</b> Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.

5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

Based on social cognitive theory, alcohol-related cognitions such as <b>alcohol</b> refusal self-efficacy <b>and</b> alcohol-related expectancies were hypothesised to mediate this link. Design : A cross-sectional survey included 1349 mothers and their sixth grade (11 - 12 years old) adolescent offspring. Structural equation modelling was employed to test the association between alcohol-specific parenting <b>and</b> adolescent <b>alcohol</b> <b>use,</b> mediated by adolescent alcohol-related cognitions. Main outcome measures : Adolescent <b>alcohol</b> <b>use,</b> drinking refusal self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> expectancies. Results : The associations between frequency of communication, maternal <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescent <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> were mediated by negative alcohol-related expectancies. The associations between quality of communication, rules and disclosure <b>and</b> adolescent <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> were mediated by self-efficacy.

40|$|Aims: Accumulating {{evidence}} for {{the influence of the}} gut microbiota on the bidirectional communication along the gut-brain axis suggests a role of the gut microbiota in eating disorders (EDs) <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> substance <b>use</b> disorders. The potential influence of altered gut microbiota (dysbiosis) on behaviors associated with such disorders may have implications for developing therapeutic interventions. Methods: A systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the gut microbiota, EDs <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> substance <b>use</b> disorders was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science databases with the objective being to examine the role of the gut microbiota in behavioral correlates of these disorders. Original papers focused on the gut microbiota and potential behavioral implications were deemed eligible for consideration. Results: The resulting 12 publications were limited to gut microbiota studies related to EDs <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> substance <b>use</b> disorders. Some studies suggest that dysbiosis and gut microbial byproducts may influence the pathophysiology of EDs via direct and indirect interference with peptide hormone signaling. Additionally, dysbiosis was shown to be correlated with <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> disorder-related symptoms, i. e. craving, depression and anxiety. Finally, a mouse study suggests that manipulations in the gut microbiota may affect cocaine-related behaviors. Conclusions: Promising, albeit preliminary, findings suggest a potential role of the gut microbiota in behavioral correlates of EDs <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> substance <b>use</b> disorders. Short summary: Preliminary evidence exists supporting the role of the gut microbiota in eating disorders <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> substance <b>use</b> disorders, although additional investigation is needed to determine what is causative versus epiphenomenological...|$|R

40|$|Characterizing {{the effects}} of <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> {{marijuana}} <b>use</b> on adolescent brain development is important for understanding potential alterations in neurodevelopment. Several cross sectional studies have identified group differences in white matter integrity after initiation of heavy <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> marijuana <b>use,</b> however none have explored white matter trajectories in adolescents pre- and post initiation of use, particularly for marijuana users. This study followed 16 adolescents with minimal <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> marijuana <b>use</b> at ages 16 – 18 over three years. At follow-up, teens were 19 – 22 years old; {{half of the participants}} initiated heavy <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> half initiated heavy <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> marijuana <b>use.</b> Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed 20 clusters in association and projection fibers tracts (p < 0. 01) in which a group by time interaction was found. Most consistently, white matter integrity (i. e., fractional anisotropy) decreased for those who initiated both heavy <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> marijuana <b>use</b> over the follow-up interval.
