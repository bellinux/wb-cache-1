40|$|An unusual {{combination}} of disconnective syndromes is reported: transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia,</b> left arm apraxia and optic ataxia. Neuropathological examination showed a left parieto-occipital and a subcortical frontal infarct and a lesion of the dorsal {{part of the}} posterior two-fifths of the callosum. The frontal lesion caused the transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia</b> and produced the left arm apraxia. Visuomotor incoordination in the right hemispace {{was due to the}} left parieto-occipital infarct, while the crossed optic ataxia in the left hemispace was attributed to the callosal lesion. It is proposed that the pathway that serves crossed visual reaching passes through the dorsal part of the posterior callosum.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} {{clinical}} spectrum of an acute severe encephalopathy occurring in 2 patients after recovery from falciparum malaria infection and {{to compare it}} with the reported clinical features of the postmalaria neurological syndrome. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Two patients presented with acute onset of fluctuating <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia,</b> severe generalized myoclonus, and postural tremor. Additional signs were cerebellar ataxia, and in 1 patient, generalized epileptic seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed patchy white matter lesions in 1 patient. Clinically, the patients' conditions continued to worsen until corticosteroids were introduced, the use of which induced a rapid, albeit incomplete, recovery. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new, severe variant of the still poorly defined postmalaria neurological syndrome. We propose a preliminary classification of this syndrome, according to its clinical characteristics, as follows: a mild or localized form, characterized by isolated cerebellar ataxia or postural tremor; a diffuse, but relatively mild encephalopathic form, characterized by acute confusion or epileptic seizures; and a severe, corticosteroid-responsive encephalopathy that is characterized by <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia,</b> generalized myoclonus, postural tremor, and cerebellar ataxia...|$|R

5000|$|Mixed {{transcortical aphasia}} {{is the least}} common of the three transcortical <b>aphasias</b> (behind transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia</b> and transcortical sensory aphasia, respectively). This type of aphasia can also be {{referred}} to as [...] "Isolation Aphasia". This type of aphasia is a result of damage that isolates the language areas (Broca’s, Wernicke’s, and the arcuate fasciculus) from other brain regions. Broca’s, Wernicke’s, and the arcuate fasiculus are left intact; however, they are isolated from other brain regions.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of a 52 -year-old right-handed Thai patient with clinical and pathoanatomic evidence of major infarction in the left frontal lobe. He was studied at 4 &frac 12; years poststroke with a Thai adaptation of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Exam and supplementary tests. His language characteristics included nonfluent spontaneous speech, good repetition and near-normal auditory language comprehension, similar to the syndrome called "transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia.</b> " The underlying mechanism of this particular language disturbance is reviewed. It is suggested that this patient’s case profile matches one of Gold-stein’s (1948) two types of transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Dichotomous classifications of clinical varieties of aphasia, which divide cases into motor and sensory, expressive and receptive, anterior and posterior, or fluent and non-fluent, are inadequate. These dichotomies fail to account for aphasia syndromes that cannot be described by one or the other or both of the two components. The classifica-tion system in use at the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital Aphasia Research Unit, however, does distinguish several distinct aphasia syndromes within the fluent-nonfluent dichotomy (Benson and Geschwind, 1971). Under the heading of nonfluent aphasia, four distinct aphasia syndromes are listed...|$|R
50|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia</b> are typically recognized first by a neurologist after a stroke or a type of brain injury. If TMoA is suspected, the neurologist will refer the individual to a speech-language pathologist (SLP) to complete a comprehensive evaluation of the patient. A comprehensive evaluation most often includes the use of standardized and/or nonstandardized tests to evaluate the individual's overall communication and language skills. These tests will look for the patient's ability to speak, listen, read, write, understand and use their language, as well as the ability to swallow. During the evaluation, the SLP will determine the individual's strengths and deficits in communication and the impact of the deficits on the person's quality of life. This comprehensive evaluation will help professionals to determine the proper diagnosis for the individual. The key characteristic for the diagnosis of TMoA is the patient's ability to repeat. The ability to easily repeat speech is a leading factor when differentiating TMoA from other diagnoses of aphasia. Likely, when an individual's repetition is spared after a stroke or brain injury, a professional will diagnose the patient with transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia.</b>|$|R

These schemes also identify several further aphasia subtypes, including: anomic aphasia, which {{is characterized by a}} selective difficulty finding the names for things; and global aphasia, where both expression and comprehension of speech are severely compromised.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Great {{emphasis}} {{has been}} placed on the right hemisphere, due to its possible selective contribution, in the processing of metaphorical statements. Objectives: To describe the processing of metaphors {{in the case of a}} patient with transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia,</b> using specific tests for patients with encephalic injuries of the right hemisphere, and to contribute to the discussion on the inter-hemispheric relationships associated with this function. Methods: A 54 year-old man with transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia</b> was evaluated three years after a left hemisphere stroke. The tasks of comprehension of metaphors were based on the subtest Metaphor Comprehension Task of the Montreal Evaluation of Communications Scale (MEC). Two metaphor comprehension tests were applied, in 45 -minute sessions with a 48 hour interval between each. Test 1 involved comprehension of the metaphors according to the options offered, and Test 2 the comprehension of metaphors measured by response time and visual field. Results: Although the right hemisphere was not affected by the stroke in this case, difficulties were observed in the processing of metaphors. Conclusions: This study suggests that the left hemisphere participates in the processing of figurative meanings. The adaptability of the brain can also re-accommodate the uninjured areas of the brain, causing the dynamic of the brain to be modified. As a result, deducing cerebral functions based on clinical data can be problematic. The value of this study is that it can contribute to clinical aspects of language rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|This study, {{which covers}} {{language}} development {{in people with}} Ontogenetic Cerebral Dysmetria, aimed to identify educational activities which promote language development in people under such a condition who present <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia.</b> On the one hand, {{it is necessary to}} understand how language difficulties can harm the subject with physical neuromotor disabilities in their emotional, social and intellectual development. On the other hand, it is imperative to unveil alternative paths and special features which promote the development of people under the condition in focus. The analyses presented in this study have as theoretical basis the assumptions of historical-cultural psychology, particularly the understanding that language is an essential tool for intellectual development. In its methodology, the research included, in addition to a theoretical investigation, a case study on the conditions of language and development of an adult woman with ontogenetic cerebral dysmetria, a condition known as cerebral palsy, spastic quadriplegia and lack of speech. The case study intended to determine the impact of a stimulation program of expressive language, with augmentative and alternative high technology communication resources which were systematized {{to meet the needs of}} the research subject. The Augmentative and Alternative Communication resources are seen as an effective way to minimize the difficulties experienced by individuals with <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia.</b> As a result of the proposed interventions, it was possible to identify a more autonomous behavior of the subject in question regarding the use of written language, which is the communication channel used by her.

A term newborn male weighing 3380 g at birth suffered myoclonic seizures within 24 hours of birth by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Apgar scores were 3 and 4 at 1 and 5 minutes. Myoclonus persisted for 9 days, responding poorly to step-up anticonvulsant treatment including lidocaine, midazolam, and clonazepam. Imaging documented arterial ischaemic stroke within the left posterior cerebral and both superior cerebellar arteries, compatible with top of the basilar artery stroke. There was no electrographic correlate for the seizures. Disturbed oscillation within the dentato-rubro-olivary circuitry was the likely mechanism.
