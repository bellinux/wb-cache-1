25|$|When certain {{compounds}} are illuminated {{with high}} energy light, they emit {{light of a}} lower frequency. This effect is known as fluorescence. Often specimens show their characteristic <b>autofluorescence</b> image, based on their chemical makeup.|$|E
25|$|Another pair {{of papers}} {{suggest that the}} natural {{fluorescence}} (<b>autofluorescence)</b> of tissues may be harnessed to track glucose concentrations. These studies {{took advantage of the}} fact that NAD(P)H, in its reduced form, is autofluorescent, and that metabolites such as glucose cause a predictable increase in NAD(P)H reduction.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence in {{the life}} {{sciences}} is used generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysis of biological molecules {{by means of the}} fluorescent emission at a specific frequency where there is no background from the excitation light, as relatively few cellular components are naturally fluorescent (called intrinsic or <b>autofluorescence).</b>|$|E
25|$|Intravascular {{fluorescence}} is a catheter-based {{medical imaging}} technique that uses fluorescence to detect high-risk features of atherosclerosis and unhealed vascular stent devices. Plaque <b>autofluorescence</b> {{has been used in}} a first-in-man study in coronary arteries in combination with optical coherence tomography. Molecular agents has been also used to detect specific features, such as stent fibrin accumulation and enzymatic activity related to artery inflammation.|$|E
25|$|After {{sufficient}} {{time for the}} fusion proteins and their linked fluorescent fragments to interact and fluoresce, the cells can be observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope that can visualise fluorescence in cells. Although the fluorescence intensity of BiFC complexes is usually <10% of that produced by expression of intact fluorescent proteins, the extremely low <b>autofluorescence</b> in the visible range extremely most cells often makes the BiFC signal orders of magnitude higher than background fluorescence.|$|E
25|$|Untransformed cells {{should be}} easy to detect and remove to avoid chimeras. Because it’s {{extremely}} important to maintain the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations. Reporter genes such as GUS and Green Fluorescent Protein(GFP) are utilized in combination with plant selective markers (herbicide, antibody etc.) However, GUS expression depends on the plant development stage and GFP {{may be influenced by}} the green tissue <b>autofluorescence.</b> Quantitative PCR could be an alternative method for chimera detection.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, {{several studies}} with NIR dyes have been done, Prof. Pickup with Dr David Birch made a NIR [...] sensor {{measuring}} both the time-resolved counts or by nanotomography of allophycocyanin-ConA/malachite green-Dextran, where allophycocyanin is a NIR fluorescent protein. In an other study, the <b>autofluorescence</b> of NAPH, an energy carrier in cells was assessed as an indirect indicator.|$|E
2500|$|Another FCS based {{approach}} to studying molecular interactions uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) instead of fluorescence, and is called FRET-FCS. [...] With FRET, {{there are two}} types of probes, as with FCCS; however, there is only one channel and light is only detected when the two probes are very closeclose enough to ensure an interaction. [...] The FRET signal is weaker than with fluorescence, but has the advantage that there is only signal during a reaction (aside from <b>autofluorescence).</b>|$|E

50|$|For example, {{cellular}} <b>autofluorescence</b> {{can be used}} as {{an indicator}} of cytotoxicity without the need to add fluorescent markers.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{proteins}} containing {{an increased}} {{amount of the}} amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine show some degree of <b>autofluorescence.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a few cases, <b>autofluorescence</b> may {{actually}} illuminate {{the structures of}} interest, or serve as a useful diagnostic indicator.|$|E

50|$|Like {{other species}} in the genus Lucihormetica, L. luckaes back {{carapace}} features one small and two large spots that glow when exposed to light (<b>autofluorescence),</b> perhaps to mimic {{the appearance of the}} toxic click beetle (Pyrophorus) that emits light at the same wavelength, in which case this would be an instance of Batesian mimicry. The evidence for genuine bioluminescence in Lucihormetica cockroaches is anecdotal and inconclusive, though there is evidence for <b>autofluorescence.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Autofluorescence</b> can be {{problematic}} in fluorescence microscopy. Light-emitting stains (such as fluorescently labelled antibodies) {{are applied to}} samples to enable vizualisation of specific structures.|$|E
50|$|However, {{photobleaching}} {{may also}} be used prior to applying the (primarily antibody-linked) fluorescent molecules, {{in an attempt to}} quench <b>autofluorescence.</b> This can help to improve signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
50|$|The <b>autofluorescence</b> {{of human}} skin {{can be used}} to measure the level of {{advanced}} glycation end-products (AGEs), which are present in higher quantities during several human diseases.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} observed autofluorescencing molecules are NADPH and flavins; the extracellular matrix can {{also contribute to}} <b>autofluorescence</b> because of the intrinsic properties of collagen and elastin.|$|E
50|$|A filter {{is placed}} in the camera so only the fluorescent, yellow-green light (530 nm) is recorded. The camera may however pick up signals from pseudofluorescence or <b>autofluorescence.</b> In pseudofluorescence, non-fluorescent light is imaged. This occurs when blue light {{reflected}} from the retina passes through the filter. This is generally a problem with older filters, and annual replacement of these filters is recommended. In <b>autofluorescence,</b> fluorescence from the eye occurs without injection of the dye. This may be seen with optic nerve head drusen, astrocytic hamartoma, or calcific scarring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autofluorescence</b> {{interferes with}} {{detection}} of specific fluorescent signals, {{especially when the}} signals of interest are very dim — it causes structures other than those of interest to become visible.|$|E

50|$|In {{patients}} at risk {{or those with}} unclear presentation, optical coherence tomography (loss of IS/OS junctions), fundus <b>autofluorescence</b> (focal hyper or hypoautofluorescence), and multifocal electroretinography (paracentral depressions) may be obtained.|$|E

50|$|In {{immunohistochemical}} techniques, {{there are}} several steps prior to the final staining of the tissue antigen, which can cause a variety of problems including strong background staining, weak target antigen staining, and <b>autofluorescence.</b> Endogenous biotin or reporter enzymes or primary/secondary antibody cross-reactivity are common causes of strong background staining, while weak staining {{may be caused by}} poor enzyme activity or primary antibody potency. Furthermore, <b>autofluorescence</b> {{may be due to the}} nature of the tissue or the fixation method. These aspects of IHC tissue prep and antibody staining must be systematically addressed to identify and overcome staining issues.|$|E
5000|$|Fluorescence imaging {{works on}} the basis of fluorochromes inside the subject that are excited by an {{external}} light source, and which emit light of a different wavelength in response. Traditional fluorochromes include GFP, RFP, and their many mutants. However significant challenges emerge in vivo due to the <b>autofluorescence</b> of tissue at wavelengths below 700 nm. This has led to a transition to near-infrared dyes and infrared fluorescent proteins (700 nm-800 nm) which have demonstrated much more feasibility for in vivo imaging due to the much lower <b>autofluorescence</b> of tissue and deeper tissue penetration at these wavelengths.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autofluorescence</b> is {{the natural}} {{emission}} of light by biological structures such as mitochondria and lysosomes when they have absorbed light, and is used to distinguish the light originating from artificially added fluorescent markers (fluorophores).|$|E
50|$|When certain {{compounds}} are illuminated {{with high}} energy light, they emit {{light of a}} lower frequency. This effect is known as fluorescence. Often specimens show their characteristic <b>autofluorescence</b> image, based on their chemical makeup.|$|E
5000|$|In some microscopes (mainly {{confocal}} microscopes), it {{is possible}} to make use of different lifetime of the excited states of the added fluorescent markers and the endogenous molecules to exclude most of the <b>autofluorescence.</b>|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of MacTel type 2 may be {{aided by}} the use of {{advanced}} imaging techniques such as fluorescein angiography, fundus <b>autofluorescence,</b> and OCT. These can help to identify the abnormal vessels, pigment plaques, retinal crystals, foveal atrophy and intraretinal cavities associated with this disorder.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} {{fluorescence}} techniques, {{a significant problem}} with immunofluorescence is photobleaching. Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing or limiting the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., Alexa Fluors, Seta Fluors, or DyLight Fluors). Some problems that may arise from this technique include <b>autofluorescence,</b> extraneous undesired specific fluorescence, and nonspecific fluorescence. <b>Autofluorescence</b> includes fluorescence emitted from the sample tissue or cell itself. Extraneous undesired specific fluorescence occurs when a targeted antigen is impure and contains antigenic contaminants. Nonspecific fluorescence involves {{the loss of a}} probe's specificity due to fluorophore, from improper fixation, or from a dried out specimen.|$|E
