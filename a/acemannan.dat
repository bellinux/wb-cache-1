40|$|Aloe barbadensis Miller (Aloe vera) has a Crassulaceae acid {{metabolism}} which grants {{the plant}} great tolerance to water restrictions. Carbohydrates such as <b>acemannans</b> and fructans {{are among the}} molecules responsible for tolerating water deficit in other plant species. Nevertheless, fructans, which are prebiotic compounds, have not been described nor studied in Aloe vera, whose leaf gel is known to possess beneficial pharmaceutical, nutritional and cosmetic properties. As Aloe vera is frequently cultivated in semi-arid conditions, like those found in northern Chile, we investigated the effect of water deficit on fructan composition and structure. For this, plants were subjected to different irrigation regimes of 100 %, 75 %, 50 % and 25 % field capacity (FC). There was {{a significant increase in}} the total sugars, soluble sugars and oligo and polyfructans in plants subjected to water deficit, compared to the control condition (100 % FC) in both leaf tips and bases. The amounts of fructans were also greater in the bases compared to the leaf tips in all water treatments. Fructans also increase in degree of polymerization with increasing water deficit. Glycosidic linkage analyses by GC-MS, led to the conclusion that there are structural differences between the fructans present in the leaves of control plants with respect to plants irrigated with 50 % and 25 % FC. Therefore, in non-stressed plants, the inulin, neo-inulin and neo-levan type of fructans predominate, while in the most stressful conditions for the plant, Aloe vera also synthesizes fructans with a more branched structure, the neofructans. To our knowledge, the synthesis and the protective role of neo-fructans under extreme water deficit has not been previously reported...|$|R

Thus, we examined pulp structure, isolated structural components and determined their carbohydrate compositions along with analyzing a partially purified pulp-based product (<b>Acemannan</b> hydrogel) used to make Carrisyn hydrogel wound dressing. Light and electron microscopy showed that the pulp consisted of large clear mesophyll cells with a diameter as large as 1000 microm. These cells were composed of cell walls and cell membranes along with a very limited number of degenerated cellular organelles. No intact cellular organelles were found in mesophyll cells. Following disruption of pulp by homogenization, three components were isolated by sequential centrifugation. They were thin clear sheets, microparticles and a viscous liquid gel, which corresponded to cell wall, degenerated cellular organelles and liquid content of mesophyll cells based on morphological and chemical analysis. These three components accounted for 16. 2 % (+/- 3. 8), 0. 70 % (+/- 0) and 83. 1 % of the pulp on a dry weight basis. The carbohydrate composition of each component was distinct; liquid gel contained mannan, microparticles contained galactose-rich polysaccharide(s) and cell walls contained an unusually high level of galacturonic acid (34 %, w/w; Gal A). The same three components were also found in <b>Acemannan</b> Hydrogel with mannan as the predominant component.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The skin is {{the largest}} organ of mammals. The loss of skin {{integrity}} may induce important dysfunctions or even death. For superficial wounds, the endogenous healing mechanisms in combination with traditional wound care are sufficient to achieve functional repair. In contrast, in larger wounds, like third and fourth degree burns, chronic wound or deep ulcers {{it is difficult to}} obtain the restitutio ad integrum and fibrosis and/or scar tissue develops 1, 2. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the efficacy of conventional and innovative topic treatments on skin regeneration, induced experimentally in sheep. To achieve this goal different types of investigations (clinical, molecular, histological, immunohistochemical) were performed. METHODS: Six skin lesions (4 x 4 cm) were surgically created on the back of six healthy adult sheep; every single wound was destined, in a randomized way, to one of the following treatments: <b>Acemannan</b> gel, Manuka Honey, hyaluronic acid, Plasma 3 (ionized gas), allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells isolated from peripheral blood (PB-MSCs). The sixth wound was the placebo. Biopsies were collected with a surgical punch (0, 6 x 0, 6 cm) at time T 0, T 15 and T 40 days. Lesions were clinically evaluated considering the presence and color of wound fluid, the state of hydration, the wound surface/surroundings and other parameters. Histological examinations considered crust formation, re-epithelization and epidermal thickness, dermis edema, extension of granulation tissue, acute and chronic inflammation. Immunohistochemistry for evaluation of inflammation, vascularization and cell proliferation was performed using CD 3, CD 20, MHCII, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and KI 67 antibodies. Furthermore, Real time-PCR investigated genes as V ascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ 1), Vimentin (VIM), Collagen 1 α 1 (Col 1 α 1) and hair Keratin (hKER). RESULTS: Clinically, the lesions treated with plasma healed more rapidly respect to other treatments and a reduced bacterial load was observed. At T 7 wounds treated with stem cells and plasma were less macerated than lesions treated with other therapies. At T 15 the wounds treated with hyaluronic acid showed a normal state of hydration while lesions treated with Manuka Honey exhibited a normal hydration from the third week only (<b>Acemannan</b> gel at fourth week). From the second week onwards all wounds did not show presence of fluid and exhibited a dry and clean secondary layer. All lesions, excluded wounds treated with <b>acemannan</b> gel, presented a red (hyaluronic acid and plasma) and dark red (Manuka Honey, PB-MSCs) granulation tissue starting from the first week. Molecular analysis showed a correspondence between clinical and molecular/histologic results. For instance, VEGF mRNA expression confirms angiogenetic events observed at histological level while TGF-β, CD 3 and CD 20 mRNA/protein expression indicated the presence/absence of inflammation in the used treatments. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: Innovative therapies led to surprising results regarding regeneration of mammalian skin. Indeed, on the basis of clinical analysis, wounds treated with plasma and MSC healed more rapidly. Further examinations are ongoing in order to elucidate possible mechanisms explaining these differences. REFERENCES: 1 S. Y. Broeckx, S. Maes, T.

A 6 mm punch biopsy wound heals in 13 days in a 3 month old rat, but takes 21 days to heal in a 2 year old rat. It is our belief that this impairment in healing may be due in part to a macrophage defect present in senescence, and that macrophage activation or supplementation may yield an acceleration in wound closure. This thesis focuses on the ability of <b>Acemannan</b> (ACM), a complex plant carbohydrate and macrophage stimulator, to accelerate wound healing in both young and aged rats. Studies were conducted using both ACM injection, and macrophage supplementation to the wound site. <b>Acemannan</b> injection to the wound site was found to accelerate wound healing in young and old rats. Overall time to complete closure decreased and average Cumulative Wound Area (CWA) exposed over the course of healing in both young and old animals was significantly (u. <O. 05) reduced. There {{was no significant difference between}} young and old ACM-treated wounds, but there was a significant (CC< 0. 05) difference between the CWA seen in old control versus young control wounds. Likewise, a single injection of peritoneal macrophages to the wound site was found to accelerate wound healing in young and old rats. Again, there was no significant difference between the young and old treated wounds, but there was a significant (cc< 0. 05) difference between the CWA seen in old control versus young control wounds. Overall time to complete closure decreased and average CWA exposed over the course of healing in both young and old animals was significantly (cc< 0. 05) reduced. ACM stimulation did not significantly improve the ability of peritoneal macrophages to accelerate wound healing. However, ACM-stimulated killed macrophages were significantly different (cc< 0. 05) from all other treatments, and exhibited decreased wound closure and CWA over that seen in the control wounds. Killed, untreated macrophages were not effective. Additionally, we observed changes in the cytokine MRNA production for TGF-P, TNF-ot, and IL- 6 in young and old macrophages stimulated with ACM. The acceleration seen in these studies strengthens the case of ACM as a wound healing agent, and encourages further studies into the basis of its activity...|$|E
