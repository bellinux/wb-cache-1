5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply.

40|$|Traditionally, {{the most}} common game-theoretic model of the Soviet-US nuclear arms race has been <b>an</b> {{iterated}} Prisoner's <b>Dilemma.</b> According to such a model, on any given trial both superpowers are better off arming {{regardless of what the}} other side chooses, but if both sides arm the outcome is less desirable than had both sides reduced their supply of weapons. Although Soviet and US preferences resembled <b>a</b> Prisoner's <b>Dilemma</b> throughout much of the Cold War, recent evidence suggests that the arms race is now more accurately modeled by a 'Perceptual Dilemma'. In <b>a</b> Perceptual <b>Dilemma,</b> both sides: (1) prefer mutual arms reductions to all other outcomes; (2) want above all to avoid disarming while the other side arms; and (3) perceive the other side as preferring unilateral armamento all other outcomes. This article presents empirical evidence that the nuclear arms race is more appropriately modeled by <b>a</b> Perceptual <b>Dilemma</b> than by <b>a</b> Prisoner's <b>Dilemma,</b> including new survey data in which members of the Australian Parliament and the Israeli Knesset were asked to estimate the preferences of Soviet and US leaders. The paper concludes by reviewing several factors which sustain misperception and by suggesting that <b>a</b> Perceptual <b>Dilemma</b> can be solved with a clear, time-limited series of disarmament initiatives. A great deal in the development of relations between the USSR and the US depends on how each of the sides perceives the world...|$|R
5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved <b>a</b> <b>dilemma.</b> It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to survive to adulthood, Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe's {{management}} announced his signing to Adidas {{for an undisclosed}} six-figure sum, stating that he would race in their new bodysuit. This presented <b>a</b> <b>dilemma,</b> as the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by Speedo, leading to months of protracted discussions and uncertainty. To compound his commercial difficulties, Thorpe had an uncertain end to the sporting year when, in October, he broke a bone in his ankle whilst jogging. However his performance throughout the year was recognised when he was again named as the World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World, and by Swimming Australia as its Swimmer of the Year. In a wider arena, he was named Young Australian of the Year, ABC Sports Star of the Year, and Male Athlete of the Year at the Australian Sports Awards.|$|E
5|$|On the whole, Cecil and Dudley were {{in concord}} about {{policies}} while disagreeing fundamentally about some issues, {{such as the}} Queen's marriage and some areas of foreign policy. Cecil favoured the suit of Francois, Duke of Anjou, in 1578–1581 for Elizabeth's hand, while Leicester was among its strongest opponents, even contemplating exile in letters to Burghley. The Anjou courtship, {{at the end of}} which Leicester and several dozen noblemen and gentlemen escorted the French prince to Antwerp, also touched the question of English intervention in the Netherlands to help the rebellious provinces. This debate stretched over a decade until 1585, with the Earl of Leicester as the foremost interventionist. Burghley was more cautious of military engagement while in <b>a</b> <b>dilemma</b> over his Protestant predilections.|$|E
40|$|In three {{experiments}} {{we examined}} the notion that interpretative thinking guides impression formation when playing <b>a</b> prisoner's <b>dilemma</b> game. In <b>a</b> first experiment, we demonstrated that an interpretation goal is spontaneously triggered upon receiving ambiguous information about an interaction partner {{in the context of}} <b>a</b> prisoner's <b>dilemma</b> game. In Experiment 2, we examined whether in this context accessible knowledge is used as an interpretation frame for judging the interaction partner. Indeed, we found that subliminally primed extreme person exemplars led to an assimilation effect in person judgment in <b>a</b> prisoner's <b>dilemma</b> game, whereas they led to a contrast effect when person judgments were made in a control condition. Finally in experiment 3, priming a comparison goal before entering <b>a</b> prisoner's <b>dilemma</b> game led participants to use subliminally presented extreme exemplars again as a standard of comparison in the judgment of an interaction partner.

5|$|Senator Robert F. Wagner {{proposed}} the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no {{stand on the}} legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) posed <b>a</b> <b>dilemma</b> for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to Henry Ford, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|Soult was in <b>a</b> <b>dilemma.</b> He {{could not}} defend both the {{important}} southwestern port of Bordeaux and Toulouse. He decided {{that trying to}} hold Bordeaux would put the Garonne Estuary at his back {{and that it would}} be difficult to obtain food in that area. Therefore, the French marshal determined to operate to the east in the direction of Toulouse. On 2 March, the Allies clashed with the French at Aire-sur-l'Adour in a combat that cost the French about 250 men killed and wounded, including 12 officers, and 100 captured. Hippolita Da Costa sent his Portuguese brigade to attack a strong position. When it was repulsed with losses of five officers and 100 men, Da Costa failed to rally the soldiers and was replaced in command. British losses were 156 killed and wounded in the 2nd Division. After this action with Hill, Harispe abandoned Aire. Soult withdrew to a position between Maubourguet and Plaisance where his army was left alone for ten days.|$|E
5|$|The {{petitions}} {{and political}} crisis continued to {{the reign of}} Hamad (1923–42) who —encouraged by the British— began it by setting up a criminal court to try {{those involved in the}} violence including his first cousins, the Khalids. The ruler was put in <b>a</b> <b>dilemma</b> between his tribal alignment and public law, and so he exiled his cousins, but paid their expenses. The Khalids, however, held a deep grudge against residents of Sitra who witnessed against them, and in 1924 attacked the island before their exile, killing several Shia men, women and children. The attackers were sentenced to death following major Shia protests and a lengthy second trial, but managed to escape before the sentence was carried out. Their father was confined to Manama. The trials marked the first time in Bahrain's history that members of the ruling family were convicted.|$|E

5|$|The {{unilateral}} French decision led to {{a censure}} debate in the House of Commons. By 1967, when the French decided {{to withdraw from the}} AFVG programme, the Air Ministry was faced with <b>a</b> <b>dilemma</b> stemming from the imminent prospect of cancelling the F-111K, a decision that was taken in November 1967, to be formalized on 20 March 1968. Up to this point, Britain had spent £2.5 on the AFVG for practically no gains. In order to justify the absence of any new strike aircraft following the failure of multiple projects to develop or procure one, Healey decided to entirely dismantle the requirement for one. Thus, in 1968, Prime Minister Harold Wilson, alongside Healey, announced that British troops would be withdrawn in 1971 from major military bases in South East Asia, the Persian Gulf and the Maldives, collectively known as 'East of Suez'.|$|E
5|$|Waddington was {{presented}} with <b>a</b> <b>dilemma</b> as both George Eastham and Peter Dobing retired {{not long after the}} club's League Cup win. Waddington responded by paying £240,000 to Chelsea for the services of Alan Hudson in early 1974. This was followed by Geoff Salmons' arrival from Sheffield United for £160,000, in the same year. Waddington later paid a world record fee for a goalkeeper, £325,000, to sign Peter Shilton from Leicester City. The new personnel brought added impetus to Waddington's side, and Stoke were close to winning the League title in 1974–75, but an end of season slump led to a fifth-place finish, four points off the champions, Derby.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} war, Robert McNamara stated that by spring 1967 {{he and other}} civilians in the {{administration}} had become convinced that both Rolling Thunder and the ground war in South Vietnam were not working. McNamara claimed that he and others within the administration continuously opposed the Joint Chief's recommendations for an increased tempo of bombing and the loosening of target restrictions. The generals found themselves on the horns of <b>a</b> <b>dilemma</b> of their own making. They continuously claimed that the campaign was working, yet they also had to continuously demand greater latitude {{in order to make}} the campaign succeed. The limited goals entailed in American foreign policy and the military's goal of total victory were simply not reconcilable. The great conundrum had then become how to defeat North Vietnam without defeating North Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{the most}} common game-theoretic model of the nuclear arms race has been the Prisoner's Dilemma, in which {{participants}} are bound in conflict by {{the structure of the}} situation. Recent evidence suggests, however, that the nuclear arms race may be better approximated by <b>a</b> "Perceptual <b>Dilemma</b> " arising from discrepant perceptions of various outcome utilities. The present experiment compared the effects of two strategies, a matching strategy (called Status Quo) and a matching strategy preceded by unconditional cooperation (called Disarmament Initiatives), within the context of <b>a</b> Prisoner's <b>Dilemma</b> or <b>a</b> Perceptual <b>Dilemma.</b> Results indicated that: (a) the Status Quo strategy sustained competitive behavior, attitudes, and emotions in both the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Perceptual Dilemma; and (b) the Disarmament Initiatives strategy induced significantly more cooperation among subjects locked in <b>a</b> Perceptual <b>Dilemma</b> than those in <b>a</b> Prisoner's <b>Dilemma.</b> The limitations, extensions, and implications of these findings are discussed in terms of political action and future research. A great deal of past research on experimental gaming has used the iterated Prisoner's <b>Dilemma</b> as <b>a</b> model of the nuclear arms race between the superpowers (see Lindskold, 1978; Pilisuk et aI., 1965; Pilisuk and Skolnick, 1968). Typically, the United States and the Soviet Union are seen as playing a 2 X 2 game, with four possible outcomes...|$|R
5|$|After scoring 12 in a {{total of}} 80 as Australia were caught on a sticky wicket, Fingleton then made 73 in the second innings of the Second Test in Sydney, one of few Australians to resist as the home side fell to an innings defeat after being forced to follow on. Australia were facing <b>a</b> <b>dilemma</b> in the Third Test in Melbourne. The home team scored 200, Fingleton {{contributing}} 38, before rain caused a sticky wicket and England declared at 9/76. However, Australia still had to bat on the treacherous surface, captain Bradman reshuffled the batting lineup, putting the bowlers in first and Fingleton and himself in at Nos. 6 and 7 to save them for more favourable batting conditions. The bowlers managed to survive {{to the end of the}} day's play and the wicket improved overnight. The pair came together with the score at 5/97 and made a Test record sixth-wicket partnership of 346, with Fingleton making 136. It turned the Test and saw Australia ended at 564. The hosts bowled England out for 323 to win the match by 365 runs and prevent England from taking an unassailable 3–0 lead. Fingleton did not pass 20 in his last three innings of the series, as Australia won the remaining two matches to win the series. Fingleton ended with 398 runs at 44.22 in the Tests, and 631 runs at 33.21 overall.|$|E

With {{the police}} arriving, Chuck offers Blair a limo ride, and a homesick Raina breaks up with Nate, {{intending}} {{to return to}} Chicago. Chuck proposes avoiding the Constance party by going to a bar mitzvah {{in a similar fashion}} to Death Takes a Holiday, which Blair accepts. Chuck and Blair have sex while Prince Louis (Hugo Becker) waits for Blair at Constance. While looking for Charlie at the loft, Vanessa spots Dan's novel and reads it. Dan calls her and is upset that she has been reading the novel, which she suggests that he publish despite the possible backlash. Realizing that he no longer cares about writing, Vanessa steals the novel after Dan angrily dismisses her. Serena stops Charlie from jumping off a window and Charlie expresses her envy towards Serena, aspiring to be like her until Serena admits her personal flaws to Charlie, who comforts her. Dan and Nate find Charlie and Serena and return to the party. Charlie makes a suspicious call to her mother and piques Georgina's interest, who gives her her number. Blair finds herself in <b>a</b> <b>dilemma</b> as her feelings for Chuck have resurfaced, arriving at the party to inform Louis of her decision but Chuck interrupts her, informing him that he has their blessing. Blair confronts Chuck for making a decision for her, but the two eventually settle their issues, and he lets her go.|$|E
