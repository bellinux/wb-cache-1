Mamo Wolde, Juma Ikangaa, Tegla Loroupe, Paul Tergat, and Haile Gebrselassie—all {{recipients}} of the New York Road Runners' Abebe Bikila Award—are {{a few of the}} athletes who have followed in his footsteps to establish East <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> force in long-distance running. Abebe participated in a total of sixteen marathons, winning twelve and finishing fifth in the 1963 Boston Marathon.

5|$|In 1941 the British Admiralty started {{receiving}} {{reports that}} German submarines {{were using the}} rivers in Vichy French parts of <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base for refuelling. The unit selected to investigate the reports was the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF) also known as No. 62 Commando. The SSRF was formed in 1941, and consisted {{of a small group}} of 55 commando-trained personnel working with the Special Operations Executive (SOE). While being under operational control of Combined Operations Headquarters, No. 62 Commando itself was under the command Major Gustavus Henry March-Phillipps, usually called Gus March-Phillipps.|$|E

5|$|On February10, MFR began {{tracking}} {{a tropical}} disturbance in the Mozambique channel near Juan de Nova Island. The system tracked generally south-southwestward, gradually intensifying. Given the name Imboa, the storm reached peak winds of 95km/h (60mph) on February13 while passing near Europa Island. After executing a small loop, Imboa {{turned toward the}} southeastern African coastline and approached the eastern coasts of Mozambique and South <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weakened system.

5|$|Women's {{football}} in <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental gender inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses.

5|$|As Italy {{entered the}} war at the {{conclusion}} of the Battle of France, their Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini looked to <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> possible location for easy propaganda victories to justify his joining the conflict and to glorify Italy's hitherto speculative role it. The British Somaliland colony, a weakly defended area located in modern Somalia, looked to the dictator easy prey. Despite Italy being logistically unready for a conflict in that region, an attack on Somaliland was authorized, set for late 1940. Italian forces in East Africa were relatively strong in numbers, if not in quality, with 29 colonial brigades, each consisting of several infantry battalions and some light artillery, concentrated around the recently conquered Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. The Italians also possessed at least 60 medium and light tanks and 183 aircraft, both fighters and medium/light bombers.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Mitch's {{meteorological}} history {{began with}} its origins over <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical wave and lasted until its dissipation as an extratropical cyclone {{north of the}} United Kingdom. Tropical Depression Thirteen formed on October22, 1998, over the southwestern Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave that exited Africa on October10. It executed a small loop, and while doing so intensified into Tropical Storm Mitch. A weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north. After becoming disorganized due to wind shear from a nearby upper-level low, Mitch quickly intensified in response to improving conditions which included warm waters and good outflow. It became a hurricane on October24 and developed an eye. After turning to the west, Mitch rapidly intensified, first into a major hurricane on October25 and then into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day.|$|E

Although he did not serve in any significant actions Lipsett performed his duties well, in 1901 was promoted to captain and on his return to England in 1903 was recommended to the Staff College, Camberley. In 1905 he returned to South <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> staff officer (Deputy-Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster-General), {{to aid in the}} reconstitution of colonial government, a task he performed until 1907, when he was posted back to his regiment.

5|$|The {{southern}} African {{territory of}} Rhodesia, officially Southern Rhodesia, {{was a unique}} case in the British Empire and Commonwealth—though a colony in name, it was internally self-governing and constitutionally not unlike a dominion. This situation dated back to 1923, when it was granted responsible government within the Empire as a self-governing colony, following three decades of administration and development by the British South Africa Company. Britain had intended Southern Rhodesia's integration into the Union of South <b>Africa</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new province, but this having been rejected by registered voters in the 1922 government referendum, the territory was moulded into a prospective dominion instead. It was empowered to run its own affairs in almost all respects, including defence.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, Kenyatta befriended an Afro-Caribbean Marxist, George Padmore, who {{was working}} for the Soviet-run Comintern. Over time, he became Padmore's protégé. In late 1932, he joined Padmore in Germany. Before the end of the year, the duo {{relocated}} to Moscow, where Kenyatta was instructed in becoming a professional revolutionary at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. There, he was among those students who complained about the food, accommodation, and poor quality of English instruction. During his time in the Soviet Union, Kenyatta also visited Siberia, probably as part of an official guided tour. The emergence of the Nazi administration in Germany shifted political allegiances in Europe, as the Soviet Union sought to establish formal alliances with France and Czechoslovakia, thereby reducing its support for the movement against British and French colonial rule in <b>Africa.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, Comintern disbanded the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers, to which both Padmore and Kenyatta were affiliated. Padmore resigned from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in protest, and was subsequently vilified in the Soviet press. Both Padmore and Kenyatta left the Soviet Union, with the latter returning to London in August 1933.|$|E
5|$|Penelope was {{completed}} at Devonport Dockyard on 27 June 1868 {{for the cost}} of £196,789 and served in the Channel Fleet until June 1869. She was then guard ship at Harwich until 1882, which included summer cruises in company {{with the rest of the}} reserve fleet. She was part of the Particular Service Squadron mobilised during the Russian war scare of June–August 1878. In 1882, she was at Gibraltar on the summer cruise when the Anglo-Egyptian War began and her shallow draught caused her to be sent to Egypt. Upon arrival in Alexandria, she assisted with the evacuation of European refugees for several days before the bombardment of the city began on 11 July. Penelope was the ship closest to the Egyptian forts and fired 231 rounds during the battle. The ship was only lightly damaged by Egyptian shells, with eight men wounded, one eight-inch gun damaged and one mainyard needing to be replaced. She became Rear-Admiral Anthony Hoskins's flagship when the British seized the Suez Canal to allow their troop transports to land at Ismailia. Penelope returned home after the war for a further five years service at Harwich. She was paid off in 1887, refitted, and sent to Simonstown, South <b>Africa,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> receiving ship the following year. In January 1897, Penelope was converted to a prison-hulk and then sold for scrap on 12 July 1912 for the price of £1,650. The ship was broken up at Genoa, Italy, in 1914.|$|E
