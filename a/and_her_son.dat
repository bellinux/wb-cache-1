5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the queen <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>son</b> to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the queen <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>son</b> to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E
