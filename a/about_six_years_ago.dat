'The Literary World' {{speaks of}} him, confidently, {{as a native}} of Presburg (misled, perhaps, by the account in 'The Home Journal') but I am pleased {{in being able to}} state positively, since I have it from his own lips, that he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, {{although}} both his parents, I believe, are of Presburg descent. The family is connected, in some way, with Maelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, he is short and stout, with large, fat, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers, a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose. There is some defect in one of his feet. His address is frank, and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie. Altogether, he looks, speaks, and acts as little like 'a misanthrope' as any man I ever saw. We were fellow-sojouners for a week <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> at Earl's Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island; and I presume that I conversed with him, at various times, for some three or four hours altogether. His principal topics were those of the day, and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments. He left the hotel before me, intending to go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it was there that he was first suspected of having made it. This is about all that I personally know of the now immortal Von Kempelen; but I have thought that even these few details would have interest for the public.|$|E
60|$|We see {{in these}} three sections, and in several others not given, that the old {{pavements}} have sunk or sagged considerably. Mr. Joyce formerly attributed this sinking solely to the slow settling of the ground. That {{there has been some}} settling is highly probable, and it may be seen in Fig. 15 that the pavement for a width of 5 feet over the southern enlargement of the room, which must have been built on fresh ground, has sunk a little more than on the old northern side. But this sinking may possibly have had no connection with the enlargement of the room; for in Fig. 13 one half of the pavement has subsided more than the other half without any assignable cause. In a bricked passage to Mr. Joyce's own house, laid down only <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> the same kind of sinking has occurred as in the ancient buildings. Nevertheless it does not appear probable that the whole amount of sinking can be thus accounted for. The Roman builders excavated the ground to an unusual depth for the foundations of their walls, which were thick and solid; it is therefore hardly credible that they should have been careless about the solidity of the bed on which their tesselated and often ornamented pavements were laid. The sinking must, as it appears to me, be attributed in chief part to the pavement having been undermined by worms, which we know are still at work. Even Mr. Joyce at last admitted that this could not have failed to have produced a considerable effect. Thus also the large quantity of fine mould overlying the pavements can be accounted for, the presence of which would otherwise be inexplicable. My sons noticed that in one room in which the pavement had sagged very little, there was an unusually small amount of overlying mould.|$|E
6000|$|... 4th December, 1854.--About {{dawn the}} caravan was loaded, and then {{proceeded}} along a tolerably level pathway through a thick growth of thorn trees towards a bluff hill. The steep was reached about 9 A.M., and the camels toiled up the ascent by a stony way, dropping their loads {{for want of}} ropes, and stumbling on their road. The summit, about 500 yards distant, was reached in an hour. At Yafir, {{on the crest of}} the mountains, the caravan halted two hours for refreshment. Lieutenant Speke describes the spot in the enthusiastic language of all travellers who have visited the Seaward Range of the Somali Hills. It appears, however, that it is destitute of water. About noon the camels were again loaded, and the caravan proceeded across the mountains by a winding road over level ground for four miles. This point commanded an extensive view of the Southern Plateau. In that direction the mountains drop in steps or terraces, and are almost bare; as in other parts rough and flat topped piles of stones, reminding the traveller of the Tartar Cairns, were observed. I remarked the same in the Northern Somali country; and in both places the people gave a similar account of them, namely, that they are the work of an earlier race, probably the Gallas. Some of them are certainly tombs, for human bones are turned up; in others empty chambers are discovered; and in a few are found earthern and large copper pots. Lieutenant Speke on one occasion saw an excavated mound propped up inside by pieces of timber, and apparently built without inlet. It was opened <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> by a Warsingali, in order to bury his wife, when a bar of metal (afterwards proved by an Arab to be gold) and a gold ring, similar to what is worn by women in the nose, were discovered.

50|$|If {{calendar}} {{is defined}} as grouping of days for conveniently keeping track of prioritized human activities, the proto Eastern Cushitcs had apparently practiced that idea according to the linguistic accounts. The Cushitic terms ‘tiro’ (count, reckon, number) and ‘ammin’ (hour, period), which make up the Somali term for ‘calendar’, are themselves several millennia-old for they came from proto Eastern Cushitic language. Tiro is a cognate word from the modern Eastern Cushitics notably the Macro-Somali, Afar, Oromo, Konso, Gawada, and Gobeze. Similarly, the word ‘ammin’ or ‘amman’ is shared by Macro-Somali, Oromo, Konso and Hadiya.

50|$|The {{geologic}} {{history of}} the Mediterranean Sea is complex.

Because it is a near-landlocked body of water in a normally dry climate, the Mediterranean is subject to intensive evaporation and the precipitation of evaporites.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the moraines, the melting ice sheet produced extensive outwash plains composed of mixed sediments and ice that bordered the bay to the northwest and west.
