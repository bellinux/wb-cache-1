5|$|Restrictive N-terminal truncation: The {{approximately}} 30 {{amino acids}} N-terminal extension of cTnI is an adult heart-specific structure. The N-terminal extension contains the PKA phosphorylation sites Ser23/Ser24 and {{plays a role}} in modulating the overall molecular conformation and function of cTnI. A restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI occurs at low levels in normal hearts of all vertebrate species examined including human and significantly increases in <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> hemodynamic stress and Gsα deficiency-caused failing mouse hearts. Distinct from the harmful C-terminal truncation, the restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI selectively removing the adult heart specific extension forms a regulatory mechanism in cardiac <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> physiological and pathological stress conditions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a system management methodology for building successful resource management systems that possess lifecycle effectiveness. This methodology {{is based on}} an analysis of the traditional practice of Systems Engineering Management as it applies to the development of resource management systems. The analysis produced fifteen significant findings presented as recommended <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> the traditional practice of Systems Engineering Management to accommodate system development when the requirements are incomplete, unquantifiable, ambiguous and dynamic. Ten recommended <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> achieve operational effectiveness when requirements are incomplete, unquantifiable or ambiguous are presented and discussed. Five recommended <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> achieve system extensibility when requirements are dynamic are also presented and discussed. The authors conclude that the recommended <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> the traditional practice of Systems Engineering Management should be implemented for future resource management systems and that the technology exists to build these systems extensibly...|$|R

5|$|An unusual triad {{is found}} in seldolisin proteases. The low pKa of the {{glutamate}} carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH.

5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles.

Females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} by water, {{the result is}} hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.|$|E
40|$|In {{biological}} evolution, <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> one {{environment can}} {{in some cases}} reverse <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> another environment. To study this “reverse evolution” on a genotypic level, we measured the fitness of E. coli strains with each possible combination of five mutations in an antibiotic-resistance gene in two distinct antibiotic environments. While <b>adaptations</b> <b>to</b> one environment generally lower fitness in the other, we find that reverse evolution is rarely possible and falls as the complexity of adaptations increases, suggesting a probabilistic, molecular form of Dollo’s law.

5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
5|$|Gene flow {{involves}} {{the exchange of}} genes between populations and between species. The {{presence or absence of}} gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> the environment.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> {{climate change}} has been {{demonstrated}} in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E

5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E
5|$|In newts and salamanders, {{metamorphosis}} is {{less dramatic}} than in frogs. This {{is because the}} larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land. Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for <b>adaptation</b> <b>to</b> the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.|$|E

5|$|In the book, Lamarck named two {{supposed}} {{laws that}} would enable animal species to acquire characteristics {{under the influence of}} the environment.
