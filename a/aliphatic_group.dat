40|$|The role of <b>aliphatic</b> side <b>groups</b> on the {{formation}} of astronomical unidentified infrared emission (UIE) features is investigated by applying the density functional theory (DFT) {{to a series of}} molecules with mixed aliphatic-aromatic structures. The effects of introducing various <b>aliphatic</b> <b>groups</b> to a fixed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) core (ovalene) are studied. Simulated spectra for each molecule are produced by applying a Drude profile at T= 500 K while the molecule is kept at its electronic ground state. The vibrational normal modes are classified using a semi-quantitative method. This allows us to separate the aromatic and aliphatic vibrations and therefore provide clues to what types of vibrations are responsible for the emissions bands at different wavelengths. We find that many of the UIE bands are not pure aromatic vibrational bands but may represent coupled vibrational modes. The effects of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>groups</b> on {{the formation}} of the 8 μm plateau are qua ntitatively determined.

30|$|The {{hardness}} of composite resins {{is particularly}} {{dependent on the}} filler type and content and it correlates with mechanical properties, such as abrasion resistance or polishability. The Silorane composite exhibited the lowest KHN, {{which is similar to}} previous studies [17, 18]. When analyzed the KHN in the top, Z 100 showed higher KHN values than Supreme. This is possible due to the greater amount of filler particles present in the composite Z 100 (84.5  wt%) in comparison to Supreme (78.5  wt%). The KHN in bottom was lower than in top in the composite Z 100, while in other composites, such as for example Supreme did not happen. Despite the lower number of reacting <b>aliphatic</b> <b>groups</b> in the Supreme (some of the monomers TEGDMA of Z 100 were replaced by UDMA and BisEMA), it still seems that a more efficient reaction occurred in Supreme. The more efficient reaction most likely related to the fewer <b>aliphatic</b> <b>groups</b> which needed to be consumed before a high conversion value was reached. Another possibility could be that there were different photo-initiators used in these two composites (something that could also have affected the reaction). Then in deep regions, the polymerization reaction of Z 100 can be impaired, thus showing reduced properties.|$|R

Mallard Blue and Ethidium Bromide dye displacement assays demonstrate that heparin and DNA have markedly different binding preferences, with heparin binding most effectively to C 18 - 1, and DNA to C 18 - 3, even though the molecular structural differences of these SAMul systems are buried in the hydrophobic core. Multiscale modelling suggests that adaptive heparin maximises enthalpically-favourable interactions with C 18 - 1, while shape-persistent DNA forms a similar number of interactions with each ligand display, but with slightly less entropic cost for binding to C 18 - 3 - fundamental thermodynamic differences in SAMul binding of heparin or DNA.

The structure and behaviour of sol-gel films is dependent on the fabrication parameters. By varying these parameters, different microstructures and consequently different quenching responses to {{dissolved oxygen}} are obtained. In particular, enhancement of the surface hydrophobicity increases the quenching response in water.
