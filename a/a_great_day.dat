5|$|In 1871, {{following}} Prussia's victories, the German {{states were}} united into the German Empire, with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent {{to the new}} German monarchy. Although William thought {{the day when he}} became Emperor the saddest of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>day</b> in German history. Bismarck, now Chancellor, disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess. Often at odds with his father's and Bismarck's policies and actions, Frederick sided with the country's liberals in their opposition to the expansion of the empire's army. The Crown Prince also became involved in many public works projects, such as the establishment of schools and churches in the area of Bornstedt near Potsdam. To assist his father's effort to turn Berlin, the capital city, into a great cultural centre, he was appointed Protector of Public Museums; it was largely due to Frederick that considerable artistic collections were acquired, housed in Berlin's new Kaiser Friedrich Museum (later known as the Bode Museum) after his death. In 1878, when his father was incapacitated by injury from an assassination attempt, Frederick briefly took over his tasks but was soon relegated to the sidelines once again. His lack of influence affected him deeply, even causing him to think about suicide.|$|E

25|$|Some pros {{always had}} {{problems}} with how the ABA decided its number one pros for the year {{going back to the}} 1979 season. The biggest complaint that it was canted to have the points work out so that the number one pro would almost certainly be decided going into the ABA's Grand National in November with the lion's share of the points being doled out then (the points that were earned was {{the amount of money that}} was earned through the year. At that time the ABA AA pro who won the most money was declared No. 1 pro). The pros claimed that this benefited the ABA since it meant an exciting finish to the season, but it was detrimental to the pros in that a season of consistent wins and near wins could be undone by having an off day and/or a normally inconsistent rider having <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>day</b> and capturing the number one plate. Other issues like a bigger pro purse and that the purse be spread out over eight places instead of the top four at ABA Nationals which would ensure anyone making the pro main would get a share of the winnings were also a factor. The claim was while NBL, NBA and independent promotional races' purses have gone up over the years, the ABA's purses had remained relatively stagnant.|$|E
