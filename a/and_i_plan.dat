"When I {{was in high}} school, I {{read and}} loved two {{wonderful}} novels by Megan McCafferty, Sloppy Firsts [...] and [...] Second Helpings, [...] which spoke {{to me in a}} way few other books did. Recently, I was very surprised and upset to learn that there are similarities between some passages in my novel ... and passages in these books ... While the central stories of my book and hers are completely different, I wasn't aware of how much I may have internalized Ms. McCafferty's words. I am a huge fan of her work and can honestly say that any phrasing similarities between her works and mine were completely unintentional and unconscious. My publisher <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>plan</b> to revise my novel for future printings to eliminate any inappropriate similarities ...

[...] In an interview with Roger Ebert in 1969, Hitchcock elaborated further: Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all ... I have a strongly visual mind. I visualise a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score ... When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 percent of your original conception.|$|E

This is called Paga in Hebrew, and it means [...] "to make intercession". When Jesus became our sacrifice ... He made the way for our prayers, praises, worship and intercession to become like that incense unto the Lord, a sweet-smelling savor ... Even with all that I have been through, nothing has changed my relationship with The Lord or the call that He placed on my life at a young age. If anything, I have gained more wisdom through the things (even mistakes) that I have suffered, and am more dependent on Him than ever before. I can testify of God's ultimate faithfulness to His children, and His unwavering commitment to conform us into the likeness of His dear Son, Jesus Christ. <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>plan</b> to keep on singing about it until the very end." ...|$|E
