6000|$|The philosopher's amazement did {{not prevent}} a narrow {{scrutiny}} of the stranger's dress and appearance. The outlines of his figure, exceedingly lean, but much above the common height, were rendered minutely distinct, {{by means of a}} faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin, but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago. These garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their present owner. His ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches. In his shoes, however, a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress. His head was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of <b>a</b> <b>hinder</b> part, from which depended a queue of considerable length. A pair of green spectacles, with side glasses, protected his eyes from the influence of the light, {{and at the same time}} prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color or their conformation. About the entire person there was no evidence of a shirt, but a white cravat, of filthy appearance, was tied with extreme precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by side gave (although I dare say unintentionally) the idea of an ecclesiastic. Indeed, many other points both in his appearance and demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature. Over his left ear, he carried, after the fashion of a modern clerk, an instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients. In a breast-pocket of his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps of steel. This book, whether accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly from the person as to discover the words [...] "Rituel Catholique" [...] in white letters upon the back. His entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine--even cadaverously pale. The forehead was lofty, and deeply furrowed with the ridges of contemplation. The corners of the mouth were drawn down into an expression of the most submissive humility. There was also a clasping of the hands, as he stepped toward our hero--a deep sigh--and altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be unequivocally preposessing. Every shadow of anger faded from the countenance of the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory survey of his visiter's person, he shook him cordially by the hand, and conducted him to a seat.|$|E

5000|$|Similar to {{the classic}} Princess Maker tradition, Yucie was found as an infant by the knight Gunbard after a battle, and became his adopted daughter. Due to an unknown curse, she stopped growing {{at the age of}} ten, and looks like a child {{although}} she is now seventeen. Yucie is very cheerful and gregarious, but she has a very strong desire to break her curse and become an adult. One of the reasons is that she often feels that being small in size is <b>a</b> <b>hinder</b> to others, thus wishing to grow up. Yucie becomes a Platinum Princess candidate after she sees the light of the Eternal Tiara, which is not visible to others. It is also said that she is the princess of the human world, as shown in the last episode. Although {{there is no evidence to}} prove it, her adoptive father, Gunbard, recognizes her as the princess of the collapsed castle during the battle he lastly involved, as he saw Yucie descending on a forest near the ruins. When she met Arc, she got mad at him for calling her huge forehead but falls in love with him later on. She starts to recognize Arc as the prince who saved her when as a child.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the perception of sustainability and sustainability performance within an organization. To understand how to fully integrate sustainability in an organization, I have in this study found that knowing what is needed to link words to practice is key. Even when sustainability values are incorporated in an organization, there can still be a dissonance between what the values state and what the performance shows. With the aid of Practice theory I was able to deepen the understanding of where this dissonance occurs. By rejecting the dualism of perception and performance, I was able to investigate how perception and performance mutually affect sense-making within an organization. I also found that the indefinability of sustainability need not be <b>a</b> <b>hinder,</b> it need not mean the same for all. Instead, for full integration of sustainability, what is important is that sustainability directives are translated into doable actions that are relevant for each practice...|$|E

The integrated chemiluminescence is affected by a number of common stabilisers, particularly tree radical scavengers.

40|$|Abstract: {{we argue}} that for most {{developing}} countries, the critical {{question is not whether}} there is inequality in the course of development, but how to transfer inequality to growth, how to control the degree of inequality, and how to allocate the results of growth. In a developing country with scare capital and poor institutional and economical environment, it is necessary for government to involve some kind of unfair transaction which is in favor of entrepreneurs, in order to absorb the latter and transform financial capital into more capital goods. Namely, the second-best government “one hand is grabbing hand, other hand is helpful hand”. Because such transaction is very difficult, democracy and extreme decentralization would be <b>a</b> <b>hinder</b> of development. On the contrary, to some extent authoritarian and economic centralization is beneficial to growth and development. In authoritarian, decentralization and intergovernmental competition, especially yardstick competition among local governments possibly induces less local governors ’ private benefits, much more productive infrastructures, and much faster growth, while produces much more serious inequality. However, economic decentralization in authoritarian couldn’...|$|E

Combining with Jeffery {{equation}} {{and mechanics}} model of fixed point of Euler rigid body, research {{was done to}} study the mechanism and method of the short fiber radial orientation and characteristics of movement in tread extrusion process.
