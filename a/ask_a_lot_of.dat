2500|$|The best {{alternative}} to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA is the alternative option a negotiator holds should the current negotiation fails and does not reach agreement. [...] The quality of a BATNA {{has the potential to}} improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward. One of the best strategy while going into a negotiation is to ensure that you have a strong BATNA, and if not, have tools equipped that can help you made the other side's BATNA weak. One of the major mistakes made by new negotiators is to disclose their BATNA at first without having had any discussion with the other side. This can jeopardise your position in the negotiation, as your negotiation might have been weaker than the other sides, and such disclosure puts you at a weaker spot in the negotiation. The best strategy is to <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> questions to develop, if not an exact, but a guess about the other sides BATNA to know your position in the negotiation.|$|E
2500|$|Kindred ‘s plot is non linear; rather, {{it begins}} {{in the middle of}} its end and {{contains}} several flashbacks that connect events in the present and past. In an interview, Butler acknowledged that she split the ending into a [...] "Prologue" [...] and an [...] "Epilogue" [...] so as to [...] "involve the reader and make him or her <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> questions" [...] that could not be answered {{until the end of the}} story. Missy Dehn Kubitschek sees this framing of Dana’s adventures as Butler’s way to highlight the significance of slavery to what Americans consider their contemporary identity. Because [...] "Prologue" [...] occurs before Dana travels in time and [...] "Epilogue" [...] concludes with a message on the necessity to confront the past, we experience the story as Dana’s understanding of what we have yet to understand ourselves, while the [...] "Epilogue" [...] speaks about the importance of this understanding. Roslyn Nicole Smith proposes that Butler’s framing of the story places Dana literally and figuratively in media res so as to take her out of that in media res; that is, to indicate Dana’s movement from [...] "a historically fragmented Black woman, who defines herself solely on her contemporary experiences" [...] to [...] "a historically integrated identity" [...] who has knowledge of and a connection to her history.|$|E

60|$|We were {{informed}} by the guide-book that we were now 3,228 feet above {{the level of the}} lake--therefore full two-thirds of our journey had been accomplished. We got away at a quarter past four P.M.; a hundred yards above the hotel the railway divided; one track went straight up the steep hill, the other one turned square off to the right, with a very slight grade. We took the latter, and followed it more than a mile, turned a rocky corner, and came in sight of a handsome new hotel. If we had gone on, we should have arrived at the summit, but Harris preferred to <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> questions--as usual, of a man who didn't know anything--and he told us to go back and follow the other route.
