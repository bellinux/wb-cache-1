Drew <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> go before the city council, but their request is denied. Drew questions how the council can deny something without seeing it <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys,</b> including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their request is then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts out the money and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks {{what they should do}} with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give it to the people that earned it. He then walks off stage and into the audience and starts handing out the extra cash, apologising for them having seen his naked buttocks.|$|E
25|$|Greg Sostrom saw The Crucified {{at a few}} {{shows and}} offered them a {{recording}} contract with his new start-up label, Narrowpath Records. The band accepted the offer and started to record songs at Casbah Studios in Southern California. The 15-track album was titled The Crucified. It was released in compact disc format, which was a new format in the late 1980s. After the album's release, the band started to tour around California, including appearances at the Cornerstone Festival as well as opening for D.R.I., G.B.H., and Pantera. Johnson was fired from the band due to personal differences <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> started {{looking for a new}} bassist. Chaffin responded to an ad in a newspaper posted by Jeff Bellew, citing The Crucified as an influence. Bellew joined the band and drove for four hours from his home in So Cal to Fresno every weekend to practice. Eventually the drive became too costly, and he moved to Fresno to practice with the band.|$|E

So, after we watched the rehearsal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> laughed a lot, I said, 'My only concern is, am I mocking your brilliant show too much?' And they said, 'No, do it more!'

The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, {{the entrance of the}} Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and {{that was part of the}} vocals on one of those songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower. Due to this eclectic mix of recording paraphernalia and idiosyncratic methods of tracking the sounds, Smiley Smile possesses an unusual sound.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive reception from critics. In the Blender magazine {{review of}} the album, critic Andy Greenwald, wrote: [...] "The title track , bursting with buzzing distortion, builds into a satisfying anti-glitz rant." [...] Tom Beajour of Entertainment Weekly reported that the song [...] "crams all of the genre's essential tropes — distorted power chords, abrupt dynamic shifts, and singsong melodies — into {{three and a half}} minutes of radio-friendly fire." [...] Chris Saunders of MusicOMH noted that the song is laden with [...] "memorable hooks, quiet/loud dynamics and emotive lyrics which will no doubt cut through to many a disenchanted youth: 'They gave you the end but not the where to start / not how to build, how to tear it apart.'" [...] Saunders concluded that the song [...] "is as lively and rousing as most of their best tracks." [...] Sputnikmusic wrote: [...] "The adventure is only on the second track [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> of Yellowcard are just getting started. This is by far the best tune on the album." [...] Bart Gottula of The Clarion wrote: [...] "The album's single and title cut, 'Light's and Sounds', follows with an amazing performance by every band member. The song provides a quick, hard-hitting beat that brings back Yellowcard's hybrid punk and emo music that the band explored in its previous single, 'Way Away'." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{scientist}} {{studying the}} Kaiju. Day stated: [...] "Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide {{a little bit}} of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." [...] Trek Buccino portrays Geiszler as a child.|$|E
500|$|IV, Diamond Rio's fourth album, was {{released}} in 1996. It was the [...] "first country release recorded entirely on a digital console"; specifically, a Fairlight console which recorded the album directly to a hard drive. Produced by DuBois, Clute, and the band itself, it was also their first album not to have Powell as a co-producer. According to DuBois, Powell left this role on good terms, as he [...] "saw a need {{to go in a}} certain direction, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> saw a need to go in a different direction." [...] Roe thought that the album benefited from a new label policy that allowed label personnel to respond more quickly to pitches from songwriters, specifically recalling to Billboard that the label's head of artists and repertoire (A) recommended the lead single [...] "Walkin' Away" [...] while co-writer Craig Wiseman (who co-wrote [...] "Bubba Hyde") was still recording its demo, and the band was able to record the song in the same day that the demo was completed. [...] "Walkin' Away" [...] peaked at No.2 on the country charts in early 1996. Three more singles were released from the album: the top 10 hits [...] "That's What I Get for Lovin' You" [...] and [...] "Holdin'" [...] (also written by Wiseman), with the top 20 [...] "It's All in Your Head", co-written by Van Stephenson, in between.
