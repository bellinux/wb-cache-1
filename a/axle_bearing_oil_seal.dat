40|$|AbstractRailway {{wheelsets}} {{consist of}} three main components; the wheel, <b>axle</b> and <b>axle</b> <b>bearing.</b> Faults can develop {{on any of}} the aforementioned components, but the most common are related to wheel and <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> damages. The continuous increase in train operating speeds means that failure of an <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> can lead to very serious derailments, potentially causing human casualties, severe disruption in the operation of the network, damage to the tracks, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the general public. The rail industry has focused on the improvement of maintenance and online condition monitoring of rolling stock to reduce the probability of failure as much as possible. This paper discusses the results of onboard acoustic emission measurements carried out on freight wagons with artificially damaged <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> in Long Marston, UK. Acoustic emission signal envelope analysis has been applied as a means of effective tool to detect and evaluate the damage in the bearings considered in this study. From the results obtained it is safe to conclude that acoustic emission signal envelope analysis has the capability of detecting and evaluating faulty <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> along with their characteristic defect frequencies in the real-world conditions...|$|R

The application is removal of light gases {{from the top of}} a fractionating tower in a refinery coker unit. The justification and reasons for the selection of the coker compressor retrofitted with magnetic bearings are discussed. The technical aspects of design, rotordynamics and operation of the old <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> and <b>seal</b> design to the retrofitted magnetic bearing and gas face seal designs are compared.

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> edges of the piston rod <b>bearing</b> <b>oil</b> cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and <b>oil</b> edge <b>sealing,</b> the <b>oil</b> chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R

40|$|As train {{loads and}} travel speeds have {{increased}} over time, railway <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> have become critical elements which require more efficient non-destructive inspection and fault diagnostics methods. This paper presents a novel and adaptive procedure based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and Hilbert marginal spectrum for multi-fault diagnostics of <b>axle</b> <b>bearings.</b> EEMD overcomes the limitations that often hypothesize about data and computational efforts that restrict {{the application of}} signal processing techniques. The outputs of this adaptive approach are the intrinsic mode functions that are treated with the Hilbert transform {{in order to obtain}} the Hilbert instantaneous frequency spectrum and marginal spectrum. Anyhow, not all the IMFs obtained by the decomposition should be considered into Hilbert marginal spectrum. The IMFs’ confidence index arithmetic proposed in this paper is fully autonomous, overcoming the major limit of selection by user with experience, and allows the development of on-line tools.
