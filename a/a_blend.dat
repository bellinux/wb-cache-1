40|$|The present psycholinguistic study {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of mental spaces and the processes which contribute to <b>a</b> mental space <b>blend</b> in the call centre communicative context between the call centre operator and the customer. Mental space blends are measured quantitatively by means of Correct Information Unit (CIU) and Mean Length of Utterance (MLU). The correlation between CIUs and MLU in <b>a</b> <b>blended</b> space is investigated. The {{results of the study}} indicate that a superior number of CIUs in <b>a</b> <b>blended</b> space mapped into a successful outcome of the communication between the call centre operator and the customer. However, data analysis indicates that a superior number of CIUs did not necessarily entail an inferior number of MLUs. Data analysis suggests that an inferior number of MLUs in the conversation does not contribute to achieving <b>a</b> <b>blended</b> mental space. The results of the study indicate no correlation between MLUs and achieving <b>a</b> <b>blended</b> mental space in a call centre conversation...|$|R
